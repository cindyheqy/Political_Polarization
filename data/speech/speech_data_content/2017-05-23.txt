Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, Americans aren’t asking for much: the ability to put in an honest day’s work and provide for your family’s basic needs; the chance to wake up in the morning without facing a series of impossible choices—food or medication, mortgage or car repair, a bus pass or school supplies. In other words, the basic economic dignity that every single person in this country deserves. The Trump administration claims that their budget is about dignity. Here is what this budget doesn’t understand: dignity can be threatened by something beyond your control, by disability, by job loss, by illness, by accident, by automation, by a government that shames you for needing a little help when you are dealt a tough hand, by the pain of having to send your kid to school knowing that he is not going to have the lunch money that he needs. Countless American families battle these daily heartbreaks and small injustices with their heads held high. For those families, this budget doesn’t see them for their dignity, but views them with disgrace. 
RECOGNIZING OMMEGANG AND ROSCOE BEER COMPANIES The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York (Mr. FASO) for 5 minutes. Mr. FASO. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to congratulate two local businesses, craft breweries, within the 19th Congressional District in New York State. These two local breweries, Brewery Ommegang, located in Cooperstown, New York, and Roscoe Beer Company, located in Sullivan County, New York, tied for first place in the Taste of New York Inaugural Craft Beer Challenge in Manhattan. This competition was held on May 17 and was announced then in New York City. Seventy breweries from across the State participated in the Craft Beer Challenge. Beers were selected by such foodie favorites like Chef Mario Batali and many other notables in the New York food business. New York has clearly established itself, as has the 19th Congressional District, as a craft beer destination. We are especially proud of our local upstate craft breweries, which support our local economy, jobs, farms, and tourism. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to announce and to congratulate these two fine establishments within the 19th Congressional District. 
Mr. FASO. Mr. Speaker, I am also pleased today to congratulate my predecessor in Congress, Congressman Chris Gibson, for his wonderful service to our country and to Congress. Chris will soon be honored by the Columbia County Association in the city of New York as man of the year. I have known Chris for over 30 years, and I am blessed to call him and his family my neighbors in the Village of Kinderhook, where we both live. He was truly a great Congressman and an allaround leader to upstate New York in so many ways. He exemplifies service in its many forms. Chris is a proud patriot. He served 24 years in the United States Army, rising to the rank of colonel. He is a highly decorated veteran who received not only the Bronze Star, but the Purple Heart during his combat deployments. He was deployed seven times, including four combat tours in Iraq. He made great sacrifices, as did his family, and he fought for our freedom. As a United States Congressman, he continued to fight for the citizens of upstate New York. He served three terms in the 19th Congressional District, fulfilling his pledge to selfimposed term limits. His legislative priorities were national security, our veteran community, and combating Lyme disease. He always had his fellow citizens’ best interests at heart. Chris Gibson was also a scholar. He graduated from Siena College in Loudonville, New York, where he earned his ROTC commission. He went on to receive not one, but two master’s degrees, plus a Ph.D. in government from Cornell University. He was an assistant professor for 3 years teaching cadets at West Point at the United States Military Academy. Today he continues his love of teaching at Williams College as a Visiting Professor of Leadership Studies. I am proud to call Chris Gibson my friend and colleague, and it is clear to anyone who knows him that he will be successful in all of his pursuits. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor former Congressman Christopher P. Gibson. I have known Chris for over 30 years, and I am blessed to call him, his wife, Mary Jo, and their three amazing children, my neighbors in the town of Kinderhook. Chris was truly a great Congressman and an allaround leader to Upstate New York. He has exemplified service in many forms. Chris is a proud patriot. He served 24 years in the US Army, rising to the rank of Colonel. A highly decorated veteran, he was deployed seven times, including four combat tours in Iraq. He made great sacrifices, was injured in the line of duty, and fought for our freedom. As a US Representative, he continued to fight diligently for the citizens of Upstate New York. Chris served three terms representing New York’s 19th District, fulfilling his pledge to selfimpose term limits. Among many legislative priorities, Chris acted to protect our national security, veterans, and those who suffer from Lyme Disease. Without question, he has always held his fellow citizens’ best interests at heart. Chris Gibson is also a scholar. He graduated from Siena college, where he achieved his ROTC Commission, and he went on to receive two Masters Degrees and a PhD from Cornell University. At West Point, Chris taught cadets for three years as an Assistant Professor. Today, he continues his love for teaching and sharing his experience in his role as the Visiting Professor of Leadership Studies at Williams College. I am proud to call Chris Gibson my friend and colleague, and it is clear to anyone who knows him that he will be successful in all his pursuits. f 
EXPRESSING GRATITUDE AND APPRECIATION The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. ALGREEN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise to express gratitude and appreciation to the many who have called. I rise to thank people for the kindness that they have shown. I rise to express my most deepest heartfelt appreciation for those who have had the courage to stand up to hatred, to stand up to bigotry. I rise, Mr. Speaker, to say thank you. I want to especially thank those who are in leadership. I especially want to thank two persons: Representative CLYBURN and Representative B ENNIE  THOMPSON . They both called me to express concern and to give me advice as to how to proceed. For those who may not know, some very ugly things have been said, but they are not in any way comparable to the many kind words that have been expressed. So thank you to all on behalf of my staff, many of whom are young people who are having this as their first experience with Congress. Thank you on their behalf. Mr. Speaker, I also want to explain why some of these ugly things are occurring, and the best way to do it, in my opinion, would be to use the words of J. Patrick Kinney. J. Patrick Kinney has written a poem styled ‘‘The Cold Within,’’ and this poem speaks to the extreme cupidity in our world—not stupidity, cupidity. It speaks to the extreme religiosity. It speaks to the extreme prejudice that some have to endure. It speaks to the extreme wealth and the abuse of it. J. Patrick Kinney talks about a cold night, possibly the coldest night ever on the planet Earth. These are his words: 
Six humans trapped by happenstance In bleak and bitter cold. Each one possessed a stick of wood Or so the story is told. Their dying fire in need of logs The first man held his back For of the faces ’round the fire He noticed one was Black. The next man looking ’cross the way Saw one not of his church And he couldn’t bring himself to give The fire his stick of birch. The third one sat in tattered clothes. He gave his coat a hitch. Why should his stick be put to use To warm the idle rich? The rich man just sat back and thought Of the wealth he had in store And how to keep what he had earned From the lazy shiftless poor. The Black man’s face bespoke revenge As the fire passed from his sight. For all he saw in his stick of wood Was a chance to spite the White. The last man of this forlorn group 
Did nought except for gain. Giving only to those who gave Was how he played the game. Their logs held tight in death’s still hands Was proof of human sin. They didn’t die from the cold without They died from the cold within. f 
b1015 STOP GUN VIOLENCE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. CARBAJAL ) for 5 minutes. Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, today I rise because 3 short years ago, the Isla Vista community in my district was rocked by an act of tragic and senseless gun violence. A young man took the lives of 6 UCSB students and injured 14 others. That day families were torn apart by a kind of grief that no one should have to ever experience— the loss of a child. The tragedy in Isla Vista we remember today is once again a reminder of the consequences of inaction by Congress regarding the epidemic of gun violence across our Nation. Far too often there are many red flags of someone intending to do harm, but no one can connect the dots. Today I introduced legislation, with my colleagues Congresswoman ESTY and Congressman BEYER , that will allow families and loved ones who see disturbing warning signs the ability to work with law enforcement and the courts so that they may intervene and better prevent acts of violence. States like California and Connecticut have led the way on important measures to combat gun violence. This bill would encourage other States to adopt these proven preventative measures. The Gun Violence Restraining Order Act would help ensure that family members can go to court to seek a gun violence prevention order to temporarily stop someone who poses a threat to themselves or others from purchasing or possessing a gun. When someone alerts law enforcement and members of their own family that they wish to do harm to themselves or members of the community, as was the case in Isla Vista, it is irresponsible of lawmakers not to give judges and police the ability to intervene. I urge my colleagues to act and pass this commonsense legislation so that not one more family must live through the nightmare that parents experienced in Isla Vista on March 23, 2014. 
SERVICE TO COUNTRY The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. LARSON ) for 5 minutes. Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about national service. I am delighted, as you can see from these posters, to be standing next to President Kennedy and General McChrystal. Many of you may know that this Monday, Memorial Day, May 29, would be the 100th birthday of John Fitzgerald Kennedy. What better way to remember his legacy than by a call to national service, a call that has been echoed by General McChrystal as well. I love the headline that says: You don’t have to wear a military uniform to serve your country. President Kennedy came up with the idea of the Peace Corps at a time when we faced nuclear threats and rising concern of proliferation of nuclear arms; at a time when Russia, as it still is today, was a very strong enemy of the United States. President Kennedy felt that the United States needed to put their best face on for the rest of the world, so he established a Peace Corps and sent the brightest and best all across the globe so that they could represent the values of this great country of ours. What better way to do that than through serving your country, by making sure you are not asking what your country can do for you but what you, in fact, can do for your country. We are proposing a concept called ACTION for National Service, action so that we can encourage people throughout the country to participate in voluntary service. Whether you serve in the military voluntarily, the Guard or the National Reserve, or whether it is the Peace Corps, AmeriCorps VISTA, or you are part of the Corporation for National and Community Service and one of the many agencies that work to provide a better world both here at home and abroad. Our goal is very simple and direct. We want to make sure, as General McChrystal has outlined, that by 2026, which would be the 250th birthday of this Nation, that we have a million volunteers annually who are coming in to service. We will provide an incentive for people to do so, very clear and simple: If you serve your country, we will help you get through college. If you have been through college and you want to serve your country, if you serve your Nation, we will forgive your college debt. We know that, in attracting a million people to public service, we can do great good across the globe. We want to make sure that we raise the Corporation for National and Community Service to a Cabinetlevel position within the White House. We want to encourage people. More than 400,000 millennials were turned away from serving their country last year. Less than 1 percent of the Nation, including all of our military and the Peace Corps and AmeriCorps VISTA combined, account for less than 1 percent of the Nation. How can a nation long survive with a population of 330 million people and less than 1 percent of its countrymen serving this great Nation of ours? This is a national crisis. At a time when we have to make sure that we are encouraging and nurturing our great democracy, we need our citizens to become more involved. That is why, on Thursday of this week, we are going to be rolling out a bill that will do just that and do so in a manner that will elevate the Corporation for National and Community Service to a Cabinet level position, create the goal of establishing a million volunteers annually by 2026, incentivizing them to serve so that if you serve your country, we will forgive your debt; or if you serve your country, we will help you go to college or get the kind of training that you need to be a participant while also gaining the knowledge and expertise and the values that come from community service. Join us. We will be live on YouTube Thursday morning at 9 o’clock. f 
MAY IS AN IMPORTANT MONTH TO HOOSIERS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. MESSER ) for 5 minutes. Mr. MESSER. Mr. Speaker, May is an important month for Hoosiers. We celebrate Indiana’s great racing tradition, the Indianapolis 500, and our longstanding military tradition on Memorial Day and during Military Appreciation Month. There are almost half a million veterans living in Indiana today in addition to the 30,000 Hoosiers currently serving in the armed services, Reserve, and the Guard. We are proud of our military men and women in Indiana. These honorable Hoosiers are our fathers, sons, mothers, daughters, neighbors, and friends. Service and patriotic duty is the Hoosier way. Actually, both of my grandfathers, my Grandpa Lathery and my Grandpa Rotzien, served our Nation in the armed services. This May, as we gather together to celebrate our great Hoosier traditions, let’s remember the reason that we get to celebrate. It is all thanks to the men and women who have put their lives on the line so that each of us can be free. On Memorial Day, we, of course, remember those who paid the ultimate sacrifice for our freedoms, but every day we can remember that we owe our military families and our vets a debt that can never be repaid. Let’s all do everything we can to ensure they are honored every day. 
b1200 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker at noon. 
PRAYER The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: God of mercy, we give You thanks for giving us another day. We thank You once again that we can come before You and ask guidance for the men and women of this assembly. Send Your spirit of peace, honesty, and fairness during this week when the budget is being considered and the work of appropriations continues. As violence and the threat of violence hang over our world, may we be continually thankful for and supportive of those whose life’s work is keeping us safe. Send Your spirit of healing and comfort to those who are victims of these horrors in our world. May we in America, and all men and women of good will, be committed to working for peace in our homes, neighborhoods, and throughout our land and the world. Bless us this day and every day. May all that is done be for Your greater honor and glory. Amen. 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. HILL) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. HILL led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, today the President put forward his budget proposal. It will be damaging to the people in our communities and the places that we call home. It cuts Medicaid by over $600 billion and cuts the food stamp program by over 25 percent, affecting the most needy within our communities. It slashes infrastructure programs, eliminates TIGER grants, cuts student loan and financial aid programs, and includes catastrophic cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency. For my home State of Hawaii, this budget zeroes out Federal funding for the Native Hawaiian Housing Block Grants, the Native Hawaiian Loan Guarantee program, and cuts Native Hawaiian education programs by nearly $33 million, crippling the progress that has been made for over 30 years to strengthen Native Hawaiian early education, literacy, gifted and talented education programs, higher education, vocational programs, and more. I strongly oppose this budget, and I look forward to working with my colleagues in Congress to pass a budget that actually serves the people and our planet. 
VENEZUELA IS A FAILED STATE (Mr. HILL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, all of us in the Western Hemisphere are in horror. Venezuela is a failed state and potentially on the brink of civil war. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week that thousands of Cuban intelligence agents are helping the Maduro regime maintain control over the army, while Maduro orders his soldiers to shoot his own people who are demonstrating in the streets. We cannot let countries like China, Russia, Iran, and Cuba continue to play a role in propping up the Maduro regime. While I commend Treasury Secretary Mnuchin for issuing sanctions against individuals of the Venezuelan Supreme Court, I call on the administration to ratchet up the pressure on these outside forces and have them answer for their role in the emergency situation in Venezuela. While we face many challenges across the globe, America must reengage in the Western Hemisphere and not let the neighbors in our backyard slide back into tyranny. f 
PRESIDENTIAL BUDGET SHORTSIGHTED AND RECKLESS (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, well, the President’s budget is shortsighted. It is reckless. Hopefully, it is dead on arrival when it lands here in the House. President Trump and Republicans want to throw billions of dollars more on defense programs and drastically cut investments in job training, afterschool programs, and lifesaving medical research. Think about this: It cuts Social Security disability benefits. If you are a worker in Saginaw looking for your next job, you are out of luck. President Trump wants to cut worker training programs. If you are a senior in Bay City, Michigan, and you depend on Meals on Wheels, too bad. President Trump wants to take away those meals, take away that contact that you have. If you are a parent in Flint with a child in Head Start just trying to find a way forward, too bad. President Trump’s budget will cut support for education and for early childhood education. A budget is a statement of our values. What does this document say about the values of this President? We must reject the President’s proposed budget. It is bad for America. 
MILITARY APPRECIATION MONTH (Mr. WILLIAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this time to recognize Military Appreciation Month. This month allows us the opportunity to educate Americans regarding the impact our military has had throughout history. This month allows us to honor the important men and women who have served and who are serving in uniform. Mr. Speaker, this month allows us to celebrate over 90 million patriots who chose to put our country before themselves. As a Representative of the 25th Congressional District of Texas, it is my 
honor to represent Fort Hood Army Base. I am proud to speak on behalf of ‘‘The Great Place.’’ Located in Killeen, Texas, this 340squaremile installation is the gold standard for the Army. My visits to Fort Hood have given me a deeper appreciation for our military and their families. This appreciation is why I would like to recognize Memorial Day, which we will all celebrate on Monday, May 29. This day reminds us of the brave men and women who gave up their todays so we could have our tomorrows. It gives us a chance to say thank you to a soldier, sailor, airman, coastguardsman, or a marine. Please join me in paying tribute to military members who have given our country the ultimate sacrifice. May God bless our troops. God bless The Great Place, and God bless the United States of America. In God we trust. 
INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS AT AMERICAN INSTITUTIONS (Mr. CONNOLLY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the international students and the U.S. institutions of higher education they attend. They have been unfairly penalized by the Trump administration through unconstitutional and illegal immigration executive orders. I urge my colleagues and the administration to recognize the vital contribution these international students make to our country. International students who spend time in the United States become ambassadors when they return home, sharing an appreciation of our values, counteracting stereotypes about Americans and the United States, and enhancing respect for cultural differences and democratic norms. International students contribute to the economic wellbeing of the United States. According to the Association of International Educators, during the last academic year, international students and their families supported 400,000 jobs and contributed $33 billion to our domestic economy. In my district alone, 4,978 international students and families contributed $137 million to our local economy, supporting 1,725 jobs. Actions taken by this administration and this President have generated a great deal of fear and uncertainty within academia. It hurts America. I urge us to support more international students to come to our country. 
RECOGNIZING FLAT ROCK MIDDLE SCHOOL (Mr. FERGUSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the hard work of the students and faculty at Flat Rock Middle School in Tyrone, Georgia. Four years ago, Dr. Monica Reckley decided to found a STEM program at Flat Rock to give her students more than just a traditional classroom experience. She hoped to show them how science, technology, math, and engineering could lead to future careers. Today, the program has 150 students spread over 6th, 7th, and 8th grades, and it is helping students develop an interest that could lead them to new professional opportunities. The program introduces students to STEM, brings in speakers from these fields, and allows students to participate in related competitions. Last month, 10 students from the program participated in the Georgia Tech InVenture Challenge and had several inventions showcased. These inventions included a bulletproof vest designed specifically for female police officers, a wireless vital signs monitoring device for elderly patients, a dental floss guard to make flossing easier, and an extension cord and power outlet combination that reduces the number of electrical outlets needed in a home. I am so proud of these students and the opportunities this school district has provided to encourage young people to explore careers in the 21st century. I am a proud supporter of career and technical education programs because they prepare students and young people for work and careers in the modern workforce. f 
PRESIDENT’S BUDGET IS AWFUL (Ms. KELLY of Illinois asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak out against the President’s newly released budget request. When I began reading this budget request, only one word came to mind, at least that I can say here—awful: It is an awful budget for American families struggling to make ends meet who haven’t had a raise in years. It is an awful budget for older Americans who paid into Social Security with the promise that it would be there for them. It is an awful budget for local businesses who can’t get their products to consumers because of our crumbling roads and bridges. It is an awful budget for common sense, with unnecessary spending on a border wall that the American people will pay for. It is an awful budget because it sets the stage for even more waste, fraud, and abuse in government. In fact, Mr. Speaker, the only group that this budget isn’t awful for is the President and his friends. The President calls this an America First budget, so why is it leaving so many American families behind? I urge my colleagues to completely reject this awful budget that doesn’t create jobs, doesn’t uplift families, and doesn’t make any sense. f 
ROWLAND THEATRE CELEBRATES 100TH ANNIVERSARY (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a true gem in Philipsburg, Pennsylvania, the Rowland Theatre, which celebrates its 100th anniversary this year. Rowland Theatre opened its doors on June 4, 1917. Its visionary was Congressman Charles Rowland, who was elected to the House of Representatives in 1915 and represented the 21st Congressional District, which included Cameron, Centre, Clearfield, and McKean Counties. The Rowland Theatre was actually one small part of Congressman Rowland’s life, but it would be the project that would become his legacy. The theater not only showed the latest silent movies during its first few decades, it was also the location for the top traveling shows in the country. Now the Rowland Theatre shows feature films and also hosts plays, as well as choir and orchestra performances. The 1,000seat theater remains an anchor of downtown Philipsburg, and it is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Rowland Theatre is open 364 days a year, closing only on Christmas Eve. Mr. Speaker, the Rowland Theatre is a real treasure. Here is to another 100 years. Congratulations. 
b1215 RAISING THE DIALOGUE ON MIDDLE NEIGHBORHOODS (Mr. EVANS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, President Trump’s budget is officially live, and he plans to make massive cuts to programs that help our hardworking families get ahead. What do we have to lose under President Trump’s budget? What don’t we have to lose? Education programs for our children, Medicare and Medicaid for the health and safety of our neighborhoods, affordable housing, SNAP benefits, veterans, seniors, and the hits keep coming. A budget is a moral document, and this one shortchanges Americans from the middle neighborhoods in Philadelphia to Beaver, Pennsylvania. The President talks about putting the country first, yet the budget does no such thing. There is a big difference between governing and campaigning. President Trump, our neighborhoods have a lot to lose when it comes to your budget. Over 40 percent of the populations of 
Philadelphia live in what you call middle neighborhoods. Middle neighborhoods are neighborhoods caught between bust and boom, neighborhoods that are doing well enough. Our neighborhoods compete for people. My district has a poverty rate of 28 percent. Mr. President, now is not the time to make deep cuts to programs our neighbors rely on while calling for massive tax cuts for the rich. Instead, we need to make investments in food policy, social safety net, education policy, and make access to capital and credit. Our communities have too much to lose. Together we will build stronger neighborhoods, block by block. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. POE of Texas). Members are reminded to address all comments to the Chair, not to other Members or to the President. 
HONORING THOSE WHO DIED FOR OUR FREEDOM (Mr. SMUCKER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and remember those who fought and died for our freedom, to thank the brave men and women who today defend our freedom, and to recognize the sacrifice of all their families. Pennsylvania has produced some of the greatest examples of valor and bravery the world has ever seen. It is home to pivotal moments in American history, like Gettysburg, Valley Forge, and the Battle of Lake Erie. Pennsylvania’s sons have stormed the beaches of Normandy. They have liberated the oppressed from fascism and communism, and they have sought out terror in the depths of Afghanistan and Iraq in order to protect our way of life. Memorial Day is coming up this weekend. We will all enjoy time with our families and friends, but we must always remember that is only possible because of the brave men and women who gave what Abraham Lincoln called the ‘‘last full measure of devotion,’’ and those who protect us today. 
THE UNAFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE BILL (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, currently a panel of Republican Senators are deciding the fate of millions of American women’s healthcare. Tragically, their starting point is the Housepassed bill that would force new moms on Medicaid to return to work right after birth, reduce women’s access to copays for contraception, weaken protections for preexisting conditions like pregnancy, and eliminate the guarantee of essential health benefits that provides services like mammograms and cervical cancer screenings, services that save lives. All of these measures hurt women— and only women—and will do enormous harm to the health and wellbeing of women from childhood to old age. It is an outrage and a gross injustice when women are treated so unequally with such gross disparity and such total disregard for their lives and wellbeing. It is one more powerful reason why this Congress should pass and send to the States to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment, declaring in no uncertain terms that women are entitled to equal rights, equal justice, equal treatment, equal protection under the law, and that means equal treatment in healthcare. In this country, it is time, at long last, for equal to mean just that, equal. f 
TRIBUTE TO COMMANDER JOANN BURDIAN (Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with much admiration and respect for Commander Jo Ann Burdian of the United States Coast Guard. Commander Burdian’s tenure in the House of Representatives as a congressional liaison for the United States Coast Guard is coming to an end. She is on her second tour of duty, 3 years each, for a total of 6 years. During her tenure in the House of Representatives, we have seen unprecedented growth and change in the mission of the United States Coast Guard. It has become somewhat of a Swiss Army knife of an agency, of a command, covering everything from oil spills to homeland security, 9/11, alien interdiction, drug interdiction, defense missions, maritime security, and many other important missions around the world. Commander Burdian has fostered incredible relationships with Members, staff, and oversight committees and done a fantastic job for both sides of the aisle, including assisting in the passage of two major Coast Guard authorization bills, three appropriations bills, full funding of the Offshore Patrol Cutter, the Fast Response Cutter, the National Security Cutter, and helping to secure $150 million in the FY17 budget to progress polar icebreaker capabilities for the United States. Commander Burdian’s hard work and efforts for the House of Representatives were rewarded with her appointment to chief of response for Sector Puget Sound. I want to commend her and her family for incredible service to the United States. 
MAY IS FOSTER CARE MONTH (Mrs. LAWRENCE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize May as National Foster Care Month. In Michigan, there are nearly 14,000 children in foster care and more than 400,000 children nationwide all in need of love and support. Studies have shown the majority of children in foster care are affected by mental health issues and often lack access to the help they need. We need to push for access to services to support these vulnerable children to avoid serious risks in the future. I encourage my colleagues to continue working together in a bipartisan manner to address the needs of our foster care system. I also want to thank KAREN BASSfor raising awareness on the critical needs facing foster youth through the Congressional Caucus on Foster Youth. During this month and beyond, let us celebrate foster parents and caregivers and recommit to ensuring every child has a permanent, safe, and loving family. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF YODELL BILLAH (Mr. O’HALLERAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. O’HALLERAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay my respects to Yodell Billah, who passed away earlier this month at the age of 97. Mr. Billah was a Navajo code talker and World War II Army veteran, fighting against the Germans in Italy until their surrender in 1945. His heroic actions and the work of our code talkers saved the lives of innumerable soldiers and civilians. For his service, he was awarded the American Defense Service Medal, American Campaign Medal, and the European African Middle East Campaign Medal. We can never repay the debts that we owe Mr. Billah, code talkers from all our Tribal Nations, and our veterans, but I am proud and humbled to stand before you today to bring attention to his service and honor his legacy. Mr. Billah will forever be remembered as an active member of his community, a loving father, a grandfather, and, above all, a hero. 
WE MUST RESPOND TO THE GLOBAL CRISIS OF HUNGER AND FAMINE (Mr. MCGOVERN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, 20 million people in South Sudan, Somalia, Yemen, and Nigeria are on the brink of famine. We saw this coming. The warning signs were there long before January of this year. I am so proud that Republicans and Democrats joined together to include an additional $1 billion in the FY 2017 omnibus bill to address these famines. Our citizens and our farmers have always been generous in times of such grave need. They know that we have to protect children from hunger and the 
violence of war. They know that we need to support diplomacy and development to avoid future catastrophes. Our united effort must continue in FY 2018, but the President’s budget eliminates the Food for Peace and the McGovernDole programs, and reduces funding for disaster assistance. I only hope President Trump and Secretary Tillerson will come to their senses. We must not stand by and watch millions of children and families literally starve to death. We must act, and we must lead. 
BUDGETS ARE ABOUT PRIORITIES (Ms. PLASKETT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, today the President put forth his budget proposal. The budget includes roughly $2.5 trillion in cuts to programs that help struggling families and elderly and disabled people afford the basics, like putting food on the table, keeping a roof over their heads, and affording healthcare. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, SNAP, would be cut by $192 billion over the next decade. Medicaid, the health program for the poor, would be cut by $800 billion. TANF, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, would be cut by $21 billion. In 2014, 20 percent of the population of my district, the Virgin Islands, received SNAP. SNAP feeds primarily poor children. In 2013, 19 percent of Virgin Islands’ children were covered under Medicaid. Another 27 percent went without any health coverage at all. Mr. Speaker, budgets are about priorities. Unfortunately, our President’s priorities are clear: more tax cuts for the wealthy taking precedence over ensuring that poor children have enough to eat, that people with physical and mental disabilities can make ends meet, and that low and moderateincome Americans have access to healthcare. The budget would make inequality and poverty significantly worse, while allowing deficits, when honestly measured, to soar. Mr. Speaker, we must reject this budget. 
HONORING THE HEROES OF OUR ARMED FORCES (Mr. YODER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. YODER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today ahead of Memorial Day next week to honor the heroes of our Armed Forces who have made the ultimate sacrifice and service to our Nation and to thank their fellow soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines who were blessed to make it back home to their loved ones. From the Revolutionary War through the war on terror, more than 1.3 million Americans have given their lives protecting our freedoms. Today, Congress is honoring those lost by passing several bills to help protect our surviving veterans and ensure they are treated with the dignity and respect they have earned. Our bills will ensure that the VA medical centers are meeting compliance requirements, help veterans have better access to nursing home care, increase the rates for veterans’ compensation for serviceconnected disabilities, and more. Mr. Speaker, I can think of no better way to celebrate Memorial Day and honor the memory of those lost than by helping our Nation’s veterans, who have sacrificed so much to help keep America safe. I urge all of my colleagues to support these measures today and our veterans each and every day. f 
BIG TALK AND BROKEN PROMISES (Mr. SOTO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, today we have a new Trump budget and more broken promises. If you recall on May 7, 2015, the President said: ‘‘I was the first and only potential GOP candidate to state there will be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.’’ Broken promise number one. His budget cuts Medicaid, it cuts Medicare, it cuts Social Security. In The Washington Post on January 15, 2017, the President said: ‘‘We are going to have insurance for everybody. Much less expensive and much better.’’ This broken promise number two is that he cuts $1.4 trillion out of healthcare and covers 24 million less people, jacking up insurance rates for countless others. Broken promise number three to the Farm Bureau at ag.com on April 24, 2017: ‘‘I support a strong safety net for our Nation’s farmers.’’ Yet he cuts $50 billion over 10 years from farm subsidies, including critical citrus greening research dollars for central Florida, where I represent. Then on September 28, 2016, The Washington Times, he says: ‘‘I will be the greatest President for jobs that God’s ever created.’’ He is cutting the National Institutes of Health, critical research dollars by $5.8 billion, cutting NASA by $200 million, cutting National Science Foundation by $776 million. We see big talk and broken promises. 
b1230 PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 953, REDUCING REGULATORY BURDENS ACT OF 2017 Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 348 and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: 
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia? There was no objection. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I found myself listening to the Reading Clerk as he read through the rule. It is a fairly straightforward rule, but it sounded pretty complicated as he was going through it. And I am reminded that 
standing to your left is one of the gentlemen that helps us sort through those issues. As every Member of this institution knows, who was listening to the colloquy last week, Brian Cooper is leaving this House after 35 years of public service, honorable service, showing up day in and day out. My friend, Mr. MCGOVERN , and I, working on the Rules Committee, sometimes go until 2, 3, or 4 in the morning. Well, folks like Mr. Cooper can’t go home until the Rules Committee goes home. So day in and day out, with absolutely no pomp or circumstance, just dedicated public service, Brian Cooper served this institution. I fear this will be the last time he and I are on the floor together while I have control of the microphone. And I did not want to yield control of that microphone without telling how much his assistance has meant to me. You know, Mr. Speaker, standing in that chair is a powerful responsibility. The burden sometimes is a lot to bear. When you are surrounded by a team of excellence, as you are today, with Ethan to your right and Brian to your left, I know you do that with great confidence. I am grateful to folks who help us to succeed. Thank you, Mr. Cooper, for all of that service. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 348 is a structured rule. It provides for consideration of H.R. 953, the Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act of 2017. It makes in order two amendments from my Democratic colleagues—one from Ms. ESTYand one from Mr. H UFFMAN . As you might remember, the House passed a nearly identical version of this bill last year, Mr. Speaker, but, unfortunately, it did not get across the finish line in the Senate, so it did not make it to the President’s desk. We are trying again this year. My sincere hope is that we will succeed. Mr. Speaker, I know that you hear from constituents, as I do, talking about regulatory burdens, and why can’t we bring commonsense rules and regulations to Washington. H.R. 953, the bill that this rule would make in order, is an attempt to do that. This bill prohibits the EPA from requiring unnecessary and duplicative pollution permits for certain pesticides. Now, so often when we start a sentence with ‘‘this prevents the EPA,’’ folks think: Oh, there go those Republicans again going after the environment, waiving those regulations that protect friends and family. Well, as you know, Mr. Speaker, that accusation is never accurate. But, in particular, it fails to address this situation. For decade upon decade, the EPA has regulated pesticides in this country. If we pass H.R. 953 today, for decades and decades to come, the EPA will continue to regulate pesticides in this country. As a result of litigation, Mr. Speaker, the courts are forcing the EPA not to regulate pesticides as pesticides, but to regulate pesticides as pollutant discharges, as if there is something else to do with pesticides other than to spray it. They are saying that you can’t just get a permit to use your pesticide, Mr. Speaker. You can’t just read the label and the proper application and get a permit to apply, as indicated on the label. You must also get a permit to discharge a pollutant as if the pesticide is not already regulated as a pesticide itself. Mr. Speaker, it makes no sense. The good news is I am surround by a team of excellence here in the United States House of Representatives and, in a bipartisan way, we have already agreed that it makes no sense. You will recall, Mr. Speaker, we brought a substantially similar measure to the floor, and we passed it under a process called suspension of the rules. It is a process we save for those bills that are relatively noncontroversial. It passed in a bipartisan way, but didn’t make it across the Senate floor. We brought it back again, Mr. Speaker, to this floor. We brought it under a rule, as we are doing today. It passed again in a bipartisan way. We sent it to the Senate, but couldn’t make it across the Senate floor. Mr. Speaker, we added it to the farm bill that we passed here in the House, which, again, passed in a bipartisan way. We sent it over to the Senate and it was stripped out on the Senate side. Mr. Speaker, we have come together time and time again as a body to move this commonsense regulatory reform forward. It is my great hope that I will get support from both sides of the aisle again today not just on this rule, but on the underlying legislation, and that we will move forward in a bipartisan way again. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. (Mr. MCGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. WOODALL ) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes. Mr. Speaker, let me begin as well and echo what Mr. WOODALL said in praising Brian Cooper for his many decades of service to this body. We appreciate all of his years of service. We appreciate all of the years he drove back and forth to work from Baltimore. And we appreciate the incredible patience that he has demonstrated over the years by having to listen to us time and time again. One of the great joys of serving in this body is that you meet some remarkable people. Brian Cooper is certainly a remarkable person, and he will be missed. And I think on behalf of everybody here, we want to say: thank you. Mr. Speaker, let me rise in strong opposition to this rule and to the underlying legislation. My colleague, Mr. WOODALL , just referenced all of the times we passed it, it went over to the Senate, and it didn’t go anywhere. Maybe we should take a hint from the Senate that it is not a good bill and we ought to kind of reconsider some of the aspects of this bill. But here we are again on the House floor with yet another regulatory rollback. It is shameful that the leadership of this House continues to waste precious time on bills that seem to address the concerns of Big Industry over the needs of our constituents, especially as we have so much that needs to be accomplished. By the way, whatever happened to regular order? Do you remember when committees held hearings and markups? The Agriculture Committee, on which I serve, did not hold a hearing. It held a markup, but it did not hold a hearing. And the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, the committee with primary jurisdiction over this bill, held no hearing and did no markup. And let’s talk about amendments. The majority made in order less than half of the amendments submitted— two amendments—but they blocked through completely germane amendments. Members jumped through all of the hoops, they dotted all of the Is, and they crossed all of the Ts. These were properly drafted amendments, and they were blocked because the Republican majority was afraid to vote on them. Now, what were these amendments? Well, an amendment to prohibit the discharge of toxics in such circumstances where they would be harmful to pregnant women or harm fetal or early childhood development. The amendment protects pregnant women and children. Blocked. An amendment to create an exception for communities that use a source of drinking water where a Federal or State emergency declaration has been issued due to a threat to public health, such as heightened exposure to an identified contaminant. Blocked. An amendment to ensure existing Clean Water Act protections apply to waters that a State has already determined are polluted by pesticides. Blocked. They were blocked because they would have passed. Why are my colleagues afraid of protecting pregnant women, and ensuring clean drinking water? That is what these amendments were about. They were germane. The only reason why they are not in order is because you chose to block them in the Rules Committee. I would say to my Republican friends: You are not running this institution. You are ruining this institution. This is supposed to be a deliberative body. Let’s start acting like it. And that means bringing germane amendments to the floor, letting us have a debate, letting Republicans and 
Democrats debate, and then vote on those amendments. There is not a single reason at all other than the fact that the Republican leadership did not want these amendments to pass that they were not made in order. That is not the way this place is supposed to work. And speaking of a bad process, late last week, Billy House at Bloomberg News broke the news that the House may need to vote again on this devastating TrumpCare bill. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  the article by Billy House. 
[From www.bloomberg.com, May 18, 2017] HOUSE MAYNEEDTOVOTEAGAIN ON GOP OBAMACARE REPEAL BILL (By Billy House) House Republicans barely managed to pass their Obamacare repeal bill earlier this month, and they now face the possibility of having to vote again on their controversial health measure. House Speaker Paul Ryan hasn’t yet sent the bill to the Senate because there’s a chance that parts of it may need to be redone, depending on how the Congressional Budget Office estimates its effects. House leaders want to make sure the bill conforms with Senate rules for reconciliation, a mechanism that allows Senate Republicans to pass the bill with a simple majority. Republicans had rushed to vote on the health bill so the Senate could get a quick start on it, even before the CBO had finished analyzing a series of lastminute changes. The CBO is expected to release an updated estimate next week. ‘‘Unaware,’’ said Representative Jeff Denham of California, with noticeable surprise Thursday, when advised that his party leaders still hadn’t sent the bill over to the Senate. Denham was one of the House Republicans who ended up voting for the measure, after earlier in the week opposing it. ‘‘I am on the whip team and we have a lot of conversations, but we have not had that one. So I am going to look into it,’’ said Denham, a member of the party’s vote counting team. 
DOWNPLAYING CONCERN  One senior GOP aide downplayed any concern over the potential trouble from the CBO report, depicting it as hypothetical, and saying that leaders will cross that bridge if they need to. According to several aides and other procedural experts, if Republicans send the bill to the Senate now and the CBO later concludes it doesn’t save at least $2 billion, it would doom the bill and Republicans would have to start their repeal effort all over with a new budget resolution. Congressional rules would likely prevent Republicans from fixing the bill after it’s in the Senate, the aides said. In the Senate, the bill must hit separate $1 billion deficit reduction targets in the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee and the chamber’s health committee. Republican aides said failing to meet those numbers would force the House to fix the bill even if the legislation meets the overall costsavings target. If Republican leaders hold onto the bill until the CBO report is released, then Ryan and his team could still redo it if necessary. That would require at least one more House vote of some sort. Ryan told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt on Friday that he doesn’t think the House will need to vote again on the health law. ‘‘We just want to, out of an abundance of caution, wait to send the bill over to the Senate when we get the final score,’’ Ryan said. That vote could be cloaked in some kind of arcane procedural move, but it would still be depicted as a proxy for yet another vote on the same bill—and reluctant Republicans will once again be forced to decide whether to back it. Only this time, they would also be saddled with the CBO’s latest findings about the bill’s costs and impacts. Republicans had a sizable deficit reduction cushion—$150 billion—before several amendments were added to the bill at the last minute, including changes allowing states to legalize much skimpier health insurance plans. BUDGET ASSUMPTIONS  It’s unclear what assumptions the CBO will make about what states will do with that newly created flexibility. If millions of people sign up for much cheaper, minimal insurance, that could trigger billions—and potentially even hundreds of billions—in costs over a decade because of the House bill’s health insurance tax credits. ‘‘We’ve got to wait for the CBO score,’’ said Greg Walden of Oregon, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which authored much of the bill. ‘‘To prove that you meet the reconciliation test.’’ But other senior Republicans weren’t aware that leaders had been holding onto the bill. ‘‘I had no idea,’’ Dennis Ross of Florida, another member of the votecounting team, said Thursday, adding that the prospect of another vote ‘‘does concern me.’’ GOP leaders never said publicly they were planning to hold on to the bill for two weeks or longer. 
DEMOCRATS ’ CRITICISM  ‘‘Every school child knows that when you pass a bill in the House, you send it to the Senate,’’ said Louise Slaughter, the ranking Democrat on the House Rules Committee. ‘‘You don’t hide it in a drawer somewhere for two weeks, while you wait for information that you should have had before you passed it.’’ The speaker and other Republicans urgently pushed their May 4 floor vote, despite a polarized Republican conference, using the frantic final hours to win over holdouts. Even so, 20 Republicans still voted against the bill. After the bill squeaked through, Ryan and other senior Republicans dashed to the White House for an unusual celebration of a onechamber vote. 
Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I want to make sure everyone understands that. We thought we were through with it here in the House, but we may not be. After Republicans used emergency procedures on more than one occasion to rush their bill through the House of Representatives, we found out that Republican leaders had yet to send a bill over to the Senate for its consideration. Instead, they have been hiding the bill for nearly 3 weeks. What happened to the urgency that my colleagues were talking about a few weeks ago? We heard from our Republican friends that the sky would fall if we didn’t act upon TrumpCare immediately. It had to be done right then and there. We couldn’t slow down long enough to hear from the nonpartisan experts at the Congressional Budget Office. We couldn’t slow down enough so that people could actually read what was in the bill. We couldn’t slow down enough to do hearings or to get estimates on how this massive bill would impact the healthcare of millions of Americans. I think it has become clear to all of us, Mr. Speaker, that the only reason to rush through this process was to trick their own Members into voting for this disastrous bill. It was to keep their Members from seeing the CBO score before they voted for the bill, because if they had seen it, many of them may not have voted for it. Republican leadership couldn’t risk transparency, and they wouldn’t let the facts get in the way of passing TrumpCare. We expect CBO to release their final analysis tomorrow. Finally, we will know how many millions of Americans will be kicked off of their healthcare because of these reckless and heartless Republican policies. We will find out how devastating this bill will be for millions of Americans with preexisting conditions. And we will finally learn just how big that tax cut for wealthy Americans is going to be. I guess my question to Republican leaders of this House is: What was the rush? If you were going to have to hold up the bill over here until the CBO score was released anyway, why couldn’t we just have waited to receive this very important information before we asked the House to vote on this terrible bill? Oh, wait. I know why the Republican leadership needed to move TrumpCare so fast, so that the bill’s namesake— President Trump—didn’t throw a temper tantrum. That is what this was all about. So he wouldn’t call them out in one of his infamous Twitter rants. b1245 But it wasn’t about good legislating. It was a lousy process basically designed to prematurely shove a bill through that is bad for Americans, all for some headline or temporary political gain. Now, if you have been watching the news lately, you will notice that our 45th President hasn’t been generating the best headlines, what with ‘‘this Russia thing’’—those are his words— constant leaks of information from his staff to the press, never mind the President’s leaking of sensitive classified information on national security matters. President Trump needed a win for himself, even if it is a loss for the American people. As we all know, it is all about him. Now, I remind my Republican colleagues that they work for the American people, that the ultimate boss for all of us is our constituents, not the President of the United States. Mr. Speaker, the Republican majority has made a habit of completely skirting regular order and rushing through legislation crafted behind closed doors with no opportunity for meaningful debate and consideration, and this TrumpCare bill is a prime example. 
We had emergency meetings, backroom deals, and fixes to the fixes to the fixes, and what we were left with is a lousy product that we may have to consider again. My Republican colleagues should be ashamed of themselves. Process matters. We are on the Rules Committee. If you don’t believe process matters, you ought to get on a different committee. It matters for the integrity of this institution, and it matters if we are to prevent lousy legislation. Finally, Mr. Speaker, let me say a few words about the Trump budget that was just released this morning. We are still digging through the text and combing through the details, but from what we have already seen, it is devastating. Reports indicate that this budget makes the deepest cuts to Federal programs that help the most vulnerable, the poorest of the poor. Mr. Speaker, that is nothing to be proud of. At a time when our crumbling infrastructure needs repair, our kids need access to affordable education, and our workers need training to move into hightech jobs, we simply cannot afford to turn our back on these critical investments that will move our country forward. But this budget plan does just that. Since we are on the floor to talk about an antienvironment bill today, I should note that the Environmental Protection Agency is among the agencies hardest hit by President Trump’s ruthless proposal. Through massive cuts to the EPA, the Trump administration is paving the way toward dirtier air and more polluted water. But my Republican colleagues don’t seem to be too concerned with that. They have been proposing cuts to EPA for years and years and years. Mr. Speaker, of all the rotten provisions tucked into this document—and I could go on and on and on—I find the most troubling to be the radical assault on people living in poverty. You know, it is easy to sit in an office at OMB and concoct plans to throw people off of SNAP and off of Medicaid and kick them out of their housing. This plan does just that. By any reading, by any measure, that is what it does. We are reading about a $274 billion cut to our safety net, on top of the over $800 billion cut to Medicaid included in the TrumpCare bill. These are real people, Mr. Speaker. They are our constituents. They are our neighbors and our friends. Our kids go to school together. But given some of the proposals I have seen from this majority party, I have to wonder whether some of my colleagues might never have talked with anyone living in poverty. I would say to them, life is very different when you leave your country club. Life is very different. It is very hard for people struggling in poverty. Being poor in this country is hard work, and you ought to know that by now. My Republican colleagues have made a habit of belittling the poor instead of trying to understand their struggles. They work hard, Mr. Speaker—often at more than one job—to put food on the table for their kids and to find a roof over their heads. They are exhausted from work and from worry. We see them every day, serving tables, washing dishes, hauling away trash, cleaning offices, mowing lawns, stacking heavy loads, taking care of people’s children, comforting the sick. Theirs are the faces in the bus windows going home from work at 2 in the morning. Theirs are the faces arriving at work at 5 in the morning the next day. They deserve our respect, not the disdain shown to them and to their families in this disgraceful budget. I would like to remind my colleagues that poverty and hunger in rural areas is often as bad as, and sometimes even worse than, in cities. So I find it highly offensive that this budget slashes our safety net for the very people that President Trump promised to protect, the very people who put President Trump in office. You know, I heard some of the rationale for this budget from the White House, saying: Well, you know, people who are on SNAP ought to work. Well, let me just say for the RECORD  so it is clear to everybody here that the majority of people on SNAP are children, are senior citizens, are people who are disabled. Of those who can work, a majority of them work. They work, but they earn so little that they are still stuck in poverty. Why aren’t we having a debate about increasing wages in this country? Why is the debate focused on how we make the lives of those in poverty even more miserable? You know, budgets are moral documents, and this is the most heartless, reckless, and damaging plan I have ever seen. It is immoral. The President’s Budget Director talked yesterday about compassion for taxpayers and for Trump supporters. Well, give me a break. You know, I would tell Mr. Mulvaney I don’t think that word means what he think it means. Compassion, that is feeding starving children, helping a father get back on his feet after a job loss, helping a mother get back on her feet after a job loss, cleaning up poisoned water, ensuring everyone has a chance at living a healthy life regardless of how much money they have. That is compassion, not turning our backs on these people. Tax cuts for the wealthiest among us at the expense of the public safety net is cruel. It is coldhearted and, Mr. Speaker, I am sick of it. I assure you that is not compassionate. So I hope my Republican colleagues will have the courage to stand up against this administration and do what is right for the American people. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I would advise my friend from Massachusetts I do not have any speakers remaining, and I reserve the balance of my time to close. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Throughout his campaign, President Trump made promises that he would not cut Medicare, Medicaid, or Social Security. Now we have come to find out that he has broken every one of those promises. The Trump budget includes more than $800 billion in Medicaid cuts in the GOP healthcare bill and then adds additional cuts on top of that, with total Medicaid cuts of over $1 trillion over the next 10 years. Furthermore, the Trump budget guts Social Security disability insurance which, as of 2015, covered 10 million recipients. The Trump budget also slashes funding for SNAP, our Nation’s first line of defense against hunger, by $193 billion. That is a 25 percent cut. SNAP is the program that provides people food. That’s it—food. We have 42 million people in this country who are food insecure—42 million. We should all be ashamed of that. And the answer is to cut SNAP by 25 percent? Oh, and by the way, the average SNAP benefit is $1.40 per person per meal. And let’s not forget that the Republicans’ healthcare disaster takes $75 billion out of the Medicare trust fund, shortening the life of the trust fund. Mr. WOODALL. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. MCGOVERN. I yield to the gentleman from Georgia. Mr. WOODALL. I appreciate that. I would like to inquire of the Speaker: Is my friend from Massachusetts working on my yielded time or is he working on his time? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is on his own time. Mr. WOODALL. I thank my friend. Mr. MCGOVERN. If the gentleman wants to yield me some of his time, I am more than happy to go on for as long as you would like. Mr. WOODALL. If my friend would yield, I was advised that I had yielded an abundance of time. I just wanted to make sure that I was not being more generous than you and I would have intended. Mr. MCGOVERN. So, Mr. Speaker, it is disappointing that, instead of protecting our most vulnerable, President Trump and the House Republicans continually insist on tax breaks for big corporations and the wealthiest Americans. Mr. Speaker, we need to hold President Trump to his word. Therefore, I am asking that we defeat the previous question. If we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule that would change the rules of the House to prevent any legislation from being considered if it would result in a reduction of guaranteed benefits under the Social Security Act, if it would increase either the early or full retirement age to receive Social Security benefits. 
This would prevent any legislation from being considered if it would privatize Social Security. We would prevent any legislation from being considered that would result in a reduction of guaranteed benefits for individuals entitled to or enrolled for benefits under Medicare or result in a reduction of benefits or eligibility for individuals enrolled in or eligible to receive medical assistance through a State Medicaid plan or waiver. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the RECORD , along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Massachusetts? There was no objection. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I would just simply say to my colleagues that I urge everybody in this House to remember why we came to Congress and who sent us here. Our primary obligation is to the people of this country, and they did not send us here to make their lives more miserable. When you look at the priorities in the President’s budget, when you look at the impact that the healthcare bill, the TrumpCare bill that the House of Representatives passed, when you look at the impact it is going to have on tens of millions of Americans in this country, these bills will devastate people. So we need to get back to what is important. It is not about propping up the President during his difficulties. It is not about playing to the cheap seats at the Heritage Foundation or some other rightwing think tank. Our primary obligation is to people of the United States. This budget and the priorities of this Republican majority and the priorities of this President undercut the security and the economic well being of every single person in this country. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ to defeat the previous question and a ‘‘no’’ vote on the rule. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I want to recognize that, if you locked my friend from Massachusetts and me in a room together, it would be over both of our objections, but we would be able to solve about 50 percent of the challenges that face this country. There is something different that happens in conversation and dialogue when the cameras are turned off than happens when the cameras are on, and of course we are going to keep these cameras here on the floor of the House for as long as you and I are here because the American people have a right to see and a right to know. But just like Mom and Dad don’t want to have all their conversations in front of the kids, and the kids certainly don’t want to have all of their conversations in front of Mom and Dad, there is a role to be played for folks to be able to close the door and sit down and visit with each other and try to make things better. My friend from Massachusetts is absolutely right. The only job that we have is to make a difference for our constituency back home. Sometimes we legitimately disagree on how to do that. The budget is a good example. You will remember, Mr. Speaker, President Obama, in his 8 years as President of the United States, never once introduced a budget that balanced. He borrowed from our children and our grandchildren in every single budget. And when I say he didn’t introduce a budget that balanced, I don’t mean that he didn’t balance in year 1, I don’t mean he didn’t balance in year 10. I mean never, ever, ever looking forward in his budgets did he ever stop borrowing. Mr. Speaker, there is not a man or woman in this institution who believes that you can run a country that way. There is not one. There is not a man or woman in this institution who doesn’t understand that balancing budgets is going to mean hard decisions, and so it is absolutely the right place for the dialog about what those hard decisions should be. But let us not be confused for one moment. There is no pathway to balance that isn’t hard. Borrowing from your children and your grandchildren to pay for what you want today is always going to be easier, Mr. Speaker, than paying for it yourself. We are going to have to have that conversation. I agree with my friend from Massachusetts. We do not work for the President of the United States in this institution. If anything, he works for us. I sit on the House Budget Committee, Mr. Speaker, and I promise you, we are promulgating our own House budget, a work product that is going to make this institution proud. I am particularly pleased to be working with Budget Committee Chairwoman DIANE BLACK on that budget, even as we speak. b1300 Mr. Speaker, it will balance by making commonsense changes to Federal programs, one of which is included in this bill here today. Take the EPA, for example. Mr. Speaker, I encourage you, if you have not read the comments of our new EPA Administrator, to get into those because what he would tell you, which is absolutely true, is that we have Superfund sites in this country that are so polluted they cannot be utilized for other purposes. They have been on the Superfund list for decades through Republican Presidents and through Democratic Presidents. They have been sitting on that list. There is no plan to clean them up, no plan to make a difference in those communities, and no plan to serve those constituencies. That is wrong. Instead of spending its time and resources making a difference for families, making a difference for the environment, what is the EPA having to do? Respond to court cases that tell it to treat the reasonable and labeled application of pesticides; not as spraying pesticides in your field, but as if you were operating a factory and just having as an effluent, pesticide flowing out of your factory. That is just nonsense. The reason we produced pesticides is to spray it in fields. We do not need an effluent discharge permit as if we are running a factory, pumping it into our streams. We are not. We are spraying it on our plants to do what? Address the food needs of this Nation. My friend from Massachusetts is absolutely right when he talks about hunger in this Nation, Mr. Speaker. He is absolutely right. I dare say that there is not a community in this country that is not affected by hunger. But the biggest advocate we have in the fight against hunger is the American farmer, Mr. Speaker. There is nobody in the world who does it better; there is nobody in the world who produces it cheaper; there is nobody in the world that has the capability of producing the food to go on the grocery store shelves in America except the American farmer. And these pesticides and herbicides make a difference in getting that food out of the field and onto those store shelves. We want to do it with strict EPA regulation. That is what is lost in this debate. There is not one Member of this body that wants to repeal EPA regulation. We want to keep that EPA regulation. It is called FIFRA, that regulation that pesticides are regulated under. No one wants to change that at all. All folks want to do is say: Wait a minute, this is not a factory discharge issue. This is a pesticide issue. My friend from Massachusetts is absolutely right. I sit on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Mr. Speaker. We did not have a hearing or a markup on this bill, and it was absolutely referred to our committee. Why, Mr. Speaker? It was referred to our committee because we have jurisdiction over the Clean Water Act, but this has never been a Clean Water Act issue, except the courts tried to make it one. This has never been a Clean Water Act issue, except the litigants tried to make it one. So when we tried to fix the problem, we didn’t waste a moment in the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee dealing with the Clean Water Act because this has never been a Clean Water Act issue. It is an ag issue, which is why it went through my friend of Massachusetts’ Agriculture Committee. Mr. Speaker, I don’t begrudge anyone the job that they have to do in this institution. We have different constituencies. They ask different things of us. 
We all have to come and do our work. But I will tell you what, Mr. Speaker, everything doesn’t have to be an us againstthem battle. Sometimes it is just about us. Sometimes there is more that unites this country than divides this country, and that is okay. Sometimes we are able to work together on commonsense solutions, and that is okay. Mr. Speaker, when this bill came to the House under suspension of the rules, again, that process that we use for things that are noncontroversial, my friend from Massachusetts supported it at that time. He supported it because it is good legislation that is going to make a difference for folks back home. It is going to make a difference in combating hunger in every jurisdiction across this Nation. When this bill went through the Agriculture Committee, Mr. Speaker, there were no amendments offered. The Agriculture Committee is composed of Republicans and Democrats. It is a place where discussion takes place. It was the markup of this bill, which is when you go and try to amend it and make it better. Not one amendment was offered from either side. Why? Because we have discussed this issue, we have litigated this issue, and we have worked together on this issue, and it is a collaborative work product. Mr. MCGOVERN. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. WOODALL. I yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I would just say to the gentleman that a number of amendments that are germane were offered in the Rules Committee to protect the health and safety of women and children, and they were not made in order. So amendments were offered and they were blocked. I just point that out for the RECORD . Mr. WOODALL. I thank my friend. He is absolutely right. When the experts on the Agriculture Committee considered this, when the folks who spend their entire careers on Capitol Hill working on pesticide and pesticide safety considered this, they had absolutely no amendments to offer whatsoever. When it came to the Rules Committee and the entire House could offer amendments, folks absolutely offered amendments. The Rules Committee, on which the gentleman from Massachusetts and I serve, made two of those amendments in order. We rejected others. You heard my friend’s opening statement, Mr. Speaker, that one of the amendments we rejected was to protect pregnant women. Well, Mr. Speaker, for Pete’s sake, I have served with these men and women in here. I have been in this body for 6 years. There is not one Member of this institution who doesn’t care about pregnant women. There is not one Member of this institution who doesn’t care about children. There is not one Member of this institution who doesn’t care. What we do in this institution is care. And when my friend from Massachusetts supported this bill, when he supported this bill, there were no amendments along those lines. When the gentleman supported this bill without the amendment dealing particularly with pregnant women and children, I don’t believe for a moment the gentleman forgot about those pregnant women and children. I don’t believe for a moment he decided he was going to punish pregnant women and children. I believe that he thought those protections were inherent in the base text, and he was right when he thought it, and he was right when he supported it. Mr. MCGOVERN. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. WOODALL. I yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts. Mr. MCGOVERN. I would just say that the bill has changed over the years, and I voted against it in committee. I guess the question is: If we are all in agreement that we want to protect women and children, what was the harm in making in order an amendment that would have done that? It was perfectly germane, and the Rules Committee decided not to make it in order. I think that is a question that the gentleman hasn’t answered. I appreciate that all the people on the Agriculture Committee are experts, but you know what? There are other people who know a lot about science, pesticides, and agriculture who were not on the committee. And just because a committee takes action—I mean, if that is the new rule now: if you are on the committee, you can’t offer amendments. Well, that is an unfortunate new approach that the Republicans are taking. Mr. WOODALL. Reclaiming my time, I will tell my friend two things that he already knows. Number one is we do accept amendments from the entire Congress. That is the purpose of the Rules Committee being in existence, and we have added two amendments to this bill for consideration. When the gentleman supported it in the 112th Congress, we considered no other amendments. That is a change this time. We are going to do that. When it passed the last time we did a rule, no one offered any amendments. This is a change from that time. When we passed it in the Agriculture bill, no one offered any amendments. So it is a change this time. We absolutely are opening up the process more and more with every time the House considers this bill. But I would also tell my friend something that we are going to have to grapple with as an institution, and that is that I don’t need a Rules Committee if what we are going to do is make every amendment that comes to this institution in order. The only reason we have a Rules Committee is to pick and choose. The only reason we have a Rules Committee is to set up a timetable on which we can debate and consider things in a reasonable manner. The only reason we have a Rules Committee is because we are not operating under unanimous consent as our friends in the Senate do, though we absolutely could. And I would refer him to my friend, DANIEL WEBSTER , who has some marvelous ideas about how we might do that. But, Mr. Speaker, I think it is legitimate for folks back home to wonder what is going on in that United States House. They passed it in a bipartisan way once. They passed it in a bipartisan way twice. They passed it in a bipartisan way three times, and here it is on the floor today, and it is as if the sky is falling and going to open up and swallow everything that is good and decent about this land. Why is that, Mr. Speaker? Why is that the conversation we are having today instead of the one we had not once, not twice, but three times about how we could use this legislation to improve the lives of citizens across this country? Perhaps that is just the environment we are in. Perhaps that is just the cards we have been dealt in politics across America today, Mr. Speaker, but we have a chance together as an institution to stand up and say it does not have to be that way. We have a chance together to stand up and say that we can do better than those partisan shenanigans. We can get together on things that are going to make a difference, and the first opportunity you are going to have after this speech, Mr. Speaker, to do that, is in supporting the rule for this bill. The first opportunity we are going to have to do that is in supporting this rule, and then supporting the underlying legislation and sending it back to the Senate one more time. It is the right thing to do, Mr. Speaker, and we have the opportunity to do that together. Mr. Speaker, I urge strong support for the rule and the underlying bill. The material previously referred to by Mr. MCGOVERN is as follows: 
RESTRICTIONS ON CONSIDERATION OF LEGISLA TION THAT WOULD BREAK DONALD TRUMP ’S 
THEVOTE ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION : WHAT ITREALLY MEANS  This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the House of Representatives (VI, 308–311), describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.’’ To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition’’ in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (RIllinois) said: ‘‘The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.’’ The Republican majority may say ‘‘the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.’’ But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here’s how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ‘‘Although it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.’’ In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled ‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ‘‘Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon.’’ Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Republican majority’s agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. 
Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I have a parliamentary inquiry. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Massachusetts will state his parliamentary inquiry. Mr. MCGOVERN. Again, hearing the gentleman say that we all want to protect the lives of pregnant women and children, I just want to ask as an inquiry: Is the amendment by EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON that prohibits the discharge of toxins in such circumstances where they would be harmful to pregnant women, or could harm fetal, or early childhood development, which is perfectly germane, is that made in order? Is that part of the rule? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is free to consult the Rules Committee report. Mr. MCGOVERN. Well, I don’t think it is. I would just simply say to the gentleman, if he wants more cooperation, then maybe we ought to open the process up, and actually listen to what the Democrats have to say too. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous question. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XX, the Chair will reduce to 5 minutes the minimum time for any electronic vote on the question of adoption of the resolution. The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were—yeas 229, nays 191, not voting 10, as follows:

THE BUDGET MESSAGE OF THE PRESIDENT—MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (H. DOC. NO. 115–3) The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky) laid before the House the following message from the President of the United States; which was read and, together with the accompanying papers, referred to the Committee on Appropriations and ordered to be printed: To the Congress of the United States: On February 28, I spoke to a joint session of the Congress about what we need to do to begin a new chapter of American Greatness. I asked the Nation to look forward nine years and imagine the wonders we could achieve by America’s 250th anniversary of our Independence if we set free the dreams of our people by removing the barriers holding back our economic growth. This Budget’s defining ambition is to unleash the dreams of the American people. This requires laying a new foundation for American Greatness. Through streamlined Government, we will drive an economic boom that 
raises incomes and expands job opportunities for all Americans. Faster economic growth, coupled with fiscal restraint, will enable us to fully fund our national priorities, balance our budget, and start to pay down our national debt. Our moral commitment to replacing our current economic stagnation with faster economic growth rests on the following eight pillars of reform: Health Reform. We need to enable Americans to buy the healthcare they need at a price they can afford. To this end, we must repeal Obamacare and its burdensome regulations and mandates, and replace it with a framework that restores choice and competition. This will lower the cost of care so that more Americans can get the medical attention they need. Additionally, Medicaid, which inadequately serves enrollees and taxpayers, must be reformed to allow States to manage their own programs, with continued financial support from the Federal Government. Tax Reform and Simplification. We must reduce the tax burden on American workers and businesses, so that we can maximize incomes and economic growth. We must also simplify our tax system, so that individuals and businesses do not waste countless hours and resources simply paying their taxes. Immigration Reform. We must reform immigration policy so that it serves our national interest. We will adopt commonsense proposals that protect American workers, reduce burdens on taxpayers and public resources, and focus Federal funds on underserved and disadvantaged citizens. Reductions in Federal Spending. We must scrutinize every dollar the Federal Government spends. Just as families decide how to manage limited budgets, we must ensure the Federal Government spends precious taxpayer dollars only on our highest national priorities, and always in the most efficient, effective manner. Regulatory Rollback. We must eliminate every outdated, unnecessary, or ineffective Federal regulation, and move aggressively to build regulatory frameworks that stimulate—rather than stagnate—job creation. Even for those regulations we must leave in place, we must strike every provision that is counterproductive, ineffective, or outdated. American Energy Development. We must increase development of America’s energy resources, strengthening our national security, lowering the price of electricity and transportation fuels, and driving down the cost of consumer goods so that every American individual and business has more money to save and invest. A consistent, longterm supply of lowercost American energy brings with it a much larger economy, more jobs, and greater security for the American people. Welfare Reform. We must reform our welfare system so that it does not discourage ablebodied adults from working, which takes away scarce resources from those in real need. Work must be the center of our social policy. Education Reform. We need to return decisions regarding education back to the State and local levels, while advancing opportunities for parents and students to choose, from all available options, the school that best fits their needs to learn and succeed. To unleash the power of American work and creativity—and drive opportunity and faster economic growth—we must reprioritize Federal spending so that it advances the safety and security of the American people. This Budget, therefore, includes $639 billion for the Department of Defense— a $52 billion increase from the 2017 annualized continuing resolution level. This increase will be offset by targeted reductions elsewhere. This defense funding is vital to rebuilding, modernizing, and preparing our Armed Forces for the future so that our military remains the world’s preeminent fighting force and we can continue to ensure peace through strength. This Budget also increases funding to take care of our great veterans, who have served their country with such honor and distinction. The Budget also meets the need to materially increase funding for border security, immigration enforcement, and law enforcement at the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice. These funding increases will provide additional resources for a southern border wall, expanded detention capacity, and initiatives to reduce violent crime, as well as more immigration judges, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, and Border Patrol agents. The Budget also invests significant resources in efforts to combat opioid abuse. In these dangerous times, our increased attention to public safety and national security sends a clear message to the world—a message of American strength and resolve. It follows through on my promise to focus on keeping Americans safe, keeping terrorists out of our Nation, and putting violent offenders behind bars. As this Budget returns us to economic prosperity, it will also allow us to fund additional priorities, including infrastructure, student loan reform, and initiatives to help working families such as paid parental leave. We will champion the hardworking taxpayers who have been ignored for too long. Once we end our economic stagnation and return to robust growth, so many of our aspirations will be within reach. It is now up to the Congress to act. I pledge my full cooperation in ending the economic malaise that has, for too long, crippled the dreams of our people. The time for small thinking is over. As we look forward to our 250th year, I am calling upon all Members of Congress to join me in striving to do big and bold and daring things for our Nation. We have it in our power to set free the dreams of our people. Let us begin. DONALD J. T RUMP .THEWHITE HOUSE , May 23, 2017. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Juvenile Justice Reform Act of 2017. Mr. Speaker, I believe in opportunity. I believe that, given tools, anyone can change their situation for the better. Too often atrisk youth end up in the schooltoprison pipeline. When designed effectively, juvenile justice programs can help reset a troubled youth’s path to successful adulthood. That is why I support the Juvenile Justice Reform Act of 2017. This legislation will help youth in the juvenile justice system get on the right path by focusing programs on approaches that work using evidencebased strategies and proven track records. It strengthens accountability and oversight to deliver positive outcomes. It also provides communities with greater flexibility to deliver services that meet the specific needs of youth in their communities. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to cosponsor this legislation to help youth break from their troubled pasts and turn their lives around and become an asset in their communities. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation. b1400 Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. WILSON ), a strong supporter of atrisk youth. Ms. WILSON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased that the House today will vote to pass a bipartisan reauthorization of H.R. 1809, the Juvenile Justice Reform Act. I strongly believe that this measure will not only help our Nation’s atrisk youth, but it will also vastly improve the juvenile justice system in each State. One area I was particularly interested in addressing in this bill is finding ways in which Statebased practices that have been developed to end the schooltoprison pipeline can be expanded. I strongly believe that youth based mentoring programs are key to achieving this goal. For that reason, I added language to the bill that expands the definition of juvenile delinquency programs to include youth mentoring programs so those programs will have greater access to Federal grant funding. One of my life’s missions has been to help build a permanent roadblock on the destructive and demoralizing path that has entrapped so many boys and young men of color and other atrisk youth. In fact, there are 50 ninth grade boys from the 5000 Role Models of Excellence Project visiting Washington today. If you see them in their red ties, give them a hug and tell them you love them. My experience as a teacher and principal has taught me the very real benefits of reaching children as early as possible and how, with proper encouragement, support, and resources, young lives can be transformed so that they will make positive and productive choices. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues on the Committee on Education and the Workforce for working very closely together in a bipartisan manner to vote to reauthorize the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act. I think we can all agree that this bill’s passage will go a long way toward assisting atrisk youth by giving them a second chance at success as well as opportunities to be able to learn from their mistakes and move beyond those mistakes to get an education, build a successful career, and contribute to society. I especially commend Chairman FOXXand Ranking Member S COTT, who I know care so much about this issue. I also applaud Representative JASON  LEWIS of Minnesota for his spirit. I encourage a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this bill. Mr. LEWIS of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. CA´RDENAS ), who has been working on juvenile justice issues since he was in the California Legislature and Los Angeles City Council. Mr. CA´RDENAS. Mr. Speaker, I also want to take the opportunity to thank my colleague for all of his diligence and incredible effort to make sure that we are here today with the successful passage of this important legislation. The bill we are considering today, the Juvenile Justice Reform Act of 2017, is a bill that puts Congress back in the driver’s seat of evidencebased reform of our Nation’s juvenile justice system. For far too long, Congress has failed to reauthorize the landmark Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act passed in 1974. The most important Federal juvenile justice statute has been expired for almost a decade. I came to Congress to effect change at a national level and to serve the people of my district and all of the people across this great country. Congress has fallen behind the leadership and the progress of Democratic and Republican States alike and cities, as well, across the Nation who have had to take the lead without us. Passing this bill is a step in the right direction and will demonstrate to States and cities across this great country that Congress is listening and acting. This bill addresses many of the issues that I have been working on in my career as a State legislator, as a city councilman, and now as a Federal elected public servant. For instance, it helps cities and local organizations fund communitybased gang prevention and intervention programs. When I was on the Los Angeles City Council, I made sure that organizations receiving taxpayer dollars from our city were actually achieving the results that they had promised. I am pleased that this bill includes a strong emphasis on research and science and making sure that evidencebased programs are prioritized. It ensures that we are supporting programs and organizations that work, which will save the taxpayers billions of dollars in the short run, hundreds of billions of dollars in the long run, and also make our communities much, much safer. This bill supports programs that ensure youth have access to appropriate legal representation and programs to expand access. This bill supports programs designed to educate kids and their families about how they can go about sealing and expunging their juvenile records and to help them do that along the way. This bill supports programs focused on girls in the juvenile justice system. Equally important, this bill makes sure that all ethnicity is recorded so we can get a better understanding of who is in our juvenile justice system and address any disparities if we find them. This bill will put us on a path to ensuring kids are not detained for an offense that would not be a crime if committed as an adult, such as skipping school or running away from home. It is high time we reauthorize the JJDPA, and I hope my colleagues in the House and Senate can come together to advance this critical update to our juvenile justice laws. It is our responsibility to lead. I urge my colleagues to be leaders by voting for the Juvenile Justice Reform Act of 2017. Once again, it is long, long overdue. Mr. LEWIS of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. CURBELO ). 
Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman LEWIS for his work on this important legislation. I also thank the ranking member, Mr. SCOTT, whom I had the pleasure of working with on this same cause last year. This year, of course, I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bill. As a former member of the Committee on Education and the Workforce, this was and remains one of my priorities, as I believe that this reauthorization can help us achieve our antipoverty goals here in the U.S. House. The Juvenile Justice Reform Act of 2017 will help set kids up for success that is long term, so they are not caught up in a system that puts them on a path where failure is inevitable. This bill includes reforms that will help juveniles transition out of the system through communitybased services and education. It also ensures that stakeholders can offer their expertise in order to best serve this population while also supporting prevention services to keep kids on the right track. Another important thing to note is that this bill prioritizes evidencebased strategies to reduce juvenile delinquency, directing necessary resources to what actually works. Everyone deserves the chance to improve their circumstances. Many kids who end up in the juvenile justice system are the most vulnerable in our communities. These kids and the stakeholders and policymakers who support them need the flexibility and tools to effectively serve them. I believe this legislation is a step in the right direction, and I encourage all of my colleagues to vote in favor of it. I appreciate the work that the Committee on Education and the Workforce has done to help atrisk youth get on a path to a brighter future. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I thank, again, the gentleman from Minnesota for his leadership. I urge my colleagues to support the bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. LEWIS of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Ensuring kids experiencing difficult life circumstances avoid a life of crime is a collaborative effort. I find it a privilege to stand with parents, teachers, and law enforcement officers to ensure atrisk youth are able to get back on track and grow into productive members of society. The Juvenile Justice Reform Act of 2017 makes commonsense reforms that move us in a positive direction by providing support to kids who need help the most. I am pleased to help lead this bipartisan effort. I thank my colleague, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT) for the work he has done on this legislation. By working together here in Congress, we can ensure young people have the opportunities they need to turn their lives around and earn a lifetime of success. I thank my colleagues for their support of H.R. 1809. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. LEWIS) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1809, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
IMPROVING SUPPORT FOR MISSING AND EXPLOITED CHILDREN ACT OF 2017 Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1808) to amend and improve the Missing Children’s Assistance Act, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1808 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Improving Support for Missing and Exploited Children Act of 2017’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. GUTHRIE ) and the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. COURT NEY) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 1808. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Kentucky? There was no objection. Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1808, the Improving Support for Missing and Exploited Children Act of 2017. Mr. Speaker, as a father, I cannot imagine the horror moms and dads in this country experience when they discover one of their children has been taken, abused, or exploited. Sadly, that is a nightmare for hundreds of thousands of parents in this country. Last year alone, there were more than 465,000 reports of missing children, and those are just the cases that were reported. The wellbeing of America’s children has long been a national priority. In 1984, Congress established the Missing and Exploited Children’s Program to help coordinate State and local efforts to recover children who are missing and better protect and support kids who are victims of abuse and exploitation. As part of that program, we provide a grant that is used to support the work of the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, known as NCMEC. For more than 30 years, NCMEC has worked to provide help to people across the country, partnering with parents, law enforcement, nonprofits, and other public and private entities in an effort to recover, protect, and support missing and exploited children and their families. We are here today to ensure this supportive work continues. H.R. 1808 updates and streamlines the Missing Children’s Assistance Act, making positive changes that will enable us to strengthen our efforts. This includes reforms that encourage and increase public awareness of new and innovative ways to recover and protect missing and exploited children. The bill better protects the growing number of children who go missing from State care or are victims of sex trafficking, while also providing transparency surrounding recovery and prevention efforts. In recent years, some of the advances in technology have, unfortunately, made it easier for kids to be victimized and exploited. H.R. 1808 ensures the law aimed at recovering and protecting exploited children is able to effectively identify and locate today’s abductors and criminal offenders, many of whom are turning to more modern techniques to commit their disturbing crimes. The Improving Support for Missing and Exploited Children Act of 2017 delivers important reforms that will provide the tools needed to effectively serve vulnerable youth, help bring perpetrators to justice, and ensure taxpayer dollars are spent responsibly. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1808. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in strong support of H.R. 1808 to amend and improve the Missing Children’s Assistance Act. Mr. Speaker, again, it is an honor to stand with my friend, Mr. GUTHRIE , in bipartisan support of this legislation which, again, makes some important changes to the existing law for the Center for Missing & Exploited Children, as my friend said, a program which was created in 1984. Sadly, it has not finished its mission. Again, the FBI reports every year there are about 460,000 reports of missing children, and despite the best efforts of programs which NCMEC has operated over the many years, which include hotlines and public information campaigns, again, this is still a scourge which afflicts many families all across the country in Republican, Democratic, rural, suburban, and urban areas. Again, this bill will basically update and modernize the language of the act 
to recognize that there are new forms of threats and risks to minor children, such as human trafficking and online predators. b1415 So it does three essential things: Number one, it incorporates new terminology to align the law with these new threats, which I mentioned above, and strengthens protections for children at risk. Number two, it clarifies that NCMEC is a nonprofit entity, which is an issue that has been ensnared in the courts. And, again, Congress’ passage and enactment of this bill will clarify this critical issue. And, lastly, it clarifies that NCMEC is a resource that provides technical assistance not just to law enforcement, but to families, community groups, schools, and the public at large. Mr. Speaker, this last aspect of the bill is critically important. Last year, Congress passed Public Law 114–184, which President Obama signed into law, the Recovering Missing Children’s Act. It was a measure which I cosponsored with Mr. PAULSEN from Minnesota. This bill actually gave State and local police another tool in terms of recovering missing children. Incredibly, the Tax Code prevented State and local law enforcement from getting access to tax returns from adults who actually had abducted children. So, incredibly, those adults were claiming these children, who were in their illegal custody, as a tax credit and a tax exemption, but State and local officials were barred by privacy provisions in the IRS code from actually accessing that information. So, on the one hand, you had one arm of government out looking for children and you had another arm of government who knew exactly where they were based on the tax returns which were filed. Again, NCMEC is in the process of trying to disseminate this new tool, which an audit of the IRS demonstrated that there are roughly 2,000 tax returns a year where adult individuals are actually claiming children as a tax deduction, obviously, with their residence and identity included. So, again, that is just another example of why we need to update and modernize the law. I would just indicate on a personal level, my wife, Audrey, is a pediatric nurse practitioner. She works at the Children’s Medical Center in Hartford, Connecticut. She is involved in a specialty clinic that helps children of sex abuse and human trafficking. She said that NCMEC is a frequent flier in their office. In the really important work that she and her colleagues do, they constantly use NCMEC as a way of trying to assist law enforcement in terms of helping children who are in these situations of human trafficking and who have been victims of online use of images, which is about as low a depraved activity that is out there right now. So, again, the work of this center, I can attest to from a personal level, is extremely important. This legislation will update, modernize, and give tools to make sure that all of the good guys out there—the local State police and the folks in the healthcare sector—can really do everything they can to help families in this really terrible, horrific situation. So, again, I applaud my colleague from Kentucky for his great work, as well as Chairwoman FOXXand Ranking Member SCOTT for bringing this legislation forward. It passed unanimously in committee. Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge all of my colleagues in the House to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I echo my support, and I enjoy working with my friend, the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. COURTNEY ). Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. WALBERG ), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions. Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the opportunity to speak on this issue. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1808, the Improving Support for Missing and Exploited Children Act of 2017. For more than 30 years, the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, or NCMEC, has operated a unique publicprivate partnership in order to build a national response to crimes affecting those we cherish most: our children. I am grateful that the bill maintains language that I supported, which grants NCMEC the authority to provide technical assistance to law enforcement agencies and first responders in identifying and recovering victims of child sex trafficking. During the committee’s hearing in March, we heard from NCMEC’s director on how their ability to provide technical assistance has allowed them to work in tandem with law enforcement to recover numerous child sex trafficking victims. Mr. Speaker, we all look forward to the day when no children are ever taken and abused, and this bill helps ensure NCMEC has the tools to get us one step closer to that goal. I appreciate the bipartisan effort on this, and I urge all my colleagues to support this important legislation. Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON ), a city which has been really challenged with this issue. I know she has been doing great work and has very powerful thoughts and arguments to make today regarding this legislation. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for yielding me this time, and I am pleased to support this bipartisan bill, the Improving Support for Missing and Exploited Children Act. I support it because it does exactly what its title says. It fills the gaps in our prior legislation on missing and exploited children. We need to look at such legislation very often because of what we are learning about missing and exploited children. There are many parts of this bill I support, but I particularly support a provision that we didn’t have nearly as much knowledge of during the passage of the last bill: to improve the protection of children in State care. These are often foster children or children without parents. These are the children who may be most susceptible to trafficking and other exploitation. I certainly would appreciate the efforts of the committee in making sure that provisions of my bill that, I believe, got to you too late, are included in the final House and Senate bill because they are entirely consistent with the bill on the floor today. They come from recent experience of the District of Columbia. The D.C. police began to do something, which I urge all of you to do, and that is to use social media to let people know when there are missing children. It unnerved residents of the District of Columbia until they recognized that the city didn’t have any more missing children than any other jurisdiction. Still, I support what the District did in using social media. Still, we simply don’t know enough. My provisions would have the government collect subsets of data that it does not collect today. For example, we found in the District that there were more missing girls of color than boys. We ought to have known that from national statistics. You don’t know it because there are no national statistics on the subsets of children. My bill would collect and publish demographic characteristics that simply are not published today on race, gender, sexual orientation, and gender identity. If you think of those categories, you will understand why these may be the children in particular need of protection. In addition, there is no current comprehensive count of missing children in the United States. So, we need more work on this bill. We need to break down to these subsets so that jurisdictions, like my own, will know where to focus when we are focusing on missing children. Again, I am pleased that the District turned out not to have any more missing children than the average jurisdiction, but I am also pleased that it got a rise out of people who never would have paid attention to this issue until the police department decided to go on social media. We want to make sure that we cover all of our children and that we do what this bill does. What are the gaps? Where do we need to fill in? Mr. Speaker, this is the first bill on missing children in a number of years. We must make sure no children are left behind. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE), the chairman of the Veterans’ Affairs Committee, and a member of the Education and the Workforce Committee. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1808, the Improving Support for Missing and Exploited Children Act, which improves the Missing Children’s Assistance Act. Mr. Speaker, this Thursday is National Missing Children’s Day. I can’t imagine the pain and suffering that occurs when a child goes missing. I am a proud cosponsor of this legislation, and I am proud of the Committee on Education and the Workforce for its work on this important issue. This legislation strengthens existing efforts to help recover missing children and prevents more children from being victims of abuse and exploitation. This bill also includes a provision to incorporate developing technologies related to the reporting of child exploitation. This provision was a result of an idea shared by a constituent of mine, Michael Reed. His wife was a victim of abuse as a child, and he has devoted his life to making sure other children have a voice and the ability to report the abuse that they are experiencing. I am committed to ensuring that Congress is working to protect these children. Mr. Speaker, I thank both sides of the aisle on the Education and the Workforce Committee, and I encourage all of my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT), the ranking member of the Education and the Workforce Committee, and a strong proponent of this legislation. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1808, the Improving Support for Missing and Exploited Children Act. This bill will strengthen recovery and prevention efforts of missing and exploited children by renewing and updating support for the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, or NCMEC. The terror experienced by parents of a missing child is unfathomable. Both the child and the parents experience pain, trauma, fear, and uncertainty. This is why affected families need the full support of law enforcement, schools, businesses, and other entities that may be able to assist in locating and recovering missing or exploited children. In 2013, Congress reauthorized the Missing Children’s Assistance Act and updated the role of NCMEC. The organization was required, at that time, to coordinate with the Interagency Council on Homelessness in order to address the high number of sex trafficking victims who were homeless youth. Now, in 2017, Congress is including several additional improvements. As this bill heads to the Senate, I will work with my colleagues in both Chambers to improve the reporting of characteristics of children trafficked as it relates to the Office of Juvenile Justice’s triennial incidence of missing children study. Mr. Speaker, despite the best efforts of NCMEC, more than 10,000 children go missing each year, and scores of children are forced into sexual exploitation and trafficking. I am hopeful that the enactment of these initiatives will assist in the efforts to end exploitation and trafficking. I am also hopeful that Congress will empower the work of NCMEC by appropriate funding in fiscal year 2018 and above. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill. Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. MITCHELL ), my friend and a member of the Education and the Workforce Committee. Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Improving Support for Missing and Exploited Children Act. My wife and I have six children. Our youngest is just 7 years old. We would do anything to protect them. I can’t even imagine the pain of having a child go missing, or to learn that they have been hurt or abused in any manner. Tragically, this is a reality for far too many children and too many families in America. Last year, there were more than 465,000 reports of missing children in the United States. To put that number in perspective, about 700,000 people live in Michigan’s 10th Congressional District, my home. Even one child going missing or being abused is too many. We must recognize the seriousness of this problem and we must do everything we can to protect our children. This important bill will assist NCMEC in locating missing children and in identifying abductors. It will help prevent children from becoming the victims of exploitation online and increase awareness about how to recover missing children. Mr. Speaker, today we come together to support America’s children. I am proud to be a sponsor of this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. ADAMS ), an outstanding member of the Education and the Workforce Committee. Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding. I proudly stand today in support of H.R. 1808, the Improving Support for Missing and Exploited Children Act. This bipartisan legislation reflects both Democrats’ and Republicans’ desire to protect and care for our greatest resource: our children. In my home State of North Carolina, the trafficking of young women has become an epidemic. There were 181 human trafficking cases reported in North Carolina in 2016, and Charlotte was home to more of them than anywhere else. b1430 That figure gave us the dishonor of being ranked among the top 10 States in the Nation in the number of trafficking reports, and that doesn’t even account for those children who have not yet been identified as victims of this shameful practice. In North Carolina, lawmakers have sponsored efforts to establish pilot programs to help victims and train law enforcement to recognize the signs of trafficking. It is time Congress does its part and passes H.R. 1808 to support States in their efforts. This bill would improve efforts by both law enforcement and the general public to combat trafficking, and it would enhance the identification and location of missing children and their abductors. It would protect children from being victims to online predators and keep a promise that was made 33 years ago, when Congress first passed the Missing Children’s Assistance Act and we vowed to assist the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children in protecting and recovering our missing and vulnerable youth. I am a parent, I am a grandparent, Mr. Speaker, and I am a concerned member of my community; and my district and my State have been torn apart by human trafficking. This is an opportunity for us to come together as Americans and support an initiative that could save lives. I urge my colleagues to pass H.R. 1808 and prove that we can all put politics aside when it comes to protecting our children. Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. FOXX), the distinguished chairwoman of the Education and the Workforce Committee. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Mr. GUTHRIE , for his great work on handling this bill today and on the bill itself. No child should live in fear, Mr. Speaker, and yet every year hundreds of thousands of children across the country are abducted, abused, or exploited. The safety of America’s children has long been a national priority. That is why I stand here today in strong support of H.R. 1808, the Improving Support for Missing and Exploited Children Act. In 1984, Congress passed the Missing Children’s Assistance Act and established a grant to enhance our country’s efforts to find missing children and prevent child exploitation. For more than 30 years, the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, also known as NCMEC, has used the grant to coordinate a national response to crises and crimes affecting America’s most vulnerable children. Through unique publicprivate partnerships, NCMEC works with families, 
law enforcement, schools, community leaders, and nonprofits in its efforts to find children who are missing and protect youth who are victims of sexual exploitation. The reforms in the Improving Support for Missing and Exploited Children Act will ensure the vital work of recovering and supporting vulnerable youth is able to continue, reuniting more families with their loved ones and helping victims receive the support they desperately need. This is a bill that delivers the reforms needed to save lives. I am also proud to say it is a bill with strong bipartisan support. At the opening of NCMEC, former President Ronald Reagan said: ‘‘No single sector of our Nation can solve the problem of missing and exploited children alone. But by working together, pooling our resources, and building on our strengths, we can accomplish great things.’’ ‘‘Together we can turn the tide on these hateful crimes. . . .’’ Together we can turn the tide. The work our colleagues, Representatives GUTHRIE and C OURTNEY , have done to get this important bill to the House floor demonstrates the type of collaboration President Reagan spoke of on that day at the opening of the NCMEC. And the Improving Support for Missing and Exploited Children Act isn’t the only bill we have been able to reach across the aisle on and deliver reforms that will help vulnerable youth. Working together, we are also advancing positive bipartisan solutions in H.R. 1809, the Juvenile Justice Reform Act of 2017. This bill aims at assisting a different kind of vulnerable youth, ensuring kids who find themselves in the juvenile justice system have an opportunity to turn their lives around and achieve success. Every child deserves an opportunity to make a change for the better, if that child has made a mistake. By working together to develop the Juvenile Justice Reform Act of 2017, my colleagues, Representatives LEWIS and S COTT, have put forward a bill that will help ensure atrisk youth are afforded an opportunity to do just that. Both of these bills renew the commitment we have made to help and protect our Nation’s most vulnerable children. All of these reforms will make a real difference in the lives of countless children, young adults, parents, and families across the country. I am proud of the bipartisan work we have been able to accomplish. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. GUTHRIE. I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30 seconds. Ms. FOXX. I want to thank Representative SCOTT, as well as Representatives LEWIS, G UTHRIE , and COURTNEY for their leadership on these issues. I urge our fellow colleagues to support the Improving Support for Missing and Exploited Children Act. Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. PAULSEN), a good friend of mine who, in his work on the Ways and Means Committee, has been focused on and dedicated to this issue. Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his work on this on a bipartisan basis with Mr. COURTNEY . I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1808, the Improving Support for Missing and Exploited Children Act. This important initiative, it builds on the bipartisan work we have already accomplished to combat sex trafficking and child exploitation. Since its creation in 1984, the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children has worked tirelessly to protect children from being exploited, to reunite missing children with their families, and to provide resources and training to our law enforcement community to help assist in this effort. This legislation today will assist the Center in strengthening its prevention and its recovery programs. One of those programs is the CyberTipline which, since being launched in 1998, has received 12.7 million reports of suspected child sexual exploitation. It is programs like this, Mr. Speaker, that go a long way to helping us save lives and put an end to sexual exploitation and trafficking of children. I encourage all of my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill. Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. In summary, we have heard again a very broadbased bipartisan chorus of voices in support of this legislation. Again, like in committee, hopefully, all of us will stand together to support this really important update to making sure that families get all the help, and law enforcement get all the help, that they need to eliminate the scourge of this problem. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I had the opportunity to visit the Center, and the building that I got to go visit was full of men and women who show up every day, who do exceptional work dealing with the disturbing issues, and so my hat is off to them. They deal with stuff that is just unimaginable to most of us, and they do it in a way that is dignified and in a way that is well worthy of the effort that we are giving them to give more transparency and empower them to help more. I really appreciate working with my friend, Mr. COURTNEY . H.R. 1808 is a bipartisan proposal, and I urge my colleagues to support the Improving Support for Missing and Exploited Children Act of 2017. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. GUTHRIE ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1808, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. f 
VETERANS APPEALS IMPROVEMENT AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2017 Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2288) to amend title 38, United States Code, to reform the rights and processes relating to appeals of decisions regarding claims for benefits under the laws administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2288 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017’’. 
On the first business day of each month the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall publish on an internet website of the Department of Veterans Affairs the following: 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. WALZ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee. 
Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their remarks and to insert extraneous material in the RECORD on H.R. 2288, as amended. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Tennessee? There was no objection. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues to support H.R. 2288, as amended. First, I want to thank the Disabilities Assistance and Memorial Affairs Subcommittee Chairman BOST and Ranking Member ESTYfor their hard work in bringing H.R. 2288 to the floor. I also want to thank every member of the Veterans’ Affairs Committee, both Republican and Democrat, who all are original cosponsors of this bill. The committee has been working on overhauling the VA’s appeals process, which was established back in 1933. The problem is that the current system is slow, cumbersome, frustrating, and full of bureaucratic red tape. As a result, there are currently 470,000 veterans, many of whom may have been injured in the line of duty, who are waiting for a decision on their appeal. Many of these folks have been waiting for more than 5 years, and veterans are filing more appeals every day. Last year, VA Deputy Secretary Sloan Gibson testified that if Congress doesn’t pass reform soon, by 2027, veterans may have to wait as long as 10 years to get a decision on their appeal. Think about that. In 2027, men and women who served our Nation may have to wait a decade to get a decision on their appeal. These veterans have bills to pay and families to support. Even worse, they may need medical treatments that they can’t get from the VA because their appeal hasn’t been decided. Mr. Speaker, one of the dearest friends I have had in my life died a little over 2 years ago, waiting on a decision on an appeal. H.R. 2288 would help streamline the VA’s appeals process, while giving veterans more options and protecting their due process rights. This legislation includes a compromise agreement that was reached between VA and the veterans service organizations which passed the House last Congress as part of H.R. 5620. We have added a few improvements since last year. For example, we have expanded the bill to allow some veterans who are currently having pending appeals to opt in to the new system. I really believe that the changes in this bill will make a difference and help expedite the process so that veterans can get a decision on their appeal and then get on with their lives. I am going to pull out all the stops to get this bill on the President’s desk as soon as possible. We are talking with our colleagues in the Senate, including Chairman ISAKSON , Ranking Member TESTER , and Senator B LUMENTHAL , to resolve a few minor differences between the House version and the Senate version. The sooner we get this bill passed, the sooner our Nation’s veterans will be able to get their decisions on appeal in a timely manner. Veterans deserve no less. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support H.R. 2288, as amended, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the manager’s amendment to H.R. 2288, the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017. This has truly proven to be a oncein ageneration opportunity to reform the disability claims process for the benefit of our Nation’s veterans. I want to specifically thank Chairman ROEfor bringing this bill to the floor today and for ensuring that the entire process that got us here was open, fair, bipartisan, and followed regular order. It is gratefully appreciated, and I think we end up with a good piece of legislation because of his leadership. I also want to recognize the efforts of our colleagues, the chairman of the Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs Subcommittee, Mr. BOST. He has been an incredible addition to the VA committee and dug his heels in on this one and got us this far, so I thank him; and to his counterpart on our side of the aisle, Ranking Member ESTY, for exceptional work that they have done together to get this bill to the floor. I would also like to thank our veterans service organizations. This is how I think the American people think legislation should be brought; on issues at hand, experts are brought in, Representatives talk. The expertise that was brought by the VSOs helped us work out some of the kinks. It is not perfect, but the coalition got us to a point where I think many of us are comfortable moving forward. The bill is complicated. To those who still have concerns in the process, let us know. There is still work to be done. It is still working in the Senate, but there is an openness that has been expressed through the entire process. Secretary Shulkin and the VA leadership have been vital in this effort. They helped pull the stakeholders together, providing the technical expertise to help us understand what it takes over the past several years. I want to recognize our former colleague on the committee, DINATITUS. She is going to be speaking a little bit later, but I think what is so important on veterans issues, members come and go from the committee, but their commitment to getting this right stays. And her tenaciousness in the 114th Congress laid the groundwork for this. So in short, Mr. Speaker, as you heard the chairman say, there are 470,000 veterans. Each one of them is an individual. Each one of them is someone’s friend, father, mother, sister, brother. It is time we peel back the layers of the complicated rules governing the process, modernize it with new technology, and get the benefits delivered in a timely manner to those who have earned them. I support the manager’s amendment to H.R. 2288 and encourage all my colleagues to do the same. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. b1445 Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST), chairman of the DAMA Subcommittee. Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bipartisan legislation, H.R. 2288, the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017, as amended. The legislation is a product of hard work between the Department of Veterans Affairs, veterans service organizations, committee staff, and committee members. This bill gives veterans more options when pursuing the appeals claim by creating three pathways or lanes: Lane one allows for the veteran to request that a new individual review their case without a hearing, which will allow a faster response time from the VA on their appeal; lane two allows a veteran to request a hearing; and lane three sends the appeal directly to the Board of Veterans Appeals. These three lanes, working together, will speed up the process for our Nation’s veterans and ensure that the appeals system works for them. An important compromise in this legislation also allows for veterans to keep the original effective date of their claim as long as they filed the necessary paperwork within 1 year of a VA’s decision. This is another way to ensure that the appeals system is working for the veterans. It is important that we do not leave any veteran behind. My colleagues and I have worked to ensure that some of the more than 470,000 veterans with a current appeal in the system will have the opportunity at certain points to opt into the new system. This will help the veterans who have been waiting for years to hear from the VA. This bill also ensures transparency in the VA implementation. This new system, by requiring rigorous reports from the Department, ensures that all veterans are treated fairly. In closing, I especially want to recognize and thank the Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs ranking member, Ms. ESTY, for her hard work and help in crafting this legislation. I encourage all of my colleagues to support H.R. 2288, as amended. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. ESTY), my good friend, ranking member of the Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs Subcommittee. 
Ms. ESTY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2288, the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017, as amended. First, I want to thank our excellent chairman, Dr. ROE, and ranking member, Mr. WALZ, for their dedication and hard work. It has been a pleasure to work on this important legislation during my first term as ranking member of the Veterans Affairs’ Committee Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs Subcommittee. I want to give special thanks to my new friend, our subcommittee chairman, Mr. BOST, for his leadership on this issue and for ensuring that the legislative process was bipartisan at every turn. I want to acknowledge and thank Congresswoman DINA TITUS for her leadership on this issue, as she helped pass similar legislation that formed the basis for our work here in this Congress. Mr. Speaker, claims appeals are backing up. Veterans in Connecticut and across the country are waiting for far too long for the benefits they have earned through their hard service to this country. When a veteran asks my office for help appealing their claim, it is frustrating and embarrassing to have to explain that the process could take more than 5 years. The backlog will only get worse if we do not reform the process. Some veterans could be waiting as long as 10 years, as we have heard from Chairman ROEand from Ranking Member WALZ, if we don’t reform things now. With the new process created under this bill, if it is properly implemented, many veterans would see a clearer, definitive appeals decision in as little as a year. I have seen in Connecticut that, when an appeal is granted, it can change the way a veteran lives. But it is also proof to that veteran that their service is being honored. That is why it is so unacceptable that the current process is failing so many veterans. It forces them to navigate layers of red tape and duplicative review. The slow grinding of the appeals process chips away at our veterans’ faith that they will ever be fairly compensated for injuries that they sustained in service to our country. Our goal with this bill is to establish a new process that is simple, fair, transparent, and, wherever possible, speedy. As we have heard, there are 470,000— yes, 470,000—veterans with disability appeals pending right now, and that is something we should be able to address, Democrats and Republicans, without regard to party. We owe a faster, better appeals process not only to our veterans who have served, but to those who wear the uniform right now. Our men and women in uniform deserve to know that the benefits that they have been promised when they signed up will be there for them if, God forbid, something happens to them and they are injured in serving our country. I would like to thank all of the veterans and veterans service organizations who shared their ideas and their concerns with us as we worked hard to craft this legislation. Voices from the veterans community were invaluable as we developed this bill and will be essential as we move forward to ensure that the new process works well. I also want to thank the VA itself for having been such a good partner in this effort. It is important to remember that this is just the first step towards reforming the appeals process. If this bill is going to be successful, it will require a lot of work from our committee, from the VA, oversight by Congress, and we must take care to ensure that legacy appeals do not get lost in the process. Congress must also provide the resources necessary for the new appeals system to work well for our veterans. I want to thank, again, Chairman ROEand Ranking Member W ALZ for making reforming the appeals system a top priority of the committee for this year and for their dedication working together in a bipartisan way. I urge all of my colleagues to support this important legislation and to commit to keep working together to get the job done. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DUNN), an active member on the committee and a veteran. Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2288, the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017. This important legislation will update and streamline the bureaucratic nightmare that is the disability appeals process. This bill breaks appeals down into three lanes to expedite decisionmaking and improves the ability of veterans to offer new information about their condition. The bill requires Secretary Shulkin to provide a comprehensive plan of how he plans to implement the crucial changes which are supported by both the VFW and the American Legion. Our men and women in uniform served with the assurance that they would be well treated when they came home. They earned and they deserve timely service from their government. Instead, veterans wait years to hear from an outofdate, backlogged appeals system. Sometimes that process takes 5 years—5 years. That is an insult to their service, and it is an insult that we cannot tolerate. Our veterans fought for their country abroad. Now it is our job to ensure that they don’t have another fight when they come home. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this important legislation. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. TAKANO ), my friend and the vice ranking member of the full Committee on Veterans’ Affairs. Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I thank my ranking member, Mr. WALZ, for yielding time. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2288 the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017. Over the past 5 years, the number of pending appeals at the VA has skyrocketed by 40 percent and now sits at nearly half a million cases. The average processing time for an appeal is 3 years. Republicans and Democrats agree, the VA agrees, veterans service organizations agree, and, most importantly, veterans agree that we need to fix this broken process. I am pleased that my colleagues on the committee have come together to develop a bipartisan solution that reduces the overly complicated appeals process, shortens the time a veteran will wait for a decision, and preserves a veteran’s full length of benefits if their appeal is decided favorably. This legislation has taken a lot of time and effort. I applaud my colleagues Ms. TITUS and Mr. Miller for laying the groundwork in the last Congress, and Ms. ESTYand Mr. B OSTfor carrying this legislation into the 115th Congress. I am very, very proud of all the work done by the committee staff to bring this together, and I am grateful to the dedicated VSOs and the VA for their input. This is a great example of how we can put aside our partisan differences and make our veterans’ lives better. Mr. Speaker, I support this bill and urge all of my colleagues to vote for it. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico (Miss GONZA´LEZ COLO´N), a new member of our committee and the only representative from Puerto Rico. Miss GONZA´LEZCOLO´N of Puerto Rico. Mr. Speaker, today I must first thank Chairman ROEfor all of his leadership and work on behalf of our veterans. I also thank Representative BOSTand all of our committee members for allowing me to contribute to this effort. Today I rise to support H.R. 2288, the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act. This bill will provide timely justice to the brave Americans who gave their best in the name of democracy, freedom, and the continuing greatness of our Nation. As the sole representative of more than 93,000 registered veterans in Puerto Rico, I established a Veterans Affairs Task Force, and one of the main complaints they have is about the Veterans Administration’s and Board of Veterans Appeals’ slow processing of their claims. I believe every veterans service organization hears similar complaints. The most recent statistics reveal a 5,000 case backlog for claims originally filed by Puerto Rican veterans. One such Puerto Rican claim has gone on for over 12 years, other claims for over 5 
years. As of this date, the veterans are still waiting for the Board of Veterans Appeals’ decisions. This is not the justice system our veterans deserve. I am a proud sponsor of this bill, and this bill will provide heroic veterans a system that is adjusted to their needs. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. CORREA ), my good friend and, more importantly, a friend to all veterans, a new member of the Veterans’ Affairs Committee. Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member WALZ. Mr. Speaker, first, I want to thank Chairman ROEand Ranking Member WALZfor giving me the opportunity to share my enthusiastic support for this bill, H.R. 2288. I also want to thank Mr. BOSTand Ms. E STYfor their remarkable leadership in guiding this legislation to the floor and for taking the steps to finally fix the appeals process. I stand here today to support the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act. This legislation reforms the VA appeals process so that our veterans can begin to receive the benefits they have earned through their dedication to our country. Veterans in California and all across America, including those in my district, currently face a backlog of sometimes more than 5 years to get their benefits. This is not acceptable, and that is why I am pleased to support this bipartisan legislation. A veteran who files a disability claim for an injury that they sustained during their military service is issued a VA rating decision, which either grants or denies a claim. If a veteran disagrees with the outcome, they may appeal the VA’s decision and then wait and wait and wait. This bill will improve the process by creating a multiple appeal streams, which will accelerate the process. Our veterans who suffered injury during their time in service can now be assured that they will be one step closer to having their appeals cases reviewed and decided in a timely manner. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. COSTELLO ), a former member of our committee. b1500 Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, this bill will improve the appeals process at the Department of Veterans Affairs, which is currently operating under a significant backlog. Last session, when I served on the VA Committee, a major focus was reforming the repeals process to better serve veterans’ appeals rights. My office has assisted hundreds of veterans, many of whom have struggled with the appeals process and several of whom have struggled with getting the care they need in a timely manner. One individual my office worked with estimated the entire process, from when he first began seeking benefits until the recent favorable decision from the Board of Veterans Appeals, lasted 20 years. Mr. Speaker, it is clear a solution is needed. This legislation would set out to improve the claims process by providing veterans with three lanes—or three choices—as to how they would like to proceed with an appeal. These choices include: one, having the original evidence reviewed again; or, two, introducing new evidence and having another hearing; or, three, sending the decision directly to the Board of Veterans Appeals. The VA’s current 5year appeal wait time is simply not acceptable for our veterans. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation, which is an appropriate solution to this problem. It will streamline many claims and also enable a more efficient administrative handling of those claims. I thank the leadership of Chairman ROEand those on the Veterans’ Affairs Committee. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2288. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. TITUS), a good friend and former ranking member of the Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs Subcommittee, and someone who has worked on this almost longer than anyone in the House. Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member WALZfor his leadership, for bringing this bill, and for allowing me to stay involved even though I am no longer on the committee. Likewise, I thank Dr. ROEfor all that he has done for veterans. Mr. Speaker, I rise in very strong support of H.R. 2288, the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act. Fixing this outdated system was one of my top priorities while I served as ranking member of the VA Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs Subcommittee. When I assumed that position, much of the focus was on the VA disability claims backlog, which had ballooned, causing many veterans to wait almost 2 years just for their initial claim decision. After that backlog was addressed and reduced, the problem shifted to the appeals process, where today, as you have heard, almost 470,000 veterans are currently waiting in an overburdened and overcomplicated system that was first developed in the 1930s and last updated in the 1980s. I regularly hear from my veteran constituents who are stuck in this appeals process about the need for reform. One veteran we are helping in Las Vegas has been working since August of 2013 to have his appeal adjudicated; and another Nevada veteran who, out of desperation, came to my office, took 4 years to complete his process. So, obviously, the current system is just unacceptable. If we don’t act, it is only going to get worse. We have heard statistics that soon veterans may be waiting for more than a decade just to have their appeals adjudicated. Last year, working closely with the VA, with the committee, and with many of our partners in the VSO community, I introduced legislation to address this outdated process. I am very proud that my proposal is the basis for the legislation we are considering today. The changes that were made to that legislation are positive additions, and I appreciate the work that Chairman BOSTand Ranking Member E STYhave done to improve the bill and bring it to the floor. I encourage all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to come together to recognize, to help, to assist our veterans, and support this bill. I want us to tell our friends in the Senate: You have got to act quickly, too. We have got to get this done. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Again, I applaud all the work that was done on behalf of our veterans and those that are waiting. I thank the professional staff on both sides of the aisle for doing that. Mr. Speaker, I thank this House for proving to the American people that we can work together for a common good. We can make improvements and we can move things along as they are meant to be. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I, too, want to echo what Mr. WALZ has said. It has been a pleasure to work on this and what has been done in the previous Congress. I think this is one of the most important bills that we voted on in the Veterans’ Affairs Committee since I have been in Congress. It is the thing we hear about back home, Mr. Speaker, which is disability claims. I think this actually will speed up that process and adjudicate those claims. I, too, thank all the staff and both subcommittee chairs and ranking members for their hard work. Mr. Speaker, once again, I urge all Members to support H.R. 2288, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2288, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
VA SCHEDULING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 467) to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to ensure that each medical facility of the Department of Veterans Affairs complies with requirements relating to scheduling veterans for health care appointments, to improve the uniform application of directives of the Department, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 467 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘VA Scheduling Accountability Act’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. WALZ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee. 
Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Tennessee? There was no objection. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 467, a bill that would codify the VA’s own directives for outpatient scheduling into law. In June of 2010, the Veterans Health Administration issued VHA Directive 2010–27, VHA Outpatient Scheduling Processes and Procedures. This directive requires VHA facility directors to annually certify that their facility is in full compliance with the scheduling procedures outlined within the directive. It is important to note that this directive was issued 4 years before the scheduling scandal at the Phoenix VA broke, with no less than 40 veterans dying while being kept on secret lists, waiting for an appointment. I believe this directive was a responsible way for the VA to ensure that veterans were receiving the care that they came to the VA for and were not slipping through the cracks. Unfortunately, in May of 2013, then Deputy Under Secretary for Health at the VA waived this requirement for the VA medical facility directors to adhere to the directive. As we now know, this waiver helped cover a practice of malfeasance within scheduling departments at VA medical facilities across the Nation. As I mentioned before, in 2014, the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, with my friend, former Chairman Jeff Miller at the helm, discovered secret waiting lists at the Phoenix VA, as well as many other medical centers across the country. Had this directive still been in place, I honestly believe the scandal could have been prevented. Mr. Speaker, it is incumbent upon us to ensure that these scheduling processes do not and cannot be dismissed by VA bureaucrats ever again. I thank my good friend and former committee member, Representative JACKIE WALORSKI from Indiana, for sponsoring this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 467, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I associate myself with the comments of Chairman ROEand I support H.R. 467. I also thank the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. WALORSKI ) for crafting this. She was, and still remains, a staunch supporter of veterans, always advocating for them. She taught me much, including, I think, the definition of Hoosier. I am still a little confused on that one, but we are working on it. By holding the VA leadership accountable, we can ensure that the VA is accessible to all veterans. While the VA has made progress to shorten wait times, we cannot rest on our laurels. If one veteran’s health is compromised because she or he was unable to receive timely care, then the VA has failed in its mission. Mr. Speaker, for that reason, I ask my colleagues to stand in support of Mrs. WALORSKI ’s bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. BILIRAKIS ), the vice chair and one of the most active members of the committee. Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate Mrs. WALORSKI doing an outstanding job with this bill. The chairman and the ranking member are champions of veterans. Again, I rise today in support of H.R. 467, the VA Scheduling Accountability Act, because all veterans deserve timely access to quality health care. In 2014, the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee uncovered the use of unauthorized waiting lists at the Phoenix VA healthcare system in Phoenix, Arizona. As a result of these waiting lists, no less than 40 veterans died while waiting for care. This is unacceptable. It is heartbreaking and completely, as I said, unacceptable. These are true American heroes, and we cannot allow something like this to ever happen again. Our investigations found that noncompliance with the VA’s scheduling 
policies was a widespread and systematic problem. This bill today requires that all VA medical center directors certify each year that their facility is in compliance with the scheduling directive. If a VA medical center is found noncompliant, H.R. 476 will hold those leaders accountable. Our bill makes certain that those who fail in their duty to serve our veterans will not be receiving bonuses or awards anytime soon. Lack of oversight, lack of accountability, and lack of transparency led to the 2014 wait times crisis. The VA Scheduling Accountability Act will help ensure those mistakes are not repeated, and improve access to timely care for our Nation’s heroes. Again, I thank the sponsor of the bill, Mrs. WALORSKI . It is one of the most important bills that we will pass this year, in my opinion, and I urge its passage. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. WALORSKI ), the sponsor of the bill and a former member of the committee. Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman ROEand Ranking Member WALZ. What an honor it is to work with these two gentlemen on veterans’ issues. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, H.R. 467, the VA Scheduling Accountability Act. This commonsense legislation codifies an important measure of oversight and accountability of VA facilities to prevent scheduling manipulation or, in the vernacular, ‘‘cooking the books,’’ that has harmed veterans for so long. Hearings held by the House VA Committee and investigations by the VA inspector general and the GAO have, unfortunately, confirmed many of the allegations of cooking books and falsified waittime data at facilities around the country. The VA has a procedure for scheduling veterans’ medical appointments, which includes 19 different items, such as ensuring that a patient’s desired appointment date is not altered and that staff are fully trained. Importantly, the directive requires each facility to certify compliance with all of these 19 items every year. However, an August 2014 VA inspector general report uncovered that, in May 2013, a senior VA official waived the certification requirement that year, essentially putting the facility on an honor system, allowing them to selfcertify. Without this crucial accountability mechanism, bad actors were given free rein to manipulate waittime data and ignore the VA’s required scheduling practices. Meanwhile, veterans faced significant delays in getting the care they needed while, in some extreme cases, veterans died. Since that time, the VA has reinstated the certification requirements. However, serious problems remain, as evidenced by a recent VA investigation of a clinic in my own district that I requested after some brave individuals came forward with allegations of wrongdoing. b1515 The VA found that the clinic scheduled appointments for veterans without the veterans’ knowledge and canceled them on the day of the appointment in order to fill their schedule for that day. If the VA had conducted proper audits of that facility’s scheduling practices last year, this misconduct could have been prevented. The VA’s report recommended a review of scheduling compliance for all medical facilities in the region. The VA’s continued inability to reform itself from within is the reason we need to pass this bill. This bill will require each facility director to annually certify compliance with the current scheduling directive or any successive directive that replaces it, and, most importantly, it will prohibit any future waivers. The bill also provides accountability by making a director ineligible for salary bonuses if their facility fails to certify compliance, and it requires the VA to report to Congress a list of these facilities that are not in compliance. This will provide more oversight of the VA, ensure that Congress is aware of noncompliant facilities, and end the reckless practice of selfcertification. Mr. Speaker, our veterans risked life and limb for our freedom, but too often the VA has let them down. It is time to put an end to this scheduling manipulation—the cooking of the books—and the false waittime data. Holding every VA facility accountable for following scheduling rules is an important, commonsense step as we work to fix the VA so it works for the veterans in our country. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 467, the VA Scheduling Accountability Act. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, again, I thank the gentlewoman from Indiana for her passion and for the chairman to bring this commonsense accountability piece to the floor. I encourage my colleagues to support it, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, once again, I encourage all Members to support this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 467. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. f 
IMPROVING THE PROVISION OF ADULT DAY HEALTH CARE SERVICES FOR VETERANS Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1005) to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve the provision of adult day health care services for veterans. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1005 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. PROVISION OF ADULT DAY HEALTH CARE SERVICES FOR VETERANS. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. WALZ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 1005, a bill to improve the provision of adult day healthcare services for veterans. Last year, the Department of Veterans Affairs testified that 9.8 million veterans, or 46 percent of the veteran population, will be 65 years of age or older in 2017. Given that, the need to ensure that veterans have ready access to a variety of geriatric and longterm care services and supports is an increasingly important component of the VA’s mission. 
Current law requires the VA to cover the cost of nursing home care in a State Veterans Home for any veteran in need of such care due to a service connected disability or with a service connected disability rating of 70 percent or more. That authority is incredibly important and has helped thousands of our veterans get the nursing home care they need. However, there is an increasing demand for VA to offer geriatric and longterm care programs in noninstitutional settings that would allow aging veterans to receive needed services and supports while remaining in their homes surrounded by their loved ones. To that end, H.R. 1005 would require VA to enter into an agreement or a contract with State Veterans Homes to pay for adult day healthcare for a veteran who is eligible for but not receiving nursing home care. Adult day healthcare programs are a popular alternative to nursing home care that provide veterans in need of case management, assistance with activities of daily living, or other supportive services with companionship, peer support, recreation, and certain healthcare services. They also provide needed respite for caregivers. By requiring VA to cover the cost of adult day healthcare programs at State Veterans Homes for veterans who would otherwise qualify for VApaid nursing home care, H.R. 1005 would expand access to this type of care, which has been shown to maximize a veteran’s independence and quality of life and to extend an aging veteran’s ability to remain at home, which I think we would all want to do. This bill has the support of the National Association of State Veterans Homes, The American Legion, the Disabled American Veterans, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, and the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States. I am grateful to my friend and former committee member, LEEZELDIN  from New York, for sponsoring this legislation and for shepherding it to the House floor. I look forward to working with him and our colleagues in the Senate to secure a quick passage over there as well. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 1005, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of Congressman ZELDIN ’s bill, H.R. 1005. This legislation is a timely solution to a problem that affects many of our aging veteran populations. Nursing homes are often a family’s last resort, and I believe that is the way it should remain. By allowing veterans to receive daily care and assistance at a nursing home and then return to their homes at night, veterans will receive the care, medical support, and attention they need without sacrificing the community family support and independence they want. For that reason, I ask my colleagues to support this really smart piece of legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. ZELDIN ) who is a former member of our committee and sponsor of this legislation. Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1005, a bill which would provide nocost medical model adult day healthcare at State Veterans Homes to veterans who are 70 percent or more serviceconnected disabled. This bill is an extension to the Veterans Benefits, Healthcare, and Information Technology Act of 2006, which currently provides nocost nursing home care at any State Veterans Home to veterans who are 70 percent or more serviceconnected disabled. Medical model adult day healthcare provides comprehensive medical, nursing, and personal care services combined with engaging social activities for physically or cognitively impaired adults. Medical model adult day healthcare offers a complete array of rehabilitative therapies, including physical, occupational, and speech therapies, hospice and palliative care, social work, spiritual, nutritional counseling, and therapeutic recreation. The program is designed to promote socialization and stimulation and maximize the participant’s independence while enhancing their quality of life. The program is staffed by a team of multidisciplinary healthcare professionals who evaluate each participant and customize an individualized plan of care specific to their health and social needs. Adult day healthcare is an alternative care setting that can allow some veterans who require longterm care services to remain in their homes rather than be institutionalized in a nursing home. Such veterans typically require support for some, but not all, activities of daily living—ADLs—such as bathing, dressing, or feeding. In many cases, a spouse or other family member may provide the veteran with much of their care, but they require additional support for some of the veteran’s ADLs. By filling these gaps, adult day healthcare can allow these veterans to remain in their homes and communities for additional months or even years and thereby lower the financial cost of caring for these heroes. Adult day healthcare also provides family caregivers support and relief. Adult day healthcare programs can help caregivers to meet their other professional and family obligations or provide a welldeserved respite while their loved ones are participating in the program. I would like to thank Chairman ROE and Ranking Member WALZ for their leadership and support on this issue. Also, I would like to thank the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee and the great staff for recognizing the need for this critical legislation. Mr. Speaker, this is a piece of legislation I would encourage all of our colleagues to support. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. COSTELLO ) who is a former member of our committee. Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of legislation that would assist veterans in Pennsylvania’s Sixth Congressional District who suffer from a serviceconnected disability. H.R. 1005 would allow the Department of Veterans Affairs to work with State Veterans Homes, such as the Southeastern Veterans Center in my district in East Vincent Township in Chester County, Pennsylvania, to fund adult day healthcare for veterans who have a disability rating of 70 percent or more from the line of duty. Making this program available to more veterans who need assistance with daily tasks, such as bathing, dressing, or eating, would help improve the lives of those who have sacrificed so much, as well as their families. Our veterans and their loved ones deserve to receive highquality health services with the freedom and flexibility to live independently and at home. I commend Congressman ZELDIN for his leadership and all those on the Veterans’ Affairs Committee for passing this out of committee. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bill, and I urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to join me in passing H.R. 1005, and I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 1005. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Tennessee? There was no objection. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Once again, I urge all Members to support this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1005. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
NO HERO LEFT UNTREATED ACT Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1162) to direct the Secretary 
of Veterans Affairs to carry out a pilot program to provide access to magnetic EEG/EKGguided resonance therapy to veterans. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1162 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘No Hero Left Untreated Act’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. WALZ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee. 
Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Tennessee? There was no objection. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1162, a bill to expand the use of EEG/EKGguided magnetic resonance therapy to treat veterans with PTSD, traumatic brain injury, military sexual trauma, chronic pain, and opiate addiction at VA medical centers. A 2016 VA report found that mental health conditions and substance abuse among veterans is alarmingly high and steadily on the rise, up from 27 percent in 2001 to over 40 percent in 2014. Perhaps even more alarming, the same report showed that VA has increased its use of prescription opioids by 259 percent over the same period to treat these invisible wounds. Magnetic resonance therapy, or MRT, is an emerging technology that has been used to treat over 400 veterans with symptoms of their mental conditions. MRT uses quantitative electroencephalogram, electrocardiogram technology to target the affected areas of the brain and apply repetitive magnetic stimulation to return normal function to those areas. MRT has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat depression, and a 2015 study found that veterans who underwent 2 weeks of treatment for PTSD reported an average of 47.4 percent reduction in symptom severity. After 4 weeks of treatment, veteran participants saw a 64 percent reduction in symptom severity on average. The same study showed zero reports of worsening symptoms or adverse effects from the treatment. H.R. 1162 would create a 1year pilot at two VA facilities during which 50 veterans would be provided MRT treatment for PTSD, traumatic brain injury, military sexual trauma, chronic pain, and opioid addiction. b1530 Ninety days after the end of the pilot, the Secretary of the VA would issue a report to Congress on the efficacy of the pilot. Mr. Speaker, with such promising results from preliminary tests of MRT technology, I believe that we must act quickly to make this emerging technology available to more veterans suffering from the invisible wounds of war. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California (Mr. KNIGHT ), my good friend and fellow Army veteran, for sponsoring this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 1162, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1162. With all of the things that you heard the chairman talk about and substance abuse disorder on the rise, the VA should continue to explore the benefits of alternative treatments and how best to provide care to our veterans. Medical providers must think outside of the box and find effective ways to treat the symptoms a veteran is experiencing, and do so in a way that does not compromise a veteran’s health, relationships, and progress towards a successful transition home. Mr. Speaker, for this reason, I would ask my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation and start moving in a direction that serves our veterans with the best treatment for them. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. KNIGHT ), the sponsor of this bill. Mr. KNIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and the ranking member for their leadership on all veteran issues. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 1162, the No Hero Left Untreated Act. I rise today to stand with our Nation’s veterans for whom the trauma from the battlefield does not always appear. Whether it is PTS, TBI, MST, chronic pain, or opioid drugs addiction, the pilot program established by this bill would provide an innovative individualized treatment for all toocommon diagnoses that our veterans face today. Using a suite of FDAapproved medical tools, the magnetic EEG/EKG guided resonance therapy, or MeRT, is a nonpharmaceutical and noninvasive procedure that has already shown great promise. This bill requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to establish the pilot program, treat 50 veterans using MeRT at two different VA locations, and then come back with a report at the end of that. Already at the Brain Treatment Center in California, 98 percent of veterans in recent trials have experienced at least a 10point change in their military PTSD checklist, or PCLM, which ranges from 17 to 80. The ActiveDuty military has already begun clinical trials using the MeRT procedure at Tinker Air Force Base, concluding that ‘‘transcranial MeRT is a promising adjuvant treatment modality to help veterans suffering from PTSD.’’ In fact, after 4 weeks of active treatment, MeRT reduced the average PCLM score from 66 to 37. U.S. Special Operations Command has also funded their own trials using the Brain Treatment Center’s treatment modality and is conducting research at MacDill Air Force Base in Florida and Naval Special Warfare Command in my home State of California. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the R ECORD  letters of support for H.R. 1162 from AMVETS, the Veterans Health Council, the Association of the United States Navy, Veterans Advantage, The Patriot Project, Lines for Life, the National Foundation for Women Legislators, the PsychArmor Institute, STEADFAST Leadership, and the WestCare Foundation. 
AMVETS, Lanham, MD, April 5, 2017. Hon. STEVE KNIGHT , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR CONGRESSMAN KNIGHT : AMVETS (American Veterans) is pleased to support your bill, H.R. 1162, the No Hero Left Untreated Act, which seeks to establish a pilot program for two Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers to treat fifty veterans using magnetic EEG/EKGguided resonance therapy. Magnetic EEG/EKGguided resonance therapy has successfully treated more than 400 veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, military sexual trauma, chronic pain, and opiate addiction. This small pilot would be instructive to VA in understanding the benefits and deciding whether to offer this promising therapy to those receiving VA health care. If it were fully understood how to treat these nuanced disorders and health issues, VA would already be doing so—and suffice it to say—the veteran suicide rate would most assuredly be lower than it is now. It is imperative that we, as a nation, look at new ways to help those who have stood up and walked the walk, and suffer the consequences day after day. AMVETS is in full support of this measure and appreciates your leadership in introducing this important legislation and in striving to improve the lives of all veterans. Sincerely, JOSEPH R. C HENELLY , Executive Director. 
VETERANS HEALTH COUNCIL , Silver Spring, MD, February 21, 2017. Hon. STEVE KNIGHT , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR CONGRESSMAN KNIGHT : I am writing in support of the H.R. No Heroes Left Untreated Act. This important piece of legislation will bring to America’s Veterans a significant contribution toward health solutions for PostTraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), Military Sexual Trauma (MST), chronic pain and opiate drug addiction through MeRT (Magnetic EEG/EKGguided Resonance Therapy). As of early 2015, the effects of collective failure to adequately address the emotional and physical effects of combat; particularly Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBI), mild Traumatic Brain Injuries (mTBI), and PTSD have left the Veteran community paying a disproportionate toll for their service to the Nation. Current treatment modalities clearly have limited utility. The urgency of understanding and responding to this national issue becomes more obvious, when one sees the growing scope, impact and prevalence of PTSD, both in Veteran suicides and in related societal indicators. While some may view this as a societal cost that cannot be averted, that is not the view of the doctors at the Newport Brain Research Lab/Brain Treatment Center (NBRL/BTC). MeRT brings a novel neuromodulation approach achieving unprecedented success rates in both open label trial and randomized, placebocontrolled, doubleblind studies. To date, over 98% of Veteran PTSD/TBI patients have responded positively averaging a 61% reduction in symptom severity as measured by the PCL–M (PTSD Check List—Military) and demonstrated by measurable EEG/EKG changes. We applaud your continued interest in exploring effective, sciencebased and proven medical technologies to help our Veterans. Like you, we believe it is our obligation and duty to ensure Veterans receive the treatment they need to have their lives and livelihoods restored. Sincerely, THOMAS J. B ERGER , PH.D., Executive Director. 
ASSOCIATION OF THE  UNITED STATES NAVY, Alexandria, VA, March 21, 2017. Hon. STEPHEN KNIGHT , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. On behalf of the Association of the United States Navy, we would like to pledge our support for H.R. 1162, the No Hero Left Untreated Act. This bill directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to carry out a pilot program to provide access to magnetic EEG/ EKG guided resonance therapy to veterans. Magnetic EEG/EKG guided resonance therapy has successfully treated more than 400 veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, military sexual trauma, chronic pain, and opiate addiction. Recent clinical trials and randomized, placebo controlled, double blind studies have produced promising measurable outcomes in the evolution of this type of therapy. The pilot program, as laid out in the bill, will allow the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide access to magnetic EEG/EKG guided resonance therapy to treat suffering veterans. The program will be located at no more than two facilities and test no more than fifty veterans. The program will be carried out for one year, and no more than 90 days after the termination of the program, the Secretary will submit to the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs of the Senate and House a report on the pilot program. Thank you for taking an active role in such an important issue to the Military and Veteran community by working to improve the lives and careers of those who served our great nation. Please feel free to contact me with any questions or concern. Sincerely, MICHAEL J. L ITTLE , Director of Legislative Affairs. 
VETERANS ADVANTAGE , Greenwich, CT, February 17, 2017. Hon. STEVE KNIGHT , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR CONGRESSMAN KNIGHT : On behalf of Veterans Advantage, PBC, the leading privatesector benefit company that advocates for greater respect, recognition and rewards for U.S. military, veterans and their family members, I am writing in support of the No Hero Left Untreated Act, HR1162. I am a Vietnam Veteran who has firsthand experience with the effects of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and Post Traumatic Stress (PTS). My son, who has sustained multiple concussions and suffers from PTS, has undergone treatment at the Brain Treatment Center (BTC) over the last year and continues to do so. As a result of this treatment, we have seen significant progress in addressing the symptoms associated with his condition, in particular his depression and anxiety have lessened. No other therapies have any effect on his condition. He has made steady progress and is now on the road to restoring his health. The current state of treatment for TBI, mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI), and PTS, is woefully inadequate. While hundreds of thousands of servicemembers suffer from these conditions when they return from war zones and multiple tours while serving our nation, there is a systemic failure to address the emotional and physical effects of combat. This is a national crisis and one we must address immediately. The legislation you are advocating is a significant step to provide the treatment our servicemen and women so desperately need and deserve. I have reviewed the double blind studies with Dr. Jin and the staff of the BTC. The use of Magnetic EEG/EKGguided Resonance Therapy (MeRT, a noninvasive treatment) under the direction of the BTC has achieved unprecedented success rates in in both openlabel trials and randomized, placebocontrolled, doubleblind studies. To date, over 98% of veteran PTSD/TBI patients have responded positively to this treatment option—averaging a 61% reduction in symptom severity as measured by the PTSD Check List—Military (PCL–M) and demonstrated by measurable EEG/EKG changes. Thank you for your initiative in sponsoring this important legislation and your support of America’s heroes through the No Hero Left Behind Act. Respectfully yours, H. SCOTT HIGGINS , Vietnam War Veteran, CEO/Veterans Advantage, PBC. 
THEPATRIOT PROJECT , March 2, 2017. Hon. STEVE KNIGHT , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR CONGRESSMAN KNIGHT : On behalf of the Patriot Project, a grassroots movement to provide Military Service Members, Families, Gold Star Dependents and Wounded Warriors with vital Chiropractic care to which they have little access, despite its inclusion in Veteran benefits; I am writing in support of H.R. 1162, the No Hero Left Untreated Act. This important piece of legislation offers America’s Veterans a timely non drug health solution for PostTraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), Military Sexual Trauma (MST), chronic pain, and opiate drug addiction through Magnetic EEG/EKGguided Resonance Therapy technology (MeRT technology). Consisting of over 5000 Chiropractors, nationwide, the Patriot Project has witnessed the invisible and visible lifealtering injuries of war these Veterans suffer, with little access to solutions except for drugs, and surgeries. The Patriot Project Board, made up of more than half a dozen Congressional Medal of Honor Recipients, has taken on the challenge of restoring hope to our returning warriors by pursuing nondrug interventions with vigor. As tens of thousands of Veterans return home each year, they encounter a systemic failure to adequately address the emotional and physical effects of combat. Current treatments for PTSD, TBI and even mild Traumatic Brain Injuries (mTBI) have limited utility to sufficiently heal our Veterans. The urgency of understanding and responding to this national crisis becomes even more compelling when one sees the growing scope, impact and prevalence of PTSD particularly in Veteran suicide rates. The doctors at the Newport Brain Research Lab/Brain Treatment Center (NBRL/BTC), believe it is their obligation and duty to ensure Veterans receive the treatment they need to have their lives and livelihoods restored. H.R. 1162 is a significant step forward in providing Veterans with the treatment they 
desperately need and clearly deserve. MeRT technology brings a novel neuromodulation approach, achieving unprecedented success rates in both openlabel trials and randomized, placebocontrolled, doubleblind studies with over 98% of Veteran PTSD/TBI patients responding positively to this treatment option. Without investment in such innovative treatment, our nation’s Veterans will continue to pay a disproportionate toll for their service. We applaud Congressman Knight and his attentive staff for their commitment to explore effective, sciencebased, and proven medical technologies and their unwavering support to helping America’s heroes. Sincerely, DR. CAROL ANNMALIZIA , CAM Integrative Consulting, Patriot Project Board Member. 
LINES FOR LIFE, March 9, 2017. Hon. STEVE KNIGHT , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARCONGRESSMAN KNIGHT : Thank you for your ongoing efforts to support our veterans, particularly through HR 1162, the No Hero Left Untreated Act. Lines for Life supports this important piece of legislation that will expand promising neurological treatment for veterans coping with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), traumatic brain injury (TBI), military sexual trauma, chronic pain, and opiate addiction. Lines for Life operates a regional Military Helpline that offers free, anonymous help to activeduty service members, veterans, and their families. We also serve as the sole backup center for the Department of Veterans Affairs’ Veterans Crisis Line. In 2016, we received over 31,500 militaryrelated calls from individuals who are struggling to cope with mental health issues including anger, substance abuse, posttraumatic stress, and thoughts of suicide. Veterans comprise 9% of the United States population, but account for 18% of suicides. Our nation’s inadequate attention to the emotional and physical effects of combat, particularly TBI and PTSD, have left our veteran community paying a disproportionate toll for their service. Treatment methods to date have had limited utility. We must respond to the growing scope, impact, and prevalence of PTSD by enhancing our understanding and response to this critical issue. We applaud your continued interest in exploring effective, sciencebased, and proven medical technologies to help our veterans. We believe it is our obligation and duty to ensure veterans receive the treatment they need to have their lives and livelihoods restored. Sincerely, DWIGHT HOLTON , Executive Director. 
NATIONAL FOUNDATION FOR  WOMEN LEGISLATORS , March 6, 2017. Hon. STEVE KNIGHT , House of Representatives, Washington, DC DEAR CONGRESSMAN KNIGHT : We are writing in support of HR 1162 the No Hero Left Untreated Act, for which your efforts should be highly commended on behalf of Veterans. This important piece of legislation will bring America’s Veterans a significant contribution to their health solutions for PostTraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), Military Sexual Trauma (MST), chronic pain and opiate drug addiction through MeRT (Magnetic EEG/EKG guided Resonance Therapy). As of early 2015, the effects of our nation’s collective failure to adequately address the emotional and physical effects of combat, particularly Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBI), mild Traumatic Brain Injuries (mTBI), and PTSD have left our Veteran community paying a disproportionate toll for their service to the Nation.

The urgency of understanding and responding to this national issue becomes more obvious when one sees the growing scope, impact, and prevalence of PTSD, evident both in Veteran suicides and related societal indicators. While some may view this as a societal cost that cannot be averted, that is not our view. We applaud your continued interest in exploring effective, sciencebased and proven medical technologies to help our Veterans. Like you, we believe it is our obligation and duty to ensure Veterans receive the treatment they need to have their lives and livelihoods restored. Sincerely, MINNESOTA STATE SENATOR  CARRIE RUUD, 2017 NFWL Chair, On behalf of the Board of Directors of the National Foundation for Women Legislators. 
PSYCHARMOR INSTITUTE , March 8, 2017. Hon. STEVE KNIGHT , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR CONGRESSMAN KNIGHT : I am writing in support of HR 1162 the No Hero Left Untreated Act, for which your efforts should be highly commended on behalf of Veterans. This important piece of legislation will allow for a neurological treatment option for Veterans who suffer from PostTraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), Military Sexual Trauma (MST), chronic pain and opiate drug addiction. This nonpharmaceutical and noninvasive treatment has helped hundreds of Veterans and their families who are supporting and caring for these Veterans. There is no one treatment for every individual, and it is important to give Veterans options so that they have the power to choose which treatment is best for them and their situation. Veterans have sacrificed so much for our nation; it is our obligation to provide for them and their families. We applaud your continued interest in exploring effective, sciencebased and proven medical technologies to help our Veterans. Like you, we believe it is our obligation and duty to ensure Veterans receive the treatment they need to have their lives and livelihoods restored. Sincerely, MARJORIE MORRISON , PsychArmor Institute, CEO & Founder. 
FEBRUARY 17, 2017. Hon. STEVE KNIGHT , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR CONGRESSMAN KNIGHT : Recent elections have focused us, once again, on the ‘‘here and now.’’ And rightly so. With the elections behind us, we have a shared sense of relief. But for combat veterans, the ‘‘here and now’’ is also often defined by ‘‘there and then.’’ They carry courage into battle, serve with honor and come home—often finding they need new courage to confront a new foe. Veterans who confront posttraumatic stress, traumatic brain injury, and related symptoms also deserve relief—and this Veterans’ Day, Congress is poised to give it to them. Truth can be compelling when it meets you up close and personal. You know that for many Veterans, there is new truth afoot, and it is compelling—and hopeful. In recent years, the specialized, littlepublicized brain treatment program for PostTraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) known as Magnetic EEG/EKGguided Resonance Therapy (MeRT technology) has emerged. The unique treatment, much studied and now widely corroborated, is powerful. It changes lives. Just as the election was an inflection point, you have recognized that Congress is in a position to change lives in America for the better. If Congress can move beyond words and intentions, beyond political jousting, America’s veterans will be forever grateful—and lives will be saved by the thousands, and you are doing just that. The chance to give life back to those on the edge, who wrestle daily with PTSD and related lifestresses and opiate addiction, is at our fingertips. The Washington Post and veteran publications have aptly described it, and time is now for action. I cannot say this with more conviction: We must act to save the precious lives, and every one at risk is precious. We lose more than 20 young men and women daily to PTSD, and we can stop this in a single congressional vote for your bill. The No Hero Left Untreated Act H.R. 1162 can help to change everything. Through pilot programs administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), veterans will turn a critical corner. It will help to restore their mental health, saving countless lives and those touched by those lives. Without this act, our veterans will continue to languish without access to this help. Seeing you, in a first postelection act bringing fifty Members together to unify around what matters, can only be applauded. Politics aside, Congress acting now to pass H.R. 1162 and a Senate companion bill following immediately will begin immediately saving the veterans most at risk. As your action clearly demonstrates, there can no longer be any excuse. As first reported by the Washington Post, this is an inflection point—a show stopper, a real chance for meaningful change. Tested through doubleblind studies, 98 percent of MeRTtreated veterans experienced at least a 10point improvement in their PTSD Check List–Military (PCL–M) score, and saw significant reduction in symptom severity, after only 4 weeks of treatment. These results have been mirrored in additional open label trials as well. Nothing else I know of has come close to this success rate. Congressman Knight, all this brings me to today and my offering of my support for your efforts on behalf of my brothers and sisters who have so ably served. I thank you for making their futures your first priority in the 115th Congress. Sincerely, REBECCA HALSTEAD , Brigadier General Retired, (USA retired). 
WESTCAREFOUNDATION , February 22, 2017. Hon. STEVE KNIGHT , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARCONGRESSMAN KNIGHT : The purpose of this letter is to show full support from WestCare Foundation, Inc, for H.R. 1162, the No Hero Left Untreated Act. This progressive piece of legislation brings a critical health solution for PostTraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), Military Sexual Trauma (MST), chronic pain, and opiate drug addiction to our nation’s Veterans through Magnetic EEG/EKGguided Resonance Therapy (MeRT technology). The doctors of the Newport Brain Research Lab/Brain Treatment Center (NBRL/BTC) have introduced a gamechanger addressing 
seemingly intractable behavioral health conditions through their development of MeRT technology. The data from both open label and doubleblind studies of MeRT technology are compelling. This protocol, offered as a first line treatment of the physical brain through neuromodulation, can improve the behavioral health outcomes for all of us who subsequently provide evidencebased therapies that will further benefit Veteran patients and clients as, together, we create a more effective comprehensive continuum of care. As a Veteran of the Vietnam War, myself, I am especially interested in seeing the VA bring this work into their practice of medicine. For over forty years later, we continue to see the negative life impact of war on our men and women who served without the advent of practice and protocols sufficient for their full recovery. MeRT technology is producing results that are saving lives and increasing the potential for followon therapies to change the future trajectory of the lives of our Veterans and their families as well. We owe our warriors the very best treatment available in America. MeRT technology is clearly making a difference. I commend you for offering this important legislation and urge its passage as soon as possible! Every day without it can be measured in loss of life, in loss of positive contribution to our communities from our American heroes, and in loss of our fathers and mothers, sons and daughters, friends and neighbors. Sincerely, RICHARD STEINBERG , President/CEO. 
Mr. KNIGHT. Mr. Speaker, in a time when the Defense Department maintains technological superiority over our adversaries in combat, our Veterans Affairs Department must continue to push the technological limit to treating our selfless servicemembers once their duty is done. I am optimistic that this pilot program for our veteran population will be the first of many that improves our ability to heal wounded veterans. Mr. Speaker, I will leave my colleagues with one last quote. As the AMVETS’ executive director stated in his letter of support for this bill: ‘‘It is imperative that we, as a nation, look at new ways to help those who have stood up and walked the walk, and suffer the consequences day after day.’’ Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California (Mr. KNIGHT ) for his innovative approach in trying to get services to our veterans. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to join us in passing H.R. 1162. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I, too, encourage all Members to support this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1162. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. f 
VA PRESCRIPTION DATA ACCOUNTABILITY ACT 2017 Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1545) to amend title 38, United States Code, to clarify the authority of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to disclose certain patient information to State controlled substance monitoring programs, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1545 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘VA Prescription Data Accountability Act 2017’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. WALZ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee. 
Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Tennessee? There was no objection. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1545, the VA Prescription Data Accountability Act of 2017. H.R. 1545 would require the Department of Veterans Affairs to disclose information about any individual prescribed medication by a VA employee or a provider authorized by the VA to a State Prescription Drug Monitoring Program to the extent necessary to prevent misuse and diversion of prescription medication. Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs are Statewide electronic databases that collect and distribute information on prescription medication to certain authorized individuals or entities. They are used to identify and address prescription drug abuse, addiction, and diversion. While 90 percent of the VA’s patient population are veterans, the VA treats certain nonveterans, including Active Duty servicemembers who receive VA care through sharing agreements with the Department of Defense, dependents, caregivers of veterans, and VA staff, to name a few. Current law authorizes the VA to disclose information to Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs for veterans and dependents of veterans only. The VA is not authorized to disclose information for other patients. Moreover, technological barriers prevent the VA from transmitting dependent data to Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs. That means that prescription drug information for nonveterans—10 percent of the VA’s patient population, which translates to more than 700,000 veterans this fiscal year—is not being shared with Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs today. In light of ongoing concerns about the potential for misuse or diversion of prescription medication, particularly opioid medications, it is imperative that the VA share information about all VA patients, veteran and nonveteran, to State Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs. It is a matter of public safety. H.R. 1545 is supported by the American Legion, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States, and by the VA, who testified before the Subcommittee on Health earlier this year that this authority would ‘‘ensure that VA is able to fulfill its public health role in sharing vital clinical information to help guide treatment decisions.’’ Mr. Speaker, this bill is sponsored by the gentlewoman of New Hampshire (Ms. KUSTER ), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, who is joined by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. WENSTRUP ), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Health; the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. BERGMAN ), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations; and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. BROWNLEY ), the ranking member on the Subcommittee on Health. I am grateful to all of them for sponsoring this legislation. It has my full support, and I urge all of our colleagues to join me in supporting it. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1545 offered by the gentlewoman from New Hampshire (Ms. KUSTER ), who is the ranking member of our Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, and, as importantly, a champion of policies that make sure the scourge of opioid addiction is addressed in this Congress, and is a leading expert on it. 
This legislation would make significant progress towards curbing substance abuse disorders and diversion of prescription medication in our veteran population. As you heard, currently, a veteran’s dependent can receive a prescription for a controlled substance from a provider in the community, and then they receive the same prescription for the same controlled substance from a VA provider without either provider’s knowledge of what happened. Congress, in the past, has attempted to remedy this problem but, due to confusion within the VA, was unsuccessful. I believe that Congresswoman KUSTER ’s legislation would clear up this confusion and allow the VA to better serve both veterans and their dependents by allowing the VA and community providers to recognize and treat substance abuse disorders instead of contributing to them by unintentionally overprescribing. Mr. Speaker, I fully support this legislation. I would encourage all of my colleagues to do the same. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, at this time I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. COSTELLO ). Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the VA Prescription Data Accountability Act. We face a serious opioid epidemic in our communities across the Nation. As we work to put forth solutions to this crisis, it is critical that we incorporate the Veterans Health Administration into existing, effective controlled substance monitoring programs. To ensure effective, accurate oversight of who is being prescribed controlled substances, this legislation would require the VA to disclose information about all individuals, veteran or dependent, who receive such prescriptions from the VHA. In my home State of Pennsylvania, we have an established comprehensive and effective Prescription Drug Monitoring Program. Incorporating additional data from the VA is an appropriate step to utilize proven existing networks to fight back against the opioid epidemic. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from New Hampshire (Ms. KUSTER ), my good friend and the ranking member of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, and a critical partner in serving our veterans. Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. WALZ) and the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE) for their support of this bill. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to speak on my bill, H.R. 1545, the VA Prescription Accountability Act. This bill demonstrates the power of bipartisanship in this Congress, especially on the House VA Committee. I thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. WENSTRUP ) for his willingness to colead this bill with me, and also the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. BERGMAN ) and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. BROWNLEY ) for cosponsoring this commonsense legislation. This bill is common sense because it improves upon the Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs, also known as PDMPs across this country. PDMPs are proven resources in combating our Nation’s opioid epidemic. PDMPs improve the public health and our general wellbeing. In 2012, the VA was finally authorized to connect its patient population to State PDMPs. But, unfortunately, an issue with the VA’s antiquated computer systems meant that literally hundreds of thousands of nonveteran patients at the VA were left excluded from the data reported to PDMPs by the VA. As the ranking member of the House Veterans’ Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, I am all too familiar with the continued issues with computer systems across the entirety of the VA. This issue underscores the need for the VA and this Congress to ensure effective and rapid reform to the VA’s computer systems. When those systemic shortcomings potentially exacerbate the Nation’s opioid epidemic, I saw the importance to take action. Through my Bipartisan Heroin Task Force, we in Congress have learned the importance of ensuring prescription opioids are not misused. The consequences are truly dire. Over 30,000 Americans die in opioidrelated overdoses every year. That number just continues to rise. This bill represents a small but practical step forward in addressing this crisis. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of this lowcost bill. It will help ensure these important programs work as intended by closing the gap in prescription information. I urge my Senate colleagues to quickly take up the bill and pass it in the Senate as well. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. TAKANO ), our vice ranking member of the full Committee on Veterans’ Affairs and a true champion of veterans. b1545 Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my colleague from New Hampshire (Ms. KUSTER ) and her bill to improve information sharing between providers to ensure that they are able to follow safe prescribing practices. The VA Prescription Data Accountability Act helps to close a loophole in statute that limits the data that the VA can share with Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs, or PDMPs. These databases track the prescribing and dispensing of controlled substances to help find suspected fraud and intervene with patients who are at high risk for prescription drug abuse. These databases are only as useful as the information they collect. Since 2011, the VA has been able to share prescription data with PDMPs, but only for the veteran patients it sees. Statutory and technical challenges have prevented the Department from sharing data from nonveteran patients with PDMPs. Approximately 10 percent of the VA’s patients are nonveterans. We are talking about 700,000 patients each year. Now, Ms. KUSTER ’s bill expands the authority of the VA to share all patient data with PDMPs. This will allow us to better monitor the use of prescription drugs and help combat a growing opioid epidemic. On average, 650,000 opioid prescriptions are dispensed daily in the United States, and 78 people die from opioid related overdoses. Properly tracking prescription drugs is one of the first steps to turn the tide on this epidemic. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join us in passing H.R. 1545. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to close. In over 31 years of the practice of medicine, I have seen great changes, many of them to the good. One of the things that has disturbed me greatly is the opioid epidemic that we have in this great country at this time. I am an obstetrician. I have delivered a lot of babies in my career, and it was a rare event when we saw a baby that was addicted to opioids—as a matter of fact, almost never until, literally, about 20 years ago, and 10 years ago a fullfledged epidemic. In our hospital at home, we have a neonatal intensive care unit that cares for nothing but opioidaddicted babies. In our State of Tennessee, Mr. Speaker, we have had more people who died of prescription drug overdose deaths than died in car wrecks. It now exceeds many cancer deaths in the country. This bill has my 100 percent support, and I certainly want to thank Ms. KUSTER for her great work on this bill. We have shared a trip to Afghanistan together, as we did with Mr. TAKANO , and had a chance to talk about these things in great detail. I want to thank her and also the ranking member for their support in this. I once again encourage all Members to support this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1545. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
IMPROVING THE TREATMENT OF MEDICAL EVIDENCE PROVIDED BY NONDEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1725) to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve the treatment of medical evidence provided by nonDepartment of Veterans Affairs medical professionals in support of claims for disability compensation under the laws administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1725 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. REPORT ON PROGRESS OF DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS ACCEPTABLE CLINICAL EVIDENCE INITIATIVE. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. WALZ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee. 
Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to insert extraneous material in the RECORD on H.R. 1725, as amended. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Tennessee? There was no objection. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. H.R. 1725, as amended, was introduced by my good friend Mr. WALZ, the ranking member of the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs. This bill addresses a very serious issue. When a veteran files a claim for disability benefits, VA may need a medical opinion regarding whether the injury or illness is service connected and, if it is, the extent of the veteran’s disability. The problem is that the VA often schedules a medical disability examination when one might not be needed. Many times, a veteran will submit medical evidence from a private doctor with enough information for VA to decide the claim, but we hear about cases where VA still requires a VA examination. Ordering unnecessary disability examinations is a waste of time and resources. It takes doctors away from taking care of their patients and conducting other disability examinations. H.R. 1725, as amended, would require VA to provide reports to Congress about its use of private medical evidence. This information will be used to help us find ways to make the disability examination more efficient for veterans. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1725, as amended. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this piece of legislation. I want to thank the chairman personally for bringing this forward and for being very eloquent in his words on what this does. It is appropriate that it is part of this block of legislation dealing with appeals reform also. I thank the folks who have worked on this for years: Mr. DENHAM , Mr. LANGEVIN , Ms. M CSALLY , Mr. J OHNSON , Mr. COSTELLO , Ms. K USTER , Mr. H IGGINS of New York, and Ms. S HEAPORTER. As originally introduced, this bill sought to change a current requirement stipulating that initial physical examinations of those seeking to file disability claims must be conducted by the VA. It was to allow veterans to see a local doctor. Again, as the chairman so clearly pointed out, it was to relieve some of the pressure on the VA, while recognizing we have quality, ethically trustworthy physicians in the private sector who can deliver some of these services. The idea was that requiring the VA to accept private medical evidence from a qualified physician would ease the benefit process in rural communities, expedite diagnosis of disabilities, and reduce the wait times and the backlogs. This is a problem that we have been working on for many years. We introduced similar language in 2013, 2014, and 2015. I would like to thank all my fellow members, both on and off the committee, and those who are no longer in Congress for working toward this. I am especially thankful to Chairman BOST and Ms. ESTYfor having worked with me to tighten the scope of this bill to address the cost that the Congressional Budget Office scored it to. As it is now, the bill requires an annual report on how veterans obtain private medical evidence in support of their claim, how often it is rejected, and why. It is my hope that this data will help build our case for mandating that the VA accept all credible private medical evidence. We cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good and need to get started gathering this data as soon as possible. As we also work to improve the appeals process today, making it more convenient for veterans to get and submit medical evidence, this component will be important. By continuing our work on this issue, veterans will be able to complete their claims faster; start receiving the benefits that they have earned faster; and make sure that the stress you heard about with 20 years of waiting, much of that time 
seeing private physicians and gathering evidence to support the very claim that is being denied, this piece of legislation should make sense with that. Again, Mr. Speaker, I thank everyone involved with this. I urge my colleagues to support this piece of legislation, H.R. 1725. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I wholeheartedly endorse this bill. Mr. WALZ, Sergeant Major Walz, speaks with great passion about it. He has the Mayo Clinic in his district. I can’t imagine an evaluation at the Mayo Clinic by physicians there wouldn’t be adequate for the VA. I wholeheartedly support this bill, H.R. 1725, as amended. I urge all Members to also support it. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1725, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ‘‘A bill to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to submit certain reports relating to medical evidence submitted in support of claims for benefits under the laws administered by the Secretary.’’. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
VETERANS’ COMPENSATION COST OFLIVING ADJUSTMENT ACT OF 2017 Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1329) to increase, effective as of December 1, 2017, the rates of compensation for veterans with service connected disabilities and the rates of dependency and indemnity compensation for the survivors of certain disabled veterans, to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, to improve the processing of claims by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1329 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Veterans’ Compensation CostofLiving Adjustment Act of 2017’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. WALZ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee. 
Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I ask that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and to insert extraneous material in the RECORD on H.R. 1329, as amended. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Tennessee? There was no objection. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. H.R. 1329, as amended, is one of the most important bills the House will take up this year. This bill will help ensure that the benefits paid to veterans who are disabled as a result of their military service do not lose value because of inflation. H.R. 1329, as amended, authorizes a costofliving increase for veterans and their families next year as long as Social Security recipients receive an increase. We pass this bill every year, and it has always enjoyed wide, bipartisan support. This year’s bill was introduced by the Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs Chairman BOSTand Ranking Member E STY. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1329, as amended, and help disabled veterans and their families keep up with the rate of inflation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise to support H.R. 1329, as amended. The Veterans’ Compensation Cost ofLiving Adjustment Act provides a 1 year costofliving adjustment for the rate of compensation for veterans with serviceconnected disabilities as well as the rates of dependency and indemnity compensation for survivors. As most of us know, this adjustment is tied directly to the rates of increase in Social Security benefits. Disability payments are vital to the economic wellbeing of most veterans, and that support should never be eroded by inflation. This bill ensures that does not happen. I thank Chairman ROEfor bringing the bill to us in a totally bipartisan process, and the Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs, as always. The names of Chairman BOST and Ranking Member ESTY have been brought up a lot today. It says something about it. They are tackling issues that have lasted years. They are bringing up important issues that are going to impact the wellbeing of veterans. You heard them both say it. They did so in a bipartisan manner that I think serves the reputation of this House well. We sorely need more true bipartisan problem solving like this. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs, Chairman BOST. Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1329, the Veterans’ Compensation CostofLiving Adjustment Act of 2017. This bill should be a top priority for all of us this year. H.R. 1329 should ensure that the veterans receive a costofliving increase next year if Social Security recipients get one. We all know that the price keeps going up and that if veterans’ benefits don’t keep pace, veterans and their families may have a hard time paying for basic necessities like food, shelter, and clothing. This bill is extremely important to our Nation’s veterans. I ask all Members to support it. I want to thank the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs, Ms. ESTY, for her support of this legislation. I urge my colleagues, all, also to support H.R. 1329. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. B ILIRAKIS ), the vice chairman of our committee. b1600 Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, this truly is a bipartisan committee under the able leadership of Chairman ROE and Ranking Member WALZ. Again, I am proud to serve on this committee. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1329, the Veterans’ Compensation CostofLiving Adjustment Act. Passage of this bill gives our Nation’s veterans the same costofliving adjustment as those receiving benefits through Social Security. These brave men and women have sacrificed so much for the freedoms and liberties we enjoy on a daily basis. As a grateful nation, we must ensure that those who put themselves in harm’s way are able to receive the benefits they have earned and deserve. Providing for our Nation’s true American heroes is not a partisan issue, but simply the right thing to do. Mr. Speaker, approximately 1.6 million veterans reside in the great State of Florida, where so many veterans call home after serving in the military. As vice chairman of the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee, I am so very proud that Florida is considered one of the most veteran friendly States across the country. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague, Representative MIKEBOSTfrom Indiana, for introducing this very important piece of legislation. As a cosponsor of H.R. 1329, I urge all of my colleagues to support our Nation’s heroes and pass the Veterans’ Compensation CostofLiving Adjustment Act. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Maine (Mr. POLIQUIN ), my good friend and a member of our committee. Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman very much for this opportunity to speak on behalf of H.R. 1329, and I salute Congressman BOSTfrom Illinois and Congresswoman ESTY from the great State of Connecticut for their great work in a bipartisan fashion to help our heroes. I think, Mr. Speaker, it was our first Commander in Chief, George Washington, who said, in effect, that we can never expect our young men and women to step forward and serve our country in uniform unless and until we make sure we take care of those who have already returned from the battlefield. Now, in the State of Maine, Mr. Speaker, we love our veterans. We have about 125,000 of our heroes in our State of Maine, more than half of whom are in the rural part of our State, the Second Congressional District of Maine, that I am honored to represent. I think it is a great idea and about time that we make sure that we come before the American people, Republicans and Democrats together, to make sure that our veterans receive a costofliving adjustment—those who have been disabled—as a result of their service for our country. Mr. Speaker, I ask all Republicans and Democrats on this committee and in this body to please support H.R. 1329. It is the right thing to do, to give a costofliving increase to our veterans. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1329. But as we get ready to close on the final piece of seven pieces of legislation, some that have taken years, that have included diverse groups coming together to try to find solutions, you are seeing today all seven of these bills are going to pass this House. They are going to pass with overwhelmingly, if not unanimous, bipartisan support. I have stood on this floor and have expressed my displeasure and my discomfort when we don’t work together. Today it is one of those pleasures to stand here and say this is what the American people expect, and this is the hard work that needs to be done. That kind of thing does not happen by chance. It usually takes one person standing at the middle of that in leadership to make it happen. I would like to thank my friend and colleague, our chairman of the committee, the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE), for ensuring that veterans come before politics, veterans come before partisan differences, and that veterans legislation can be done together in a bipartisan manner. So, I thank him for that and encourage support of all of these pieces of legislation. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I want to thank my good friend, Sergeant Major WALZfor his kind words. Certainly, what we try to do on the Veterans’ Affairs Committee is leave Republican and Democrat at the door of the committee room and go and do the work of the veterans for what is best for them. It is a true pleasure and honor, if you have ever attended one of our meetings, to see that and to see the effort of all Members. And you can see here today, with seven important pieces of legislation passed, it will help improve the lives of our veterans. I know, for me, that this time of the year—and I feel sure that my friends on the other side of the aisle feel the same way—is one of the most difficult times of the year. It is Memorial Day. And I don’t think we need to forget, this coming Monday, what that means. It is for all of those who didn’t make it home who protected this great country. I know, myself, I get some guilt this time of year. I was a drafted soldier, as many of us were. I served my time in 1973 and 1974 in Korea, just south of the DMZ. Many of my friends didn’t make it home from Vietnam. I still feel for them and their families. I know every Memorial Day, when I attend a service for veterans, it is difficult for me to get through that day because I got to come home, as all of us here who are serving did. We got to raise our children and see our grandchildren be born. These men and women who died in Vietnam and other wars didn’t get to do that, as young people are doing today. So I can’t thank, enough, the veterans of this great Nation who serve us every day and keep us free. Mr. Speaker, I encourage all Members to support H.R. 1329, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1329, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ‘‘A bill to increase, effective as of December 1, 2017, the rates of compensation for veterans with serviceconnected disabilities and the rates of dependency and indemnity compensation for the survivors of certain disabled veterans, and for other purposes.’’. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
PROTECTING THE RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS AGAINST TECHNOLOGICAL EXPLOITATION ACT Ms. MCSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2052) to amend the Uniform Code of Military Justice to prohibit the wrongful broadcast or distribution of intimate visual images. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2052 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Protecting the Rights of IndiViduals Against Technological Exploitation Act’’ or the ‘‘PRIVATE Act’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. MCSALLY ) and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. SPEIER ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Arizona. 
Ms. M CSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Arizona? There was no objection. Ms. MCSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2052, the Protecting the Rights of Individuals Against Technological Exploitation Act, or the PRIVATE Act. This act would amend the Uniform Code of Military Justice to prohibit the wrongful broadcast or distribution of intimate visual imagines. Recent revelations that nude photographs of servicemembers were nonconsensually posted to social media websites like Marines United is abhorrent. This repugnant behavior is unacceptable, and we must work to prevent this deplorable behavior from occurring again. The Neanderthals who committed these acts are not emblematic of the vast majority of decent and honorable servicemembers who serve our Nation. However, the notion that any servicemember would think it is acceptable to upload, view, or comment on nude photos of their fellow servicemembers is a serious problem that must be fixed. This bill will help hold perpetrators of these types of crimes accountable. It will strengthen the Uniform Code of Military Justice by establishing an enumerated, punitive article that clearly prohibits the wrongful, nonconsensual sharing of intimate visual images, even when those images were initially given with consent. While the Uniform Code of Military Justice currently contains two general articles under which these crimes can already be prosecuted, this new provision will give commanders an additional specific tool and send a clear message to servicemembers that this behavior is unacceptable and is, in fact, a crime. The PRIVATE Act is designed to protect our servicemen and women and is supported by 26 different military and veterans organizations. While there are many divisive issues facing Congress today, as a retired colonel and 26year combat veteran of the Air Force, I am heartened that this bill enjoys such significant bipartisan support. I wish to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, including Ms. SPEIER for her leadership, for her cosponsorship, and for her devotion to our servicemembers. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Four years ago, I stood on the House floor and condemned the online bullying of U.S. Marine Corps servicewomen on Facebook. These web pages contained obscene and abusive pictures, and implied that women only advanced professionally by performing sexual favors. I sent a letter to the Secretary of Defense and the Commandant of the Marine Corps asking them to take action. I got a letter back from the Commandant which said, ‘‘I share your indignation.’’ I didn’t want him to share my indignation. I wanted him to do something about it. Neither he nor the Department of Defense inspector general did anything. Lack of consequences caused this cultural rot to spread further. The Marines United page, through which hundreds of ActiveDuty and veteran marines viewed thousands of nonconsensually distributed intimate imagines, damaged the lives and the careers of more servicemembers than I can imagine. In fact, many of these servicemembers were identified by name and the bases at which they served. Despite reports of this vile site, new versions continue to crop up and spread more destruction, unchecked by military leadership. Until now, the leadership failures that allowed this to go on for 4 years also extended to Congress. We did nothing except hold a subcommittee hearing on—wait, let me indicate what it was on—social media policy, without a single survivor brought to testify. This is not about social media policy. This is about abhorrent behavior by servicemembers against other servicemembers. Two months ago, a bipartisan group of Members held a hearing on this very issue, and we had victims who testified. One of those members, who was Active Duty, said that her Marine Corps drill instructor said to her and the other women during their training, ‘‘The only women that serve in the marines are sluts, lesbians . . . ’’ or a word that starts with a B that I won’t mention on the House floor. How destructive can that be? Today, that ends. My colleagues on both sides of the aisle are taking a stand. Today, I am honored and proud to support H.R. 2052 with my colleague, Ms. MCSALLY . This bill will ensure that nonconsensual pornography is made illegal by explicitly forbidding the sharing of intimate images without the consent of the subject. Right now, the reprehensible acts of nonconsensually distributed and consensually obtained photographs is not clearly defined as illegal under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. That is why this bill is a critical step in ensuring that our female servicemembers aren’t distracted from protecting the country by having to also protect themselves against online abusers and colleagues within the services. But let me be clear. Our work is not done. If the chain of command continues to see nonconsensual pornography as a ‘‘boys will be boys’’ joke instead of sexual violence, nothing will change. Such conduct must result in severe and immediate consequences for the perpetrators. The PRIVATE Act must pass, and it must be enforced. I also want to note that the passage of the PRIVATE Act does not apply to the civilian people in our country. Although 34 States have passed laws to address nonconsensual pornography, their approaches vary widely, and some are very flawed. That is why a Federal law is needed to provide a single, clear articulation of the elements of this crime to ensure that Americans in every part of the country—civilian and military—are protected if they are subjected to this heinous abuse. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2052. We have come a long way in 4 years since I found those vile Facebook pages. Four years from now, I hope I am standing here commending us all for stamping out the scourge of nonconsensual pornography. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. b1615 Ms. MCSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Guam (Ms. BORDALLO ). Ms. BORDALLO. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2052, the Protecting the Rights of IndiViduals Against Technological Exploitation Act, also known as the PRIVATE Act. This act will amend the Uniform Code of Military Justice to prohibit the wrongful broadcast or distribution of intimate visual images. As technology evolves, so, too, must our judicial systems; and it is clear, especially after the Marines United scandal, that there is a gap in the UCMJ. This bill addresses that gap and gives commanders the tools they need to address this horrific crime of posting or sharing intimate images that were previously privately shared. The bill clearly states that distributing or broadcasting intimate visual images without consent would result in punishment. This change in the UCMJ will send a strong message to any bad actors in our military and remind them that honor, trust, and respect are paramount whether you are deployed or back home. Servicemembers will know that sharing, broadcasting, or posting intimate images are illegal and will be punished under the UCMJ. I thank the gentlewoman from Arizona, Representative MCSALLY , for introducing this important legislation and diligently working it through the legislative process. I am also pleased to see such bipartisan support. Although the circumstances that led this bill to be written are appalling, it is heartening to see so many colleagues coming together today to make the necessary changes. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2052. This amendment to the UCMJ is very necessary and very timely. Ms. MCSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. TSONGAS ). Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Speaker, earlier this year, many of us heard of the Marines United Facebook page for the first time. On this page, women marines found that their intimate photos were posted without their knowledge and without their consent. Some had no idea these photos had ever been taken. Beneath the photos, marine members of the Facebook group wrote obscene and abusive comments about their comrades. This betrayal of marines by marines disgracefully disrespects fellow members, sows the seeds of distrust, and undermines the unit cohesion so essential to military readiness, putting our national security at risk. Today we bring a bill to the floor to make sure military members who have broadcasted or distributed certain private images are held accountable. H.R. 2052 creates a separate article under the Uniform Code of Military Justice that specifically criminalizes the wrongful sharing of intimate photos without explicit consent to do so. H.R. 2052 sends a clear message to all servicemembers and to our military leadership that this kind of abusive behavior will not and must not be tolerated. Members from both sides of the aisle have come together, and I thank Representatives McSally and Speier for their leadership in support of this commonsense legislation, and I encourage all of my colleagues to vote for it. Ms. MCSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. FRANKEL ), my good friend and colleague, and the cochair of the bipartisan Women’s Caucus. Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank my great colleague from California and I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their leadership on a subject of urgency. Mr. Speaker, in the strongest terms possible, I urge support of this bipartisan legislation called the PRIVATE Act that makes it illegal for military members to share explicit photos without consent. Our Democratic Working Women’s Group recently held a bipartisan hearing regarding the Marine United Facebook page where male marines posted thousands of nude photos of female servicemembers and veterans without their consent. At this hearing, we heard the testimony of two courageous female marines whose privacy was violated with the nonconsensual posting of intimate photographs. They described their embarrassment, their anger, and the vitriolic harassment by their marine brothers that followed, with threats of rape and violence, and stomachsickening posts like: ‘‘We should throw female Marines into a tub of acid and rip off their eyelashes.’’ Mr. Speaker, I am the proud mother of a United States Marine veteran, so I can tell you, I understand firsthand the selfless sacrifice a marine makes when he or she puts on their uniform. So I say to those warriors whose honor was violated: We stand with you today to declare that you were targets of behavior that we will not tolerate; and we will seek to punish those who offended and prevent similar conduct in the future because that conduct is not only degrading to brave patriots, it threatens the safety and security of our Nation. Ms. MCSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from New Hampshire (Ms. KUSTER ), the chair of the Bipartisan Task Force to End Sexual Violence. Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative MCSALLY and Representative J ACKIE  SPEIER for bringing us to the floor today. I speak on behalf of H.R. 2052, the PRIVATE Act. I was deeply disturbed by the Marine United photosharing scandal, as were many of my colleagues, both men and women, Republican and Democrat. Our Armed Forces are the greatest fighting forces the world has ever seen. It is unacceptable that members of the Marines sought out intimate photographs of their fellow soldiers and distributed them purposely online. Not only were the actions by the participants in the Marines United scandal morally repugnant, but they jeopardized our national security and endangered the security of both male and female marines. Women in the Armed Forces put their lives on the line every single day to defend our country, and they should not have their safety risked by their fellow marines. I am proud to support H.R. 2052, the PRIVATE Act, which will update the Uniform Code of Military Justice to ensure that the type of explicit image sharing we saw in the Marines United scandal is expressly prohibited. As the cofounder, with my colleague, JACKIE SPEIER , of the Bipartisan Task Force to End Sexual Violence, I understand the persistent challenges that the culture of sexual violence poses on our society. The conversation around sexual violence is beginning to change, thanks in no small part to Members of this Congress on both sides of the aisle. This legislation will support broader cultural reform and improve the lives of our brave servicemembers. This is an issue that transcends politics, and I am encouraged by the bipartisan support for the PRIVATE Act. I urge my colleagues to support the bill. Ms. MCSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to my colleague from California (Mrs. DAVIS), the ranking member on the Democratic side of the Armed Services Committee. Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for bringing this forward. The Marines United website was a disgusting breach of trust, and I immediately called for the perpetrators to be prosecuted. I appreciate General Neller coming to Congress earlier this year, taking ownership of the problem, immediately establishing a task force, and conducting multimedia and personal engagements across the Marine Corps. 
He said he would deal with this immediately and decisively, and we demand nothing less. I take him at his word, and he was clear in asking to be held accountable. While the Navy and Marine Corps have updated policies regarding social media and established notolerance policies for nonconsensual pornography, these still need to apply across all the services and must be codified into law. For this reason, I support the PRIVATE Act, and I hope that we continue to work together with my colleagues to ensure that this bill becomes law. Mr. Speaker, as the scandal unfolded, it became clear to me that, even from initial recruitment, servicemembers must be held to the highest ethical standard online, and prevented from joining the military should their behavior fail to meet that standard. Our children live their lives online, and the laws need to be updated to reflect that. The issue of nonconsensual pornography, unfortunately, is prevalent across our society. It has no place anywhere, but especially not in our military ranks. Ms. MCSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. If the gentlewoman from California has no further speakers, I am prepared to close once the gentlewoman does. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and, in so doing, I also want to make the point that our commitment to making sure that our armed services have the cohesion and readiness to serve requires us to take action on this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. MCSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. As a 26year combat veteran, I am deeply disturbed, but not surprised by the scandal. As a former commander, I know that you need to give commanders all the tools they need to hold perpetrators accountable. This is not just about good order and discipline. This is about the military mission. This bill gives commanders an additional tool in order to address this culture and to hold people accountable for their abhorrent behavior. I want to say that I appreciate the strong support across the aisle and our side of the aisle. This is strong, bipartisan support. I would urge all of my colleagues to support the PRIVATE Act. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Will the gentlewoman yield? Ms. MCSALLY. I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. JACKSON LEE. I want to add my support for this legislation, and I thank the gentlewoman from California and the gentlewoman from Arizona for their longstanding service. We have been dealing with bills dealing with sexual assault in the Judiciary Committee. Having listened to the young female soldiers who were impacted by Marines United, I know that this legislation that gives the military leadership additional tools to ensure that the depiction of women and others in the United States military, against their will, on social media, will not be tolerated and will not be viewed as an honorable act under the U.S. Military Code. Giving these tools will show that you will be punished and that men and women will be respected in the United States military. I ask colleagues to support this legislation. Ms. MCSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman THORNBERRY for his leadership on this issue. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. MCSALLY ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2052. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
b1630 DHS STOP ASSET AND VEHICLE EXCESS ACT Mr. MCCAUL.

DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY BLUE CAMPAIGN AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2017 Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1370) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to require the Secretary of Homeland Security to issue Department of Homeland Security wide guidance and develop training programs as part of the Department of Homeland Security Blue Campaign, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1370 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Department of Homeland Security Blue Campaign Authorization Act of 2017’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. VELA) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL). 
Mr. M CCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of my bill, H.R. 1370, to combat human trafficking. According to the FBI, human trafficking, which includes forced labor, domestic servitude, and commercial sex trafficking, is the third largest criminal activity in the world. It is a multibilliondollar industry that enslaves 20 million innocent victims around the world. We need a collaborative multiagency approach to combat this criminal activity. My bill recognizes and supports the work of the Department of Homeland Security to join these partners to combat this scourge on our society. This bill authorizes a vital lifesaving campaign at the Department to prevent human trafficking. This campaign is called the Blue Campaign. It is a Departmentwide effort to conduct outreach and raise awareness of trafficking. It provides training and materials to those in the best position to identify trafficking victims. This campaign works in collaboration with law enforcement, governmental and private organizations to identify and save those victims. The Blue Campaign has entered into agreements to provide training, raise awareness, and combat human trafficking. Currently, it enlists the help of numerous organizations who have witnessed trafficking such as airlines, hotels, truck stops, convenient stores, and package delivery services. The Department uses the resources and expertise of the CBP, ICE, USCIS, and the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers to help with this effort. Of note, my bill adds the Transportation Security Administration to this fight by training its personnel to recognize the victims of trafficking and pull these victims out of its viscous cycle. My bill also requires the Department to share information on patterns of trafficking and possible connections with terrorist activity, both internally and with the National Network of Fusion Centers. In 2014, I held a field hearing in Houston, Texas, to address the issue of human trafficking in our major cities, and we heard personally from the victims their stories of sexual abuse and human trafficking. That hearing highlighted the importance of collaboration and community involvement in combating this terrible crime. This DHS campaign furthers these collaboration efforts. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this legislation and the efforts of the Department to address human trafficking. I thank Chairman GOODLATTE of the Judiciary Committee for his cooperation in bringing this bill to the floor. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. VELA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1370, the Department of Homeland Security Blue Campaign Authorization Act of 2017. Mr. Speaker, human trafficking is a $32 billionperyear global industry, making it one of the most profitable forms of transnational crime with more than 20 million victims worldwide. Each year an estimated 17,500 innocent people are trafficked into the United States; almost half of those individuals are children. Trafficking victims can be of any age, race, gender, or nationality, and are largely found in workplaces within the manufacturing, agriculture, hospitality, and domestic service industries. Since 2010, the mission of the Department of Homeland Security’s Blue Campaign has been to bring DHS components together with Federal, State, 
and local law enforcement agencies, private industry, and other nongovernmental entities to combat human trafficking. The Blue Campaign has provided the Department with the necessary structure to uniformly train personnel in its components to identify and investigate these criminal activities. The Blue Campaign has proven an effective mechanism through which DHS and its law enforcement partners collaborate to dismantle human trafficking networks across the country and bring perpetrators to justice. The public awareness and outreach efforts launched through the Blue Campaign provide the general public, nongovernmental organizations, and private sector entities with tools to be active partners in the Federal Government’s efforts to assist victims of human trafficking and prevent others from being exploited. Earlier this year, DHS recognized its partners in the transportation and hospitality industries for training their employees and customers about how they can help combat human trafficking by identifying the signs and reporting suspected incidents. Over the years, the program has proven to be an important, multifaceted tool that leverages both government and private sector resources with the goal of ending the exploitation of vulnerable people. H.R. 1370 codifies the important program and emphasizes the importance of clear guidance and training for all Blue Campaign partners. This bill also underscores the importance of timely and routine information sharing amongst DHS components to ensure unity of effort in preventing and disrupting human trafficking. As a cosponsor of H.R. 1370, I believe that it is our responsibility as Members of Congress to do whatever it takes to stop the illegal and immoral smuggling of innocent people into the United States by transnational criminal organizations. Mr. Speaker, I ask my House colleagues to support H.R. 1370, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from South Dakota (Mrs. NOEM). Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman also for bringing up this important issue today. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 1370, the Department of Homeland Security Blue Campaign Authorization Act. A few years ago, law enforcement officers in South Dakota placed undercover ads on the internet, and they weren’t pretending to sell illegal drugs. What they were pretending to sell was young girls. In less than 2 days, over 100 individuals responded to that ad. Many of them were hoping to buy children for sex. Similar operations were conducted across the State in following months, and they had similar results. Many times, when folks think of human trafficking, they often picture a place far away overseas, but the fact is that it is happening right here—in our backyards many times. Those being targeted are often children, 12 or 14 years old, sometimes even younger. They are forced to turn tricks up to 50 times a day while their pimps work hard to get them addicted to alcohol and drugs so that they can further control them and their lives. It also deepens their dependence on their trafficker. Last Congress, we passed significant antitrafficking legislation, which I am incredibly proud of, but there is still more that needs to be done. Time and again, South Dakota advocates tell me that awareness remains a challenge, but a challenge that we can work together to overcome. That is ultimately the purpose of this legislation that we are considering today. Through the enhanced Blue Campaign, we can offer Americans from all walks of life the information that they need to spot trafficking in their backyards. If more people are aware of distress signals and how to respond, we can move faster towards ending human trafficking together. Mr. Speaker, for this reason, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1370. Mr. VELA. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. POE). Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for bringing up this legislation. Mr. Speaker, this past February, in my hometown of Houston, Texas, we hosted the 51st Super Bowl. For most Americans, the Super Bowl is a fun filled day spent with friends, family, and cheering on our favorite team. But for human traffickers, the Super Bowl has become an annual opportunity to expand their evil, criminal empire. Studies show that big events like the Super Bowl create large upticks in the trafficking and purchasing of sex trafficking victims. In order to counteract this, the Department of Homeland Security, as a part of its Blue Campaign initiative, began preparing months in advance before the Super Bowl in Houston. Through the Blue Campaign, the Department of Homeland Security raises public awareness, it forges antitrafficking partnerships, and brings suspected human traffickers to justice. Most importantly, it rescues victims of the sex trafficking trade. In advance of the last Super Bowl, the Blue Campaign worked with local, State, and Federal law enforcement agencies on the ground, as well as participating in several congressional briefings. One such briefing I hosted here in Washington. Everybody working together, all different law enforcement agencies, State, local, and Federal, had a great result in what occurred in Houston. Over 750 people were arrested, and 86 victims were rescued. Many more were likely spared being forced into the trafficking industry. Having worked closely with the Blue Campaign on this, and many other operations, I have seen firsthand the important role the Department of Homeland Security has in fighting the scourge of human trafficking. Mr. Speaker, as you know, trafficking is second only to the drug trade in the amount of money, criminal money, it brings in. And the Department of Homeland Security Blue Campaign Authorization Act will ensure that the critically important program continues to provide safety to victims and gets some justice to the traffickers and those wouldbe buyers of little children. Mr. Speaker, I commend the chairman for this legislation. And that is just the way it is. Mr. VELA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1370 was unanimously approved by the Committee on Homeland Security earlier this year. The partnerships that DHS has established through the Blue Campaign are critical to stopping criminal activity that comes with a tragically high human cost. By leading the charge and identifying and closing all possible avenues through which human traffickers smuggle people into the United States, DHS plays a critical role in ensuring the safety of children and other innocent people. Joint, concerted efforts that bring together law enforcement, nongovernmental entities, and private industry, and raise public awareness of this criminal activity, are important to ending the practice altogether. We must continue to support this unity of effort in order to aid and protect victims of human trafficking, and bring those who exploit them to justice. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman MCCAUL for his leadership in this effort, and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1370, and I yield back the balance of my time. b1645 Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Let me also thank my colleague, Mr. VELA, for his steadfast support of this legislation, as well as the entire Homeland Security Committee, which has worked in a very bipartisan fashion on this very important issue. This is not a matter of politics. It is a matter of saving our children from trafficking and sex abuse. We have all heard the stories. We have heard some of those here today, but I think there is nothing more criminal, other than perhaps what ISIS did yesterday, than the exploitation of children. Of course, that is what ISIS did yesterday in killing innocent children and teenagers outside a concert hall. The issue of human trafficking brings it to full bear: bringing children into 
this country and exploiting them, selling them on the black market, and sexually abusing them for a very long time. This bill is important and necessary. It really supports, codifies, and gives congressional backing and support to a very important program within the Department, and that is the Blue Campaign. I also want to thank Secretary Kelly of Homeland Security for showing the leadership to come forward with this campaign to address this horrible crime against our children and those moving into adulthood. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1370, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

REMOVAL OF NAME OF MEMBER AS COSPONSOR OF H.J. RES. 13 Mr. BLUM. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to remove my name as cosponsor of H.J. Res. 13. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. BERGMAN ). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Iowa? There was no objection. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2473) to ensure compliance with the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015, to make strides toward eradicating human trafficking, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2473 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Put Trafficking Victims First Act of 2017’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOODLATTE ) and the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON  LEE) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia. 
Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 2473, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Virginia? There was no objection. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2473, the Put Trafficking Victims First Act of 2017, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. Human trafficking has plagued communities and neighborhoods across America. Victims have endured horrific trauma, violence, and reoccurring abuse. As a result, there is a tremendous need for expanded victim services, improved data on the prevalence and trends of human trafficking, and effective mechanisms to identify and rescue trafficking victims. H.R. 2473 takes reasonable steps to increase victim services while improving upon the tools already available to combat human trafficking. The bill directs the Attorney General to provide a report on the effectiveness of State safe harbor laws to ensure these laws are based upon a survivorcentered approach. In addition to the report, the bill instructs States to recognize coping mechanisms and the symptoms of trauma as local law enforcement interacts with victims of human trafficking. Furthermore, the legislation provides for increased training and technical assistance for State and Federal agencies, prosecutors, and law enforcement on how to take a victimcentered approach to preventing human trafficking. This provision promotes evidencebased training in order to improve the physical and mental health services provided to victims. The bill’s focus on supporting victims continues as H.R. 2473 instructs the National Institute of Justice to establish detailed methodologies to review the modern trends and detail the prevalence of human trafficking throughout the United States. The survey will not only assess how victims of trafficking are accessing services, but, in addition, help estimate the prevalence of human trafficking in the United States. Moreover, H.R. 2473 will provide assistance to trafficking victims seeking restitution, many of whom still face many obstacles in Federal court. The bill directs the Attorney General to report on efforts to increase mandatory restitution for victims by providing Congress with data involving the number of Federal cases related to human trafficking in which restitution was ordered, as well as the participation rate of victims in trafficking criminal proceedings. Finally, the bill expresses the sense of Congress that States should implement traumainformed, victimcentered care for all trafficking victims. Mr. Speaker, Congress’ intent is clear: Protecting victims from the heinous crime of human trafficking is of utmost concern. I commend the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. WAGNER ) for introducing this important legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. 
AND THE WORKFORCE , Washington, DC, May 23, 2017. Hon. BOBGOODLATTE , Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC. DEARMR. CHAIRMAN : I write to confirm our mutual understanding with respect to H.R. 2473, Put Trafficking Victims First Act of 2017. Thank you for consulting with the Committee on Education and the Workforce with regard to H.R. 2473 on those matters within my committee’s jurisdiction and agreeing to make improvements to the legislation to address concerns. The Committee on Education and the Workforce will not delay further consideration of this bill. However, I do so only with the understanding this procedural route will not be construed to prejudice my committee’s jurisdictional interest and prerogatives on this bill or any other similar legislation and will not be considered as precedent for consideration of matters of jurisdictional interest to my committee in the future. I respectfully request your support for the appointment of outside conferees from the Committee on Education and the Workforce should this bill or a similar bill be considered in a conference with the Senate. I also request you include our exchange of letters on this matter in the committee report and in the Congressional Record during consideration of this bill on the House Floor. Thank you for your attention to these matters. Sincerely, VIRGINIA FOXX, Chairwoman. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY , Washington, DC, May 23, 2017. Hon. VIRGINIA FOXX, Chair, Committee on Education & the Workforce, Washington, DC. DEAR CHAIRWOMAN FOXX: Thank you for consulting with the Committee on the Judiciary and agreeing to be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 2473, the ‘‘Enforcing Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act,’’ so that the bill may proceed expeditiously to the House floor. I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of your committee or rejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives on this bill or similar legislation in the future. I would support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate number of conferees from your committee to any HouseSenate conference on this legislation. I will seek to place our letters on H.R. 2473 in the Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill. I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward to continuing to work together as this measure moves through the legislative process. Sincerely, BOBGOODLATTE , Chairman. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2473, the Put Trafficking Victims First Act of 2017. I congratulate the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. WAGNER ) and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. BASS) for the introduction of this legislation. This bill is intended to improve the implementation of the Justice for Victims Trafficking Act of 2015. The 2015 act expanded the Federal response to trafficking concerning services and benefits for victims, criminal justice, domestic sex trafficking of children, and interagency coordination and training. I support H.R. 2473 for several reasons. To begin with, this measure will strengthen the effectiveness of the 2015 act in various ways. For example, H.R. 2473 requires that training be provided for prosecutions of traffickers. When children fall prey to the sex trade and 
then are treated as criminals rather than victims, their injuries are compounded. We had the first human trafficking hearing of any committee in Houston, Texas, just a few years ago under the auspices of the Homeland Security Committee. Our committee determined this very point: that children fall prey and then become victims of the criminal justice system. That is not the way to deal with our children who are victims, innocent children who have been turned into human traffic products by the heinous traffickers. As such, this training is critical to ensure that human trafficking victims are treated as victims and afforded justice, respect, and dignity. Second, H.R. 2473 establishes a working group to develop best practices or best methods to assess the prevalence of human trafficking. We know that there is a growing epidemic of abhorrent practices of sex trafficking, and we must consider all methods to help law enforcement stop these crimes. The working group will identify barriers that hamper human trafficking data collection and identify what information should be collected, as well as ascertain current practices being used by different agencies and organizations that can be standardized into best practices. As a result, H.R. 2473 will help ensure the most effective prevention practices are standardized so that perpetrators of sex trafficking are ultimately brought to justice. Lastly, the legislation encourages States to adopt protections for sex trafficking victims. These victims are often very afraid to seek help, particularly from law enforcement because of the risk that they will be treated as criminals again rather than victims. H.R. 2473 recognizes the critical fact that children involved in sex trafficking are victims and not criminals. They absolutely should not be treated as criminals. In acknowledgement of this fact, the bill identifies a broad range of important initiatives that States should undertake that would provide meaningful assistance to these victims: upholding basic rights, facilitating ways to identify child trafficking, providing emergency longterm housing. Each of these initiatives should help ensure that these victims are not revictimized and help enable them to be guided back to a normalized life. Mr. Speaker, for all of these reasons, I am pleased to support this bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. WAGNER ), the chief sponsor of this legislation. Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOODLATTE ) for his leadership on this area of human trafficking, along with the gentlewoman from California (Ms. BASS), my good friend, for all of her support on this human trafficking issue. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to present the Put Trafficking Victims First Act to the House of Representatives. I am thrilled to have the opportunity to address the concerns of victims of human trafficking across our country. Too often, victims of trafficking are overlooked and underserved. This must stop. America needs to afford trafficking victims the same justice, protections, and dignity that other victims of crime receive. In my home State of Missouri, I have met with countless survivors, along with survivors across this country, and I have listened to their painful stories. They need help to rebuild their lives, and that is exactly what my bill will do. b1730 One important place to start is in the courtroom, where we need victimcentered practices oriented toward justice and recovery. For example, victims technically have access to mandatory restitution in Federal courts, but the sad reality is that, according to one estimate, sex trafficking victims get restitution in only 14 percent of Federal sex trafficking cases. This, Mr. Speaker, is unacceptable. My bill will direct the Attorney General to make mandatory restitution mandatory and implement victimfriendly procedures in Federal criminal cases. Another big problem is that we just don’t have good data on how to identify and rescue victims and put them on a path toward success. We don’t really know where to find victims, what portions may be coming from foster care, or what their age, ethnicity, or other characteristics are. We can’t help them if we can’t find them. So we desperately need good data and reporting in order to improve victim outreach. To answer this need, my bill establishes a national working group to develop robust methodologies to determine the prevalence and trends of tracking and evaluating how to best identify victims and address their needs. My bill will establish a national survey of survivors so we can better understand how victims are accessing help. Yet another problem is that we are failing to provide traumainformed care to victims, care that would help victims recover and cooperate with criminal investigations so we can put pimps and buyers behind bars. Lack of help for victims in the justice system can lead to revictimization, or even result in victims being criminalized for offenses they were forced to commit. That is why we will train agencies, law enforcement, and prosecutors across the country to implement victimcentered approaches to investigating and preventing trafficking. We encourage law enforcement and prosecutors to make every attempt to determine whether an individual’s participation in trafficking is, in fact, free from fraud, force, or coercion before arresting or charging them. Finally, victims of trafficking are mostly served at the State level, so it is critical that States improve how they respond to victims. My bill encourages States to improve outreach, screen children entering child welfare services and the justice system, screen foreign nationals who may be labor trafficked, create safe harbor laws, and develop emergency response plans. Mr. Speaker, together we can get victims of trafficking out of dangerous and abusive situations and create better, more accessible traumainformed services. I urge my colleagues to put trafficking victims first and to support this legislation. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from California (Ms. BASS), the original cosponsor of this legislation and one of the champions of protecting children and a leader of the Congressional Caucus on Foster Youth. Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2473, the Put Trafficking Victims First Act of 2017. I thank Ranking Member JACKSON LEE, Chairman GOODLATTE , and also Representative ANNWAGNER of Missouri for her leadership in combating trafficking in America. The importance of a bipartisan approach cannot be overstated or diminished. Over the years, we have made tremendous progress, but the work is far from over. The Put Trafficking Victims First Act is a great first step forward in addressing the perilous deficiencies in sex trafficking policies and services in America. As an original cosponsor of this bill, I am grateful for the inclusion of my amendments that serve to further support and strengthen this important legislation by providing necessary language and focus on young victims in the child welfare system. In drafting legislation that calls for data collection assessments to help identify and implement effective and responsive models of justice and relief services, we must always be cognizant of the need to draw awareness and find solutions to eradicate the devastating epidemic of young children who are in the U.S. child welfare system from becoming victims of sex trafficking. In particular, it is imperative that we better identify and screen the characteristics of children and youth involved in the child welfare and justice systems and that we provide greater access to appropriate housing and services from trained traumainformed care service providers. Far too often, we hear stories about victims who cannot access housing, shelter, or mental healthcare and are unable to expunge or seal their criminal records and are treated like criminals rather than victims. As the cofounder of the Congressional Caucus on Foster Youth, I am 
particularly concerned about what we are doing to combat the devastating epidemic of young girls in the foster care system falling prey to child exploitation and sex trafficking. I hear horrific stories of foster girls who have been trafficked far too often, and I hear that the average age of a girl being involved in trafficking is 12 years old. Mr. Speaker, this week we have over 100 youth here from 98 different congressional districts who will be shadowing their Members of Congress tomorrow. We met with the youth yesterday, and a number of them stepped forward and talked about being involved in the trafficking system and how they fell through the cracks in child welfare. It is important that we remember that the purpose of the child welfare system is to protect children who are abused or neglected. When we take custody of these children, then we—meaning the local, State, or Federal Government—in effect become their parents. So if your own child showed up missing and you don’t do anything about it, then obviously you are considered responsible. This is exactly what is happening with child sex trafficking in the United States. H.R. 2473 further encourages States to implement screening mechanisms for all children entering the child welfare system and criminal and juvenile justice systems to better identify child trafficking and connect them with appropriate services. I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 2473. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. POE), a member of the Committee on the Judiciary. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman GOODLATTE for the time and also his work on this issue of human sex trafficking in the United States. I support this legislation. I also compliment Congresswoman WAGNER , Congresswoman B ASS, Congresswoman MALONEY , and Congresswoman SHEILA JACKSON LEEand other women. I mention that because when we presented the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act 2 years ago and worked on that massive legislation that is excellent legislation, I am convinced that it was the women in the United States House of Representatives who got it done. They made sure that this legislation passed, and then they trotted down the hallway to the Senate and—I will use the word—‘‘encouraged’’ our Senators to take the bill up, and it passed there, and President Obama did sign the legislation. I am convinced there is nothing more powerful than a woman who has made up her mind, and the women in this House made up their mind about human sex trafficking. I just wanted to point that out. This legislation is important. There are many stories. I am going to talk about a 9yearold girl who lived not far from where we are today here in the United States Capitol. When Ashley’s mother died, she was left alone. Like any lost and lonely child, she sought the comfort that she needed of love and safety. A woman came in to Ashley’s life, offering her the care that Ashley was looking for as a 9yearold: comfort and love. Ashley felt like she was safe for the first time since she had lost her mother. She was an orphan in Washington, D.C. Little did she know that the woman who was being nice to her was faking it all because she was grooming Ashley to be a sex slave here in Washington. You see, traffickers exploit the vulnerabilities of victims, destroying their selfworth and their hope for a better life. In some cases, traffickers steal the soul of young children. They have no hope and they have no self worth. That happened to Ashley, this 9year old girl. She was trafficked on the streets of Washington, D.C., and online for 5 years. At 16, a peace officer here in Washington, D.C., arrested her for prostitution. She was brought before a judge, and the judge recognized that she was not a criminal, she was not guilty of prostitution. Children cannot commit the crime of prostitution. He recognized her plight and he ordered her into a treatment program to help her recover from being a trafficking victim. It is my opinion that that judge saved Ashley’s life. As was mentioned here on the House floor by Congresswoman BASS, the average age of a trafficking victim here in the United States of America is between 12 and 13. That means some girls are younger, like Ashley. She was 9. What a statistic. And, yes, it is mostly young minor females. Boys are trafficked. Adult females are trafficked as well, but the scourge is the biggest when it is our children. Like the laws of the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, they have increased judge and prosecutor training, giving them tools to deal with the scourge of human trafficking. It is nothing more than modern sex slavery. That is what human trafficking is. Congresswoman WAGNER ’s Put Trafficking Victims First Act continues to improve the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act and improve the process by encouraging more training and a focus on victimcentered approaches in the courtroom. I was a judge for 22 years in Houston. We had none of this legislation to help rescue and restore victims of trafficking, and now we do. We should remember that in our country we treat trafficking victims, like Ashley, like victims and make survivors out of them. Gone are the days that we are going to treat them like criminals. They are not criminals. They are victims of crime. We must stop the sale of children on the marketplace of sex slavery. This legislation helps do that. Victims like Ashley deserve treatment and care, and I support the work that has been done in the Put Trafficking Victims First Act, and I support the fact that it will help victims. As cochair of the Victims’ Rights Caucus, along with the gentleman from California (Mr. COSTA ), we understand the importance of victims and we understand the importance of this legislation. No more, Mr. Speaker. Not in our city, not in our States, and not in our country. And that is just the way it is. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to close. What an appropriate time so that I can add my appreciation to the chairman and the ranking member, Mr. CONYERS , the ranking member of the subcommittee that I am on, and to the chairman of the subcommittee. We have enjoyed working together on this legislation. To the cosponsors of this legislation, Mrs. WAGNER and Ms. B ASS. And then to the potent statement of my friend and fellow Texan, Congressman TEDPOE, who modestly indicated that we, as women, helped drive this, frankly, he beat us to the finish line riding his horse, but I want to thank him very much for his great leadership and interest in this very important area. b1745 This bill is a wonderful complement to the igniting of understanding about the vileness of human trafficking. I think it is important to take note that the Homeland Security Department has trained airline stewards to recognize human trafficking victims on airplanes. Many of them are children, camouflaged as an adult and their special child—niece or nephew—traveling together. This legislation is all about pointing out, finding, saving the victims, making sure they get treatment, and making sure that human trafficking is identified. So I am also pleased that this measure, as amended, requires a report on State safe harbor laws. As we all know, safe harbors play a critical role in preventing youth, forced into the sex trade, from being revictimized again and stigmatized a second time by the criminal justice system, almost similar to the little girl who was looking for love. Instead, she got victimized and turned into a human trafficking product. H.R. 2473 also fosters better collaboration among the Federal, State, and local law enforcement in the fight against sex trafficking and encourages States to adopt protections for trafficking victims by providing rehabilitation and recovery services for victims of human trafficking. Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to support this measure and, as well, to be reminded of all those children who will be helped and saved. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this fine legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOODLATTE ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2473, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ‘‘A bill to direct the Attorney General to study issues relating to human trafficking, and for other purposes.’’. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
HONORING MICHAEL WELGE (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and memory of a lifelong resident of my hometown of Taylorville, Illinois, my good friend, Michael Welge. Mike was a veteran, public servant, devoted husband to his wife, Judy, father, grandfather, and, again, my friend. Mike passed away on May 4, but he left a long legacy of dedication to his family, his country, and his community. As an Army veteran who served his country, Mike continued his service to military members as the commander of American Legion Post 73. Mike worked at Peabody Mine No. 10 for years before beginning a 22year career at the Illinois Department of Corrections. Mike served as a member of the Taylorville Planning and Zoning Committee for 25 years and was a member of many groups like the Taylorville FFA Association, the American Farm Heritage Museum in Greenville, ABATE, and Moose Lodge 1516. Mike is survived by his wife, Judy, son, grandson, and brother. He will be truly missed by all who knew him, and I consider myself blessed to have known Mike Welge as a friend. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP’S BUDGET PROPOSAL (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, budgets are about values. And President Trump’s budget breaks his promises to the American people. His 2018 budget is a disgrace. The plan cuts people’s access to basic necessities and retards decent standards of living. The American people want to create jobs, raise wages, invest in education, protect their pensions, and give people a chance at a better future. What does the Trump budget do for the heartland that voted for him? Great Lakes clean up? Zeroed out. Social Security Disability insurance? Slashed. Medicaid? Slashed. Public education? Slashed. We have seen this supply side economic shell game before. It ends with a massive tax cut for millionaires and billionaires, while leaving Americans living on the brink paycheck to paycheck, leaving them behind. Let’s recap. The Trump budget hurts working families, it weakens Social Security and Medicaid, it hurts students seeking to better themselves, it hurts seniors trying to pay for their medicine and insurance and who depend on programs like Meals on Wheels. I would encourage every heartland family with an elderly parent, an indebted graduate, or a trusting toddler to look at this budget and match it against the promises they heard versus what is being delivered. What a shame for our country. f 
HUMAN TRAFFICKING (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of millions of people worldwide, whose lives have been irreparably harmed by the scourge of human trafficking. Tragically, human trafficking is a $32 billion industry. This horrific practice is often difficult to detect, yet there are nearly 21 million victims of human trafficking throughout the world each year. It is estimated that 55 percent of these victims are women and young girls. Sadly, most incidents of human trafficking go unreported, while the victims suffer in silent pain. It is for these reasons that we must raise awareness of this terrible practice and work to combat the growing threat against these vulnerable people. As a member of the State assembly, I championed bipartisan measures to combat this modernday form of slavery, including the Trafficking Victims Protection and Justice Act. Yesterday, to continue this fight, I worked alongside my colleagues in the House to pass bipartisan measures to eliminate the scourge on humanity at the Federal level, and also today. Millions of men, women, and children are suffering at the hands of human traffickers and sex abusers. Thus, it is our duty to hold those who commit these vile acts accountable and to ensure justice for all. 
MEMORIAL DAY (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, this Monday, America honors its war dead. We call it Memorial Day. Many Americans do not realize that there are 25 United States cemeteries overseas for America’s war dead. The one in Luxembourg is one that I have visited and I find quite unique. During World War II, in 1944, the Germans crushed through the American lines in a surprise attack. It was called the Battle of the Bulge. My 92yearold father fought in that battle when he was 18. The German advance was eventually halted. One reason was because General George Patton and his army helped halt the attack by quickly advancing through and saving Luxembourg. After the war, the nation of Luxembourg agreed to a memorial there. The memorial is unique because the cemetery is a burial place for mostly Americans who were killed in the Battle of the Bulge. There are 5,076 Americans buried there—22 sets of brothers. And the average age of the soldier buried in Luxembourg is 19. This Memorial Day, let us remember all who have served and have given their lives and are buried all over the world, because, Mr. Speaker, the worst casualty of war is to be forgotten. And that is just the way it is. f 
REDUCING IMPACT ON DISEASE CONTROL (Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 953, the Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act, which eliminates the need to apply for additional permits for using pesticides already approved for widespread use under current law. The permitting process places an unnecessary compliance burden on farmers who simply want to protect their crops using already available pesticides that have been determined to have minimal or no environmental impact in their original testing process. But of greater concern is the impact on disease control. This bureaucratic red tape can have the severe unintended consequence of raising the difficulty for local mosquito control districts, and others, and increase the likelihood that mosquitotransmitted diseases can spread. The Zika virus, which reached epidemic levels last year, remains a serious threat in the United States, with 119 cases still in place and over 400 cases in U.S. territories. We are not out of the woods yet. This duplicative process hamstrings health officials and agencies who are responsible for suppressing these viruses and maintaining public safety. This legislation provides critical protections of our Nation’s food supply, as well as increasing our ability to combat public health crises, such as the Zika virus. H.R. 953 passed the House last year with bipartisan support, and I encourage my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to do so once again. 
RECOGNIZING BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. SESSIONS ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. 
Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the topic of this Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, tonight, Members of Congress who are Eagle Scouts are taking to the floor of the House of Representatives to say thank you not only to the Boy Scouts of America but to recognize and to highlight our opportunity while in Boy Scouts, and now, as Members of Congress, to talk about how important the Boy Scouts of America is to the youth, the young men and young women of this country, and, also, to highlight the leadership that takes place every single day in this country: men and women who volunteer their time to make sure that the Boy Scouts of America are prepared and ready to meet not only the times that we live in but the advances of young people and the challenges that they have. Tonight, as an Eagle Scout of the Eagle class of 1970, it is my opportunity to introduce Members of Congress and then to follow up at the end as we talk about how important Scouting is. Today, there are 1,262,311 boys in Scouting from ages 6 to 10 in Cub Scouts. There are 822,999 boys aged 11 to 17 in Boy Scouts of America and Varsity Scouts. There are 119,268 young men and young women between the ages of 10 to 20 who are engaged in exploring based upon programs that may be STEM or other Scouting programs. As you see, Mr. Speaker, the Boy Scouts of America is important to the youth of this country. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. COLLINS ), who is the head of our Scouting Caucus, and the Eagle class of 1963. Mr. COLLINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank Eagle Scout PETE SESSIONS for yielding. I am very honored to be standing with him today as the cochair of the Scouting Caucus, along with Eagle Scout JIMCOOPER  from Tennessee. There are, in fact, 33 Eagle Scouts— 23 from the House of Representatives and 10 from the Senate—currently serving in the United States Congress. But just as importantly, there are 150 Members of Congress who experienced Scouting, whether as a youth, and, perhaps, in the case of 33 progressing to the rank of Eagle Scout, or, currently as myself does, serving as an adult Scout leader. Scouting was important to many of us growing up. I think when a lot of us look back on our lives and say what was one of the larger impacts we had, I can tell you, in my case, it was Scouting. And the same is true for my 24year old Eagle Scout son. I can’t tell you how many different camping trips my son and I enjoyed together—what a great bonding experience for a father and a son coming right up through Cub Scouts. So for all of those Scouts today, as Eagle Scout PETESESSIONS indicated, who are currently involved in Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts and Explorers, Scouting is changing their lives, and it is changing their lives for the better. We have all heard the 12 points of the Scout law. That is a compass for the youth of America today, when they are faced with tough decisions, to look at those 12 points and remind themselves that a Scout is trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean, and reverent. Those 12 points of the Scout law are a compass for them to live their life and make the right decisions. b1800 Many cases I referred to the first three words of the Scout Oath, and we can’t talk about them enough, those first three words, ‘‘on my honor.’’ That is so important today for our youth to have a compass, to understand what honor is, and Scouting introduces them to that. But I will also tell you what Scouting is. It is young men, young boys having fun outdoors. Some say today the problem with youth in America is they have and they suffer from nature deficit disorder: They don’t get outside enough; they don’t know how to play outdoors; they are stuck with their electronic devices. Well, Scouting gets the youth of America outside. It is healthy. They get to enjoy themselves, learn all kinds of skills, but just the friendships that they get within Scouting that, over a lifetime, will help them as they become the future leaders of America. There are a disproportionate number of leaders in America today who were Scouts and, in fact, Eagle Scouts. Today, in President Trump’s Cabinet, we are honored as a country to have four Eagle Scouts: Eagle Scout Rex Tillerson, Secretary of State; Eagle Scout Rick Perry, Secretary of Energy; Eagle Scout Jeff Sessions, our current Attorney General; and Eagle Scout, Ryan Zinke, our Secretary of the Interior. I will tell you, in most of their cases, they would identify Scouting as a major part of them growing up and, maybe they didn’t know it at the time, but giving them the life skills that have served them to the point today they are serving our Nation. We have 27 Members in the bipartisan Scouting Caucus; many, but not all, are Eagle Scouts. I think all of us are proud to talk about our past as an Eagle Scout, but we also remind people, to this day, we are Eagle Scouts. Once a year, our Chief Scout Executive, Mike Surbaugh, comes to Washington, D.C., to present a report on the status of Scouting in the Nation today. We have a great reception for our Chief Scout Executive once a year to welcome him and Scouts from around the country as they present to us the status of Scouting in America today. I would be remiss if I didn’t recognize the last four presidents of the Boy Scouts of America. Our current president, Randall Stephenson, is the current CEO of AT&T. He followed Bob Gates, who was our Secretary of Defense; Wayne Perry, the vice chairman of AT&T; and our own Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, when he was CEO of Exxon, was the president of the Boy Scouts of America. So I think all of us today understand the importance of Scouting in our lives and, in many cases, just reflect back on the fun that we had as young kids and young adults. Once every 4 years, all the Scouts in America gather, with some from around the world as well, at our national Scout jamboree. We currently have a permanent Scout High Adventure site in West Virginia at the Summit. Eagle Scout PETESESSIONS and I, as well as others, 4 years ago, went to the Summit. And you know what? We just had fun. We went down the zip line. We went on some of the other obstacle courses. Even as adults, it was reliving our youth. And we intend to go back later in July for, every 4 years, as I said, they have the national Scout jamboree. Somewhere in the neighborhood of 40,000 Scouts from around the United States will gather for approximately 1 week and just have a lot of fun, get to meet others from around the country. So that is what Scouting is. I can’t think of a more healthy activity for young men to be involved in, and, I think, in many cases, certainly, the moms of this world understand the important values that their sons are getting, as well as the dads. I can just tell you, I am happy to stay involved in Scouting. As the co chair of the Eagle Scout Caucus, I am proud to remind people I am today an Eagle Scout. And we also have fun shaking hands with our left hand. That’s how Scouts do it, the hand closest to our heart. I was with our Secretary of State in Alaska a week ago and went to introduce myself. He put out his right hand to shake hands, as adults do, and I said: ‘‘No, sir, Mr. Secretary. As one Eagle Scout to another, we are going to shake hands the right way, with our left hands.’’ He got a big smile on his face because he knew exactly what I was talking about. So Eagle Scout PETE SESSIONS , I want to thank you for giving me the 
opportunity to talk a little bit about Scouting today in our Congress. Thank you for your leadership in our Special Order tonight, and I look forward to hearing from our other Members of Congress, fellow Eagle Scouts. I know it impacted their life. Thank you again for your leadership tonight. Mr. SESSIONS. Eagle Scout CHRIS COLLINS , thank you very much. By the way, one of those presidents of the Boy Scouts of America was Ed Whitacre. When I was at AT&T, Mr. Whitacre led the Boy Scouts of America, understanding how important it is. Ladies and gentlemen, the gentleman from Texas, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, the gentleman from Dallas, Texas, is also an Eagle Scout. JEBHENSARLING not only is a bright, young, thoughtful, articulate leader in the United States Congress, he is Eagle Class of 1971. Chairman HENSARLING , as an Eagle Scout, not only distinguished himself to Scouting, but also, that led him to Texas A&M University and then, further, to the University of Texas Law School. He is a young man who not only deeply believes in his country and his God, but he believes in the things that have brought him forward to become a leader in Congress. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas, Eagle Scout JEBHENSARLING . Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I certainly thank the gentleman for yielding. I have had many opportunities in my career to come to this House floor and speak about topics of great importance, but few are as near and dear to my heart as is Scouting. So, one, I want to thank the gentleman from New York for his leadership and the gentleman from Texas for his leadership and keeping Scouting alive not only in their hearts, but in the heart of the House and in the hearts of so many young men in America today. Mr. Speaker, as I think about my own life, I think how terribly blessed I have been. I think about the molders of my character, and, certainly, I thank the Lord for the blessing of being able to worship Him in the land of the free. And I think about the impact my church has had upon my life. I think how blessed I am to have parents like Charles and Ann Hensarling, who raised me in College Station, Texas, and how proud I am to be my mother’s son and how proud I was to be my late father’s son. But I also think about what Scouting meant as a molder of my character. Mr. Speaker, that is not what originally drew me to Scouting. I was originally drawn to the fun of it, to the high adventure, to the camping trips, to those Capture the Flag games that went on to the wee hours of the morning. Little did I know how long one could actually hunt for a snipe back in the early days of my Scouting career. And so I was drawn to Indian lore and canoeing and camping, and that was so exciting to me. So when I think about my Scouting career, Mr. Speaker, I think about, you know, the fun I had. I think about the friendships. There are people I haven’t seen for decades, but, you know, I think about a friend by the name of Dennis Gary, whom I haven’t seen in decades. But if I saw him tomorrow, I would know him because I would know him through his heart, because we experienced Scouting together, and so many others. I think about the many practical things I learned in my Scouting career. I hope I never fall into a hole and break an arm, but if I did, even today at my ripe old age, I could still tie a one handed bowline. I still know how to do that. I hope I am never lost in the forest for days on end, but, you know, Mr. Speaker, I know that, as distasteful as it would be, I could survive off of cattail root and dandelion leaves because that is what Scouting taught me. So Scouting is about fun; it is about friendship; but it was about practical things that I learned. Mr. Speaker, there is even a far more important aspect to Scouting, and that is values, the values that we learned. So even today, as a Member of Congress, I know how important it is to be prepared, to be prepared before I come to this House floor and try to convince fellow Members of this august body on actions that we should take in the life of a great nation. As we deal with so many issues about the lives of a great nation, I also remember, for example, somebody who wasn’t in the Boy Scouts—my wife. I know back in Dallas, Texas, almost every week of her life she is driving some indigent cancer patient to their treatments. I reflected that, although as Members of Congress we deal with matters of great importance that impact millions and millions of people, I have got to tell you, my wife, back in Dallas, Texas, does a good turn daily. It reminds me that I learned in Scouting how important it is to help one human life at a time and to do a good turn daily. When I look upon my colleagues here in Congress today, I think about a certain colleague, and I am not going to mention his name, but a colleague who at one time wasn’t quite keeping up with his diet. He wasn’t quite keeping up with his exercise. Although he had young children, he had a heart attack, and we almost lost this colleague, but he came back. It is a reminder how important it is to keep ourselves physically strong for our children, for our parents, for our colleagues, and for our friends. That is something I learned in Scouting, Mr. Speaker. I think about another friend whose wife almost was lost when she was diagnosed with a very serious form of cancer, stage IV. But there was an oncologist here in this area, in the Washington area, who was on the cutting edge of cancer research that saved her life, and she was—the percentages against her, there was a 99 percent chance she wouldn’t make it, but she did because somebody decided to be mentally awake. That is something else I learned in Scouting, Mr. Speaker, how important it is to be mentally awake. And one day, when I leave this institution, some of the finest people I have ever met in life I know will have served in the United States of House of Representatives, but, unfortunately, a couple of them represent the worst. A couple of them have turned in their pin stripes for prison stripes because somehow they lost their way. In Scouting, we are taught to orient a map with a physical compass, but we are also taught to orient the map of life with a moral compass. So I learned in Scouting how important it was to be morally straight, to have that internal compass to guide us at all times. So I will admit, I am not proud of the fact, Mr. Speaker, but you know what? The words, over the years, occasionally they are a little rusty to me. I don’t quite recite them as I once did. I don’t always recite the words: ‘‘On my honor, I will do my best to do my duty to my God and my country, to obey the Scout Law, to help others at all times, to keep myself physically strong, mentally awake, and morally straight.’’ So, yes, Mr. Speaker, occasionally the words are a little rusty, but the principles are as alive to me today as they were almost half a century ago when I first entered Scouting and followed that career all the way up to Eagle Scout, something I am so, so very proud of today. So, Mr. Speaker, I hope anybody who is watching the proceedings at this time will, again, understand how valuable Scouting is to all of us. It is not just important to my own personal life. It is important to the life of a great nation. Our first President, the Father of our Country, said that you cannot have a free society which is not a moral society. Scouting helps make certain we have a moral society. b1815 So I think of the fun, I think of the friendship, I think of the lessons, but, most importantly, I think about that moral compass for the map of life that has guided me and, with Scouting to come in the future, will guide the life of this great Nation. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Dallas for his leadership, I thank him for his friendship, I thank him for all he means for Scouting, and I thank him for yielding to me. Mr. SESSIONS. Chairman HENSARLING , Eagle Scout, class of 1971, thank you very much. Mr. Speaker, I hold a Scoutbook, something I call the second good book. Of course, we know in Scouting, the 
good book is the Bible; but to Scouters, also the second good book is the Boy Scout Handbook. This was given to me in 2010 by Bob Mazzuca, who is our chief Scout executive, and he gave it to me with really a guide to my life to continue down that pathway of talking about Scouting in great ways. And that is what we are doing tonight. I acknowledge that we not only have JOHN GARAMENDI , who is an Eagle Scout, class of 1960, who will be speaking in a bit, but on a bipartisan basis, this body has young people, young men who understood why they got into Scouting. They understood about their life. They certainly understand it now. At this time I would like to bring forth Eagle Scout FRENCH HILL, 1972, from Arkansas, a relatively new Member of Congress, not only a mature man, but a man who comes with the proxy of knowledge of what Boy Scouting has helped provide him. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. HILL), an Eagle Scout. Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman SESSIONS for holding this Special Order. It means, I think, a lot not only to the Scouts that are here in the House of Representatives and the Senate to recognize the importance of Scouting to our country, but to all the mothers, fathers, and Scouts that are seeing this proceeding on C–SPAN or will hear about it to realize that they are participating in something that is very special. I mean, I think of Scouting, really, Mr. Speaker, as a gift to the country for all of the reasons that the previous speakers have noted. I can’t think about Scouting without thinking about what it has meant to me, Chairman SESSIONS , and influencing on my young life. Role models is the first thing that comes to mind with Scouting. I think about my dad—who was not an Eagle Scout. He was a Sea Scout— and he ended up being basically a Life Scout for life, as people say in Scouting. But nobody was more influential to me in my youth than my dad—currently 91 years old—a Scout still at heart, and all the experiences we had together, how we bonded as father and son, and how, when I went off to college, Mr. Speaker, he continued to be a role model and adult leader for young men for years to come. That is the kind of person that is in every one of our communities all over this country, helping mold our young people through the Scouting program. Mr. Speaker, Scouting was my first paid job. I worked at a Scout camp. I earned, I believe, something like $10 a week, plus room and board, of course. It is when I first learned who FICA was because, at $10 a week, I wanted to know who took this $2 out of my $10 check. So I learned my first lesson about Federal economic policy and who FICA was as a Boy Scout working at the end of a very dusty parking lot for 7 weeks in the hot summer of Arkansas, teaching, pioneering, cooking, and camping merit badges. But I think of other adults besides my dad. I think about Angelo Coppola and Fred Bean, both constituents of mine now that I serve in the people’s House who were camp directors at that camp where I was a very happy employee and Scout for those summers in the early 1970s. So Scouting is about role models. Scouting is about character building, and that starts that relationship, I think, between our moms and our dads that are involved in the Scouting program, and what we give to kids today. And, boy, do we need that character development. The Boy Scouts of America was formed in 1910 and was inspired by British war hero Robert S.S. Baden Powell of the Scouting program started back in the U.K. A lot of people today who are involved in Scouting, even at this moment, Mr. Speaker, don’t know that the U.S. Congress presented a law to Woodrow Wilson, who signed it in 1916, chartering the Boy Scouts of America. We are chartered by the United States Congress, and what a special feeling it is for all of us who are Scouts in Congress today to recognize that something that was so important to our youth was, in fact, chartered by the body that we serve in today. In the early 20th century, Baden Powell was thinking about how to expand army youth training with a place for all boys to dedicate their efforts to peace, not war, and he wanted Scouting to improve boys’ lives by building their character, physical fitness, and outdoor skills. He put a premium on bringing boys together from all walks of life, mixing boys from the elite prep schools and boarding schools with those in working class homes. And we do that today, Mr. Speaker. We bring boys from all backgrounds into the characterbuilding exercises of Scouting. Mr. COLLINS , a few minutes ago, talked about the importance of outdoor recreation, and that was certainly what brought me in. My interest in Scouting was outdoor recreation. When you think about it, in 1910, people were moving off the farm. People were urbanizing. We were passing laws on child labor. We were trying to make sure our boys coming off the farm away from home would have a good set of role models. So Scouting was so important to that urban youth that they get character and that outdoor experience. And while that was a big deal back in 1910, I would argue, as CHRIS COLLINS  did today, that it is a big deal now. He talked about a nature deficit. There is no doubt that we have that today, just as we did in some people’s views back in 1910. In 2005, Leonard Sax wrote a seminal book that I urge not only all of our Members to read, but people watching these proceedings to read, ‘‘Boys Adrift,’’ where he argued that the lack of experiential learning and free playtime—particularly outdoors—in our childhood is diminishing our effectiveness in learning as managers and our interpersonal relationships. In 2008, Richard Louv wrote a book called ‘‘Last Child in the Woods,’’ where he argued that unstructured outdoor playtime is critical to childhood development. Well, that is exactly what Scouting does. It provides outdoor recreation, something I think is essential to childhood development; something that we have lost because of not only urbanization, but our changing behavior. One recent nature conservancy poll found that only 10 percent of American teens spend time outside every day. I can’t imagine on a day where the sun was shinning when I was a teenager that I ever spent any time indoors. My parents were always on the hunt: Where is he? He is outside somewhere. According to research by the Harvard School of Public Health, American adults spend less time outdoors than they do inside vehicles; less than 5 percent of their day. So I think the scientific research says our boys and our girls need outdoor recreation. They need experiential learning. This is what is the core of the Scouting program. Like air and water, our wild places, our National Parks are essential to the education of our children and have greatly benefited the Boy Scouts and the Scouting experience. I can’t imagine what my life would be like without that Scouting experience in terms of my love of the outdoors. The second thing that attracted me to Scouting was the leadership opportunities. BadenPowell said he wanted to be boydriven. And here, 101 years after President Wilson signed the Boy Scouts of America into law, Scouting prides itself, Mr. Speaker, on being boydriven, kiddriven. That is how we teach responsibility, character, and leadership. I like this famous list, Mr. SESSIONS , that we use at so many Eagle Scout ceremonies called ‘‘100 Scouts.’’ Mr. Speaker, of 100 Scouts, people who participate in Scouting: Thirty will drop out their first year, but they will remember the program fondly. Twelve will be from a family that has no religious organization or religious membership, and many will begin their first contact with the need to be morally straight and have, at their heart, a belief in God; 12 will be touched by the Scouting program. Five will go on to earn their religious award from whatever faith tradition they have. One will use their Scouting skills to save a life. One will credit Scouting skills for saving their own life. Eighteen will develop a lifelong hobby. Eight will find their vocation through the exploration of the merit badge work they did as a Scout. Seventeen will later become Scout leaders, like all of our Members here on this floor tonight. 
Four will become an Eagle Scout. Four out of that 100, Mr. Speaker, will earn the rank of Eagle Scout, and at least one will say they value earning that Eagle award more than their college degree. When it comes to the role that Scouting plays, it is something that I am so proud of because I have a Scout in Troop 30 in St. Paul’s Methodist Church in Little Rock, and I am so proud of the work that he has done on that trail toward Eagle. He is in the middle of planning his project now to combine his love of golf and Scouting. It is a service project at The First Tee of Central Arkansas in Little Rock, and I reflect it on the value of these Eagle projects across our communities in all 50 of our States and around the world. Just in America, using 2014 data, about 150—140 people earn their Eagle rank a day in the United States. And in 2014, they spent 8.1 million hours, Mr. Speaker, on their Eagle Scout project, benefiting our towns, our communities, all over this country. In the nonprofit world, if you applied a typical pay rate to that, a project rate that the independent sector uses of about $23 an hour, that is $188 million in public service value our Eagle Scouts have contributed across this country. Mr. Speaker, I want to tell Mr. SESSIONS how much I appreciate his taking time to highlight Scouting, and the value of Scouting to our town and our communities, but, more importantly, to our families at creating that sense of character that we have talked about tonight. I am one of those people that values my Eagle Scout award, dating back to 1972, from Troop 27, at Our Lady of the Holy Souls Catholic Church in Little Rock. And I am so proud that this many years later I still have the ability to support my son who is on that Eagle trail, and have the support of my dad that many long years after 1972 and my Eagle award because, in our family, we believe in a good turn daily. We believe in the Scout law. We believe in the Scout oath. And if there is one thing you need to do to survive in Congress, you have got to be prepared. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate Mr. SESSIONS for the opportunity to share these comments in support of Scouting. I thank the gentleman for his service to the National Eagle Scout Association and his long service to Circle Ten Council in Dallas, Texas. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, Eagle Scout Congressman FRENCH HILL, Eagle class of ‘72, thank you very much. It is with great distinction now that I recognize Congressman Eagle Scout JIMBRIDENSTINE , 1991. It was about a week ago that Eagle Scout Bridenstine came up to me and said: Pete, I want you to know that my son is involved in Scouting, and I deeply believe in it, but I think we ought to get together here. So it actually is Eagle Scout JIM BRIDENSTINE who said: Let’s get together our Eagle Scouts and talk about it. And I hope that the gentleman will have a chance to come on July 24 or so, as Eagle Scout Members of Congress, along with Senator MIKEENZI, and perhaps others—my Down syndrome son, Eagle Scout Alexander Gregory Sessions, Troop 890, Lake Highlands, Texas, will join me—that you, too, with your son, may be able to go with us to the reserve and do that. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. BRIDENSTINE ), a distinguished Eagle Scout. b1830 Mr. BRIDENSTINE. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Eagle Scout Chairman PETESESSIONS for his great introduction. It is an absolute honor to be here. About a week ago, I said I would like to get the Eagle Scouts together on the floor of the House of Representatives and talk about what it means to us to be Eagle Scouts, reflect on our history and our tradition and how great this institution has been for the United States of America for all of these years and how we must make sure that this institution stays strong for the years to come. When I brought that to the gentleman’s attention, he said, absolutely, we will do it. I didn’t talk to him again, and today we are doing it. I didn’t have to ask twice. As chairman of the Scouting Caucus here in the House of Representatives, the gentleman has led in a tremendous way. We have seen so many Eagle Scouts come to the Capitol, and he always gets all of us together and always has us talk facetoface with the Scouts—not just Eagle Scouts—and encourage them from the earliest days of their Scouting careers. I want to thank him for his leadership, because a lot of people could chair this committee, but he hasn’t just chaired it; he has led it, and that reflects greatly on him. When I think about my days as a Scout, I go all the way back to my Cub Scout days. In fact, it was even before I was a Scout. My brother was a year older than me, so he got to be a Cub Scout before I was a Cub Scout. He got to participate in this new thing that was going on in the lives of the Bridenstines called the pinewood derby. He had this little car—a block of wood with some nails and some wheels—and we watched that car streak from the very top of the track and come to a screeching halt where the track leveled out. In fact, this little blue car didn’t even make it to the end of the track. Of course, all of these other Scouts had all their fancy cars that had their rounded wheels and graphite on the nails and all of the weights put in the car. We didn’t know to do any of that. So my brother, John Bridenstine, who was a Cub Scout before I was a Cub Scout, had to endure the pain of being a Scout and wanting to have the fastest car, and his didn’t even make it to the end of the track. Well, I will tell you this. There was a Life Scout named Wayne Bridenstine, who was our dad. He was not going to allow any of our cars to ever again not make it to the end of the track. So we went to work trying to learn everything we could about this pinewood derby. We engineered a couple of what I think are the greatest cars in American Scouting history. The next year, the Bridenstine boys won first place and second place going forward. We won first place and second place in—I don’t remember which—but we reversed it going backwards. So we went from having a car that didn’t even reach the end of the track to winning the pinewood derby. Many years later, now I have my own son. He is in Cub Scouts and he does the pinewood derby. I committed to him the same thing my dad committed to us back in those days: We are going to win the pinewood derby. The first year we did it, we had great success. The second year, Dad got a little, maybe, overaggressive in his engineering. Maybe we put the weights a little too far back. As that car came down, it got really unstable and it wobbled. There were a couple of times it barely made it to the end of the track. But I will tell you this. The relationship that I had with my dad and that my brother had with our dad and that was necessary to pull us from not even finishing the race to winning the race and now the relationship with my son, Walker Bridenstine, are things that are important in our family and will be for many years to come. So those are some of my first ideas. Of course, Cub Scouts led to the Arrow of Light. The very next progression is to become a Boy Scout. So we searched a number of different troops across Arlington, Texas, and Fort Worth, Texas. We were in the Longhorn Council at the time. We eventually settled on Troop 83. I remember some of the leaders of the troop. Coach Wasden was a football coach at Hutcheson Junior High. That was somebody who was intense. He was serious about Scouts. Boy, if you were going to move up in rank, you were going to prove to him that you have done what was required. Of course, earning merit badges was important to all of us who were trying to move up the ranks. I will never forget the first summer camp that we went on. My brother and I were not able to go to the summer camp that our troop went on. So we went to this thing called the Maverick Camp, where we went with a bunch of Scouts we didn’t even know, but we had a great time. I am not going to lie to you; it was a challenge. I was in fifth grade. My brother was in sixth grade. It was the middle of August in Texas. We will just say the middle of August in Texas. It was just as hot at midnight as it was at the noon hour. 
We sweat a lot. We worked hard. We got seven merit badges that summer. That was intense. We didn’t know you weren’t supposed to get that many. We showed up back at our troop for the court of honor and people were shocked that we got seven. No wonder it was so hard. Nobody told us not to get seven merit badges in one summer camp. These are some of the memories I had. My brother and I were really challenged and we got that done. The next summer, we did three or four merit badges and had a lot more fun. These are some of the memories. I was the chaplain’s aid. As the chaplain’s aid, one of the things that I prayed for most was that the chaplain would show up on the campout so I wouldn’t have to do the public speaking in front of everybody. And here I am now as a Member of Congress who publicly speaks as a living. That is one of the things the Boy Scouts of America gave me: the ability to stand before an audience and tell people what was on my mind. My leadership experience was as the chaplain’s aid. My brother was the senior patrol leader for Troop 83. I was in the Arrow of Light patrol. He was in the Bison Patrol. He was the senior patrol leader. Summer camp after summer camp and all the things we heard, here is, I think, one of the important things that people need to remember: The Boy Scouts of America is an institution that trains leaders. You might not recognize it when you are in it because you believe you are just having fun, but then there come those moments in life when you really need to lean on the things that you learned as a Boy Scout, and it doesn’t even dawn on you until later that you actually learned these things as a Boy Scout. After I graduated from college, I joined the United States Navy. I became a pilot. Of course, one of the things we have to do is survival, evasion, resistance, and escape. In this process, we have to live in the woods for a period of time. We have to figure out how we are going to survive and evade for a week. During this time, you have to live based on the things that you see around you. You have to be able to start a fire. Some of these basic things I was able to do that all the peers around me had no ability to do because they did not have the life experiences in the Boy Scouts of America. We had to be able to cook a rabbit, something that I had done before and something that my peers, also Navy pilots, had not done. We had to able to land navigate with a map and a compass, which, to me, was second nature because I had done it for years trying to get to my rank of Eagle. But for so many people, it was a foreign concept to use a map and a compass to land navigate from point A to point B. I remember one group navigated point to point. Our group said: We don’t want to go point to point because if we miss the point, we won’t know we missed the point. So we are going to intentionally offset, hit the river, and then we are going to know exactly where we are. Of course, we didn’t miss the point. We knew where we were going. But some of my peers who did not have the experiences I had went well beyond the point and didn’t know they had gone down the point, then they had to come back. I could have told you that was going to happen because it had happened to me previously as somebody who was in the Boy Scouts of America. These are very reallife experiences that you look back on and say: Why was I able to do this? I was able to do it because I was in the Boy Scouts of America. You also look back and say there are things that are intangible, things that are not specific. I heard Eagle Scout JEB HENSARLING today—chairman, Congressman, Eagle Scout—talk about tying a bowline in one hand and how he doesn’t anticipate finding himself at the bottom of a cliff with a broken arm, but if he did, he would be able to tie a onehanded bowline and somebody would be able to pull him out. Certainly, that is exactly the same kind of thing that I learned when I was going through the same program. Just a couple of weeks ago, Walker Bridenstine, my son, had to learn how to tie a bowline. I was trying to teach him how to tie a bowline the oldfashioned way. I simply couldn’t do it. When I tried to tie it as a onehanded bowline, I was able to do it. It just stuck with me all of these years. So, again, these are specific skills. But the leadership, the ability to lead people are things that the Boy Scouts teach you. You apply these things every day in your life, and you don’t even know you are doing it. I will also say that, as employers, we look for leaders when we are trying to find whom we are going to hire. We see over and over again employers looking to hire Eagle Scouts from the Boy Scouts of America. So there might be somebody today who is watching this maybe on C– SPAN, maybe on the internet; and maybe you are a Boy Scout, maybe you are a Cub Scout, maybe you are not sure if you are going to stick it out. I will tell you this. Every interview I have ever gone on, I had a resume. On that resume was included the fact that I was an Eagle Scout. Even when I was applying for college, I put on my resume and in all of my extracurricular classes that I was an Eagle Scout. I would highly encourage anybody that is maybe at a lower rank but working hard to attain that Eagle, finish your Eagle Scout. My dad was a Life Scout. He moved when he was a Life Scout. He never finished his Eagle. His brother, JIM BRIDENSTINE , my uncle, did finish his Eagle Scout. Of course, my brother and I both finished our Eagle Scout, and now our kids are in Scouts, and we are going to do everything we can to help them finish their Eagle Scout. Not only did I put it on every resume, not only on all of my college applications, I will tell you, I also ran for Federal office. The first thing I did in my campaign commercials is tell people: My name is JIMBRIDENSTINE , and I am an Eagle Scout. Before I told them that I went to college or before I told them that I was a Navy pilot, I told them that I was an Eagle Scout. I think it is important for people to understand that some folks have a desire from an early age to achieve. When employers look at a resume, when voters look at somebody running for office, they want to see that. I will tell you, there was somebody who came into my office not too long ago wanting a job. I had a number of great candidates. It was nearly impossible for me to pick which one. We all know this: When you get to be a Member of Congress, you get hundreds of resumes the next day. I was getting down to the end, and I was trying to figure out which one. I got down to three. When they left my office, one of the three said this: One other thing I need to let you know; I am an Eagle Scout. That did it for me. I knew at that point that this young man had committed himself to something much bigger than himself from an early age. That person now works in my office. I look for that. I know employers across this country look for that. It speaks volumes to the character and the training of the individual. That will continue. I will tell you, when you think about all of the astronauts in the United States of America, the 316 or so of them in the history of the United States of America, 40 of them were Eagle Scouts. That is not by accident. I will tell you that is a much higher percentage than the number of Eagle Scouts who are produced in the Boy Scouts of America, and it is certainly a much higher percentage than the number of Eagle Scouts that exist in the population of the United States of America. So this is something that employers look for. I took my 11yearold son to the Air Force Academy just about a month ago. I took some brochures about what it takes to get into the Air Force Academy. There is all kinds of stuff in there about being an athlete and being a great student, but one of the six criteria that they look for is: Are you an Eagle Scout at the Air Force Academy of the United States of America? I would also argue they probably look for the same thing at West Point and the Naval Academy. These are things that employers look for, that schools look for, that the military looks for. These are the character issues that are important. So if you are in Scouting today, my encouragement to you is to finish, get your Eagle Scout. If you are below the 
age of 18 and you have still got time, I would encourage you to join and get your Eagle Scout. It has been important for me. It has been important for my brother. It has been important for my family. b1845 My uncle Jim’s son, Shane, my cousin, is also an Eagle Scout. This is a tradition of the Bridenstine family, and I would encourage you to make it a tradition in yours. Mr. Chairman, I just want to say thank you for your leadership and thank you for leading this effort. Mr. SESSIONS. Eagle Scout JIM BRIDENSTINE , Member of Congress from Oklahoma, Eagle Class 1991, thank you very much. The Scouting stories of leadership, of character, and of opportunity began in my life with my father, who was an Eagle Scout. His father, Dr. Will A. Sessions, in 1947 wrote the original God and Country Award Handbook. I wanted to be an Eagle Scout because of my dad. I have two young sons: William Steele Sessions II, who is an Eagle Scout, age 27; and Alexander Gregory Sessions, a Down syndrome young man, an Eagle Scout, who is 23. Scouting is in our blood, we believe it, but it is also in family blood. JIM BRIDENSTINE spoke about it, and C HRIS COLLINS spoke about the Eagle Class of ‘63. This other next young man who is here will talk about Scouting and what a difference it makes. I wish we had hours, Mr. Speaker, but the rules allow 1 hour. He is a young man from Pennsylvania, Eagle Scout GLENN ‘‘GT’’ THOMPSON . I had an opportunity to go to Pennsylvania with the Chief Scout Executive and give GT THOMPSON his National and Distinguished Eagle Scout Award and pin him. GLENN ’s wife is a Scouting widow. She is proud of her Eagle Scout sons, but she knows that the weekends are made for Scouting. GT THOMPSON is a man who will be with me again at the Summit Bechtel Reserve this year for the Scouting Jamboree. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the distinguished gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON ). Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I thank you so much for this opportunity. It is great to have a distinguished brother Eagle Scout like yourself. Mr. Speaker, Scouting has been a part of my family—or I have been part of the Scouting family, actually, since I was 11 years old. When I was 11 years old, my mom and dad did an amazing thing; they did what today I would call a good turn. It was really an amazing turn. They actually opened their home up—and this was appropriate since we are talking about a lot of foster youth this week, kids that grew up in foster families. They opened our family up to a boy that was just 2 years older than I, Bob. Bob came as a foster brother, and he is still my brother today. Bob has some special needs. Bob had been bouncing around foster care homes his whole life, but when he came to our house, he didn’t bounce anymore. He stuck. Like I said, he became my brother and is my brother today. My mom and dad made a promise to him. One of the positive things that happened to Bob in the home he had been living in prior to coming to our home was that he got involved in a Boy Scout Troop. That Boy Scout Troop experience did amazing things for Bob. It really did. It was life changing for him because it allowed Bob to have success experiences, to enjoy the outdoors, and to flourish with things that he really developed a passion for. As an 11yearold younger brother, I lucked out. When mom and dad took Bob back over a couple of valleys to the Scout Troop where he was associated with—there was no Scout Troop in my hometown at the time—I got to tag along. I was 11 years old, and I never looked back. I have been involved in Scouting since I have been 11 years old. I went on to achieve and earn my Eagle Scout Award. I have served as a Chapter Chief and a Juniata Lodge Chief in the Monocan Lodge in the Juniata Valley Council with the Order of the Arrow. I went on to be a Scout Master for 30 years. One of the hardest parts about coming to Congress was the fact that I wasn’t going to be home to be able to work with those youth leaders who were leading the troop for Scout meetings, campouts, and events on the weekend. That was the hardest part about taking this job because I had been a Scout Master for almost 30 years. I had trained Scout Masters, I was a course director, and I had served my council as a council president. I am still involved with Scouting. I was back at my old stomping ground at the Seven Mountains Scout Camp in Spring Mills, Pennsylvania, on Sunday for an Eagle Scout court of honor. Here is the cool part of that: at that site over 70 years ago, my fatherinlaw received his Eagle Scout Award. Now, I am not saying it should be a prerequisite for picking out a wife that her dad is an Eagle Scout, but it worked out okay for me. It wasn’t a bad thing. So Scouting has been a big part of our family. My wife, Penny, has been a Cub Scout leader and a committee member, and, yes, a Scouting widow when our three sons and I, at different times, would pack up and go off to camp and High Adventure. Sometimes she would come along, actually. A lot of times she was left at home. Unfortunately, she was there to accept all the dirty laundry at the end of the weekend or the week, but she is just as much a Scouting leader. When I think about a great Scouting leader, my wife, Penny, comes to mind with what she has done. I enjoy the opportunities to go out to Eagle Scout courts of honor. It really is a great opportunity to reconnect and to be a part of Scouting. I enjoy going to Girl Scout Gold Awards as well. So when I go there, normally I will look at the new Eagle Scout. I will talk about how we are there to celebrate all the merit badges they have earned, the citizenship that has been reflected in their actions, the character that we have seen, and the service that they have provided that now entitles them to be able to have that red, white, and blue piece of ribbon with a piece of metal in the shape of an eagle hang from their chest. I also tell them they are ready for one last test question. I will look them in the eye and say: It has been over 100 years since Scouting came to these shores from England, where Scouting was first originated. So the question I give them is: Over 100 years, how many Eagle Scout Awards have been given away? These kids are really smart. Somehow they are trying to do the math in their head. I stop them, and I say: Whoa. Stop. This is a trick question. The answer is zero. They have all been earned. None of them has ever been given away. I talk about how now, as new Eagle Scouts, they have this tool chest that they carry with them. They don’t carry it physically in their hands; they carry it in here. And it really is the principles of Scouting, because we stop and we start our meetings, we start our meetings, we end our meetings, we do our campouts and our Scouts’ own worship services. We are always using and repeating the 12 points of the Scout law and three parts of the Scout promise. We do that because we want these boys who start out as young boys and become men to have muscle memory. Muscle memory is not just on the good days where it is easy things, where things are going well and we are all celebrating and highfiving each other and life is good, but on the bad days. Bad days do come. Life will be hard at times. We want them, especially in those times, to be able to rely on that muscle memory of those principles of Scouting. I talk about how in this Chamber we are here voting. The chairman knows this. There are 435 of us. It is kind of interesting if you watch how people make up their mind to vote. It is pretty diverse sometimes. But for people like myself—I will take the liberty. I know this man well. This gentleman right here, Mr. SESSIONS , is an Eagle Scout. I fall back on the principles of Scouting. I ask myself four questions when it comes time to vote. The first question is: In the decision I am about to make, what is my duty to God? Is the decision righteous according to God’s Word and my faith? Now, I said there are four questions. But if the answer is ‘‘no’’ on the first one, I don’t go on to two, three, and four. I stop right there. If the answer is ‘‘yes,’’ then the next question is: In the 
decision I am about to make, what is my duty to country? What does the Constitution have to say about this decision that is before us? The third question I ask is: In the decision I am about to make, what is my duty to others? Now, that one is a little harder because that is like: How does this impact more than 730,000 citizens that I have the privilege and honor to represent—16 counties, 24 percent of the landmass of Pennsylvania? Finally, the last question is: What is my duty to self? Now, for those who maybe it has been awhile since you have been involved in the Scouting family or maybe you just never had that opportunity, there is still time for everybody to get involved and support Scouting. There are a lot of volunteer jobs out there that can be filled. What we mean when we say duty to self, it is not selfserving. We define that by in every action we take and every decision we make, we are prepared to do our best. That is a reflection of the Scout motto and the Scout slogans. So those are principles as Eagle Scouts I really do believe that, by that point, it becomes muscle memory. Any youth, for whatever period of time they have the opportunity to serve in Scouting, we know based on the research division of the Boy Scouts of America that it makes a difference in their lives. I will finish up with this. I have said that, as a Scout Master for 30 years, I have seen this work its way out countless times, but let me take a personal privilege and just mention three particular Eagle Scouts: Parker, Logan, and Kale Thompson, my three sons. They are all three Eagle Scouts. They are all adults now. They are scattered—if anything, maybe one flaw is we made them too independent. They are now flourishing, one in Elgin, Illinois; one in San Antonio, Texas; and one in Trenton, New Jersey. Independent—I guess Scouting will do that. You learn to fly as an Eagle Scout. I will tell you what I have seen. Parker today is a great dad. What he does with his two little guys, I see the lessons he learned in Scouting that just come through in how he nourishes. Logan, my second son, is a soldier. Although I worried about him, I didn’t worry as much when he was deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan because I knew that, as an Eagle Scout, he could handle whatever came to him. My youngest, Kale, is a music teacher today who nourishes and just serves youth, kids in middle school, and makes such a difference in their lives. In the lives of my three sons, I see how being a Boy Scout and an Eagle Scout has made them better men and made them better in all the roles that they serve. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I thank Eagle Scout GLENN THOMPSON , Eagle Scout 1977. On behalf of Chief Scout Executive Mike Surbaugh and Members of Congress who gathered together this evening to tell another story, I intend to do it again next month. I intend to get JOHN GARAMENDI , who is one of our dear friends from California, Eagle Class of 1960. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Eagle Scouts of Congress who had time to come tonight, myself, CHRIS COLLINS , JEBHENSARLING , F RENCH HILL, JIM BRIDENSTINE , GT T HOMPSON , I am thankful for the hour you have allowed us to tell the story about the Boy Scouts of America, about exceptionalism, about the Order of the Arrow, and about the opportunity for character to lead a great nation. Mr. Speaker, we are thankful for the time. We will be back. We hope that we leave our campsite better than the way we found it. That is what we try to do every day. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
THE PRESIDENT’S BUDGET The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. FASO). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from California (Mr. GARAMENDI ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues who, for the last hour, have talked about an extremely important part of America’s social fabric: the Scouting programs of America. I thank them for bringing to Congress and to the American people the importance of Scouting at all levels. And for those of us who have achieved the rank of Eagle Scout, much was discussed. Equally important are the men that enter and only spend a couple of weeks and do not pass beyond the Tenderfoot level because they, too, have achieved, at least in part, the opportunities that Scouting presents. I will talk about that more in the future, and I will look forward to that discussion. In the meantime, let’s see if we can now talk about other things that are before Congress and the American public. Mr. Speaker, almost unnoticed as a result of all of the issues—all of the controversies surrounding the President here in the United States, the controversies of Russia and Russia’s involvement in the election, the firing of Comey and the investigations now conducted by a new special counsel, and, of course, the President’s foreign travels, with all of that, we have basically not heard much about another extremely important and quite possibly a much longer lasting thing that has happened. Today the President presented his budget. A budget presented by the President is often just waved aside by the Congress and considered to be dead on arrival, and surely this one should be. But I want to back up for a moment and I want us all to ponder exactly what it is that the President has proposed. b1900 Because, you see, the budget, whether it is a Democratic budget or a Republican budget, an Obama budget or a Trump budget or a George H.W. Bush budget, those budgets are a statement of priorities. They are a statement of the value, the values that is what it is that the President thinks is important and how that fits into the American society. We need to really understand and value the statement that the President, President Trump, has made in presenting to us his priorities. We ought not just wave it aside and say it is of no consequence because, after all, we are going to rewrite it and we are going to write our own, which is the tradition. However, it would be a gross mistake not to analyze what it is that the President of the United States of America, the strongest, the wealthiest country in the world, has proposed. Take a careful look, America. Don’t just brush it aside. This is what the President wants. This is what he wants us to be. This is his vision of America. I must tell you, it is awful—not my words only, but the words of many Republican leaders, of, obviously, the Democrats. Take a look, America, at what it is he is proposing. I am going to run through some of this because we need to understand, Members of Congress, we Americans need to understand what it is that this President wants us to be, what it is he sees as America. I am going to go through just some things very, very quickly, and then we want to go into it perhaps in a little more detail. Medicaid is a program that has been in existence for some 60plus years. It is a program that provides healthcare to the poor. It is a program that provides care to seniors. It is a program that is relied upon all across this country by families so that the children and adults can get medical care. The President has proposed, in his budget, a $610 billion reduction in Medicare on top of, in addition to, an $800 billion cut in what we know now as Trump and RyanCare, the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. A $1.5 trillion reduction in medical services to the poor. And they are not all kids. They are not all families. More than half of that money goes to seniors in nursing homes. This is the vision of the President of the United States: $1.5 trillion reduction in medical services over the next 10 years to working men and women just above the poverty level, to seniors who are in nursing homes, and to women and children who are below the poverty level. This is his vision of healthcare in America. And that is not all. That is not the end of the story. In the 1990s, we knew that children not covered by Medicaid or, in California, MediCal were not getting medical services; and so the American people, through their representatives in 
Congress and the Senate, created what we now know as the Children’s Health Insurance Program, CHIP—Children’s Health Insurance Program. And so what is the vision? What is the value? What is the moral purpose of our President? He would cut $3.2 billion out of that program and effectively deny medical services for the 6 million children that are currently covered by the Children’s Health Insurance Program. For the aged, blind, and disabled—the aged, blind, and disabled Americans— that receive supplemental Social Security programs, $64 billion would be cut from those aged, blind, and disabled who receive supplemental Social Security insurance. Students? How many times on this floor of the House of Representatives have we heard Democrats and Republicans talk about the terrible problem of student loans, the huge cost of providing educational services? So what is in this budget? Student loans, financial aid, and repayment, $143 billion reduction. How does that help our educational program? How does that help students who are suffering under the cost of higher education? I don’t know what the answer is except it does not. For men and women who are working at minimum wage or below minimum wage across the United States, there is a program that was established by Richard Nixon called the earned income tax credit to encourage people to work. Men and women that are out there working but at a low wage, minimum wage, the earned income tax credit was established to lift them up to a liveable amount of money and encourage them to continue to work. What does the President propose? Well, let’s cut, by $40 billion, the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit. It goes on and on. This is President Trump’s statement of what he values in America. I think it is immoral. I think it is terrible public policy, and, when coupled with the rest of the story, it becomes an abomination. The rest of the story, the rest of the story is the most massive tax cut ever for the wealthy in the United States. You take that tax cut that has been proposed in the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare, and you couple it with the tax cuts that are embedded in the President’s budget, and we are talking somewhere north of $3.5 trillion tax cuts, 80 percent of which goes to the top 20 percent of America’s income earners. All the discussion last year about income inequality from President Trump, from Hillary Clinton, from everybody else about income inequality and the problem it presents to America was somehow forgotten. Because, when you take the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, which some call the American Health Care Act now, and you couple it with this budget, the tax cuts that are embedded in both of them amount to the largest transfer of wealth ever in tax policy from the poor, from the working Americans, to the top earners in America, to the superwealthy. If you are concerned about income inequality, this is exactly backwards. It is from the working men and women, the middle class of America and the poor to the wealthy. That is exactly what is happening here. Is that a rational vision of America? Is this a sense of value of what America is all about: more for the wealthy, less for the working men and women, the middle class, for the families that presumably—presumably—were at the heart of last year’s election? Yes, we heard Mr. Trump and we heard Ms. Clinton go around the Nation talking about how we need to raise up the middle class, how we need to deal with this income inequality, what a problem it was for our society and our economy, months and months of political rhetoric. And now we see what is actually—actually—taking place: the greatest transfer of wealth from the middle class and the poor to the wealthy that has ever been found in any piece of legislation proposed. God help us if it is enacted. Watch carefully, America. This budget, the repeal of the Affordable Care Act together with the proposed tax cuts, will devastate, seriously harm, personal lives in America by taking away their health insurance, by taking away their money that they depend upon to pay their rent, to put food on the table, to care for their children. This is not the America that I want to see, and I don’t think this is the America that the American public voted for. Whether they were a Democrat or a Republican, whether they voted for Trump or Hillary, they did not envision an America that would take $1.5 trillion out of the Medicaid program, of which 50 percent of that money goes to seniors in nursing homes. I don’t think that is what they had in mind when they voted last November. That is not what they were promised. That is not what either of the two candidates promised. They promised to deal with this income inequality issue. They promised, both of them, to provide more healthcare, not less. That is just on this one side of it. Neither promised massive tax cuts for the superwealthy. In fact, both railed against the way in which we have seen those at the top of the heap benefit while the rest were stagnated. Both candidates did that. And yet the proposal that has been put before this Congress in the last 127 days has been quite the opposite. The repeal of the Affordable Care Act, ripping away healthcare benefits for 24 million Americans, and now on top of it, this budget proposal that the President has given to us. b1915 I want to take just another moment because this one ought to be close to every American. In the President’s budget proposal, there is a $7 billion reduction for research in the National Institutes of Health. What does the National Institutes of Health do? It does research. It does research on disease. Over the years, Democrats, Republicans, both sides of the aisle have put forth proposals to advance and increase the research in healthcare. And the result? The result of that is this. I have used this many times on the floor. As I looked at the President’s proposal to cut $7 billion out of the National Institutes of Health, I thought we ought to come back to this. Deaths from major diseases over the years. Because we have invested in research, we have seen breast cancer deaths decline by 2 percent, prostate cancer decline by 11 percent, heart disease decline by 14 percent, stroke by 23 percent, HIV/ AIDS by 52 percent. That is what happens when you invest in research. That is what happens when we take the taxpayer money and we put it into research on healthcare and medical issues. Today, the National Institutes of Health has $5 billion of valuable research projects that cannot be funded, research projects on all of these. Instead of adding an additional $5 billion, the President proposes to give that $5 billion to the wealthiest of Americans. The top 40 families in America, under his proposals, would receive a $7 million reduction in their taxes. And I daresay that four or five of those families are either the President’s family or in the Cabinet. This purple line here, this one, over the last year, we have increased the funding for Alzheimer’s from just over $500 million to just under $1 billion. This one is out of control. Every family in America is experiencing the effects of dementia and Alzheimer’s. My family. My motherinlaw spent her last 3 years in our home and died of Alzheimer’s. It is not unusual. In fact, it is common. Incidentally, cancer is some $6 billion a year for research; heart disease, $5 billion; HIV/AIDS, about $3 billion; Alzheimer’s about $900 million. We know that if we were to spend the money, we could delay the onset, dramatically improve the lives not only of the individuals but of the families. So what does the President propose? Not adding $5 billion for research that we know would provide benefits, extend the lives of Americans. He proposed to cut by $7 billion. Is this a statement of his values, of what he thinks is important, of his morality, of his administration? On the floor of the House, in the cloakrooms, what is argued and often said is that each and every bill that passes here, each and every proposal that we introduce, is a statement of our own personal sense of morality of what is right and what is wrong, of values. Today, I looked at the Hill papers, what we fondly call the Hill rags, three of them. The top story is not the President’s budget. The top story is the 
President’s scandals. But I will tell you this: This budget is the real story because this is going to live on. This is what we will be fighting about. All the issues of the scandal in Russia and everything else will be dealt with by others and some of our committees, but this is what is going to affect the American public in their homes, in their lives, in their healthcare, in their education, and in their jobs. The President proposed a budget, and it is a reflection of what he believes to be important. That is a scandal. I can go on and on here, and I suppose I promised some that I wouldn’t. There is much that we can do. There is much that we need to do. We have great needs in the United States. We need an infrastructure program. We need a healthcare system that provides benefits to all in which the costs are controlled. We have a military and we have national security, and we will debate these things, but I cannot let a day go by without contemplating what it is that the President has proposed to America. Not to us but to America. And it is not good. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
THE DETERIORATING SITUATION IN VENEZUELA The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. ROS LEHTINEN ) for 30 minutes. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I am so grateful to Mr. ALBIO SIRES, my good friend from New Jersey, the ranking member of our Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere in the Committee on Foreign Affairs for joining me tonight for this Special Order regarding the deteriorating situation in Venezuela, demonstrating not only the bipartisan nature of this issue, Mr. Speaker, but also the need for the United States, and specifically the Congress, to be even more engaged. As Mr. SIRES knows—and we will hear from him in just a few minutes— the situation in Venezuela, as you can see here, is becoming more desperate by the day. The humanitarian situation is getting worse, if one can imagine that. The Maduro regime continues its flagrant human rights violations, and, despite the latest round of sanctions against human rights violators imposed by our excellent Treasury Department, the United States needs to take more decisive steps in support of the people of Venezuela. Mr. Speaker, at least 48 Venezuelans have been killed in almost 2 months of protests, nonstop protests, against the dictatorship responsible for a litany of crimes. You cannot enumerate them. Horrific human rights abuses, drug trafficking, a rapidly worsening humanitarian situation. The list goes on and on, Mr. Speaker. Venezuelans do not have access to even the most basic of necessities, which means water, food, and medicine. None of that exists in Venezuela. Venezuelan humanitarian shortages of food and medicine. People are standing in lines to get nothing. The Venezuelan Pharmaceutical Federation estimates that the country is running shortages on nearly every necessary medical item. For those few Venezuelans who could afford to purchase medicine, they are forced to pay exorbitant prices for supplies like gauze, pain relievers, BandAids, and that is only if they are available in the first place, Mr. Speaker. Hospital workers have told us that the supplies are being raided, and they are being sold on the black market. The situation is no better when it comes to food. Last week, a 46yearold man was killed by soldiers as he was on his way home from buying diapers for his baby. Killed while buying diapers for his baby. Why? Because diapers are a scarce commodity. They have been a scarce commodity for over a year now in Venezuela, a country that was abundant in natural resources. Earlier this week, this very week, a 15yearold boy was shot and killed for the crime of buying flour. One study reports that 75 percent of the population of Venezuela—this is unbelievable—has lost an average of 19 pounds due to food shortages. Even obtaining water can be an expensive proposition for those without running water at home. The shortage of basic goods has led to massive lines, has led to violence, has led to looting as people have become increasingly desperate for the basic, meager means to survive. We are just talking about basic necessities, Mr. Speaker. This tragic humanitarian situation could have been prevented, Mr. Speaker, and no one is more responsible than the thug who rules Venezuela with an iron fist, Nicolas Maduro, and his despotic regime. The Maduro dictatorship presides over the world’s largest oil reserves yet has managed to run the state oil company and the entire economy into the ground. Socialism does not work. Communism does not work. One need only look at Venezuela. Instead of allowing humanitarian relief, the regime has nationalized the food and medical supply chain and put corrupt officials in charge. What could go wrong? Earlier this month, I wrote a letter, along with my good friend ALBIO SIRES, as well as ELIOT ENGEL , the ranking member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and 12 other congressional colleagues joined Mr. SIRES, Mr. E NGEL , and myself, urging the administration to use its voice, to use our vote, to use our influence at the United Nations Security Council to demand that Venezuelan authorities allow the delivery and the distribution of humanitarian aid. We were giving them what they need. Maduro would have none of it. But I applaud our U.S. Ambassador at the U.N., Nikki Haley, for organizing a Security Council meeting on Venezuela last week. But more needs to be done, Mr. Speaker. As Ambassador Haley bravely said, Venezuela is on the edge of a humanitarian crisis, right here in our hemisphere. Humanitarian agencies must be allowed to operate independently in Venezuela, without interference from the thuggish Maduro regime, and deliver the aid that the people so desperately need. The world is ready to help Venezuela. Nicolas Maduro refuses this help. Humanitarian agencies must say to Maduro, if they are hindered in any way, then those responsible must be held to account. Before I continue, Mr. Speaker, to address the Maduro regime’s abuse of human rights in greater detail and how the United States can be a force for good in Venezuela, I yield to ALBIO SIRES, my good friend from New Jersey. Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Florida. I want to commend her for her passion and her commitment to helping the people of Venezuela. I thank her for making me part of this Special Order. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the ongoing crisis in Venezuela. With every week that passes, we see the situation in Venezuela becoming more critical. b1930 A country with the world’s largest known oil reserves is spiraling into a collapsed state where people are struggling just to survive. Journalists and citizens risk their lives every day to report what is happening inside Caracas and around the country. We see that tensions are growing, and government security forces shoot first and don’t even bother to ask questions later. Maduro continues to keep political prisoners like Leopoldo Lopez under lock and key to send a strong message to those trying to question his actions. Just yesterday, we saw reports that government buildings in western Venezuela are being set ablaze. Make no mistake: It is the failed Chavismo policies and the authoritarian actions of Nicolas Maduro that have brought all of this pain and suffering upon the Venezuelan people. Press reports show that of 800,000 businesses that opened during the Chavez regime, nearly 600,000 have shut down. Both the Obama and Trump administrations have sanctioned senior officials in the Venezuelan Government for their associations with narcotrafficking, money laundering, and other illicit activities. Just today, Reuters released an exclusive report that the Venezuelan Government is in possession of 5,000 shoulderlaunched surfacetoair missiles that are typically used to shoot down lowflying planes and helicopters. Last week, Spanish authorities interdicted a shipment of 6 tons of cocaine from Venezuela en route to their shores. With the recent sanctions of Vice President Tareck El Aissami, under the Kingpin Act, it has become clear that Venezuela’s Government is 
acting as a narcostate and facilitating the shipment of narcotics throughout the region. These sanctions are not against the Venezuelan people but are carefully crafted and targeted towards the individuals who are committed to destroying the lives of millions of innocent civilians in exchange for money and power. Last week, the U.S. Department of the Treasury sanctioned members of Venezuela’s Supreme Court for their rulings that stripped power away from the National Assembly, further consolidating Maduro’s authoritarian regime. Maduro and his cronies continue to get rich as they traffic money and drugs while doing nothing to help the millions of suffering people in Venezuela. They continue to loot the country as reports regarding the worsening situation continue to make frontpage news throughout the region. Maduro’s tactics are making it impossible to survive. Multiple news reports confirm a growing health crisis as people lack access to basic medicines, and infant mortality rates and preventable diseases such as diptheria, malaria, and the Zika virus are all on the rise. In addition, nearly every day we hear of young children whose lives are cut short, whether it is from a bullet from Maduro’s thugs or the lack of access to food, water, and basic services. That is why I am grateful for the efforts of my colleagues here tonight who have supported several initiatives in Congress that work to hold these thugs accountable. My colleagues and I have held hearings, sent letters, and met with our allies in the region to work together to try to bring sound relief to the Venezuelan people. Meanwhile, instead of focusing on the economy, Maduro is staging mock military exercises and stoking fears by spreading propaganda of U.S.led invasion. The truth about Maduro is clear, and the international community is starting to unify against him. The OAS Secretary General Luis Almagro has wisely called for Venezuela’s suspension from the OAS unless it frees its political prisoners, accepts humanitarian aid, and holds elections without delay. I believe we need to work together with our allies around the world and continue to insist Maduro abide by international norms and give the Venezuelan people the freedom they deserve. I thank my dear friend from Florida, ILEANA ROSLEHTINEN , and the other Members here tonight for their relentless commitment to these important issues. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. SIRES for such an eloquent statement on behalf of the beleaguered and embattled Venezuelan people. Before I yield so proudly to Mr. CASTRO of Texas, another member of our Western Hemisphere Subcommittee, I would like to say just a few words about the continuing human rights abuses and the deteriorating situation in Venezuela. As we have heard from Mr. SIRES, we are dealing with a corrupt dictatorship, and we are dealing with a brutal dictatorship. At least 42 are dead and 90 arrested since protests began in March of 2017, you can see on this poster. This is a dictatorship that will go to all lengths to maintain its tight grip on power and silence the opposition by tear gas, by real bullets, by jailing, and by intimidation. The people of Venezuela are literally dying, Mr. Speaker, on the streets from the violence of the Maduro regime. They are dying on the streets from starvation, and they are dying from the lack of medical supplies, yet they still risk their lives. This goes on each and every day in Venezuela. They go out into the streets. They demonstrate to the world that they will not be silenced, and what they desire is freedom, and what they desire is democracy, and what they desire is nothing less and nothing more than their Godgiven human rights, the very same intangibles that many in America here take for granted because we live in the greatest country in the world. We take for granted that we have our freedom. But the ideals that we proudly espouse and defend around the world are alive and well in the streets of Venezuela. Venezuelans are protesting against the regime’s continual assaults on Venezuela’s constitutional and democratic order. Like Chavez before him, Nicolas Maduro has a horrific human rights record, including restrictions on freedom of expression, restrictions on the press, widespread arbitrary detentions, extrajudicial killings, torture, and the list goes on and on. In its human rights reports on Venezuela last year, our own State Department noted how the Maduro regime has misused the judiciary to undermine the National Assembly, a body overwhelmingly manipulated by the opposition since December of 2015. This opposition has risen to power thanks to the vote of the people. So what did Nicolas Maduro say? Well, his supreme court nullified almost every action taken by the National Assembly, including refusing to allow lawmakers to take their seats in the legislature and overturning laws to free political prisoners and grow the economy. I am so pleased to see that we have been joined by the chairman of the Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, Mr. DUNCAN , tonight. But things have only gotten worse since that time. In March, the regime controlled the Supreme Tribunal of Justice—a sad name for what it does— and ruled that it would resume the responsibilities of the National Assembly. It said: We are the state. Who needs the National Assembly that is manipulated and controlled by the opposition? We nullify its actions. We will assume the responsibility. And although what the Tribunal said, they had to backtrack almost immediately because the condemnation internationally was so loud. It partially reversed its decision just a few days later, but the damage was already done, Mr. Speaker. Venezuelans had further proof of a break in the constitutional order. Antiregime protests have been going on, as we can see here, day after day, day after day, as hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans have taken to the streets to demand relief from the Maduro repression. According to The New York Times, before these protests even began, Mr. Speaker, the Maduro regime had arrested 6,893 people, jailed 433 for political reasons just in the past few years, and there are at least 175 political prisoners behind bars today, including Leopoldo Lopez and Daniel Ceballos. Joshua Holt, a United States citizen, Mr. Speaker, is being unjustly held for nearly a year. In September, I wrote a letter, joined by my colleagues here, to the State Department about Joshua’s case. Joshua Holt’s health has deteriorated over the last month. I urged the State Department to secure his unconditional release on humanitarian grounds. We all were humbled to meet with Joshua Holt’s mom, who is so anxious to see his release, just last month. So, Mr. Speaker, despite all of the Maduro regime’s human rights abuses, the beatings, the violence, the murders, the repression, and the political prisoners, despite all of this, the Venezuelan people are refusing to be silenced. They are rising up, and they are protesting in even greater numbers. This is just amazing. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CASTRO ), my good friend from the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee. Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman ROSLEHTINEN  and Congressman ALBIO SIRES for their incredible work on this issue and all of their passion. I also thank the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee chairman, Congressman DUNCAN . I know how much he has worked on the issue of Venezuela, and Latin America also. The people of Venezuela are in dire need of humanitarian assistance to endure critical food and medicine shortages. The desperation, oppression, and violence in Venezuela really are reaching a breaking point. Three out of four Venezuelans have lost significant weight during the last year due to food shortages. In 2016, the nation suffered a homicide rate of 91.8 per 100,000 people, making Venezuela the second most violent country in the world outside of a war zone. We have reason to believe more than half of Venezuelans want to leave their home country. Last year, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said Colombia should expect an ‘‘avalanche’’ of Venezuelan refugees, an influx that 
could complicate this critical time for Colombia’s own peace agreement. Meanwhile, President Maduro’s government is taking increasingly antidemocratic actions in violation of Venezuela’s own constitution. Since Venezuela’s supreme court attempted to dissolve the country’s legislature in March, the Venezuelan people have sustained massive protests, leading to a brutal crackdown from government security forces. The best outcome for this political crisis is a Venezuelan solution: a peaceful return to free and fair elections. At the same time, the United States has a responsibility to work alongside our allies at the Organization of American States and the United Nations to hold Maduro’s government accountable and to provide humanitarian assistance to the people of Venezuela. Last week, President Trump authorized sanctions against the members of Venezuela’s supreme court who attempted to shut down the legislature. While U.S. sanctions against individuals in the Maduro regime are justified, sanctions work best when implemented multilaterally. More importantly, unilateral actions are no substitute for collective, coordinated pressure. The OAS has scheduled a meeting of foreign ministers on the situation in Venezuela to take place on May 31 here in Washington, D.C. This meeting presents an opportunity to work with our partners and Venezuela’s neighbors to support a return to democracy and respect for human rights. I hope Secretary Tillerson will represent the United States at this meeting and demonstrate our Nation’s support for the Venezuelan people. One of the reasons that I chose to join the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee when I was already part of the Foreign Affairs Committee is because I believe that there are many things that happen in Latin America that don’t get the attention that they deserve here in the United States. b1945 It is amazing to think that there is a human rights crisis going on right now in our own Western Hemisphere. Of course, there are many challenges around the world. We know that because of the war in Syria and the unrest in the region, Europe, over the last few years, has faced its largest migration crisis since World War II. There are challenges with human rights and freedom in every continent just about. But we have to make sure that we attend to the things that are happening in our own backyard, so to speak. So I thank each of you for being here tonight to speak up on this issue of human rights in Venezuela and the crisis that they are going through. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, we are so pleased that Mr. CASTRO has, once again, joined us in this battle for human rights, for democracy, for justice, for the rule of law, in our hemisphere. His voice is a valiant one that needs to be heard and is always present whenever the struggle for human rights is mentioned. So thank you, Mr. CASTRO , for this stance today and for the stance that you have taken on behalf of beleaguered people in our hemisphere every day. Now, Mr. SIRES and I are so thankful that our subcommittee chairman of the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee, the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. DUNCAN ), has joined us. As I mentioned, Mr. Speaker, Mr. SIRES is the ranking member of that subcommittee, and Mr. DUNCAN is the chairman of that subcommittee, a valiant voice for freedom that must be heard. I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. DUNCAN ). Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairwoman, former chairwoman of the full committee when I first came to Congress, and a real leader on foreign affairs issues, focused on Cuba and Venezuela. She has been a real mentor to me, and I want to thank her for her work on this, giving us the opportunity to speak tonight. Again, Ranking Member SIRES has been a champion on our subcommittee. I want to echo the words about Mr. CASTRO as well. We have got a great Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere focusing on freedom and democracy in the Western Hemisphere. What we see in Venezuela is alarming, as well as it is saddening, when we hear about Venezuelans who are scrounging for food in the dumpsters, eating domesticated animals, even flamingos; people who are hungry because the socialistic policies of the Maduro and the previous Chavez regime has not worked in Venezuela. A country that has bountiful natural resources, more oil than Saudi Arabia, should be leading this hemisphere in economics. Yet because of the policies of the Chavez and Maduro governments, the people of Venezuela are continuing to be oppressed. This weekend, more than 2,000 Venezuelans took to the streets, marking, I think, the 50th day of protests against this regime. I can’t think of any other way to describe this faux democracy in Venezuela, other than a regime. The Venezuelan people are standing up and calling for a new government. They are calling for more democracy, true democracy, representation in their own government, freedoms that we take for granted here in this country, freedoms of speech, and the right to peacefully assemble, the right to participate in their government and have accountability, the right to petition their government for grievances. And they have got some grievances against the Maduro regime. Yet Maduro continues to oppress the Venezuelan people. It is not unlike what we have seen in Cuba. Folks, socialism doesn’t work, and it is not working in Venezuela, and they are a prime example. But Maduro doesn’t want to listen to his own people in Venezuela and call for new democratic elections, where the people elect their representatives to congress and to the Presidency. But he has called for elections, and he said just recently: ‘‘‘Votes or bullets. What do the people want?’ Maduro asked a crowd of redshirted supporters waving Venezuela flags at the Miraflores presidential palace.’’ Votes or bullets? Is that how we talk about the democratic process in a true democracy? I say no, and I tell the Venezuelan people, America stands with you as you approach democracy. It is time for more people in this hemisphere and the Organization of American States, all the member countries, to stand with the Venezuelan people, and let’s change the government in Venezuela through peaceful means, democratic means, that their Constitution calls for. But yet, Maduro is ignoring the Constitution. In fact, he got the Supreme Court to go along with him to discount the National Assembly there, and, luckily, they reversed course on that because they realized the world was watching and the world was saying that is not how democracies operate. The Venezuelan people need the support of the world, and I call on the world today to come to the backs, standing with, watching the backs of the Venezuelan people, because Maduro has told his snipers to get ready; told his snipers to get ready to attack the protesters that are protesting a supposed democrat government. Wow. So I want to thank the chairwoman. I want to thank Ambassador Nikki Haley, former Governor of South Carolina, who has stood strong in the U.N. as Ambassador to the U.N. for the Trump administration. I want to thank her for standing with the Venezuelan people for democratic principles. I want to thank all those in this Chamber, including my ranking member, for having stern and direct conversations with the OAS about Venezuela. I want to thank Argentina for what they have done, stepping up to the plate. These are countries that understand the democratic process. I want to thank Brazil for actually allowing the democratic process to work in the country of Brazil through an impeachment of their President, and allowing the democratic forces to work to return that to a representative government. It is time for America to stand with our friends about democratic principles here. Snipers? That is not how we operate. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. I yield back the balance of my time. 
THE DETERIORATING SITUATION IN VENEZUELA The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. SIRES) for 30 minutes. Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I want to take this moment to thank my colleague and my chairman of the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee for always being present on all the important issues, human rights issues in the Western Hemisphere. And of course, I want to thank my colleague from Florida, ILEANA ROS LEHTINEN , for her passion and determination to bring democracy to Venezuela. Before I recognize my good friend from Florida, MARIO DIAZBALART , I would just like to say that Venezuela basically has taken a page out of the Castro brothers. This is how the process in Cuba started. Fiftyfive years later, there is nothing but oppression, no freedom of expression, no election, and, quite frankly, there are approximately about 30,000 Cubans in Venezuela running the security apparatus. But I want the Venezuelan people to know that we are fighting along with them, that we are talking to all the Presidents, all the leaders in the Western Hemisphere, to put pressure on Venezuela to develop the democracy and stop the abuse of human rights in Venezuela. At this time, I yield to my good friend from Florida (Mr. DIAZBALART ), who is also a fighter for human rights and who has been always in the forefront of human rights in the Western Hemisphere. Mr. DIAZBALART. Mr. Speaker, let me first start by thanking the leadership, the steadfast, never confused leadership of Congressman ALBIO SIRES. He is a man who I have had the privilege of traveling with to Eastern Europe, where he is known there, as he is in the United States, for one who is always fighting for those who are repressed, oppressed around the world; which is why the people of Venezuela know that they can count on Congressman ALBIO SIRES for his leadership. Thank you, sir, for never giving up, never fighting, never forgetting those who are struggling under repression. You mentioned Congresswoman ILEANA  ROSLEHTINEN . She is a giant, a giant in the Halls of Congress, a giant for not only things that obviously affect us here domestically, because she is fighting for those, particularly those who are the least fortunate in our society. But if there is somebody who is known internationally as a fighter for those who, again, are struggling for freedom, it is ILEANA ROSLEHTINEN . I thank you also, Mr. SIRES, for mentioning the chairman of the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee. We just heard from him, a person who, again, is on the same track of always making sure that the—he makes the United States look good by never forgetting human rights as a fundamental pillar of our foreign policy. The people of Venezuela are demonstrating that they are, in fact, the heirs of Simon Bolivar. They are showing now, with 50 days of consecutive demonstrations in the streets, that they are not willing to accept repression. They are not willing to accept any more of this dictatorship; that they are not willing to accept, as Mr. SIRES mentioned, in essence, a takeover from the Cuban regime of their beautiful country of Venezuela. And they are suffering because of that activism, that bravery of hitting the streets. About almost 50 of them have been murdered since this last number of demonstrations have taken place, not to mention the dozens upon dozens of political prisoners, whether it is political leaders, mayors, et cetera, who are in prison just because they are not willing to stand by while their country has been taken over by this horrendous, narcoterrorist, murderous dictatorship. Frankly, I am here to commend the Venezuelan people and, as Mr. SIRES said, to let them know that they are not alone, that we stand with them, that the United States Congress stands with them. But I would be remiss if I didn’t end as I started, Mr. Speaker, by thanking these individuals who have spoken already: the giant of human rights in the House of Representatives, ILEANA ROS LEHTINEN , the chairman of the subcommittee, who never gets confused, and who is always fighting for those who are struggling to regain or gain their freedom; and yes, ALBIO SIRES, who I have had the privilege of seeing, not only who he is recognized here in this Congress by his colleagues as a true freedom fighter for human rights, but I have been able to travel with him and see that whenever you go anywhere with ALBIO SIRES, he is also recognized around the world as that champion for freedom. So what a privilege to be part of and to be able to spend this time with you. Thanks to each and every one of you for not forgetting the struggle of Venezuela. I know that you have done it in your committee, you have done it in your subcommittee, and this Congress is grateful, and this Member of Congress is grateful for your leadership. And I know that the Venezuelan people who are showing incredible bravery know, and history will record that, in their toughest moments, when they were putting their lives on the line, all of you, and this Congress, stood with them. So with that, thank you, Mr. SIRES, for yielding to me. Mr. SIRES. Thank you, Congressman. Thank you for all your passion and all your effort on behalf of those people who need it the most, the people in Venezuela. Mr. Speaker, I would just like to end by saying, you know, I remember years ago when Spain went through 39 years of dictatorships in the Franco era. And one of the things that happened that was able to develop democracy in Spain was the fact that all the European countries got together and helped and assisted in developing a democracy in Spain. I think the same thing needs to happen in this region. b2000 The countries of our Venezuela have to demand that Venezuela release its political prisoners, that it has free elections, and stop the human rights abuses. After all, it is in their best interest that a stable Venezuela is good for a stable region. Mr. Speaker, I thank very much my colleague, ILEANA ROSLEHTINEN , always for her passion on this issue. She is the little giant of human rights in this Congress. I thank her and my colleague, MARIO DIAZBALART . Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
