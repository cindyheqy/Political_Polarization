Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak about Russian interference in our elections. In the last 18 months, the United States intelligence agencies and our allies abroad have decisively concluded that Russia interfered with our elections. We have sworn testimony from men and women with impeccable records, Democrats and Republicans alike. Their testimony overwhelmingly states that Russia interfered in our elections and that Russia has done so as well in other Western democracies for years. Russia’s goal with election interference is to destabilize Western democracies. Destabilizing our democracy will weaken our ability to defend ourselves against foreign adversaries like Russia, China, and Iran. Democratic institutions and systems are the foundation of how we govern ourselves and defend our borders. When the integrity of democratic institutions is doubted, the power of our democracy is weakened. Make no mistake: attacking the integrity of our democratic institutions is an attempt to weaken our Nation and our way of life. We must ensure that neither Russia nor any other foreign power interferes in our election process in the future. The House of Representatives seems to have abdicated its official role in investigating Russian interference. It is my hope that the Senate will continue its investigation in a bipartisan manner. Thus, Special Counsel Robert Mueller must be allowed to continue his investigation, following the evidence wherever it leads, and write a comprehensive and complete report without intrusion or obstruction by political power plays. This is not a Democratic or Republican issue. This is an American issue. Mr. Speaker, as Members of Congress, our first responsibility is to protect our Nation. We take an oath of office every 2 years to defend and protect our Nation from all enemies, foreign and domestic. I call upon my colleagues, my fellow Americans, to join me in putting partisanship aside, putting our country first, and doing everything we can to prevent foreign interference in our elections in the future. TARIFFS AND TRADE  
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I also rise today to speak about U.S. trade and the recently raised tariffs on steel and aluminum. We all want to secure American jobs and increase the opportunity in the U.S. economy, but raising farreaching tariffs will do just the opposite. The most likely effect of raising tariffs will be other countries adjusting their trade measures to protect their economies and their workers. This is known as a trade war, and no one wins in a trade war. What’s more, American agriculture is always the target of international reactionary and retaliatory trade behavior. California agriculture, which I am a strong advocate of and represent, feels the most intense direct pain from these tariffs. California farmers and ranchers earned roughly 44 percent of their total revenue from international trade in 2016. But this pain will radiate across the country. Manufacturers, processors, merchants, and farmers will face negative impacts to their businesses as foreign markets close, which will cost both American jobs and profits. Yes, we have an international trade imbalance that must be addressed, but raising these tariffs, I think, is the wrong strategy, plain and simple. This is why both Republicans and Democrats have publicly expressed grave concern with these recent actions. The way to address these trade imbalances is to successfully renegotiate and modernize NAFTA and other trade agreements with our European allies. The President and Congress must work together on trade agreements; it is that simple. Our best approach for successfully renegotiating trade agreements in a way that serves the entire Nation is by Republicans and Democrats coming together and putting in the hard work required for bipartisan negotiations, serious policymaking, and getting the job 
done. That is what we are supposed to do. 
OUR JOB IS TO KEEP STUDENTS SAFE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. MESSER ) for 5 minutes. Mr. MESSER. Mr. Speaker, as a parent with kids in school, I believe that no parent should have to worry if their child will come home safe at the end of the day. That is why I rise today to join President Trump in urging the Senate to immediately pass the STOP School Violence Act. The House overwhelmingly passed this legislation last week, and now it is time for the U.S. Senate to act and pass this bipartisan, commonsense bill. Among other positive steps forward, this bipartisan bill would provide funding to enable local schools to make physical and technological improvements to keep students safe. Southwestern High School in my district has been called the safest school in America because of its focus on security, training, and coordination with local law enforcement. I have had the opportunity to visit Shelby County’s Southwestern High School and speak with the leadership there and the Shelby County Sheriff’s Department leadership as well, and, frankly, I could not have been more impressed. If the STOP School Violence Act is enacted, more schools could follow the example set by Southwestern High School. The U.S. Senate needs to do its job now and act quickly to pass this commonsense legislation to secure our schools and keep America’s children safe. 
RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess until noon today. Accordingly (at 10 o’clock and 7 minutes a.m.), the House stood in recess. 
b1200 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker at noon. 
PRAYER Dr. Michael S. Lewis, Roswell Street Baptist Church, Marietta, Georgia, offered the following prayer: Our Father in Heaven, we enter into Your presence this day with thanksgiving in our hearts for the gracious gift of life and the opportunities that You have set before us. We bless You for being our Creator and for providing a living relationship of love through Your Son and our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ. We humble ourselves before You as men and women of this special body whom You have appointed with the responsibility of serving the people of this Nation. May You fill the minds of each leader with wisdom which is from above, fill each heart with passion for Your glory and the greatest good of others, and fill each decision with the guidance of Your Spirit. My heart is grateful to voice this intercessory prayer on this day in our Nation’s history with fellow citizens. May You unite our hearts to glorify Your name. May You bless the cities and communities of our Nation with peace. May You bless the United States of America, for I humbly make this prayer in the name of Jesus. Amen. f 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. SCHNEIDER ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. SCHNEIDER led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
WELCOMING DR. MICHAEL S. LEWIS The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. LOUDERMILK ) is recognized for 1 minute. There was no objection. Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, today I have the honor of introducing our guest pastor, Dr. Michael Lewis, from my home district and from the great city of Marietta, Georgia. Dr. Lewis graduated in 1996 with a master of divinity degree from Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary. In May of 2005, he received an honorary doctor of divinity degree from Liberty University. He has had the honor of serving in churches in South Carolina, Texas, and Florida as their pastor. Currently, Dr. Lewis serves as pastor of Roswell Street Baptist Church in Marietta, Georgia, where he lives with his wife of 25 years, Liliana, and their three wonderful daughters. It is my privilege to introduce Dr. Michael Lewis, who opened us this morning in prayer. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in honor of Women’s History Month. Every March, we celebrate the trailblazing women who have enriched our history, our society, and our communities. This month, it is important to recognize the hardworking women in today’s workforce. Today, more than 70 percent of women work outside of the home, and these women account for nearly half of the workforce, while 40 percent of women are their family’s top earners. Because of tax reform, the women of America’s workforce will be able to keep more of their hardearned cash to spend on their families, rather than sending it to Washington. Additionally, working moms and their families will receive double the child tax credit to ensure they have the means to care for their children. Mr. Speaker, to the naysayers who claimed that tax reform would only benefit rich men, I say that is categorically false. Tax reform already has and will continue to empower the wonderful women in America’s workforce to make history worth recognizing. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF REVEREND JAMES HAWLEY MCKINNON, JR. (Mr. BUTTERFIELD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a great North Carolinian, a friend to many, and a man of God, Reverend James Hawley McKinnon, Jr. Mr. Speaker, Jim passed away on Sunday, March 11, at the age of 77. Jim McKinnon preached the Gospel of Jesus Christ in eastern North Carolina for decades. His ministry inspired and motivated so many individuals, both in his home of Wilson, North Carolina, and elsewhere. Ordained as a minister of the Presbyterian church on September 22, 1968—shortly after the assassinations of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and Senator Robert F. Kennedy—Jim served congregations throughout North Carolina; first as an associate pastor in Fayetteville, and then as a senior pastor in Morehead City, Charlotte, and Wilson, where he retired after 26 years as senior pastor of First Presbyterian Church. Jim McKinnon was a strong, strong pillar in our community and he will be missed. Jim McKinnon is survived by his wife of 51 long years, Louise Cherry McKinnon; and their two sons, also Presbyterian ministers, James, III—we 
call him Trip—and his wife, Angie, from Brunswick, Georgia; and John and his wife, Darci, from Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. His beloved four grandchildren are: John Brandon and Rebecca Louise from Brunswick, Georgia; Aidan Gayle and Ian McKay from Oklahoma City. Jim was preceded in death by his grandson, James Hawley McKinnon, IV—Jamie. Let it be said, Mr. Speaker, that Reverend Jim McKinnon made a difference in this world as he helped change lives for so many Americans. 
CONGRATULATING THE BELLEVILLE WEST BASKETBALL TEAM (Mr. BOST asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, today I proudly honor the Belleville West basketball team for winning the 2018 4A State tournament. It was truly a ‘‘March Madness’’ in Peoria, Illinois, this weekend as the Maroons played in a backandforth State title game against Whitney Young Dolphins. It took overtime, but Belleville West held off Whitney Young for a 60 to 56 victory to take home the championship trophy. This is the first basketball State title in school history. I extend a heartfelt congratulations to the players, coaches, staff, school officials, families, and friends who supported these young men on this incredible journey. Illinois 12th is proud of you. Go, Maroons. 
HEALTHCARE SHOULD BE A HUMAN RIGHT FOR ALL (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, this Friday marks the eighth anniversary of the Affordable Care Act being signed into law. In the richest country in the world, healthcare should be a basic human right, not a privilege for some. While the ACA is far from perfect— we know that—it made great progress, ensuring millions and millions of Americans that they could have health insurance, that they could have healthcare when they need it, making it more affordable, making sure that Americans with preexisting conditions were not denied coverage because they were sick or kicked off their coverage because they got sick. Unfortunately, though, this House has spent a good deal of the last year or so trying to take back some of those advances that we have made, essentially, putting more families in the position of having that economic uncertainty of not knowing whether or not their premiums will continue to go up or their copays will go up, or prescription drugs will be available but completely unaffordable to them; putting families back in the place where they are, essentially, one illness away from losing everything that they have worked for. We should work together because we know there are improvements that we need to make. We should work across the aisle to improve this law and move forward. f 
BEST BUDDIES FRIENDSHIP WALK (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Best Buddies International for a successful 5K walk in downtown Miami this past Saturday, March 17. Best Buddies International was founded in 1989 by one of my constituents, Anthony K. Shriver, and it promotes the idea that every person has a gift and that every person can contribute. This message is emblematic of what makes America successful, and it has made Best Buddies a thriving global organization serving thousands of individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities. The Best Buddies Friendship Walk allows those who are often excluded because of their differences the opportunity to create oneonone friendships that last a lifetime. It is that model that has allowed Best Buddies to make extraordinary advancements in the autism community to increase understanding and acceptance of the disability. I would like to extend my congratulations for a successful Best Buddies Friendship Walk. I am so delighted to see my constituents giving the gift of friendship to individuals in south Florida with intellectual and developmental disabilities. 
BOOTS TO BUSINESS (Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today in support of the Boots to Business program. Running a small business requires a wide variety of skills. One day you are the company’s accountant, the next day you are researching marketing strategies. Many of our servicemembers have the temperament and experience to excel as smallbusiness owners and entrepreneurs, but they lack the industryspecific skills to turn their dream into a reality. The Boots to Business program helps bridge this gap by offering exiting servicemembers and spouses a 2day inperson course on business ownership, followed by more indepth instruction through an 8week online course. Since the program launched in 2013, more than 50,000 servicemembers and spouses have participated, learning how to start and grow businesses and, thereby, grow our economy. This month, I introduced the bipartisan Veteran Entrepreneurship Training Act with my friend from Iowa, Congressman RODBLUM. The bill would codify the Boots to Business program. Our veterans serve our country with honor. They deserve our support as they transition from military to civilian life. I urge my colleagues to join me on this bipartisan effort. 
CREATING TRANSPARENCY THROUGH DISCLOSURE (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, today I introduced the Foreign Influence Transparency Act, which requires organizations, such as the Confucius Institute, to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, FARA, if they promote the political agenda of a foreign country. The goal of this legislation is to increase transparency between foreign governments, universities, and students. Americans have the right to know if they are consuming propaganda that is produced by a foreign government. Currently, FARA contains a technicality that allows foreign governments or organizations to push their political agenda under the facade of an ‘‘academic pursuit.’’ The Foreign Influence Transparency Act will clarify the intent and ensure that all propaganda funded by foreign governments at least contains a disclaimer. The Foreign Influence Transparency Act also decreases the monetary threshold of foreign donations that universities are required to disclose. Currently, universities only report on donations they receive of $250,000 or more, while organizations, such as the Confucius Institute, operate below that level. This results in a lack of disclosure to students and parents. The goal of this legislation is simple, and that is to create transparency through disclosure. In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF LEW VANDERZYL (Mr. TAKANO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Lew Vanderzyl, a dedicated educator; a veteran; and a devoted father, grandfather, and greatgrandfather, who passed away last month. Lew’s lifetime of service included a deployment with the 40th Infantry Division during the Korean war, followed 
by a half century as a teacher and administrator, and 17 years as a Riverside school board member. As school board president, Lew demonstrated his moral courage by insisting that a local high school be named after Martin Luther King, despite a wave of protests and intense opposition. He will be remembered by the Riverside community as someone who cared deeply for his students. Lew Vanderzyl, an avid reader, crossword puzzler, and traveler, and a constant source of wisdom and kindness, will be dearly missed by our community. May his memory be a blessing to the friends and family he leaves behind. 
b1215 HONORING LOUISE MCINTOSH SLAUGHTER (Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, LOUISE MCINTOSH SLAUGHTER  served the people of Rochester in Monroe County, as well as the city of Buffalo, in the United States Congress from 1987 until her untimely death last week. LOUISE SLAUGHTER was a champion of progressive causes and a liberal lioness in the United States Congress. She knew who she was fighting for, and she knew how to fight. For the homeless, the hopeless, and the voiceless, LOUISE SLAUGHTER championed all their causes because her political ethos was forever to defend the dignity of every citizen. She never deviated from that cause and reinforced it each and every day on the floor of this Congress, the institution that she loved. She served as chair and ranking member of the Rules Committee and championed the first $500 million earmark for breast cancer research to the National Institutes of Health and the Violence Against Women Act. These are among a long list of impressive accomplishments that were championed by LOUISE SLAUGHTER . Her friends and her family will miss her, but her accomplishments will forever be enshrined on this institution representing the people that she loved in Rochester and Monroe County.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. HASTINGS ), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 787 provides for the consideration of two important bills whose focus is to empower the people of this Nation by removing governmental obstacles standing in the way of life and prosperity in this country. The first bill, H.R. 4566, the Alleviating Stress Test Burdens to Help Investors Act, is a bipartisan effort from the Committee on Financial Services under Chairman JEBHENSARLING , authored by the gentleman from Maine (Mr. POLIQUIN ). The second piece of legislation in today’s rule, H.R. 5247, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2018, authorizes the use of certain drugs to eligible patients who have been diagnosed with a stage of a disease or a condition for which there is a reasonable likelihood that death will occur in a matter of months. The rule provides for 1 hour of debate for H.R. 4566, the Alleviating Stress Test Burdens to Help Investors Act, equally divided between the Chair and the ranking members of the Committee on Financial Services. The rule makes one amendment in order, authored by the gentlewoman from California (Ms. MAXINE WATERS ), the ranking member. Further, the rule provides for the consideration of one motion to recommit with or without instructions. For H.R. 5247, the Right to Try Act of 2018, the rule provides for 1 hour of debate equally divided between the Chair 
and the ranking member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce. Although no amendments to the bill were made in order, the rule does provide for one motion to recommit. Mr. Speaker, before I speak about the substance of the two bills under consideration in the rule before us today, I do want to take a minute to honor our colleague and the Rules Committee’s ranking member, LOUISE SLAUGHTER , who passed away unexpectedly last week. I have known Ranking Member SLAUGHTER since I first joined Congress in 2003. We spent countless hours debating every issue one can imagine in the Rules Committee upstairs, often long into the night. When I joined the Rules Committee in 2013, Ranking Member SLAUGHTER  was then the ranking member, but it was under her chairmanship where she ushered through the Affordable Care Act, where my largest memories reside. During the debate for the Affordable Care Act, I went up to H–313, the Rules Committee hearing room, with 18 amendments under my arm, a small selection of the many ways I felt the law needed to be changed. Certain that I would only be able to get through a small portion of those amendments before I was cut off, I began my testimony. To the chairwoman’s credit, she let me go on and on and on, and despite my being convinced that she was going to gavel me down at any second, she allowed me to finish speaking on all 18 amendments. Mr. Speaker, it wasn’t until I actually became a member of the Rules Committee several years later that I discovered there is, in fact, no time limit for Members and witnesses to speak, much to the chagrin of many Members when we debate the National Defense Authorization Act. Ranking Member SLAUGHTER was always proud of her background as a microbiologist, and it served her well during her tenure in Congress, because, after all, we deal with, sometimes, almost miniscule, microscopic issues, so time as a microbiologist would be good preparation. One moment where I was glad to be able to work with Ranking Member SLAUGHTER was in 2007. This was right after the Democrats took control of the House. Ms. SLAUGHTER had been pushing for years for legislation that would prohibit the discrimination of employees based on genetic information. The legislation was forward leaning, long before companies offered DNA testing kits in every pharmacy of the country. And, in fact, it was former Speaker Newt Gingrich himself who brought this bill to my attention, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, which I was proud to support as it moved through the Energy and Commerce Committee and was eventually signed into law by President Bush. I would also like to mention Don Sisson, the staff director for the minority on the Rules Committee. Don has been with the committee for years— even at one point working under Chairman Drier—and has been with the ranking member of the Rules Committee through many events in the past years, including the death of her own husband, who, in fact, often sat in the audience of the Rules Committee and joined Ms. SLAUGHTER during our latenight Rules hearings. Don is, indeed, a loyal staffer, himself hailing from Rochester, New York, and is a great example of how Ms. SLAUGHTER ’s life and passing is affecting so many people. I do want to thank Don for his written remarks that were read into the record of the Rules Committee last night from the staff perspective on the passing of Ranking Member SLAUGHTER . Mr. Speaker, at this point, I would like to hold off making further comments on the legislation before us to allow others to speak. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS ), my friend, for yielding me the customary 30 minutes for debate. Mr. Speaker, like my friend from Texas, I was overcome with sadness by the tragic news of LOUISE ’s passing, who was not only the ranking member of the Rules Committee, but the first and only woman to have chaired the committee. For 30 years, LOUISE poured every ounce of energy she had into serving her constituents in upstate New York. She never hesitated to speak her mind, and she never wavered in espousing her beliefs. I will always be truly grateful for the time that I had to serve alongside her. LOUISE was one of my dearest friends in Congress, having not only served with her on the Rules Committee but also on the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Helsinki Commission. Her legacy speaks for itself. She was not just a champion of women’s rights. She was a champion of working families everywhere. This Nation has lost one of our fiercest public servants, and her absence will leave an unfillable void. Mr. Speaker, I offer my deepest condolences to LOUISE ’s daughters: Megan Secatore, Amy Slaughter, and Emily Minerva; her seven grandchildren and one greatgrandson; as well as to her friends, constituents, and congressional staff during this extremely difficult time. Her spirit and loving memory will forever live in the Halls of Congress. She will be dearly missed. Mr. Speaker, turning to today’s rules, this rule brings the number of closed rules for the 115th Congress to 74. In other words, more than 50 percent of the legislation coming to the Rules Committee has been closed off from an open and honest debate by my Republican friends. At the beginning of this Congress, we were told by my Republican colleagues that they would run the government in an open manner. They even championed regular order. Well, that spirit has clearly been jettisoned in favor of an overly partisan approach to governing. By way of example, one of today’s bills, H.R. 5247, was introduced last Tuesday, brought to the House floor for a vote on the same day without the committee of jurisdiction holding one single hearing on the bill or Members having the opportunity to offer their amendments. b1230 Not surprisingly, the measure failed to pass under suspension of the rules. What was the response of my friends on the other side of the aisle when the vote failed? Did my Republican colleagues insist that the Energy and Commerce Committee hold hearings on the measure? Did my Republican colleagues on the committee of jurisdiction invite experts to speak on what the consequences would be if this bill were to become law? Did my Republican colleagues work with Democrats to come up with a bipartisan solution? No. Madam Speaker, let me tell you what did happen. The Republican leadership ignored the problems with the measure and brought it to the Rules Committee last night for it to be considered on the House floor today. Now, this flies in the face of regular order, to ask the entire membership of the people’s House to vote on something for which no one can honestly say they know what the unintended consequences would be if this bill were to become law. Bad process makes bad bills, and the process we have witnessed with this bill can’t get much worse. Yet it did get worse when the Republican majority blocked the ranking member’s, Mr. PALLONE ’s, substitute amendment, an amendment which was both germane and had bipartisan support. Madam Speaker, the Republican majority took it a step further when they extended the Holman rule for the remainder of the 115th Congress. My friends on the other side of the aisle are yet again seeking to scapegoat Federal employees, make cuts to the Federal workforce, and politicize the civil service system that was established to professionalize agencies and offices, all while ignoring the waste and abuses in the reality show of the Trump administration. Madam Speaker, challenged by the American people to bring up comprehensive gun reform, House leadership instead brings up one bill that hasn’t gone through anything resembling regular order and another bill that weakens and undermines a valuable tool that gives financial companies and regulators an opportunity to identify and correct problems before they could lead to another financial crisis. 
Every year, roughly 35,000 people are killed by guns. Moreover, 2,700 children and teens are shot and killed, and over 14,000 more are shot and injured every year. That is an average of 47 American children and teens shot every day. And the effects of gun violence extend far beyond those struck by a bullet. Gun violence shapes the lives of the millions of children who witness it, know someone who was shot, or live in fear of the next shooting. We have witnessed the effects over the last month with the students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. This weekend, hundreds of thousands of students and their supporters will descend on Washington, D.C., to demand that the Federal Government take action to stop the epidemic of mass shootings, which have become all too familiar. No less than this morning when I turned on the television, less than an hour and a half away from here, in yet another school, yet another shooting. Fortunately, it appears that the resource officer there engaged the shooter early on and may have caused there to be less damage, although some people were injured, and one or two critically. We can no longer ignore what gun violence really is in this country. It is an epidemic. But do not just take my word for it or the students who witnessed 14 friends’ and 3 teachers’ lives brutally cut short. The American Medical Association, following the tragedy at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, declared gun violence in this country ‘‘a very public health crisis,’’ a crisis which the Republican majority’s only answer is to offer thoughts and prayers and further block any Democratic measures to address this crisis and to continue to block the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from even researching gun violence. Instead of finally making permanent the status of Dreamers in this country as full citizens, the Republican majority ignores their calls and the calls of the vast majority of Americans and, instead, brings up one bill that undermines a valuable early warning system of our Nation’s economy and another bill that has gone through a completely closed process. Enough is enough. President Donald John Trump says he wants to fix this problem. The Speaker says he wants to fix this problem. We on this side of the aisle clearly want to fix this problem. So let’s do it already. Madam Speaker, last week, when I was managing yet another useless financial regulation, I commented and I asked the American public to respond: Would you rather us stop banks from having stress tests or would you prefer that we deal with the deferred action for children in this country, 800,000 of whom are Dreamers, 120 of whom lose their status every day? Would you prefer that we deal with the measure that is on the floor today or that we deal seriously with a variety of issues having to do with gun violence in our society, which I have described as an epidemic? Would you prefer as a priority, America, that we deal with these trivial matters that are going nowhere fast or that we center ourselves and focus on those measures that are vital to the survival, security, and safety of all Americans? Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, it was indeed incredibly disappointing last week when our Democratic colleagues did not join us in supporting what was very carefully crafted righttotry legislation. The President came and talked to us at the beginning of February, and right to try was one of the issues that he highlighted there from the podium. So it should be to no one’s great surprise that this House would indeed take up and work on that issue that the President himself highlighted. Right to try was the one piece of legislation that President Trump specifically promised to the American people in the State of the Union address. Today, I want it to be known that I stand with the President. I stand with the thousands of Americans with terminal diseases and their families and their friends in getting this important bill passed. Since 2014, 37 States, including my home State of Texas, have passed a version of a righttotry law, and through a strong grassroots movement, they have accomplished that. Today, the House is considering H.R. 5247, the Right to Try Act of 2018, which would improve access to experimental treatments for terminally ill patients and offer them a chance—a second chance, a third chance—at life. Over the course of the last decade, our Nation has achieved unprecedented innovation and scientific breakthroughs. Thanks to researchers in our academic institutions and those working in the pharmaceutical and medical device industries, American patients have access to innovative treatments. Regardless of these achievements, I hear from patients with serious life threatening conditions, including my constituents from north Texas, who are frustrated with what they see as regulatory barriers from trying and experimenting with new therapies when every other avenue has failed. It does seem we are at a crossroads when lifesaving treatments, while not yet approved, both exist and remain unavailable to patients. As a physician, I understand that access to investigational drugs and therapies is a deeply personal priority for those seeking treatment for themselves or loved ones with a serious and life threatening condition. It is crucial to mention the multistakeholder efforts that have gone into improving the original righttotry bill. Chairman WALDEN of the Energy and Commerce Committee led negotiations with the Commissioner of the United States Food and Drug Administration, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, and with other stakeholders to ensure that this legislation opens the door to innovative experimental drugs for these patients without necessarily compromising the vital work and the mission of the Food and Drug Administration. The product of those negotiations is a bill that strikes the proper balance between ensuring patient safety and granting access to these treatments. I also want to mention that the Subcommittee on Health did have a hearing in this regard October 3. We heard from the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration during that hearing. We heard from a number of patient groups and stakeholders who felt that it was, in fact, in their best interest for us to advance legislation. Currently, the Food and Drug Administration conducts an expanded access program aimed at helping patients who do not qualify for clinical trials to gain access to therapies that the agency has yet to approve. While this program makes a good faith effort to help those patients, right to try would create an alternative pathway for those individuals, allowing them to access eligible investigational drugs. The fact is that individuals may not qualify for a clinical trial if they do not meet very specific patient inclusion criteria, which may include factors such as age, gender, type and stage of disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions. There are also many patients for whom participation in a clinical trial is not feasible, especially those who live in rural areas far from where those academic clinical trial sites exist. Most, if not all, of the patients with a terminal medical condition fall into one of these categories. This legislation allows those patients to participate in the alternative pathway so long as they are certified by a physician who is in good standing and abides by the rules laid out in the bill. Again, we worked closely with the Food and Drug Administration to ensure that the new alternative pathway does not hinder or conflict with the critically important oversight that that agency conducts. While some people may have reservations about the safety of a new pathway, this bill protects patients from manufacturers mislabeling or misbranding drugs, requires sponsors and manufacturers to report adverse events to the Food and Drug Administration, and provides certain liability protections for parties participating in the new pathway. This alternative pathway would also be limited to individuals who have exhausted all FDAapproved treatment options. Additionally, only certain investigational drugs are considered eligible under this legislation. In order to qualify, the drug must have completed a 
phase one clinical trial, must have an active application, must be under active development or production by the manufacturer, and must not be the subject of a clinical hold. Eligible patients include those suffering from a stage of a disease or condition for which there is reasonable likelihood that death will occur in a matter of months or that would result in significant irreversible morbidity that is likely to lead to premature death. This revised righttotry bill also provides certainty to manufacturers in the drug approval process. It is essential that we do not create additional hurdles in that process. The legislation clearly states that the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services ‘‘may not use a clinical outcome associated with the use of an eligible investigational drug . . . to delay or adversely affect the review or approval of such drug.’’ b1245 Since the Health Subcommittee first considered the righttotry legislation, the bill has passed in the Senate, and we have had many conversations with patients, advocates, the administration, and stakeholders on all sides of this complex topic. That collaborative effort was necessary, and I am certainly grateful to all who participated in those discussions. Madam Speaker, this represents months of hard work and thoughtful discussions and decisions. I believe this legislation is a positive step forward in our shared goal of improving care for American patients. Again, this was the one aspect of the President’s State of the Union Address where he asked us specifically to act on this legislation. For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support the rule and the underlying bill. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, last night in the Rules Committee, I had dialogue with the author of this legislation and also the ranking member, Mr. PALLONE . I indicated to them that I have very strong sympathies regarding persons who are in the apparent throes of death and seeking some hope, and medication can have its advantages, and experimental medication can have its advantages. My quarrel with the legislation is that it didn’t go through regular order. I don’t understand why, with all of the experts. I introduced into the RECORD  in the Rules Committee last night a substantial number of organizations and individuals who have come forward. They all agree that something along the lines of what is being sought ought be undertaken, but it would allow for those persons to have added input into what ultimately may be significant legislation. But my friends on the other side plow right ahead on this matter that I reiterate was brought on suspension last week that failed, and then brought here last night for purposes of a rule along with financial stress legislation. So it is not that many of us are not sympathetic to the underlying principle that is being offered. It is that it is rank process and that we should not allow legislation to continue to come to the floor of the House of Representatives that blocks out a significant number of persons who may have input that would make the measure be much more salient to a more significant number of people. It is for that reason that I continue to ask the questions: What are our priorities here? What is the rush with reference to this matter while we are ignoring a significant number of other matters that we could be undertaking? In addition to that, we were supposed to go to the Rules Committee this afternoon on the omnibus bill; and now, evidently, there is wrangling going on between the parties and bicameral between the Senate and the House, and that measure isn’t ready to come to the floor. Yet we are dealing with something that isn’t the highest priority of the moment. I commented last night, anything that will help a person who is facing death is the kind of thing that we would want that person to have that opportunity to deal with. But we have children who have been killed and we have children who are facing the potential for that kind of horror, yet we are doing nothing. So, Madam Speaker, once again, I rise to appeal to my friends on the other side of the aisle: Please, listen to the American people and do more to help end the epidemic of gun violence that has plagued our Nation and that the American people are demanding Congress to do more. For example, in a recent Gallup Poll, nearly twothirds of adults wanted stricter laws on the sale of firearms. According to a recent NPR/Ipsos poll, 75 percent of respondents said they think gun laws should be stricter. As I indicated earlier, just this morning there were reports of another school shooting just an hour and a half from Washington, D.C., in Great Mills, Maryland. The American people are begging this body to do something to end this epidemic, so I offer the majority this opportunity: Madam Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I am going to offer an amendment to the rule to bring up four commonsense gun safety bills: H.R. 4240, the Public Safety and Second Amendment Rights Protection Act; H.R. 3464, the Background Check Completion Act; H.R. 2598, the Gun Violence Restraining Order Act; and H.R. 1478, the Gun Violence Research Act. These bills would close the dangerous gun show and internet sale background check loopholes, prevent the sale of guns without a completed background check, ensure that people who are a danger to themselves or others can be prevented from possessing a gun, and lift the prohibition on government sponsored scientific research on the causes of gun violence. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the RECORD , along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. FOXX). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question so that we can finally do something to address gun violence. Through you, Madam Speaker, I would advise my friend from Texas that I have no further speakers and I am prepared to close when he is prepared to close. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. NEWHOUSE ), who is a fellow member of the Rules Committee. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS ), as well as the good gentleman from Florida (Mr. HASTINGS ), because I want to take just a minute. I think it is appropriate at this time during this debate on a rule to remember Ms. LOUISE SLAUGHTER , our ranking member of the Rules Committee, a historical position. She was the very first woman to be the chairman of the Rules Committee. She gave three decades of service to our Nation through the U.S. Congress. As importantly—or, to me, more importantly—she was someone whom I consider a personal friend. LOUISE was an individual who I said yesterday could really transcend between politics and personal relationships. We had some very heated debates—a good example is today—and very strong differences of opinions, but we can do that. That is our job to do that. But LOUISE also taught us that we could do that without being negative to each other in a personal way. She was great at that. She embodied and personified the ability to have an objection without being objectionable, and I admired that greatly about her. She was a senior Member and I was a very junior Member. She didn’t have to do this, but in many ways she took me under her wing when I became a Member of Congress. We served on the Rules Committee together, and I very much relished that relationship that we had. Another thing that we had in common was we joined a very exclusive club, one that several other Members of this body belong to, and that is those people who have lost their spouses. When I was going through that very personally difficult time, LOUISE  
had the similar experience. She was very gracious to me to be able to help me through that very difficult time. We exchanged books. Many Members of Congress have read books by C.S. Lewis. LOUISE and I had many discussions about some of the things in some of his writings. In kind of a funny way, as she would do in manipulating me into thinking I was helping her, she was actually having me help myself through that very challenging time. I will always be forever grateful to her for doing that. She stood strong, and she was a formidable opponent. When she was managing the rule for the Democrats on the other side of the floor, it was always a challenging task, and you had to be on your game when you were on this side making the debate with her. I count myself very fortunate to have been able to know her and to have been able to work with her. I join together with all of my colleagues and her family to be able to remember her and honor her memory; and I will continue to do so, as she has truly left a large mark on this institution. Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I would say to my friend from Washington what I said last night: We would do a great service to LOUISE ’s memory if we were to make more open rules here on the House floor; and I will argue for her in that regard. Madam Speaker, before I close, I want to again reiterate the tremendous loss felt in this Chamber with the passing of our longtime colleague, Congresswoman LOUISE MCINTOSH SLAUGH TER. She was a champion of all the issues she cared about and a giant here in the House of Representatives. Her wisdom will be missed every day. Madam Speaker, the people’s House should be approaching our work in a manner that is fair to all Americans, in a manner where the appropriate committee of jurisdiction holds hearings and markups, in a manner where experts in the field are consulted, and in a manner where Members of both parties have the opportunity to offer amendments and debate the contents of the bill. The process we are witnessing here today is truly a slap in the face to regular order. A bill that has zero input from members on the Energy and Commerce Committee or that has been the subject of any thoughtful discussion is suddenly on the House floor for a vote. Now, I respect my friend from Texas’ view that last year in the Senate, and even perhaps since that time, and throughout the country, righttotry measures have passed in several States to some degree. But this particular bill that is on the floor that we are making a rule for has not gone through regular order; and that, then, disallows a significant number of persons who would have an opportunity to have input to what could be legislation that all sides could agree upon. Our failure to undertake to do that is a disservice, in my view, to the institution and to the measure that is being sought to be passed here today. This is not just an affront to normal House procedure; it is downright undemocratic and emblematic of the Republican majority’s inability to govern. I think it will redound to their discredit that they are not allowing this House to proceed under regular order. As I indicated earlier, more than 50 percent of all of the measures that have come to the Rules Committee and have ultimately come to the floor of the House of Representatives have been under closed rules, which means that Members who represent millions of people in America do not have opportunities to offer amendments that might make the measure better or, at the very least, have their views heard with reference to substantive legislation that is moving through this body. b1300 If we continue down this path for the remainder of this session, we will probably break the 100th barrier on closed rules. We have already had more closed rules than in the history of legislating in this country. That is not fair. That is basically all we are arguing. Open up the process. Let every Member have an opportunity for input on behalf of his or her constituents. It is the right thing to do. What has been happening is the dead wrong thing to do. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the rule, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  an article from The Dallas Morning News from 2010. The title of the article—and I am not going to read the whole thing—is: ‘‘Pelosi Pulled Strings to Let Dying Dallas Lawyer Try Experimental Cancer Drug.’’ 
[From the Dallas Morning News, 2010] PELOSI PULLED STRINGS TOLETDYING DALLAS LAWYER BARON TRYEXPERIMENTAL  CANCER DRUG (By Todd J. Gilman) WASHINGTON .—Dallas’ top Democratic donors will cut big checks to share dinner later this month with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Most will be motivated by a desire to protect the party’s congressional majority. Lisa Blue will have an extra reason: to say thanks for Pelosi’s efforts when her husband, Fred Baron, was dying of bone marrow cancer. His only option was an experimental drug whose manufacturer refused to give permission to use it for Baron’s condition. ‘‘He was a big fan of hers, and now I am as well,’’ Blue said. Baron, the ‘‘King of Toxic Torts,’’ built a fortune suing on behalf of asbestos victims. He died the week before Election Day 2008 at age 61. A prolific Democratic fundraiser, he served as finance chief that year for his friend John Edwards, who also made his fortune in court. Baron later acknowledged funneling large sums to Edwards’ mistress—a scandal that gave ammunition to those who already despised trial lawyers. But to Blue, first and foremost, Baron was a husband. The tale she tells of his final weeks is not so different than any widow might tell, except, of course, that the couple had friends in especially high places—friends like Pelosi, who will headline the Aug. 24 dinner to raise cash for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. In 2002, Baron was diagnosed with multiple myeloma. By October 2008, his doctors at the Mayo Clinic were telling him he had just days to live. They also offered a glimmer of hope. Over the years, the couple had donated about $1 million to Mayo. The staff was especially diligent, Blue said. They tested an arsenal of drugs and finally discovered that Baron’s cancer responded surprisingly well, in the lab, to a drug called Tysabri. Mayo had an ample supply, but the drug was—and still is—approved only for treatment of multiple sclerosis and Crohn’s disease. The manufacturer, Biogen Idec, refused to give permission, even under special ‘‘compassionate use’’ rules that protect a drug maker from a black mark in case of an adverse outcome. Biogen said it didn’t want to jeopardize the drug’s availability to other patients. (The company did not respond to a request for comment last week.) ‘‘I told Mayo, ‘I’ll sign anything, I’ll release anything. Just give him the drug,’’’ Blue said. Blue, also a top lawyer, began making calls. She started with Lance Armstrong, the bicyclist and cancer survivor, whom she had represented. ‘‘I started going through Fred’s Rolodex,’’ she said. ‘‘I called every politician, every celebrity that I knew and just begged them to help....  I  must have made 200 calls.’’ She called clinics in Canada, trying in vain to find doctors willing to administer the drug without Biogen’s OK. She hired a lawyer and prepared to sue Mayo to force it to dispense the drug. She even bought some Tysabri online from Australia, intending to send stepson Andrew Baron to smuggle it back, she said. The younger Baron posted an open plea online to Biogen, noting that Bill Clinton, Sens. John Kerry and Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa and even the head of the Food and Drug Administration had urged the company to reconsider. ‘‘You talk about mental anguish,’’ Blue recounted. ‘‘Fred, every day, would wake up and he said, ‘Am I going to get the drug?’’’ Others were supportive, she said, but Pelosi ‘‘put her heart and soul’’ into the cause, as did Harkin. Somehow—Blue still isn’t sure how—Pelosi cajoled the FDA to find a legal justification that let Mayo administer the drug, even without Biogen’s consent. ‘‘Nancy figured out a way,’’ she said. The drug beat back the cancer for a few days, but not enough. Blue has no illusion that a typical family could pull such strings. ‘‘There are so many cases like Fred’s,’’ she said. ‘‘One thing he taught me was politics matters. What a personal experience for me to understand how politics matters.’’ And no, she added, ‘‘It’s not fair that other people can’t pick up the phone and make the government give them a drug....  I t  was just such an awakening about how the drug companies have so much power.’’ That’s what she’ll tell Pelosi over dinner. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, this article references events that occurred in 2008. In 2002, this individual was diagnosed with multiple myeloma. By October of 2008, his doctors were telling him that 
he had just days to live. They also offered a glimmer of hope. There was perhaps one chance of therapy. It was an unproven therapy that might, in fact, be helpful to him. The family made inquiries, made entreaties, but they were not successful until they invoked the thenSpeaker of the House, NANCY PELOSI , who actually helped this lawyer get access to this medication. Unfortunately, it was not successful. His disease spread to a point where the therapy was not helpful. But the family observed, ‘‘NANCY  figured out a way.’’ How about that. The Speaker of the House figured out a way to get this medication to an individual who was dying of a disease, who obviously was very important—a large Democratic donor, and I get that. But the Speaker of the House intervened because the clinic where he was being treated felt that they did not have the authority to give him the medication. The company that was manufacturing the medication did not feel that it was in anyone’s best interest to give him the medication. But NANCY found a way. Well, Mr. Speaker, today, we are going to find a way. The President asked us, and we are going to find a way for those millions of Americans who are asking for that same chance. So today’s rule provides for consideration of two important consumerdriven pieces of legislation: H.R. 4566, by Mr. POLIQUIN , will help alleviate some of the regulations that were put in place under the Dodd Frank Act. H.R. 5247, the righttotry bill which garnered a majority of bipartisan support last week, will give patients who have nowhere else to turn another option to fight the potentially fatal health conditions with which they have been diagnosed. I do want to thank President Trump and Vice President PENCE for their leadership on this issue and helping us understand here in this body how important it is to move forward with this patientcentered legislation. I urge my colleagues to support today’s rule and the two underlying pieces of legislation. The material previously referred to by Mr. HASTINGS is as follows:

THEVOTE ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION : WHAT ITREALLY MEANS  This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the House of Representatives (VI, 308–311), describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.’’ To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition’’ in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (RIllinois) said: ‘‘The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.’’ The Republican majority may say ‘‘the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.’’ But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here’s 
how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ‘‘Although it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.’’ In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled ‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ‘‘Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon.’’ Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Republican majority’s agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. BACON ). The question is on ordering the previous question. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. 
RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess subject to the call of the Chair. Accordingly (at 1 o’clock and 4 minutes p.m.), the House stood in recess. 
b1340 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. JODYB. H ICEof Georgia) at 1 o’clock and 40 minutes p.m. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, today we rise to honor the service and sacrifice of seven airmen fallen in the line of duty last week on the IraqSyria border. There are no words that fully describe the profound sorrow and immense gratitude that consume us today. There are no words to describe the emptiness this loss leaves in the hearts of communities all across our Nation. There is, however, no shortage of ways to describe these seven servicemen: selfless, heroes, patriots, and everything we aspire to be as a people, as a nation, and as Americans. These fallen airmen are the best of who we are. They are the embodiment of what makes this country the greatest in the world, the willingness to make the ultimate sacrifice in defense of our exceptional Nation. There is no doubt these brave men, and the so many who have fallen before them, are the reason we have the opportunity to stand here today in the well of the House of Representatives, in the heart of the United States Capitol, which should always serve as a beacon of hope and freedom for so many in our country and around the world. Each and every day, these seven Americans answered the call of duty, to defend the liberties on which our Nation were founded, to defend their neighbors and communities, but, most selflessly, to defend the millions of Americans whom they would never know. Four of these airmen served with the 106th Rescue Wing in Westhampton Beach, New York, located in the First Congressional District. This amazing unit is made up of the best of the best our Nation has to offer, with a long, rich history of service and sacrifice. Mr. Speaker, the families of these seven great airmen have the unwavering thanks and appreciation of every American across our country, but, most of all, they have our utmost respect.

ALLEVIATING STRESS TEST BURDENS TO HELP INVESTORS ACT Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 787, I call up the bill (H.R. 4566) to amend the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act to provide relief to nonbanks from certain stress test requirements under such Act, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 787, in lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the Committee on Financial Services printed in the bill, an amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 115–65, is adopted, and the bill, as amended, is considered read. The text of the bill, as amended, is as follows: 
H.R. 4566 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Alleviating Stress Test Burdens to Help Investors Act’’. 
Section 165(i) of the DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (12 U.S.C. 5365(i)) is amended— (1) in paragraph (1)(B)(ii), by striking ‘‘and nonbank financial companies’’; and (2) in paragraph (2)— (A) in subparagraph (A), by striking ‘‘are regulated by a primary Federal financial regulatory agency’’ and inserting: ‘‘whose primary financial regulatory agency is a Federal banking agency or the Federal Housing Finance Agency’’; (B) in subparagraph (C), by striking ‘‘Each Federal primary financial regulatory agency’’ and inserting ‘‘Each Federal banking agency and the Federal Housing Finance Agency’’; and (C) by adding at the end the following: ‘‘(D) SEC AND CFTC .—The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission may each issue regulations requiring financial companies with respect to which they are the primary financial regulatory agency and that have total consolidated assets of more than $10,000,000,000 to conduct periodic analyses of the financial condition, including available liquidity, of such companies under adverse economic conditions.’’. 
Nothing in this Act shall be construed to limit the authority of the Financial Stability Oversight Council under section 120 of the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (12 U.S.C. 5330). 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill, as amended, shall be debatable for 1 hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Financial Services. After 1 hour of debate on the bill, as amended, it shall be in order to consider the further amendment printed in House Report 115–613, as modified by the order of the House of today, if offered by the Member designated in the report, which shall be considered read, shall be separately debatable for the time specified in the report equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent, and shall not be subject to a demand for a division of the question. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. HENSARLING ) and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. MAXINE WATERS ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. 
Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4566, the Alleviating Stress Test Burdens to Help Investors Act. Mr. Speaker, I especially want to thank the gentleman from Maine (Mr. POLIQUIN ), one of the most hardworking, enthusiastic, cheerful members of the House Financial Services Committee for all the work that he has done to advance this very strong piece of bipartisan legislation, which, incidentally, passed the Financial Services Committee again with another strong bipartisan vote of 47–8. Now, the financial crisis led to questions, both domestically and internationally, about how to address financial stability and create a regulatory framework to mitigate systemic risk, all the while ensuring robust economic growth. At the heart of this bill of the gentleman from Maine is a recognition that our economy can suffer when we get it wrong, when government attempts to dictate the business models and operational objectives of so many of our businesses. It is also a recognition that onesizefitsall regulations can stifle economic growth and ultimately harm consumers and harm our constituents. Current bankcentric standards and assessments to nonbank industries, such as the asset management industry, have needlessly saddled Main Street investors with increased costs while they are trying to save for college or retirement or some other important need, and this is perhaps no clearer than in this stress testing regime. As a former SEC chief economist observed in 2016, who said that, in the current law, ‘‘stress test the big banks; and, oh, you might as well go ahead and do the asset management companies.’’ That is his take of what the law says. In other words, asset management firms that, again, our constituents depend upon for their retirement security or for their financial planning are now subject to bank regulations simply because they operate under the financial services umbrella, even though such firms plainly have legal, structural, and operational characteristics that make them very, very different from banks. By the way, none of the asset managers had anything to do with the financial crisis that brought about the legislation that we are debating in the first place. For example, unlike banks, asset managers do not have access to the deposit insurance fund or the Fed’s discount window. If that is not enough for you, Mr. Speaker, here is more. Asset managers are legally separated—legally separated from the funds they manage, meaning that the asset and liabilities of the manager are distinct from the assets and liabilities of the funds. On the other hand, the bank business model directly subjects the bank to the risks and obligations of its assets and liabilities. Again, applying a onesize fitsall regulatory structure—in this case, a bankcentric model—is not only bad for the asset management industry, but, far more importantly, for our constituents that they serve, who choose to save and invest. Registered funds are the investment vehicle choices for millions of Americans seeking to buy a home, pay for college, plan for financial security and retirement. Application of unnecessary, illsuited, bankcentric stress testing requirements to register funds 
and advisers will undoubtedly increase cost for these funds and advisers, and, ultimately, this gets passed on to investors without any corresponding benefits that we can discern. The recent asset management and insurance report issued by the Department of Treasury confirms these concerns. The bill of the gentleman from Maine (Mr. POLIQUIN ) would fix this unequal regulatory structure by exempting certain nonbank financial institutions that have not been designated for supervision by the Federal Reserve Board from the act’s stress testing requirement. Further, in the true spirit of bipartisanship, I want to thank the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. CAROLYN  B. MALONEY ) for recognizing the underlying need for this relief and for working with Mr. POLIQUIN to offer an amendment during markup that allows the SEC and the CFTC to issue regulations to require certain financial companies they supervise to conduct periodic analysis of the financial condition of such companies under adverse economic conditions. The approach is common sense. It is not one size fits all. It recognizes that the primary regulator of nonbank financial companies is better suited than a bank regulator to determine whether these stress tests might be useful to address risk. And it recognizes that, as a general matter, stress testing asset managers is difficult and often needless. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this great bipartisan legislation. I believe we have an amendment forthcoming from the ranking member, which I expect our side of the aisle to support. I am led to believe that, with the adoption of her amendment, she would support the underlying bill. I hope that proves to come to fruition, in which case we can have a very strong bipartisan vote on this bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. b1430 Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose H.R. 4566, the socalled Alleviating Stress Test Burdens to Help Investors Act, which would make it harder for regulators to identify and mitigate hidden systemic risks at nonbank financial companies before they undermine our economy. Last Wednesday marked 10 years since global investment bank Bear Stearns imploded as a result of its failure to manage risk associated with its highly leveraged balance sheet and exposure to the subprime mortgage market. American taxpayers were forced to come to the rescue to prevent the firm’s collapse from spreading to other overleveraged Wall Street institutions. The demise of Bear Stearns was the canary in the coal mine for the ensuing financial crisis, which ravaged the United States economy, destroyed trillions of dollars of wealth, and put millions of Americans out of their jobs and their homes. Democrats responded to the 2008 financial crisis by passing the Dodd Frank Act, which, among other reforms, required rigorous stress tests of the Nation’s largest financial institutions. The DoddFrank Act also gave the Federal Reserve Board the discretion to quickly intervene and stress test firms that could pose financial stability risk. If regular stress testing had been conducted on firms like Bear Stearns from 2006 to 2008, it might have revealed major threats to the economy sooner, giving both the companies and Federal financial regulators a better chance to take remedial action to avoid a catastrophic near collapse of the global financial system. H.R. 4566 would eliminate the Federal Reserve’s authority to stresstest nonbank financial companies, even in situations where the firm’s designation as systemically important is pending before the Financial Stability Oversight Council, FSOC. Additionally, the bill would weaken the DoddFrank mandate that large financial companies under the SEC and CFTC’s purview conduct internal stress tests to determine the company’s ability to withstand a recession. Combined, these rollbacks would allow the Bear Stearns of the world to take on increasing amounts of risk while regulators are tied up in lengthy administrative processes. As former SEC Chair Mary Jo White stated in a December 2014 speech: ‘‘Stress testing is an important tool routinely used by banking regulators. Implementing this new mandate in asset management, while relatively novel, will help market participation and the Commission better understand the potential impact of stress events.’’ I agree with Chair White’s comments about the importance of stress testing and think that it simply does not make sound public policy to eliminate this tool. Members of the asset management industry have also recognized that stress testing is critical to effectively managing risk. In a 2015 letter to the SEC, the Asset Management Group of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, that is SIFMA AMG, whose members manage more than $30 trillion in assets, wrote: ‘‘Stress testing is one part of an effective and coherent risk management process for asset managers, the objective of which is not to test for solvency or capital adequacy, but to complement other approaches in assessing investment risk.’’ In fact, in a 2015 survey of SIFMA AMG members, nearly twothirds of the asset managers surveyed reported that they already stresstest their funds. It seems imprudent that Congress would repeal a requirement for large interconnected hedge funds that may have 15to1 leverage to periodically determine whether they could withstand a down economy. Moreover, given how rapidly failures at large nonbank financial companies can spread across the highly interconnected financial system, regulators must be able to quickly identify problems that could undermine U.S. financial stability. The Federal Reserve should continue to have the discretionary authority to step in to identify and mitigate systemic risk at any financial company whose failure could pose a threat to our economy. H.R. 4566 appears to ignore that nonbank financial companies like Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, and AIG played a central role in the financial crisis. When these firms collapsed as a result of their failure to mitigate their own internal risk, their losses sent shockwaves throughout the banking system. Stress testing these kinds of nonbank financial institutions provides a valuable early warning system for our economy and gives both the companies and regulators a chance to correct problems before they have catastrophic effects on our financial stability. That is why I intend to offer an amendment that, if adopted, would restore the Fed’s discretionary authority to stress test any nonbank, provided that the test meet certain conditions, including approval by a majority of FSOC members. It would also allow the Fed to use alternatives to capital, as appropriate, when stresstesting systemically important nonbanks and broaden the SEC’s and CFTC’s authority to require internal testing for entities under their purview. This amendment would ensure that large financial institutions, like investment companies that manage trillions of dollars of hardworking Americans’ retirement savings, can be appropriately evaluated for their ability to survive in a stressed economy. While I oppose H.R. 4566 in its current form, I would support an amended version of the bill that preserves the bill’s ability to identify and mitigate future systemic risk at nonbanks before they lead to another crisis. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from Maine (Mr. POLIQUIN ), who is the sponsor of this legislation. Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding me the time, and I thank the chairman for moving this very important piece of legislation through our committee, the Financial Services Committee, and onto the floor. This is a commonsense bill, Mr. Speaker, that I encourage everybody, Republicans and Democrats, to support, H.R. 4566. Throughout the great State of Maine and across America, Mr. Speaker, we have millions and millions of small 
savers and small investors who are planning for their retirement or for the college education for their kids or their grandkids. The people of Maine, Mr. Speaker, are the most honest and hardworking folks you can find anywhere, and every week thousands and thousands of Maine families are setting aside small parts of their paychecks into an IRA or a 401(k) plan so they will have enough money for their retirement, or setting aside small amounts of money for their son or their daughter to attend a college, a community college, a university, or a technical school. Today, Mr. Speaker, almost 55 percent of all American families, about 100 million of our fellow Americans, entrust these savings to mutual funds and other pension advisers such that they are able to grow and to provide them with a larger nest egg down the road. These asset managers, Mr. Speaker, are currently operating under the uncertainty of whether or not they will be subjected to very costly and, in many cases, unnecessary stress test regulations which are designed for large money center banks with very different functions in our economy. Mr. Speaker, when a bank takes in deposits from its customers, it is obligated to return those deposits and, hopefully, with interest. Now, it is important that those banks have enough reserves to make sure that, during a recession, they are able to meet those obligations. For many of these banks, stress testing does make sense. However, Mr. Speaker, mutual fund and other asset managers perform a very different function. If one invests for their retirement or their college savings, their goal is to grow that nest egg, but it is not guaranteed to be the case by the asset managers who are performing that job. In effect, Mr. Speaker, these asset managers of mutual funds serve as an agent for the investor and the small saver, with no liability to return these savings in full; but, of course, they take the risk for a better return down the road. Now, if you do have a huge money center bank with tentacles running throughout the economy and that bank fails, it could represent a systemic risk to our economy. But investors in a poorly performing mutual fund are simply able to switch their account to a better performing mutual fund house in order for a better return down the road with no systemic risk to the economy, in part, Mr. Speaker, because the assets themselves are held at a bank custodian. They are not even held at the mutual fund company or at the asset management firm. Now, my bill, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4566, exempts most nonbank financial institutions, like mutual funds, from costly stress test requirements. And this, Mr. Speaker, is so important to our small savers across the country because, when you have costly, cumbersome, and unnecessary regulations, they are paid for by the savers in these mutual funds and by these pension fund investors. And when they are paid out of their rate of return, their rates of return drop, and, therefore, the value of their nest eggs drop. Mr. Speaker, government should be in the job of helping our families live better lives with more financial security, and H.R. 4566 helps us do just that by removing onesizefitsall regulations that fit for lots of banks but not for the asset management community. Today, Mr. Speaker, approximately 4 percent of the expenses of asset managers are for complying with regulations. If we do nothing, that number is expected to go up to 10 percent of their expenses, just on compliance, within 5 years. Now, that makes a big difference because the higher the expenses, the lower the rate of return, the smaller the nest egg for those who are saving for college or for retirement. To give support to my point, Mr. Speaker, for the past 10 years, economists at our own Securities and Exchange Commission and at our own Treasury have not been able to design a stress test for asset managers and for thousands and thousands of mutual fund companies across the country, and that is because it makes no sense to try to do so. Stress testing as a prudential regulation simply does not fit every participant in the United States financial services sector. There are intrinsic differences between banks and asset managers, and my bill, Mr. Speaker, recognizes that difference and properly exempts most nonbank financial institutions from stress tests. That, in turn, again, Mr. Speaker, will lower the cost and increase the rates of return for Main Street investors across our great State of Maine and across America. Mr. Speaker, I thank you very much for the opportunity to address this very important issue, and I encourage everyone, Republicans and Democrats, both sides of the aisle, to please vote ‘‘yes’’ for H.R. 4566, Alleviating Stress Test Burdens to Help Investors Act. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, first, let me thank my colleagues on the opposite side of the aisle and my chairman, Mr. HENSARLING , for indicating their acceptance of the amendment. I think it is extremely important for both sides of the aisle to appreciate the necessity and the importance of stress testing, and I think we both do that. The discretion that we afford to the Feds in this bill, I think, is very important. So this is one of those instances when both sides can come together and recognize that there were important indications of what is needed to understand what should be done to avoid another meltdown in our financial services industries and our banks. Again, I don’t think there is any need for us to continue to talk about what we don’t like about stress testing, but, rather, we are coming together to talk about how it is done and why it is important. I have a great appreciation for that, and I would like to thank my colleagues for that. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. b1445 Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. MCHENRY ), who is the vice chairman of our Financial Services Committee and the chief deputy majority whip. Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my chairman for yielding time today on this important bill. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Alleviating Stress Test Burdens to Help Investors Act. It rolls off the tongue to some, maybe BRUCE  POLIQUIN ’s, the bill’s sponsor, but it is an important thing for us to discuss here today. Now, hindsight bias is a very dangerous thing. It allows us to overstate our ability to predict an outcome, and it is something that lures us into creating a new system that while excellent at solving the last financial crisis or the last crisis, the last event, it fails to see the next event coming. Now, it is not something that just fortune tellers use. It is not something that just those with an NCAA pool would use to say that all along they knew UMBC would beat Virginia. It is not just used there. Here in Washington, it is done by bureaucrats that are susceptible to these same fallacies. So in the wake of the financial crisis, policymakers here in Washington raced to give regulators new tools to help predict future risks so that such a crisis would never happen again. One of those tools was stress testing. The idea was to provide a method to test financial firms to differentiate between solid institutions that can weather a financial storm and those that would need help. But this crystal ball has flaws. One of the biggest flaws is treating all large financial firms the same, a onesizefitsall approach, and this includes lumping in nonbank financial firms that don’t use leverage with financial firms—bank firms—that do use leverage. Despite this widely understood concept that capital adequacy standards do not fit neatly into assessing the risks of the asset management industry, for instance, regulators have instead stuck to their rigid methodology to try to square the circle, or circle the square, whatever that phrase is. Thankfully, Representative BRUCE  POLIQUIN has crafted a very solid bill to address this truth and bring it into reality legislatively. The stress tests built after the financial crisis do not work for nonbank financial firms. This is a security show rather than security in fact. Thus, in a world that constantly throws big and unexpected events our way, understanding the limitations of 
predicting risk is one of the most important steps we can take to avoid future harm, and that is what this bill does. I encourage my House colleagues to vote in support of and in favor of it. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I am just amazed that anybody from North Carolina, after being beaten by Texas A&M by 21 points, would make any allusion to basketball whatsoever. I trust our next speaker will not make that mistake. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. LUETKE MEYER ), who is the chairman of the Financial Services Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit. Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, the chairman can be assured that since my team was one and done, I will skip the bracket discussion here. Mr. Speaker, I want to start by thanking the gentleman from Maine (Mr. POLIQUIN ) for his work on this very reasonable legislation. Stress tests are a good idea that should be standard practice in any company. What is not a good idea— and, quite frankly, not terribly helpful in promoting systemic financial stability—is the cryptic and arbitrary manner in which stress tests are handled today. Today, the Federal Reserve imposes these stress tests on all financial firms with more than $10 billion in consolidated assets. This doesn’t apply just to banks, despite the fact that the Fed is a bank regulator. This requirement to submit information extends to nonbank financial firms as well. Mr. Speaker, let me take a moment to walk you through what one of these stress tests looks like. A financial firm is given cryptic instructions to run a number of scenarios to test the fortitude of the institution. That firm then submits tens of thousands of pages to the Fed. In some cases, that number can climb to more than 100,000 pages at a cost of millions of dollars. Mr. Speaker, to give you an idea of what 20,000 pages is, in our committee hearing, we had a visual aid there with a table about this size right here in front of me today, about 3 feet tall, and boxes all around. That is 20,000 pages. Some of these stress tests, Mr. Speaker, are 100,000 pages, five times that amount, hundreds of thousands—if not millions—of dollars to do these stress tests; and, quite frankly, there is very little evidence that the Fed actually reads all the paperwork. In fact, one day you will probably get a call from the Fed, and they will tell you whether you passed or not. It is a very subjective test. There is no real explanation offered if a firm fails. The message is just to try again and keep trying until you finally pass the test and guess what the model is. This is not a productive exercise for anyone. The truth of the matter is that the Fed has no business conducting and analyzing stress tests on nonbanks. Those firms have functional regulators, like the SEC and CFTC, which better understand the business models and performance of nonbanks and, as such, the risks those firms pose to the financial stability of the United States. The actual supervisor of these companies should be the only entity with the ability to require these sorts of activities, and Mr. POLIQUIN ’s bill allows for that. Mr. Speaker, this legislation is about promoting thoughtful and effective legislation. It is about curtailing a one sizefitsall—as the chairman mentioned earlier—approach to regulation, something Members from both sides of the aisle have claimed to support. Mr. Speaker, I want to again thank the gentleman from Maine for his leadership on this issue, and I urge support of this legislation. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. HULTGREN ), who is the vice chairman of the Financial Services Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Securities, and Investments. Mr. HULTGREN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friend from Maine, BRUCE POLIQUIN , for sponsoring this bipartisan legislation. The Alleviating Stress Test Burdens to Help Investors Act amends the DoddFrank Act to make some commonsense changes to stress testing requirements for asset managers and the investors whom they serve. Congressman POLIQUIN has worked very hard to make sure this bill is bipartisan. In fact, he was able to win the support of twothirds of the Democrats on the Financial Services Committee. I believe this is one of the many bills that Chairman HENSARLING has suggested be part of our negotiations with the Senate on their regulatory relief package. I agree. Why shouldn’t a bill with such strong bipartisan support at least be part of the conversation? The idea behind the stress testing for financial institutions under Dodd Frank is to make sure that they have enough capital on hand to cover losses in the case of a market disruption like the one that was encountered during the financial crisis. However, registered funds have a very different business model than banks. They do not guarantee any return to investors or promise that investors will get their principal back. Furthermore, these funds are not on the adviser’s balance sheet. The idea that an asset manager should hold capital like a bank does not comport with its business model. Or in the words of Mark Flannery, a former chief economist of the SEC, there is a false parallel for stress testing asset managers: ‘‘The parallel to bank stress tests is really extremely misleading. It is as if DoddFrank said ‘stress test the big banks, and, oh, you might as well go ahead and do the asset management companies.’’’ Fortunately, BRUCE POLIQUIN has sponsored commonsense legislation to provide some regulatory relief in a way that I think Democrats and Republicans should be able to agree. The Alleviating Stress Test Burdens to Help Investors Act would eliminate the banklike stress testing requirements in DoddFrank but would empower the SEC, the primary Federal regulator of the asset management industry, to require stress testing as it deems appropriate. In short, what this bill says is that we should only stresstest asset managers as their primary regulator determines is in the best interest of the investors instead of arbitrarily applying banklike stress testing requirements as proposed by the Federal Reserve. It comes as little surprise that the SEC, including under the leadership of Mary Jo White, seems to agree. The SEC has not been able to come up with stress testing standards that are consistent and comparable with those of the Federal Reserve and other banking regulators, likely because there is no way to account for capital adequacy in these companies. Furthermore, this bill does nothing to undermine the significant regulatory authority to the Financial Stability Oversight Council. The FSOC would still be able to make recommendations to the SEC for additional regulation of asset managers. I am not necessarily endorsing this concept, but I would like to emphasize this in the hopes that it would encourage even more Democratic colleagues to join in support of this bill. This bill, again, is true to its name. It cuts costs that are borne by investors without subjecting our financial system to any additional risk. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join with me in supporting this bill. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. WILLIAMS ), who is the vice chairman of the Financial Services Subcommittee on Monetary Policy and Trade. Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take the opportunity to commend my friend and colleague from Maine (Mr. POLIQUIN ) for his leadership on this important issue. H.R. 4566, the Alleviating Stress Test Burdens to Help Investors Act, would help nonbanks not currently under supervision of the Federal Reserve from stress testing requirements. In addition to alleviating burdensome requirements, the bill allows the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to issue regulations requiring financial companies with more than $10 billion in consolidated assets to conduct a periodic analysis of their 
financial condition, including their liquidity. This legislation would properly tailor DoddFrank’s stress test requirements in a way that is appropriately focused. This bill retains the SEC’s ability to issue stress testing as it believes appropriate. The bill does not limit the Financial Stability Oversight Council’s authority to request the SEC to adopt suitable requirements for advisers and funds. Mr. Speaker, once again, I thank the gentleman from Maine for his commitment to this important piece of legislation. I encourage all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this bill on the floor. In God We Trust. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. KUSTOFF ), who is a hardworking member of the Financial Services Committee. Mr. KUSTOFF of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4566, the Alleviating Stress Test Burdens to Help Investors Act, which was introduced by my colleague, Representative POLIQUIN . Mr. Speaker, millions of Americans rely on registered funds to invest and save for their future, and they rely on asset management advisers to assist them in making major financial decisions, such as paying college tuition, saving for retirement, or buying a home. However, too often these advisers have their hands tied complying with burdensome regulations that were not intended for the type of financial institutions that they serve. Following the enactment of DoddFrank, a framework was created to assess systemic risk posed by financial institutions, and this framework looked at the risk from a bankcentric approach. In addition, DoddFrank required all financial companies with total consolidated assets of more than $10 billion to conduct various annual stress tests to comply with the law. Now, unfortunately, this broad definition sweeps in registered investment companies and requires that these nonbank institutions be held accountable for the same stress tests as banks. This particular stress test does not make sense for the asset management industry and only adds costs that will end up putting the burden on investors who rely on these funds. Again, the U.S. asset management industry is critical in promoting diverse investment and savings opportunities for individuals, for families, and for businesses. This important legislation would eliminate unnecessary costs for nonbank financial institutions that have not been designated as systemically important by removing Dodd Frank’s bankcentric, mandatory stress test requirement. As we continue to explore new ways to help families save for their future or buy a new home, we should remain focused on improving their ability to invest. I want to thank Representative POLIQUIN and Chairman H ENSARLING for their important work on this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this important bill. b1500 Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased about the work that staff has done on this particular legislation. I do believe that we all agree that stress tests are important; it is a matter of who, how, and when. Someone has likened stress tests to car testing, where, in the manufacture of new cars, you take them out on the road and you test them to see if they can withstand what they may be presented with in the terrain and with the kind of things that you would experience perhaps on the roughest roads that they test on. When they determine that there are weaknesses that can be corrected, that is what they do in order to make sure that this new vehicle that they are testing can withstand whatever the difficulties are that may be presented to them when they test a car. That is what this stress testing is all about. It all about whether or not, in the event of a downturn in our economy, you have the ability to withstand the downturn, whether or not you have the ability to not only withstand what you are presented with in a downturn of the economy, but how you can fix what you have determined is wrong with what you are doing. So I am, again, very pleased that we all agree that stress testing is extremely important and that we know what your concerns are about hedge fund and asset managers and all of that. But the discretion that we give to the Feds, I think, is very important. The fact that all of the businesses that we are concerned with will be doing their internal stress testing is extremely important. So, again, I am very grateful for the acceptance of my amendment, and I am hopeful that, with this amendment, it demonstrates that, when we work very hard to reconcile our differences, we can do that. Mr. Speaker, I would ask that, with this amendment, all of the Members of the House vote for this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, once again, I want to encourage all of my colleagues to support H.R. 4566, the legislation from the gentleman from Maine. I want to commend him once again. He is one of our most hardworking members on the committee, and he cares passionately about his constituents in Maine. I also want to commend him for once again working on a very bipartisan basis. He has managed to change his bill from its original concept many times to try to garner more support from the other side of the aisle. With the acceptance of the ranking member’s amendment, again, I am hopeful that we will have a very, very strong vote in the House. Again, this came out of committee with a very strong bipartisan vote of 47–8. Mr. Speaker, very often we debate regulation. I think that now, fortunately, we have a 3 percent growth Tax Code which has been passed by Congress, but, unfortunately, I do not believe we have a 3 percent growth of finance in the banking system. That is important. It is important to our constituents who still need credit to buy that first home, a factory worker who needs to get their transmission repaired so that they can go to work, some parent trying to send a kid to college, or people trying to plan for their retirement. Too often, I think we have a dichotomy between regulation and deregulation, when the real dichotomy is between smart regulation and dumb regulation. It is always incumbent upon us in Congress to look very carefully at these regulations. Sometimes they look very good on the chalkboard, but in reality, they don’t quite render the results or benefits that we had hoped for. So we always have to take a look at what this is doing not just to consumer and investor protection, but what it is doing to economic growth as well. I agree with the ranking member. Stress testing is a good concept. It is one of the reasons why banks and other financial firms typically stresstest themselves daily, weekly, monthly, annually. What doesn’t make sense, though, is that there be no recognition to the cost that it imposes, as the gentleman from Missouri, the chairman of our Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit Subcommittee, was very articulate in reminding us that these submissions can cost us millions and millions of dollars. The reports are not measured in pages; they are measured by the pound. There can be 10 and 20pound submissions of paper that we wonder if anybody ever reads. But what especially doesn’t make sense is trying to apply a bank stress test to a nonbank financial institution, particularly an asset manager. I know the ranking member was talking a little bit earlier about using an analogy to auto inspections: It makes no sense to have the home inspectors inspect your auto; it makes no sense to have the auto inspectors inspect your home. The gentleman from Maine is ensuring that whatever stress test is applied, it is applied properly to the business model that needs to be tested for its potential stress of our financial system. So, again, I just want to commend the gentleman from Maine for his hard work, and I urge all Members to vote in favor of H.R. 4566 because, indeed, 
maybe it is not a catchy title, but it is an accurate title. As we alleviate stress test burdens, we do help investors. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. HUDSON ). All time for debate on the bill has expired. 
AMENDMENT NO . 1, AS MODIFIED , OFFERED BY  
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1, as modified, printed in House Report 115–613. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk made in order under the rule. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment, as modified. The text of the amendment, as modified, is as follows: 
Page 1, strike lines 8 and 9 and insert the following: (1) in paragraph (1)(B)— (A) by redesignating clauses (ii) through (v) as clauses (iii) through (vi), respectively; (B) by inserting after clause (i) the following: ‘‘(ii) may conduct the evaluation required by this subsection utilizing alternatives to the capital adequacy test described in subparagraph (A), as the Board may determine appropriate;’’; (C) in clause (iii), as so redesignated, by inserting before the semicolon the following: ‘‘, provided that such tests of any nonbank financial company— ‘‘(I) are requested by a majority vote of the Council; ‘‘(II) are conducted in accordance with the company’s business model, including by utilizing alternatives to the capital adequacy test described in subparagraph (A), as the Board may determine appropriate; and ‘‘(III) are not already required by the company’s Federal primary financial regulatory agency’’; and (D) in clause (vi), as so redesignated, by striking ‘‘clause (ii)’’ and inserting ‘‘clause (iii)’’; and Page 2, beginning on line 10, strike ‘‘and that have total consolidated assets of more than $10,000,000,000’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 787, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. MAXINE  WATERS ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, in its current form, H.R. 4566 eliminates the Fed’s discretion to require stress testing on nonbanks that have not yet been designated as systemically important and weakens the DoddFrank Act’s mandate that the SEC and CFTC require nonbank financial companies under their authority to conduct annual stress tests. Together, these repeals create a loophole that would allow large brokerage firms and mega insurance companies to ignore risks while regulators are tied up in lengthy rulemaking or the FSOC designation process. My amendment, if adopted, would restore the Fed’s discretionary authority to stresstest any nonbank financial firm, provided that the test is requested by a majority vote of the FSOC, is conducted with consideration of the company’s business model, and is not already required by the company’s primary regulator. My amendment would also allow the Fed to consider alternatives to the existing capital adequacy test, where appropriate, when conducting stress tests on nonbanks, including those designated as systemically important. One of the key safeguards created by DoddFrank is the Fed’s ability to identify and mitigate risks in the financial system before they undermine the U.S. economy. By preserving the Fed’s ability to stresstest nonbank financial companies on a discretionary basis, my amendment will give regulators a better chance of preventing the next Bear Stearns or Lehman Brothers from dragging down our financial system. Finally, my amendment would broaden the SEC’s and CFTC’s authority under the bill by striking the provision that would limit future companyrun stress testing requirements to entities with more than $10 billion in assets. This would ensure that the SEC and CFTC can require any financial company under their purview to evaluate their own ability to survive in a stressed economy. While I oppose H.R. 4566 as currently drafted, with this amendment, the bill would represent a truly bipartisan effort to strengthen DoddFrank. Mr. Speaker, I would urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on my amendment. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition to the amendment, although I am not opposed. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I am not thrilled with the amendment, but in the spirit of compromise and the spirit of bipartisanship, we have worked with the ranking member and the sponsor of the legislation. It wouldn’t be my preferred approach, but that is often what we do around here. I want to thank the ranking member for working with the majority side in order to advance this, again, as a very strong bipartisan vote in the House, which I hope and anticipate with the inclusion of this amendment. I would point out, Mr. Speaker, again, I am very happy. On the other side of the Capitol, they have recently advanced a number of kind of smart regulatory measures and capital formation measures. We look forward to negotiating with our friends in the Senate. I am hoping that an overwhelming vote on a bill like H.R. 4566 is one that could be in a final package before it goes to the President’s desk. Again, I still think that, although we have all compromised a little something here, I think we all advance our principles. I think it is something that will help, actually, both financial stability and investor protection, including protecting their opportunities to have a better future. So again, I want to thank the ranking member for working with us, and I would urge the House to adopt her amendment and adopt H.R. 4566 by Mr. POLIQUIN of Maine. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maine (Mr. POLIQUIN ). Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Speaker, who says that a terrific Representative from one of the most urban areas in the country, Los Angeles, California, cannot get together with a Representative from one of the most rural parts of America up in the great State of Maine? I thank Ranking Member WATERS for her extension of bipartisanship. I also thank Chairman HENSARLING very much for brokering this. This is going to be a great day for America, a great day for Maine, and a great day for California. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for those kind words, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the previous question is ordered on the bill, as amended, and on the amendment, as modified, offered by the gentlewoman from California (Ms. MAXINE WATERS ). The question is on the amendment, as modified, by the gentlewoman from California (Ms. MAXINE WATERS ). The amendment, as modified, was agreed to. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the passage of the bill. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. HENSARLING.

HOUR OF MEETING ON TOMORROW Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 10 a.m. tomorrow for morninghour debate and 11 a.m. for legislative business. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. 
MABEL LEE MEMORIAL POST OFFICE Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform be discharged from further consideration of the bill (H.R. 4463) to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 6 Doyers Street in New York, New York, as the ‘‘Mabel Lee Memorial Post Office’’, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 4463 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
(a) D ESIGNATION .—The facility of the United States Postal Service located at 6 Doyers Street in New York, New York, shall be known and designated as the ‘‘Mabel Lee Memorial Post Office’’. (b) REFERENCES .—Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, or other record of the United States to the facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be a reference to the ‘‘Mabel Lee Memorial Post Office’’.

PERMISSION FOR MEMBER TO BE CONSIDERED AS PRIMARY SPONSOR OF H.R. 756 Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that I may hereafter be considered to be the primary sponsor of H.R. 756, a bill originally introduced by Representative Chaffetz of Utah, for the purpose of adding cosponsors and requesting reprintings pursuant to clause 7 of rule XII. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Virginia? There was no objection. 
BRAIN INJURY AWARENESS DAY (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, today is Brain Injury Awareness Day, and I welcome those who are in Washington today to share their stories. This issue is near and dear to my heart. For nearly 30 years, this was my area of practice and expertise as a therapist and rehabilitation services manager. I served as a board member for the Brain Injury Association of Pennsylvania and helped form a brain injury support group. The theme for this year’s campaign is Change Your Mind. This public awareness campaign strives to destigmatize brain injury; empower those who have survived, as well as their caregivers; and promote the many types of support available. The need to raise awareness is great. More than 2.8 million Americans sustain traumatic brain injuries in the United States each year. The 13 million Americans living with brain injuries want what we all want: to be defined by who they are as people, not by their injury. Mr. Speaker, everyone recovers at a different pace, and we should do everything in our power to support and encourage brain injury survivors. They deserve no less. 
GET SCREENED FOR COLON CANCER (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge each of my colleagues and the American people to talk to their doctors about getting screened for colorectal cancer. Each year, I sponsor a resolution to recognize March as National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month. By raising awareness about this preventable cancer, we can save lives. During this Congress, Representative CHARLIE DENT and I introduced H.R. 1017, the Removing Barriers to Colorectal Cancer Screening Act of 2017. This bill would eliminate surprise outofpocket costs for Medicare beneficiaries who have polyps removed during colonoscopies. I also introduced H.R. 1578, the Donald Payne Sr. Colorectal Cancer Detection Act of 2017, which would expand Medicare to cover certain bloodbased colorectal cancer screening tests. Named after my father, who passed away from colorectal cancer, this bipartisan legislation would significantly increase colorectal cancer detection and treatment. Each year, I lead the appropriations letter to increase the funding for CDC colon cancer research. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me on these important bills. Together, we can save lives from colorectal cancer. f 
NATIONAL AGRICULTURE DAY (Mr. YOHO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, President Trump has declared today to be National Agriculture Day, a time of celebration and gratefulness to our Nation’s farmers and ranchers. Whether we realize it or not, agriculture is a part of all of our daily lives from morning until night. In fact, each American farmer feeds over 144 people, providing vital nutrition, and helping us better connect with our Godgiven resources. Every $1 of United States agricultural products and food exports creates another $1.27 in business activity. Our country’s agricultural exports are valued at more than $100 billion, including $4 billion from my own home State of Florida. Every $1 billion in exports supports approximately 8,000 American jobs. That is over 8 million jobs created by agriculture. While celebrations such as these mark tremendous achievements for U.S. agriculture, we must continue to construct policies that supports and strengthens all of our farmers and ranchers. As lawmakers, let us make this celebration a time of action and work towards initiatives that continually uplift our ag industry. 
HONORING SHANTHI VISWANATHAN (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Mrs. Shanthi Viswanathan, a teacher at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, whose quick thinking saved lives. As the second alarm went off that day, Mrs. Viswanathan knew something was wrong and she locked the classroom door, telling her students to take cover. When the SWAT team arrived and asked her to let them in, she would not because she didn’t want to risk falling for a gunman’s trick. Instead, she told them: ‘‘Knock it down or open it with a key.’’ When Mrs. Viswanathan knew there was danger, she exemplified the truest form of the Hindu concept of dharma, of duty, in protecting those she was responsible for. These actions were brought to my attention by the Hindu American Foundation, which continues to support the victims of the shooting as part of their broader commitment to Ahimsa, the Hindu concept of nonviolence. They have also pursued various measures of gun control, which I wholeheartedly support. I commend them for their efforts here. Thank you to Mrs. Viswanathan and the Hindu American Foundation for their exemplary work and for making America a better place. f 
EIGHTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the eighth anniversary of the Affordable Care Act. Since it was signed into law, Americans have relied on the ACA for access to quality, affordable healthcare; but Republicans have attacked Americans’ healthcare at every turn. Last year, Republicans tried to pass TrumpCare, a bill that would have imposed a crippling age tax, raised outof pocket costs, and increased the number of uninsured Americans by 23 million. After the American people stopped TrumpCare in its tracks, Republicans went after the Affordable Care Act again in their tax scam. On top of that, the administration waged a persistent campaign to discourage people from enrolling in the ACA plans. Despite GOP sabotage, Americans still signed up for the Affordable Care Act. Americans want better, more affordable healthcare, and that is what Democrats offer: A Better Deal for better healthcare. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF TERESA KIMURA (Mr. KIHUEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Teresa Kimura. Teresa traveled to the Route 91 festival in Las Vegas on October 1 with six of her friends. She was known for making every gathering an amazing experience. Teresa worked at the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration. She is remembered for her big heart, love of life, beautiful spirit, and infectious laugh. I would like to extend my condolences to Teresa Kimura’s family and friends. Please note that the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada, and the whole country grieve with you. 
ISSUES OF THE DAY The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. BUDD). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. KING) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to be recognized to address 
you here on the floor of the United States House of Representatives. I come before this floor to address a topic that has been front and center in this country since 1973: when the Supreme Court came down with the decisions known as Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton, then the subsequent case in the early 1990s, Planned Parenthood v. Casey. This is a nation that has traditionally—and from the very beginning of the very first founding document, the Declaration of Independence—respected and revered life. As our Founding Fathers put that language together, and as John Adams coached Thomas Jefferson, and Thomas Jefferson put his pen to the Declaration of Independence: ‘‘We hold these truths to be selfevident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.’’ Now, Mr. Speaker, it wasn’t an accident that the order of these rights that come from God be started out with life, then liberty, then the pursuit of happiness. Of all the scholars that I have talked to and the times that I have sat in the classroom and in my readings, it just never really claim clear. It is not educating our young people about what they were thinking about when they drafted that language in the Declaration: ‘‘We hold these truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights,’’ but the right to life is listed first. It is not second or third. They didn’t put together a list of four or five or seven or ten different rights. They laid three out in the Declaration. And those three start with life, because life is the most paramount right. The former Governor of Pennsylvania, Governor BOBCASEY , a Democrat, who has since passed away, was denied an opportunity to speak at the Democratic National Convention some years ago because he was a prolife Democrat Governor and he would speak in favor of life. He said this: ‘‘Human life cannot be measured. It is the measure itself against which all other things are weighed.’’ The measure itself. Now, what does that mean and how do we think about this, Mr. Speaker? It would be this: when the Frenchmen devised the metric system, they set up a distance that was divided out to mean a ratio of the circumference of the Earth in whatever manner of calculation they had. And they came down to—however many times they divided that around, it came down to the length of the meter. b1600 Then they produced this meter that was a platinum rule that was set at precisely the length of the meter. And, in controlled temperature and pressure, at standard temperature and pressure, what would the length of this platinum rule be? Exactly a meter. Now, how long is a meter? I guess I could tell you, we can measure it by other measures. We can do some comparisons. But that meter, that original meter made out of platinum that is maintained at standard temperature and pressure, that is the measure itself; and all other measurements of length that are incorporated within the metric system, all of those measures of length are in relation to the meter itself. That meter stick, the original one, is the measure itself against which all other distances are weighed and measured in the metric system. Human life is the measure itself against which we measure every other value that we have because human life is sacred in all of its forms. And then, once we accept that and this Nation accepts that human life is sacred in all of its forms—Democrats and Republicans do agree to that, I believe, generally speaking, maybe even universally—but the disagreement comes in, well, when does life begin? When does life end? We can look at any one of the prolife groups that are here in this country. You can ask the priests and pastors around America: When does life begin? The most consistent answer to that question is life begins at the moment of conception, the instant of fertilization, the instant of conception. That language is threaded throughout. I have walked into gymnasiums, or maybe a whole school, K–12, or maybe a high school alone, and I will say to them: You will be faced with a couple of questions in your emerging young adult life, and the counsel that you would give to your friends perhaps, or maybe you, yourself, you will have to answer these two questions: Is human life sacred in all of its forms? And I will say to them: Look at the person next to you. Is their life sacred? And they will nod their head. Look at the person on the other side. Is their life sacred? And they will nod their head. And I said: And they are looking at you, and they are nodding their head at you, too, because everybody in here, your life is sacred. It is precious. It is the measure itself against which all other things are weighed. So once we universally agree that human life is sacred in all of its forms, then we have the next question and ask the question: At what moment does life begin, at what instant? And that is that instant at conception, that instant at fertilization. The rational, moral thought and faithful reasoning comes to that conclusion. Yet the Supreme Court, in Roe v. Wade and in the accompanying case of Doe v. Bolton, on January 22, 1973, brought down a decision that decided that liberty and pursuit of happiness trumped life. They concluded that a mother could decide whether that child was inconvenient, whether they didn’t want the child at the time, and allowed for abortion on demand. Coupling the two cases together, they allowed for abortion on demand. Doe v. Bolton wrote everything in the list that could be exceptions: it could be the mental health; it could be the physical health; it could be even the familial health of the mother, which any of this could be affected by finances themselves. So if you don’t think you can afford this baby, Doe v. Bolton lets you say: Well, it affected my mental health. It affected my familial health, so I decided to abort the baby. And any abortion doctor could conduct an abortion at will, staying within this framework that was manufactured by the Supreme Court that turned the principles that are in our Declaration on their head. They no longer recognize that life is the paramount right that is delivered to us from God and that liberty is secondary to life and that pursuit of happiness is tertiary to life. Now, think of this. If any of us, in our pursuit of liberty, would decide that someone’s life is in the way of our liberty, we can’t go kill them. We would end up in prison or executed in some States. We can’t go kill somebody because they infringe upon our liberty. Their life is more important than our liberty. Neither can someone, in their pursuit of happiness, trample on someone else’s liberties. Our liberties of freedom of speech, religion, the press, assembly, the right to keep and bear arms, the protections that we have on a reasonable search and seizure, a jury of our peers, the States’ rights that are enshrined in the Constitution that are subordinate to the enumerated powers in the Constitution, that is all laid out within a beautiful framework that has never been done better anywhere in the world in the history of the world, but it is based on the prioritization of God given rights. Life is more important than liberty, is more important than this pursuit of happiness. By the way, to define pursuit of happiness a little more thoroughly, some of the young people are growing up and they read that and don’t give it very much thought. They say, well, pursuit of happiness is a fun tailgate party before the ball game; it is getting together with my friends; it is sitting down with my Xbox and enjoying the video games that are going on. Maybe it is just listening to music. None of those things fit the categories that our Founding Fathers envisioned when they put pursuit of happiness in the Declaration. Pursuit of happiness was lifted from the Greek term ‘‘eudaimonia,’’ which is spilled EUDAIMONIA—because we are friends, Christina. Eudaimonia, the Greek term, means pursuit of happiness in this concept that our Founding Fathers understood, and that was that development of the whole human being, not a party at all, not a joke at 
all, not a time necessarily of laughter, but it was a component; to develop one’s self intellectually, develop one’s brain power with a knowledge base that was as strong as it could be, and for a lifetime, to develop one’s mind and develop it thoroughly and contemplate deep thoughts to develop themselves. That is the intellectual component of it. There was a theological component to develop one’s self religiously, which they did. Even though they were pagan, in my view, they developed themselves in a belief in a hereafter and in a belief in higher beings. It was plural for the Greeks, the higher beings. But they were developing their intellect. They were developing themselves spiritually and theologically and also physically. They kept their bodies in shape, and they worked out and they exercised, and they competed in the sports that are the foundation of our Olympics today. All of that was wrapped up in the eudaimonia of the time that our Founders read and understood. Thomas Jefferson thoroughly understood. There is no doubt he understood the meaning of the word ‘‘eudaimonia.’’ He just didn’t think the American people would understand it, so he wrote in there, ‘‘pursuit of happiness.’’ We have just kind of given a short and a brief definition of that. We haven’t given it the full respect it was intended by the drafter and, in many cases, the author of our Declaration, Thomas Jefferson. So now that I have reset this, life is paramount and it is the most important, and any of us should be willing to sacrifice at least some of our liberty to protect and save the lives of others because those lives are that precious and that important. Any one of us who is in pursuit of our eudaimonia, our pursuit of happiness, should be willing to give up some of that in order to secure and protect the liberties—not only our liberties, but the liberties of others. So a nation that is built upon those principles would also be a nation that would do most anything to protect the lives of the most innocent among us, our unborn, our unborn that don’t have the ability to scream out for their own mercy. They don’t have the ability to come to Congress and lobby for themselves. They are silent. They have no chance to make a noise even until the day that they draw their first breath, if they have the opportunity to draw that first breath. But the tally for the decision of Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton on January 22, 1973, now has reached or exceeded 60 million babies—60 million babies sacrificed on the altar of choice. Watching the prioritized rights that came from God, we are endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights. Our Supreme Court got it wrong, and they set the liberty of the mother over the life of the baby. They set the pursuit of happiness, the eudaimonia, presumably, of the mother, over the life of the baby. We have a hole in our society; not only a hole that comes from the heavy, heavy guilt of tolerating this throughout these years, but it is a hole that is a multigenerational hole: 60 million babies not born that would otherwise be living, loving, laughing, learning, falling in love, having babies of their own, worshipping, and raising their children with the values that have made this America a great nation. But that is all denied this Nation. It is denied the world. The solutions that they would have provided, the happiness and the joy they would have delivered, intellectual firepower that would come from 60 million babies is denied to us. And to go back and look and think, also, a good number of those little girls that were aborted since 1973 would have otherwise been mothers today. And to look at it generationally, and this is a backoftheenvelope calculation, to take those little girls and predict that maybe each one of them would have had three babies, each one, that calculates out to be, Mr. Speaker, another 60 million babies—another 60 million. So the population of this country would be something like 120 million stronger if the Supreme Court had believed and had conviction on what I have just described about the right to life being the paramount right—more important than liberty, more important than the pursuit of happiness, eudaimonia, the right to life. When the Supreme Court made that erroneous activist decision, they started this country in a downward spiral, a spiral where there is less respect for life than there was before 1973. Mr. Speaker, if I just take you to the school shooting data and address that, we look back through the history and the records of the school shootings as well as mass killings that have taken place in schools, look back over the last century, the earliest one that we could find was 1924, in Michigan. It was a series of bombs that were planted in the schools there in Michigan, set to go off by alarm clocks, which would be the kind that we would see in the old cartoons today. Those bombs were timed to go off, and the result of that was 40 people were killed in the bombings at the school in Michigan in 1924, mass school killing. That is the largest mass school killing that we could find by sorting through history as deeply as we could research it, 40 killed, bombings, 1924. Then not another mass school killing or shooting, not another killing until 1940, when an individual went into a school in Pasadena and killed five people with a pistol. Then not another school shooting, mass shooting of any kind at least, took place from 1940 on. It took us all the way to 1963, 23 years after that single mass school shooting in Pasadena. Twentythree years later, the Supreme Court came down with another erroneous decision called Murray v. Curlett. Murray v. Curlett is the case that took prayer out of public schools. Up till that time, we went to school and we went into school and started the day with the pledge and a prayer in the classroom with the teachers, especially in elementary school. I remember that clearly. But by the time the Murray v. Curlett decision came down, I was a freshman in high school, and I remember that order. The Supreme Court commands no more prayer in the public schools. Where did they get the authority to declare that we couldn’t exercise our freedom of religion? Now, I have been challenged on this a good number of times in subsequent years, but I remember them saying: Well, what will you do about the separation of church and state? Well, first of all, there isn’t a separation of church and state, but it is being exercised by Supreme Court decisions as a separation even not only of church and state, but church and school. Now, the First Amendment of the Constitution writes, and what it specifically does is it prohibits Congress from establishing a law that creates a state religion. And it denies the ability of Congress to pass that legislation that establishes a state religion, so that is all it does. And the freedom of religion shall not be infringed. We have a freedom of religion, but they still, the Supreme Court, made the decision to take prayer out of the public schools, an activist act that then began to scrub faith and morality out of our public schools. b1615 I remember that freshman year when I learned this. I remember in that classroom—and these images are in my mind clearly. It was: How are they going to stop us from praying in our schools? What could they possibly do to keep us from praying? They hadn’t invented duct tape yet at that time, Mr. Speaker, but, you know, I am thinking the white adhesive tape that doctors use, the medical tape, and I had images in my mind: Well, they could tape our mouths shut with that tape. We could pray silently. They couldn’t stop us from praying by taping our mouths shut. The only way to stop prayer in the public schools, if we refuse to accept the order, was to empty the schools out themselves. That image is in my mind. Denison Community Schools, where I went to high school, I can still see the central building in my mind’s eye, clearing out all the rooms, emptying the rooms, all the students going outside, outside of that school. And the Army. The Army is in my imagination—Vietnam era—that the Army would come in, and they would have a new chain to roll around those bars that you push inside the doors to open the doors, wrap that chain around there, put a new padlock on it, and post a guard, an Army uniform outside those doors, every entrance into that 
school. That is the only way they could have stopped prayer in that public school. But they stopped it because we accepted the order of the Supreme Court. We accepted the beginning of the degradation of the moral core of America that was being taught in every public school in America at that time. We revered our faith. We understood our history. We knew that our Founding Fathers, who put this country together, who I believe were moved around like men on a chessboard by the hand of God—I believe the Declaration is written not with divine inspiration, like the Bible, but with divine guidance, just a little bit lower standard of proof. We are gifted in this country with the divine grace that God guided the men and women who built this country in the nearly perfect foundation that they put in place in the Declaration and in also the Constitution. But we let the Supreme Court, that was never designed to be the most powerful of the three branches of government—we let the Supreme Court rule. And then, now, today, we teach in those schools that there is three equal branches of government. They are not equal. They were not designed to be equal. The Founding Fathers put them together that the judicial branch of government was designed to be the weakest of the three branches of government, and they were not even the branch of government that was designed to come down with a rule on what is constitutional and what is unconstitutional. The Constitution requires that Congress establish a Supreme Court. And I had made this case to, God rest his soul, Justice Scalia, an awfully hard man to say goodbye to for all that he has done for our country and all the clarity that he has brought to the understanding of the Constitution. I am grateful that Justice Gorsuch is there to replace him in picking up on the things that are so well perfected by Justice Scalia. But in a meeting with 30 or 40 other members here several years ago, I made the point, Mr. Speaker, to Justice Scalia, and I said to him that Congress is the most powerful branch of government, the legislative branch of government, and the House, in particular, because all spending bills have to start here, and the Constitution doesn’t require that we establish all of the Federal circuits that are out there or the Federal district courts below that. The Congress only—and this is how I put it to Justice Scalia—Congress is only required to establish a Supreme Court. We could abolish all of the other Federal districts if we chose to do so. In fact, Congress did abolish two judicial districts back in about 1802. That is a pattern. It has been established. So if Congress decided to do so, we could weaken the judicial branch of government, and we could reduce the judicial branch of government down to just a Supreme Court, because it requires that we—constitutionally, we are required to establish a Supreme Court. But there is nothing that requires us to build a building, fund a building, or to fund an administrative staff and team for them. So I said to Justice Scalia: We could eliminate all the Federal courts, except the Supreme Court. We could reduce the Supreme Court down to the Chief Justice at his own card table with his own candle, no staff. And I think it was a bit of surprise for the very glib Justice Scalia to hear that out of a Member of Congress, especially in a setting that was, I will say, quasipublic at least. He thought about it for a little bit. I am not sure if he had ever thought about what I had presented to him, Mr. Speaker, but he thought for a little bit, and he said: Well, I would argue that you could reduce the Supreme Court down to three Justices because, otherwise, if you don’t have anything but a Supreme Court Chief Justice, there is nothing to be the chief of. So I would argue for three Justices. And I said: Well, Justice Scalia, there have always been too many chiefs and not enough Indians. And we, more or less, declared a case ready to move on for further discussion. But the point of this exercise, Mr. Speaker, is to make the point that the Court’s power exists because Congress empowers it. And if there is a struggle between the legislative branch of government, Article 1; or the executive branch of government, Article 2; or the judicial branch of government, Article 3, I would remind the folks involved in any discussion like that that the branches of government were prioritized in the Constitution in the same fashion that the Godgiven rights are prioritized in the Declaration—life, liberty, pursuit of happiness. In the Constitution, Articles 1, 2, 3— legislative, executive, judicial branches of government—prioritized because our Founding Fathers envisioned that there would be a struggle between the three branches of the government, and they wanted to set up a static power base so that they expected that each branch of government would jealously protect its constitutional authority, and there would be that tug of war, a struggle, ethically and peacefully, they hoped, between each branch of government. That is why they put the checks and balances in place. They gave the legislative authority to the United States Congress, and the spending authority to Congress, and the initiation of all bills that initiate spending to the House of Representatives. They didn’t give it to the Senate because we were to be the hot cup of coffee, and the Senate was to be the saucer that that coffee cooled in. That is why we are 2year terms here, 6year terms over in the Senate, but they wanted a legislative body that would be a quick reaction for us, a fast response for if things got out of whack, if they needed to be addressed quickly, then they wanted the House of Representatives to perhaps turn over quickly so that the House could respond to these issues in a fast way. They wanted a judicial body, that legislative body that could sit back, maybe fold their arms a little bit, and wait and be patient and think things through so it wasn’t just emotional. It was also kind of a hardcharging reaction force in the House, and seasoned by experience, I might add, Mr. Speaker; and a more careful, slower moving body in the Senate, which I think they clearly achieved a more careful, slower moving body in the Senate. But one of those examples in modern day, when things went against the American people in the elections of 2010, around March 23, 2010—it was March 23—the final passage of ObamaCare passed out from the Senate and the House to President Obama’s desk, and he signed that bill as fast as he could get his signature on it. The American people had rejected a Federal Government takeover of our health insurance, at least as a minimum. And I long said that, you know, our soul is the most sovereign thing that we have, and the government hasn’t figured out how to nationalize that yet. I don’t believe they ever will. The second thing that is the most sovereign thing that we have is our bodies, our skin, and everything inside it. ObamaCare nationalized a Federal takeover of the management of our body, our skin, and everything inside of it, took out of our hands the ability to manage our own health in a free market system, and the public rejected such an idea. They rejected ObamaCare. On March 23, it passed and was signed into law. That election that ensued the following November brought 87 freshmen Republicans to the House of Representatives. Every one of them pledged and every one of them ran on the ticket to 100 percent, rip it out by the roots, repeal ObamaCare. That is the reaction of the public when this body here was not responding to the will of the people. They changed that over in the very next election, which was just months later, from the third month to the eleventh month as—so you are only—and 8 months later, the election had taken place, and we had 87 new freshmen Republicans on the way. We didn’t get as far as we needed to get. We didn’t get it fully ripped out by the roots, as I wanted to do, but you can see the effects of that election to this day, Mr. Speaker. That is how our Founding Fathers envisioned it would work—the House of Representatives to be a quick reaction force. They reacted quickly in the 2010 election. The American people weighed in. When the executive branch gets out of line, there are provisions there. If there is going to be impeachment, the 
House has to initiate that impeachment. But over in the Senate, the impeachment doesn’t remove a President from office. I believe it constitutionally requires a trial in the Senate, but to remove a President from office takes a two thirds majority in the United States Senate. I don’t think they served us very well in 1998, when the impeachment went before the United States Senate, when William Jefferson Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives, because the trial in the Senate didn’t bring us a verdict. It put all the questions together. And instead of asking the question, ‘‘Did he commit the acts that the House had indicted him for,’’ and in a separate question, ‘‘Should he be removed from office for that,’’ they jammed those questions together, and it gave some of the Democrat Senators a way out. They didn’t have to answer the question, whether they believed he was guilty or not, so they never really heard the case and gave us a verdict on the conclusion. It was inconclusive in the Senate. I think that the way they framed those questions that were voted upon by the Senators, I think it was a disservice to the American people, a disservice to our Constitution. But, nonetheless, there is a check and a balance. If an executive—if a President gets out of line, if his executive branch gets out of line, the House of Representatives can initiate impeachment. The House of Representatives can shut off all funding to that branch of government or—well, it wouldn’t do that, obviously, but to a division within that branch of government, we could cut the funds to the funding to bring about the result that is necessary if we have the conviction here and if we believe it is prudent policy. The House controls the spending. The House initiates any impeachment that might be required, and we don’t want to ever exercise that unless it is judiciously done for good reason and good cause. And the Senate, the prudent group of the Senate, come up for election every 6 years, so they can sit back a little bit. Only a third of them have the level of apprehension that all of those who are up for reelection in the House of Representatives do. But this balance, this check and balance between the three branches of government, was that the branch of government and the division within it—the legislative branch and the U.S. House of Representatives, the division within it was always designed to be able to control the other branches of government and, by the way, able to limit the United States Senate. The reasons for that are why we are up for election every 2 years so the people would be sovereign. We the people are the ones who really do decide who is right in all of this Republican form of government, which is guaranteed to the American people in the Constitution. We are guaranteed, Mr. Speaker, a Republican form of government. But in this form of government, it is we the people; and we the legislators within the United States House of Representatives are the most accountable to the people, and, by that, we need to be the most responsive to the people as well. I think history has proven that out. So it doesn’t mean either that the Supreme Court gets to decide necessarily what the Constitution means. I will define what it means here, Mr. Speaker, and that is, the Constitution has to mean what it says. It has to mean literally what it says, but it has to also mean what it was understood to mean at the time of its ratification. Every one of us takes an oath to support and defend the Constitution. Here, in the House, 435 of us; and over in the Senate, 100 Senators; and a good number of executive branch employees, a long ways down the line, take an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. Now, I take that oath seriously, and I carry a Constitution in my jacket pocket every day, as close to my heart as it can get, to remember what this means, what it means to me. But I don’t take the oath to support and defend the Constitution with the idea in mind that I am going to shift my oath and the meaning of my oath to conform to a Supreme Court decision that does not reflect the original understanding of the Constitution. None of us can take an oath to a living, breathing, moving interpretation of a document. This Constitution, Mr. Speaker, this Constitution constitutes a contractual guarantee, an intergenerational contractual guarantee that this Godgiven liberty, as defined in our Declaration, and the Bill of Rights and the structure of our government and the function of our government, the enumerated powers that are in here, that this is an intergenerational contractual guarantee passed down to us generation to generation, and it can’t change its meaning just because five Justices over there in the Supreme Court decided to change its meaning. b1630 Now, I want to respect their jurisprudence and I respect almost all of the decisions that have come down, but there have been times in history when an activist court has decided that they are going to rewrite this society according to their whim. I have always admired Congressman LOUIE GOHMERT of Texas, who is a former judge. He came to this Congress and he ran on this ticket. He has been to Iowa a few times, and he is coming back. He says this: 
I found myself on the bench as a judge, and I was constrained to interpret the literal meaning of the Constitution and to interpret the literal meaning of the laws that were passed, and when I felt the urge to be a legislator, I knew my obligation then was to leave the bench and run for Congress. 
That is what you need to do when you feel in your heart that you are a legislator, when you reason that you can do more to contribute as a legislator than you can as a judge. So LOUIE GOHMERT came to this Congress. Congressman LOUIE GOHMERT  came to this Congress in the right way for the right reasons, to legislate, because that was his heart’s desire, and that is where he believed, and I hope today he still believes, that he can do the most good for this country. But the Justices that sit on the bench that decide that they can just ignore the meaning of the Constitution are undermining our Godgiven liberty. They are undermining the foundation delivered to us by the Founders. They are undermining the Declaration. They are undermining the Constitution itself. I can think of a few of those decisions. The Kelo decision, where the Supreme Court ruled that private property could be confiscated, condemned, through eminent domain by a local jurisdiction of government and then handed over to another private interest. Let’s just say that there is a widow lady that lives in a certain section of town, and she wants to live in that house the rest of her life, but there are developers that own the rest of the land around her, and they want to put in a shopping mall. So they would come in and say to the lady: Hey, here is our offer. We want to buy your house. And she says: No. No amount of money can buy my house. I am going to live in this house the rest of my life. Well, in the Kelo decision, they went to government, and government condemned the property, took that property away from her. It was litigated all the way to the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court ruled that local government could condemn property under the Fifth Amendment, the Fifth Amendment, which says ‘‘nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.’’ And think of this. They didn’t say ‘‘nor shall private property be condemned and handed over to other private interests, without just compensation,’’ because the Founding Fathers never imagined that government would have the audacity to condemn private property to hand it over to other private interests. But the function of that decision was, and so now the effect of the Kelo decision is, the Fifth Amendment now reads, in effect, de facto, we say: Nor shall private property be taken without just compensation. They struck out those three words ‘‘for public use.’’ That is the effect of a Supreme Court decision, and it is an erroneous decision. It is a wrong decision. It doesn’t reflect the language in the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution. The dissent was written by Justice O’Connor. I didn’t know until after I had made my statement on the floor after that decision that her dissent mirrored almost exactly the statement 
that I made on the floor in rejection of it. I didn’t expect the gentleman at that time from Massachusetts, Barney Frank, to agree with me either, but Barney Frank, Justice O’Connor, STEVE KING, and many others agreed: an erroneous decision. A Supreme Court amended the Constitution, in effect. They de facto amended the Constitution of the United States by coming down with a decision that effectively struck the words ‘‘for public use’’ out of the Fifth Amendment, ‘‘nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.’’ So now there are extra constitutional takings of private property handed over to private property because local government has concluded they can collect more tax dollars off of that private interest that wants to build a shopping mall or a truck stop or whatever it might be to expand. That is the kind of decision that a Supreme Court can make that are activist decisions that effectively amend our Constitution if we let them do that. So we think of a decision like Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton. How did they cook that up? Where does that come from? Well, it comes from out of the emanations and penumbras, Madam Speaker, and it is rooted back in a decision called the Griswold decision from the sixties. I believe it was 1964. Connecticut, at that time, a strong Catholic State, had decided that they would not allow for contraceptives to be sold in Connecticut. The Griswold couple, husband and wife, decided that they had a right to privacy to purchase contraceptives to exercise their liberties. Now, that decision that was made by the State of Connecticut not to sell contraceptives was a part of the laboratory of the States. It is a State’s right to pass a decision like that; and as soon as the people in the State of Connecticut decided they rejected that decision, they can elect some new people to their legislature. But this was litigated to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court of the United States decided that that couple, the Griswold couple, had a right to privacy, and that right to privacy included the right to purchase contraceptives. So they created a new right, a right to privacy. They created it out of thin air, which we now call out of the emanations and penumbras. That is a little shadow around the edge of the cloud that maybe a Justice in a black robe can see but the rest of us lay people or even the brightest attorneys in the land can’t quite see because they aren’t seated on the Supreme Court. Well, if you can find rights out of the emanations and penumbras that you can’t find in the very language of the Constitution or statute, for that matter, you are an activist judge, and you are trying to alter our society, amend our society into your own fashion. You are legislating from the bench. So they created a right to privacy, and this right to privacy was then used as the foundation of the decision in Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton that granted, those two cases together, abortion on demand—abortion on demand, at least before viability. And viability is a very vague measure of a baby that would be able to survive outside the womb. Now, that length of maturity within the womb and the ability to survive outside the womb has changed substantially, Madam Speaker, since Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton. Now we have babies who survive clear down as early as into the 20th week. Viability has changed because medicine has gotten ahead of this, and we have saved more babies. But viability wasn’t the only measure, because Doe v. Bolton gave all the exceptions that I talked about earlier, made exceptions for the health of the mother, the physical health, the mental health, the familial health, the financial health, anything that might affect her psyche. So it amounts to abortion on demand for the sake of, well, let’s wait until it is convenient to take the life of that innocent little baby. But what we see now, Madam Speaker, what we see now is that we are watching these babies grow in the womb and the ultrasound. My iPhone has a number of little babies and the ultrasounds in it, and you can watch as those little babies will squirm and reach their arm out, suck their thumb. They look like they are trying to talk, stretch their legs out. They move around a lot more than we ever thought they did. I have talked to mothers who say as they watch their little baby that is 19, 20 weeks along, squirming around in the ultrasound, that a lot of the time they can’t yet feel that movement. We know that as we get later on, even us dads get to feel that movement, and it is a glorious thing. This is the development of a miracle, and you can’t be a parent or a grandparent and hold a little baby that is flesh of your flesh and not be amazed at the miracle of a little baby. When I took my firstborn in my hands, little David STEVEN KING, and put him in my hands and looked at him, it was with awe that I saw so many pieces about him: counted the fingers and toes, took a look at his eyes, saw every little feature that is there, that little son. And I began to ask that question shortly after his birth: Could anyone take his life now within minutes after he was born? As squirmy and beautiful and miraculous, created in God’s image as he was, could anybody take his life then? I don’t know anybody who would be ghastly enough who could do so. So I thought, if he is 20 minutes old and we can’t take his life, if he is 5 minutes old and we can’t take his life, if he is 1 minute old and we can’t take his life, how could we take it a minute before he was born? or 5 minutes? or an hour? or a day? or a week? or a month? Where along this continuum from this moment of conception would there be a time that we could say: Oh, he is only a blob of tissue? He was never a blob of tissue. He was always a unique human being, joining together the DNA of his mother and his father in a unique fashion that would never be matched again. Madam Speaker, think of this. Seven billion people on the planet, every one unique. Even the identical twins, the identical quadruplets that are there, their mother can tell them apart. Their father can tell them apart most of the time. And the older they get, the easier it is. But 7 billion faces on this planet, and God created those faces to be unique. No two faces are the same. Even if their DNA is matched up in identical twins or identical quadruplets or identical triplets, as rare as they are, their mothers can look them in the face and know which child is which. The rest of us can figure out everybody else, and we can, a lot of times, figure out the twins, too. I have twin nieces that I could always tell apart. They would ask me how I could, and I would say: Well, one of you is really intelligent and the other is really beautiful. You two figure out which is which. I am not going to answer the question. But we can tell them apart. Now, what a gift from God, the creation, to have the imagination to create faces, every one unique. No matter how many people on the planet there are, just the facial features are unique, let alone all the rest of us, let alone all the things that go on in our heads and in our minds and the experiences we have, the personalities that develop differently. That combination of nature or nurture that we will never unlock the mystery of that, that is all a gift from God. We have aborted 60 million of the gifts from God—60 million—and another 60 million babies not born because their mothers were aborted. Children who never had the opportunity to live to draw that first breath of free air. When I welcome a new grandchild into the world, I say a prayer over them, Madam Speaker, and I pray that they have a long and a healthy life, a faithful life, and a life that is long and healthy and faithful. And when that day comes that they are called home at the end of that long and healthy and faithful life, I pray that the last breath that they draw is more free than the first breaths that they are drawing on that day. And that is what we need to work for: more freedom, more God given liberty, more young lives brought into this world. The very source of all joy comes from little babies, from our children, and if we stopped having babies, the joy would finally just die down. The laughter, the giggling would just diminish day by day by day until there was no joy left in the world, because that is the source of it. And yet we are aborting 1 million babies a year. 
That is why, Madam Speaker, I brought the Heartbeat bill to this House of Representatives, H.R. 490, the Heartbeat Protection Act. That is why we have worked so hard to get cosponsors on this legislation, we worked so hard to get the cosponsors. People like former majority leader Tom DeLay came here to work pro bono. The leader of Faith2Action, Janet Porter, a driving force, worked to get cosponsors on this legislation, worked to send the messages in the right place. We carefully drafted language that reflects our intent to save the lives of as many babies as we can from the moment of the heartbeat. We require that, if the abortionist is intending to commit an abortion, he must first check for a heartbeat, and that heartbeat would be detected at 7 to 8 weeks. If a heartbeat can be detected, the baby is protected, because we know that is a unique human being, a sacred human life. b1645 I would like to go back to the moment of conception, but we can’t yet medically identify that moment. But we can identify when a heartbeat can be detected. We all know that if there is a beating heart, there is a baby there. That heart doesn’t just sit down there on its own beating away. It is in the chest of a baby, a little baby, a little unique boy or a girl who is a gift from God. That baby has at least a 95 percent chance of successful birth once we can detect that heartbeat in the womb. So how could we allow for the ending of that unique human being’s life without that baby ever having a chance to draw a breath of free air or to scream for its own mercy? How could we say no to that? How could we have in our earpieces that ultrasound of that beating heart? That little granddaughter is 20 weeks along and her heart was beating last week, anyway, at 161 beats per minute. That beat is strong, firm, and solid. She has at least a 95 percent chance of successful birth and being welcomed into this world drawing that breath of free air, and I will pray as freer still on her last day many, many years from now. But we need to get there. We need to protect these lives, and we need to get a bill before the Supreme Court. So here in this House, we are 170 cosponsors strong. We are far ahead of any other significant piece of prolife legislation. I drafted the bill with the strategy in mind, Madam Speaker, to get the Heartbeat bill before the Supreme Court after the next appointment to the Supreme Court. I am very pleased with what I see with Neil Gorsuch. When I hear the rumors of the potential retirements in the Supreme Court, our three oldest members of the Supreme Court are 84, 80, and 78 years old, Madam Speaker. So we can expect a retirement fairly soon. We need to have a bill out of the House of Representatives sitting on MITCH MCCONNELL ’s desk long enough and hard enough that we can gin up the effort to get it passed out of the United States Senate. There are four windows that need to be open before we can start to save lives in significant numbers, Madam Speaker. One of them is a prolife majority in the House of Representatives. We have that, 237 votes behind the paincapable 20week bill. The next one is a prolife majority in the United States Senate. Senator ROY BLUNT made mention in our values team here a couple of weeks ago that they have a bare majority, a prolife majority in the Senate. Fiftyone votes voted for the 20week bill over there. They didn’t break the filibuster, but 51. That is a prolife majority. If they suspend the rules over there and get rid of the filibuster rule, the votes are there to pass Heartbeat bill over and send it to the President’s desk. That is the third window. The first window is a prolife majority in the House. The second window is a prolife majority in the Senate. The third window is a President who will sign the Heartbeat bill to protect these lives from the seventh or eighth week all the way through. I don’t have any doubt President Trump will sign such a bill, and I don’t have any doubt that Vice President PENCE will be standing right next to him when that day comes. I don’t know whether I am going to be standing there, but I am going to do everything I can, Madam Speaker, to get the Heartbeat bill to the President’s desk. Yes, it will be litigated. The pro abortion people will litigate everything that slows down the abortion mills in this country. So it would be litigated. And the timing of getting it out of the Senate to the President’s desk and before the Court after the next confirmation means we are called upon to move the Heartbeat bill out of the House within the next few months because as we get closer to the election, it gets harder. Things get crazy around here. So if it gets passed around July, it is going to be really hard to move the Heartbeat bill. There is a little rule that was handed down, I think, from the previous Speaker that says that prolife legislation doesn’t move off the floor of the House unless the top three prolife organizations support it and will actively support it here in the House of Representatives. Those organizations would be Family Research Council. Tony Perkins supports the bill. The next organization is Susan B. Anthony List. They also have agreed to support the bill. Yes, they have a priority they would like to have move ahead of that, but Marjorie Dannenfelser said: 
Of course, I would never stand in the way of something so good as the Heartbeat bill. 
The third organization is the one that is not fully on board. In fact, I don’t see that they are supporting it in any way, and back channel says to me that there are some statements made to try to slow it down. That is the National Right to Life, the oldest and the largest prolife organization in the United States of America. They said that they don’t oppose the Heartbeat bill. Madam Speaker, this is right off of their electronic publication, whether it happens to be a tweet or whether it is their website, but here is their statement: National Right to Life, protecting life in America since 1968. National Right to Life says they do not oppose the Heartbeat bill. I struck through there with a red line and said: Well, neither do they support it. They don’t oppose the Heartbeat bill. Well, they don’t support the Heartbeat bill. They are stuck on this. They are hidebound on this. Their mission statement says that they support and protect life from the beginning of life until natural death. They define the beginning of life at the moment of fertilization. So how can you be National Right to Life and not support the Heartbeat bill? Their reasoning is that they are stuck in this. They refuse to challenge the Supreme Court. They refuse to challenge the viability standards that were written into Roe v. Wade, Doe v. Bolton, and Planned Parenthood v. Casey. If the number one prolife organization refuses to challenge the Supreme Court on those standards, then what they are really doing is accepting—and some would say accepting the idea that we are going to see 1 million abortions a year in this country, as far as the eye can see, because if you are not willing to challenge the Supreme Court, then you are accepting 1 million abortions. That is what we get if we are trimming around the edges with paincapable at 20 weeks. I support all of this legislation. Let’s do it all, Madam Speaker. The paincapable doesn’t get the job done. It shies away from challenging the Supreme Court. We wrote this Heartbeat bill, H.R. 490, in order to challenge the viability standard the Supreme Court has. We want to measure life—unique, precious, sacred human life—from the moment of conception until natural death, protected. By the way, protected in the 14th Amendment. We are all protected in there: life, liberty, and property. So all we need to do is define when life begins, and we are obligated by the Constitution to protect that life. But the Supreme Court has different ideas. I don’t believe they will after the next appointment to the Supreme Court. So some of the people who agree with National Right to Life have said that not enough States have passed it. Okay. So we went to work. Here are the States that have passed heartbeat protection language: Ohio, North Dakota, and Arkansas. Now, John Kasich vetoed that legislation. 
Who lobbied him to do that? The arm of National Right to Life and Planned Parenthood; side by side, by the way. What brings them to do that, Madam Speaker? Because they don’t want to challenge the Supreme Court. There is testimony that went before the Ohio Legislature December 13, 2011, that said: We don’t want to force Justice Kennedy to vote ‘‘no’’ on a Heartbeat bill because then Justice Ginsburg might write the majority opinion. If she does that, she might take away the things we have gained. And we should not go before the Court and risk what we have gained. I would argue instead that every time we have gone before the Court, we have gained. We gain something. We gain ground. The Court is sensitive to the movement of our society. They were sensitive to that when they ran up the Obergefell decision that imposed samesex marriage on America. They decided American society was ready for samesex marriage, and they gave us an extraconstitutional decision and forced it on everyone in America. They must have been right because there wasn’t a very big fight that was put up. But by their rationale, we are a lot more ready to protect innocent unborn human life than we ever were for gay marriage. Yet we need to get this legislation before the Court. Tonight at 6 o’clock eastern time, 7 o’clock central time, there is a full hearing before the Iowa House of Representatives on their Heartbeat legislation, which has passed the senate 30–20. It went before the house. It has passed out of committee out of the house last Thursday night in the last hour that was available in what they call funnel week. Now this hearing is called for by the proabortion people who want to have a full house hearing. The witnesses will be lined up there. They will stand up for life tonight. If the hearing goes the way we expect, I expect the bill will come before the Iowa House of Representatives and it will pass. Watching the expressions on our excellent and wonderful first female Governor in the State of Iowa, Kim Reynolds, I can’t imagine she would do anything but sign it. I don’t want to put words in her mouth. I am just anticipating a wonderful result. I believe in 1 week or 2 weeks that becomes law in Iowa. Likely the pro abortion people will litigate like they did in Mississippi on Mississippi’s 15 week bill that we have just seen before today, an injunction that is going before the Sixth Circuit. The viability standards in Roe v. Wade, Doe v. Bolton, and also Planned Parenthood v. Casey will be challenged in the Fifth Circuit on the basis of the Mississippi law. Then that means that the Iowa law that I anticipate also will be litigated. Why wouldn’t we send this standard over to the Senate and on to go before the Supreme Court? H.R. 490, the Heartbeat Protection Act, litigated at the same time before the United States Supreme Court along with Mississippi’s 15week bill and Iowa’s Heartbeat bill. That looks to me like a good result. That brings it from several different angles. I would remind the body that there were three Federal circuits where the partialbirth abortion legislation was heard simultaneously. They arrived packaged up in one case before the United States Supreme Court, and life prevailed in that case, as eventually life will prevail in the United States of America. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
LEAVE OF ABSENCE By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to: Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas (at the request of Ms. PELOSI ) for today.
