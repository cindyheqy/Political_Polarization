Mr. KINZINGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of the Honorable John B. Anderson and pay tribute to a man who inspired many to serve. On December 3, 2017, John Anderson passed away at the age of 95. In mourning his death, I send my condolences to his wife, Keke, and the entire Anderson family. A native of Rockford, Illinois, John Anderson attended Rockford Central High School and graduated from the University of Illinois in 1939. Before representing Illinois’ 16th District in the House of Representatives, the district that I now proudly represent, John Anderson answered the call to serve as a staff sergeant in the United States Army. He left law school in 1943 to enlist, and bravely served his country through the end of World War II. A decorated war veteran, John Anderson was honored with four battle stars for valor in combat. Upon returning home to Rockford, John finished his law degree at the University of Illinois, and then went to Harvard to earn his master of laws degree. A few years later, he joined the Foreign Service and worked in Germany for the United States High Commissioner. After returning home to Rockford, he was elected as Winnebago County State’s Attorney in 1956. Shortly after, he joined the primary race for Congress and went on to win the House seat in 1960. For 10 terms, John Anderson represented the 16th Congressional District of Illinois. He was on the powerful Rules Committee and held firm to his fiscally conservative values. He believed in a smaller and more accountable government, and he wasn’t afraid to speak up for it. His servant leadership and love of country earned him the chairmanship of the House Republican Conference, ranking third in House leadership. This esteemed position eventually led to his run for President. John Anderson believed that his job was worth giving up in order to set a better example of realism in politics. As a community and as a country, we are better for his candor, his focus, and his honesty. To this day, John’s pragmatic approach and selfawareness continue to inspire many and greatly impact my service here in Congress. Mr. Speaker, John Anderson dedicated his life to serving our Rockford community and this great Nation, and he served us proudly. After his political career, he continued to serve by becoming a visiting professor at several universities across the country. On behalf of the 16th Congressional District of Illinois, we salute the service of our fallen leader, friend, neighbor, and dedicated civil servant. It is my hope that his legacy will continue to inspire generations to come and that his impact will never be forgotten. f 
REPORT ON RESOLUTION PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF SENATE AMENDMENT TO H.R. 1, TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT Mr. SESSIONS, from the Committee on Rules, submitted a privileged report (Rept. No. 115–476) on the resolution (H. Res. 668) providing for consideration of the Senate amendment to the bill (H.R. 1) to provide for reconciliation pursuant to titles II and V of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018, which was referred to the House Calendar and ordered to be printed. 
REMEMBER OUR MILITARY PERSONNEL THIS CHRISTMAS SEASON The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON ) for 5 minutes. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, as individuals across the country travel near and far to be with loved ones this holiday season, I ask that we remember our military personnel who will not be surrounded by family and friends this Christmas. Instead, our military men and women 
will be stationed all over the world to protect and defend the United States of America. There are about 1.3 million military personnel on Active Duty who serve in more than 170 countries. While it is not easy to be away from family, it is especially difficult during the holidays. But, Mr. Speaker, events like American Red Cross’ Holiday Mail for Heroes cardsigning campaign lets our troops know that we are keeping them in our thoughts and prayers. Since 2007, the Holiday Mail for Heroes program has provided Americans the opportunity to extend holiday greetings, expressions of gratitude, and well wishes to servicemembers, veterans, and their families. Last year, the Red Cross distributed thousands of cards to troops across the globe. As we are extending our support to military personnel serving overseas, the Marine Corps Reserve is giving back to those who are less fortunate right here in our own backyard. Toys for Tots, which was founded in 1947 by Reservist Major Bill Hendricks, collects new, unwrapped toys each year and distributes them as Christmas gifts to children in need. As of 2016, Toys for Tots collected and distributed more than 512 million toys to less fortunate children. That kind of selflessness truly embodies the spirit of Christmas. Mr. Speaker, we cannot forget to honor our fallen heroes this Christmas season. One of our finest holiday traditions that honors our fallen servicemembers took place last Saturday: Wreaths Across America. Many Americans can recall the iconic photograph of wreaths on the tombstones at Arlington National Cemetery. Snow blankets the ground. Red ribbons adorn the balsam wreaths, which lay on rows of tombstones as far as the eye can see. This annual tribute began in 1992 by a Maine wreathmaker named Morrill Worcester, who donated 5,000 wreaths to Arlington National Cemetery in honor of our fallen heroes. Today, Wreaths Across America has grown into a national organization. A total of 1.2 million wreaths were placed on markers across the country in more than 1,200 locations, with more than 200,000 at Arlington National Cemetery alone. The mission is to remember, honor, and teach. Morrill describes the wreaths as a symbol of honor, respect, and victory. As we celebrate with our loved ones, let us remember all of our military men and women, especially those we lost in service to this Nation. Thank you to Morrill and to all the volunteers who honor their memory. Mr. Speaker, I thank all of our troops serving at home and overseas. I wish them a Merry Christmas and a happy New Year. Merry Christmas and God bless America. DISTRICT ATTORNEY BIVENS RETIREMENT The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. KUSTOFF ) for 5 minutes. Mr. KUSTOFF of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a great west Tennesseean and a dear friend of mine, District Attorney General Phil Bivens. After more than 25 remarkable years, Phil Bivens is retiring from his post as district attorney general of Tennessee’s 29th judicial district, which covers both Dyer and Lake Counties. Since 1992, Phil Bivens has been the consistent voice of law and order in his community. District Attorney General Bivens is a lifelong resident of Dyer County and a graduate of the University of Tennessee at Martin and the University of Memphis School of Law. Throughout his career as a prosecutor, District Attorney General Bivens has handled some incredibly important cases and has earned a reputation for being fair, honest, and by the book. In 2016, District Attorney General Bivens was elected to the executive committee for the Tennessee District Attorneys General Conference. Serving in this respected leadership role, he has advised the Tennessee General Assembly on issues related to the criminal justice system. When I was the United States Attorney for the Western District of Tennessee, I also served Dyer and Lake Counties, so we worked together very closely. We worked together to tackle dangerous crimes and drug crimes. Most recently, District Attorney General Bivens has been instrumental in combating the growing opioid crisis that is hurting west Tennessee and certainly the entire country. During our time together, I saw firsthand District Attorney General Bivens’ strong work ethic and dedication to making west Tennessee a safer place. He is a true public servant. In addition to being known as a prosecutor, he is also the voice of the Dyersburg High School football team. District Attorney General Bivens spends Friday nights calling some of the most thrilling high school football games in the Nation. In summary, District Attorney General Bivens is a real west Tennessee legend. While he may soon no longer be our district attorney general, I know that he will never stop working to make his community a better place, just as he has his entire life. I will always be grateful for the time that we worked together. I wish Phil Bivens; his wife, Barbara; and their whole family the best as they begin their next exciting chapter. 
b1000 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker at 10 a.m. 
PRAYER The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: Lord of Heaven and Earth, we give You thanks for giving us another day. Darkness descends upon us as the days grow shorter, and the cold chastens us to withdraw inside. Be for us the light we long for. The very promise of change creates expectation. By the first hints of Your dawn, banish all fear and hesitation. May those who live on the margins of America’s rich blessings have peace and prosperity too. Because You are always faithful, strengthen us with Your mighty arm, that this Congress may be unified in lifting Your people to renewed hope. May all that is done in the people’s House be for Your greater honor and glory. Amen. 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. The SPEAKER. The question is on the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. The question was taken; and the Speaker announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present. The SPEAKER. Pursuant to clause 8, rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER. Will the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. ROS LEHTINEN ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
COMMUNICATION FROM THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE The SPEAKER laid before the House the following communication from the Clerk of the House of Representatives: 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, it has been 5 years since 20 children were senselessly murdered in the Sandy Hook massacre. And while we will never forget the young lives we lost that day, we must also remember that this tragic, lifealtering and liferobbing epidemic continues to impact thousands of other families across the country. Two weeks ago, I had the honor of meeting the parents of Alexandria Burgos. On October 19, 2014, Alexandria was picking up her brother from a friend’s house when her life was cut short by a stray bullet shot through an apartment window. She was 18 years old. She worked with kids at the local YMCA and hoped to be a social worker after graduating from college. Like her parents, I am telling her story to push the conversation forward, the conversation that includes thoughts and prayers, but also must lead to action. Alexandria’s story and the pain felt by her loved ones is something that far too many have had to endure in this country. Let 2018 be the year that we do more than reflect on the lives we have lost and finally step up to find the courage to confront gun violence. f 
OBSTRUCTION OF A DEA INVESTIGATION INTO HEZBOLLAH (Mr. PITTENGER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PITTENGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my outrage at a detailed report by Politico which included testimony that President Obama and his administration obstructed a major DEA investigation into Hezbollah when they wanted to secure the Iran deal. These revelations are shocking and infuriating but, regrettably, not surprising. This is the same administration that sent $1.7 billion in cash ransom to Iran. According to the DEA, Hezbollah was operating a global criminal enterprise worth over $1 billion, annually. They were selling drugs and running arms as a means of funding their terrorist activities. A major DEAled task force called Cassandra had procured mounting and incriminating evidence against them. Yet, according to senior Treasury and Defense officials, the Obama administration consistently obstructed and stonewalled the investigation in order to protect the Iran deal. In essence, it seems President Obama and his administration were so focused on striking a deal with Iran that they let a major global terror group off the hook, even though the terror group was involved in global drug trafficking and sent massive amounts of cocaine and other drugs to our American communities. I have sent this letter to Chairman GOWDY , urging an immediate investigation into this matter. THIS IS THE WRONG DIRECTION AND THE WRONG BILL (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, on the floor of this House and, I guess, again today, there will be a vote on this massive tax cut targeted to people at the very top, targeting big cuts for corporations. Like many Members on this side of the aisle, I welcome the opportunity to do comprehensive, real tax reform. And for a long time, the discussion in this body and around the country was about the need to lower the rates and broaden the base and eliminate some of those loopholes that allow some corporations to get away with paying literally no taxes at all. But instead of doing that, what we saw was a massive shift of the responsibility to fund the government away from people at the top to people who work hard every day. There are many examples of how we could have done this better. There was a lot of discussion on the Senate side about the child tax credit. But why did we end up with a child tax credit that rewards a minimum wage family with about $75 a year, when somebody making $400,000 would get $4,000? I mean, is the life of a child of a family making a half a million dollars worth that much more? This is the wrong direction. This is the wrong bill. We should reject it. f 
CELEBRATING THE CAREER OF DORIS JACKSON (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the career of Doris Jackson, who will be retiring after more than 33 years of service to the U.S. House of Representatives. Doris began working as a cashier in the Cannon Cafe in 1980 and eventually became a supervisor. After more than three decades, there have been many changes as Members and staff have come and gone, but Doris’ smile has remained ever present. I know that I speak for every Member, staffer, and intern who has had the privilege of knowing Doris when I say that we will miss her witty sense of humor and her willingness to give encouragement to everyone she meets. In retirement, Doris plans to spend more time with family, especially her grandchildren, and to stay active in her community by volunteering at her church. Mr. Speaker, Doris has dedicated her life to serving us as we strive to serve our constituents. On behalf of our congressional family, I wish Doris the best of luck in the next exciting chapter in her life. Congratulations, Doris. 
LAYING DOWN A MARKER (Mr. HASTINGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, I witnessed, as did all of us, the jubilation of my friends, the Republican majority, in passing the tax cut measure that had been advocated as tax reform for a substantial period of time, but, finally, they did admit that it was a tax cut. I rise here today just to lay down a marker. I have said, as have many of my colleagues, that what we witnessed is the beginning of what ultimately will allow for us to address the entitlements in this country. Many of us know that the deficit that the tax cuts create are going to allow, some time during the course of next year or shortly after the election, us to begin discussing Medicare and Medicaid. I think that is a mistake, and I want that to be recognized. 
CONGRATULATING THE NORTH CAROLINA A&T STATE UNIVERSITY FOOTBALL TEAM (Mr. WALKER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the North Carolina A&T State University football team, winner of the 2017 Celebration Bowl and the HBCU national championship. This win capped off a historic year for the undefeated Aggies, a first in MidEastern Athletic Conference history, and marks their second championship in 3 years. In the final minutes, the Aggies marched 56 yards in seven plays. The drive was capped off with a fake spike and a quarterback sneak on the goal line for the gamewinning touchdown by Lamar Raynard. MVP Marquell Cartwright, who followed the great Tarik Cohen, rushed for 110 yards and two touchdowns. With the guidance of Coach Broadway on the field and the leadership of Chancellor Harold Martin in the classroom, North Carolina A&T is leading the way in showing the great value and the importance of our Nation’s HBCUs. I am proud to represent this distinguished school of academic and athletic excellence, leaving only one question remaining, Mr. Speaker: Can I get an ‘‘Aggie Pride’’? 
HONORING THE LIFE OF EVELYN WRIGHT MOORE (Mr. WEBER of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, on Friday, December 15, Brazoria County lost one of its great community leaders, Ms. Evelyn Wright Moore. Evelyn dedicated her entire life to early childhood development and education. In 1975, in fact, she started her career as the Brazoria County Head Start coordinator; and, after a very short 8 years with that organization, she was running the show and continued running that show for the rest of her life. Evelyn made sure her students were receiving the support that would allow them to thrive in that community. Brazoria County Head Start now enrolls just over 490 students, thanks to her. That program was championed by Evelyn’s passion and her devout dedication to those same students. She and I met many times over the years, both in Brazoria and here in Washington, D.C., and I will greatly miss our conversations. The legacy of Evelyn’s servant heart will long be remembered and cherished. Evelyn, my dear friend, you are now safe in the arms of Jesus. f 
b1015 PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF SENATE AMENDMENT TO H.R. 1, TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 668 and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. WOMACK ). The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. SLAUGHTER ), my friend, the ranking member of the Rules Committee, pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. 
Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning in support of this rule and the underlying legislation. The rule provides for consideration of the Senate amendment to H.R. 1, an act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to titles II and V of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018, also known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Mr. Speaker, last evening, the Senate, on a vote of 51–48, passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which I believe is in the interest of the American people. This is a bold, progrowth plan that will overhaul our Tax Code and unleash the free enterprise system. It lowers tax rates on businesses of all sizes so that job creators can focus more on bringing not only more work to their workers, but also hiring more workers, increasing paychecks, and growing a competitive marketplace all around the world. Mr. Speaker, we are trying to expand our economy, and there is nothing more important for any Member of this body than to know that the things that are happening in their own local communities are about the ability for people, whether they are just graduating from high school, whether they are graduating from a technical school, whether they are graduating from college, or whether they are looking for a second job or a longer career, to be successful in the marketplace in their own area, in their own home—not having to move somewhere to find a job, but in their own community. That is what we are trying to do. We are trying to increase wages for every single community across this country. My home of Dallas, Texas, has been home to so many people who have moved there as a result of the, really, unlimited opportunities that we see right now in Texas, and that comes because Texas has found itself to be their home because so many other companies have literally been run out of their States because of high taxes—high taxes that are placed on those companies and the employees to where it makes living and being competitive more difficult. During consideration of this legislation in the Senate, a few, relatively small provisions were removed through points of order in the Senate under what is called the Byrd rule, a parliamentary tool used during reconciliation. The first change made by the Senate under the Byrd rule strikes the language that allowed 529 accounts to be used for homeschool expenses. The second change modifies a provision that imposes an excise tax on the investment income of certain educational institutions. The change strikes a reference to ‘‘tuitionpaying’’ students, making the exception to the excise tax available only if the institution has less than 500 students or if 50 percent or less of the students are located in the United States. 
A third small change simply strikes the short title. Mr. Speaker, all of these provisions were included in the underlying bill as it first passed the Senate and came to the House and passed. However, at the time that this was done, there were no parliamentary points of order which were raised, which were later done. Mr. Speaker, these minor changes will allow us to advance exactly the same discussion that we had in this body, exactly the same discussion that we have had with the American people, exactly the things that we have talked about up in the Rules Committee and across this country, as Republicans have talked about the importance of the status quo tax laws that we presently have—moved so many companies overseas, moved jobs overseas, and is not encouraging American companies to be competitive because America, when combined with State and local taxes and Federal taxes, is among the highest in the world, which means that American business finds itself in a competitive marketplace, may be a great product, but, on price, we are not as competitive. This will allow America to achieve the greatness that it needs for a great people who want and need to be great, also. This legislation is about making sure that the rising worker, whether they are brandnew in the marketplace or whether they are an entrepreneur, or a mother or a father out in the marketplace looking for a job, will find the ability to be successful. The United States is already the best place in the world to live. We are an incubator always for new ideas and small business, but we are now going to be able to celebrate that to make it easier. We are taking the Tax Code, instead of being the highest taxed Nation in the world, to be one of the lowest. It is going to mean great things for the American people, the American worker, and, most of all, for people who believe that we want America to be great again. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding me the customary 30 minutes. Mr. Speaker, it seems like only yesterday we were here. Does it not? Mr. Speaker, we are 5 days away from Christmas, but it feels like Groundhog Day. Less than 24 hours ago, the majority stood in the Chamber and passed its partisan bill to provide tax cuts for millionaires, billionaires, and one President. Speaker RYAN called it a onceina lifetime opportunity, but, apparently, by a twist of fate, he is getting that great opportunity again today, much sooner, I am sure, than he anticipated, because we are taking the bill up again this morning. Maybe in the mad dash to provide massive tax breaks for corporations and the 1 percent, the majority failed to do the due diligence and properly vet the bill. We found out, after it passed, that several of its provisions violated the Byrd rule in the Senate. Now, everybody knows about the Byrd rule in the Senate, and I don’t understand why this was not found in the conference that was held for maybe 30 minutes. This is the rule that prohibits the Senate from considering extraneous matters as part of a reconciliation bill. After passing the House, provisions in this bill governing 529 college savings accounts and exempting certain universities from an excise tax were ruled out of order by the Senate Parliamentarian. The bill was so rushed that even the title of H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, was found to be a violation. Let me repeat that. The very first words of the bill didn’t pass muster with a nonpartisan rule keeper in the Senate. Imagine what other areas we have yet to discover. This is a consequence of a process that was nothing short of an abomination. There were zero hearings on the text of this bill. Not a single expert was called in to give his or her experience. It got the votes to pass only after a series of closeddoor, backroom dealings, and a conference committee between the House and Senate Republicans. Well, I think there were some Democrats there, but they tell me that none of them signed the conference report. The Senate was such a sham that an agreement was reached before the first public meeting ever took place. Now, I know this is not the last time, Mr. Speaker, we will meet here to try to fix this bill. Mark my words, we will be back here next year to make more socalled technical fixes because of this hasty consideration. The majority is rushing to pass a bill that is historically unpopular, clearly deeply flawed, and we will be forced to clean up its impacts and unintended consequences for many years to come. I think we have all got a second opportunity here, and I would wish that my friends, to whom I only wish well, would grab up all their papers and run for the door and forget about this tax bill altogether. But I know that that wish will not come true. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New York. She has, as the Rules Committee has, taken a lot of time on this bill—we have spent hours not only discussing and debating the effects of the bill, what the bill is about, why we would do it—but most of all, her abiding ability to stand up and represent her party in their context, and I respect that. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. BYRNE ), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding me time. Mr. Speaker, I have been listening to my colleagues from the other side of the aisle talk about the 1 percent, the people at the top of America. Let me tell you who benefits from the status quo of our Tax Code. It is the 1 percent. They can afford the lawyers, the accountants, and the lobbyists to get them all these special tax treatments that the rest of us don’t get. If you want to do something about the 1 percent, fix the current Tax Code. Instead, what our friends on the other side of the aisle keep doing is defending the present Tax Code, because if you don’t pass this bill, we have the present Tax Code. We have the status quo, and the rest of us don’t see the benefits from the present Tax Code. The rest of us need a break. Now, I asked the chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, when he was before the Rules Committee the other night, three questions that I think are relevant to everybody in America. The first thing I asked him was: Will the average individual taxpayer in my district get a tax cut? He said: Absolutely. And he pulled out a sheet of paper. He said: In fact, in your district, Congressman, the average family of four is going to get a tax break of over $2,100 a year. I know in some places in America, $2,100 a year extra in people’s pockets doesn’t sound like a lot of money, but in south Alabama, an extra $2,100 in the pockets of hardworking parents who are trying to raise two kids, that is a lot of money. So that is a good thing that is coming out of this bill. I asked him: Will it be easier for those individuals to fill out their tax returns? He said: Absolutely. By making the changes we made in here and taking out some of these special tax breaks, we made it easier for everybody to fill out their tax return. Then I asked a third question. I just heard the gentlewoman from New York talk about how this benefits big corporations. I don’t have big corporations in my district in south Alabama. I have got mainly small businesses. Let me tell you about one. It is called Fast Time Convenience Store. Now, we call those in Alabama filling stations, because you go there and you put gas in your car. In the morning, you go get a cup of coffee, you get one of their breakfast biscuits, and you see a lot of people in there getting ready to go to work. You go in there at lunchtime. You have also got something called Fred’s Kickin’ Chicken. You go in there and get a good thing of fried chicken and a soft drink, and he has got some barbecue in a little trailer across the way. That is the sort of businesses I have got in my district. b1030 I think those businesses are darn important. The owner of that business asked me the other day when I was in there: I don’t care about the big boys. 
Are you going to do something that helps me, that helps businesses like me? So I asked the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee: Are we going to be helping those small businesses? Absolutely. They are going to see historic tax cuts, particularly if they are one of these passthroughs; historic tax cuts. Yes, their tax returns will be simpler to fill out. So when I think about it from the standpoint of south Alabama—and I daresay my district is not that much different from most every other district that is being represented here—I see a threefer. Individuals get a substantial tax cut, more money in their pocket. Individuals will have an easier time filling out their returns. These small businesses that are the backbone of America are getting a real break. Now, I know that our friends on the other side of the aisle think that the government needs to be more involved in the lives of ordinary Americans. But in order for the government to do that, the government has to have money. The government doesn’t produce anything and it doesn’t provide a single service, so they don’t sell anything. So how does the government get money? It takes money. A tax is a taking. It takes money from people in the private sector. We on this side of the aisle don’t think the government should be so involved in people’s lives in America, and we don’t think we should be taking so much money from them through taxes. So we have come up with this bill that gives sort of tax breaks to ordinary people and small businesses, and we believe that that benefits America in two ways: Number one, giving people more control over their money is a good thing in and of itself. Number two, we are absolutely convinced—and dozens and dozens of economists have told us—that this is a major shot in the arm for the American economy. This is also a jobs bill because this is going to pump up the American economy and get our economy growing at a much faster rate. When we do that, we not only create more jobs, but we create a sort of lift in our economy when we start seeing real wage growth. What we have been missing out there is real wage growth. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from the State of Washington (Ms. DELBENE). Ms. DELBENE. Mr. Speaker, it should come as no surprise today that we are voting again on a bill that couldn’t pass muster because it was cobbled together in a hurry, hidden from the public, and denied any meaningful vetting or debate. Tax reform is hard. It is even harder when you go it alone, cooking things up in back rooms out of the light of day. But the real travesty here is that this bill won’t help everyday Americans in the long term. To call it once inageneration tax reform is an insult to those who came before us: Republicans and Democrats who linked arms and, through years of partnership and compromise, crafted the 1986 bill that House Democrats passed with President Reagan. That is the model we should have followed, because the fact is, we can all agree that our Tax Code is out of date and leaves countless families behind. This year, the U.S. Department of Labor released data showing that there were around 6 million open jobs unfilled across the country at a time when around 6.8 million Americans are looking for work. I believe Congress has a responsibility to the American people to tackle this problem from every possible angle, including tax policy. But the RyanMcConnell plan doesn’t just fail to acknowledge or address the problems that American workers are facing today, it cuts people’s legs off from underneath them just when they are trying to get traction. Chairman BRADY likes to talk about this bill leapfrogging us to the front of the pack, but the truth is this bill doesn’t leapfrog us anywhere but backward. This bill does nothing to put educational opportunities in the reach of more Americans trying to get ahead in the 21st century economy and does nothing to modernize research incentives that could support new breakthroughs that create the jobs of tomorrow. It explodes the deficit, making it that much harder to finance desperately needed investments in infrastructure that could put people back to work. Why are Republicans giving away the house to companies whose CEOs are already talking about stock prices, not jobs? As a former CEO myself, I know that economic growth is created by great ideas and great talent, not indiscriminate corporate tax cuts at the expense of investments in the people who have always powered our economy. I think tax reform should be about modernizing the Code to make us competitive in the 21st century. That means being fiscally responsible, forwardlooking, and investing in families. Unfortunately, this bill is a letdown for the American people, and we will no doubt be cleaning up this mess for years to come, not just today. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, we do recognize we have a difference. We recognize we had a difference at the time we announced we were going to do this bill and we were going to change the direction we were going. This was part of a debate that happened during the Presidential election, where we had an argument. The Democratic Party very clearly said: We need to raise taxes. Every year we see where they are on the floor during budget time to raise spending $1 trillion and raise taxes $1 trillion. That is more than what they had done under President Obama, Speaker PELOSI , and Mr. Reid; except what happens when you do that is you kill the economy, you kill the investment in families, in jobs, and in small businesses. In the year after we had the massive tax increase, we had a GDP rate of zero. That is because there was this huge transfer from free enterprise to Uncle Sam, so the economy failed to grow. Then as the economy began to normalize, it normalized over the next 7 years at 1.2 percent. That is what the election was about, Mr. Speaker. Since the election, what has happened is we have added over 1 million net new jobs, despite a huge storm summer that impacted a lot of employment. Our stockmarket has risen dramatically, meaning that America wants to be great again, too. We are going to make it together. So we do recognize differences. They want a $1 trillion increase in spending, and they want a $1 trillion tax increase. We want to move it the other direction. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. JUDYCHU). Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, less than 24 hours after it passed, we already have to come back to vote on fixes to the Republican tax scam. This bill was so needlessly rushed that there wasn’t even time to proofread. I can only wonder what other mistakes we will discover in the coming days, weeks, and months. This was sloppy lawmaking and bad policymaking. In order to give massive tax cuts to corporate interests and the top 1 percent, Republicans have created trillions in new debt that will have to be paid for by, you guessed it, the rest of us. Republicans claim that everybody is getting a tax cut. But if you read it— something they clearly didn’t do—you will see that 83 percent of the benefits go to the top 1 percent. The average savings for the lowest earners is just $60. My own constituents in California can actually expect to pay more in taxes thanks to the capping of the State and local tax deduction. Mr. Speaker, I am opposed to this tax scam, and I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’ Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Georgia (Mr. WOODALL ), who is a member of the Rules Committee. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I very much appreciate the chairman for yielding me the time. I have the great pleasure serving on the Rules Committee. I also have the great pleasure of serving on the Budget Committee. So I felt it incumbent to come down and talk a little bit about 
the Byrd rule process that goes on in the Senate. It is part of the 1974 Budget Act. It became a custom in the Senate during 1985 and 1986, and ultimately it was codified and put in the act permanently. To describe what went on in the Senate as some sort of proofreading error is just nonsense, just absolute nonsense. We have this process called reconciliation that allows the Congress, the House, and the Senate to get really tough things done. As a part of that process, the Byrd rule says: What we don’t want to do is get involved in extraneous issues. We want to stay focused on these issues that are most important to the American people. So if you try to get outside the lanes of fundamental tax reform, those provisions become what they call ‘‘Byrdable.’’ But, Mr. Speaker, you are probably as uplifted as I am by the conversation you hear about the importance of bipartisanship and collaboration. I wish that that were more true. What we saw yesterday in the United States Senate I would tell you is a little bit of the pettiness that we see on Capitol Hill. Is it true that the Senate had the right to prevent parents who homeschool their children from being able to finance that homeschool education through taxes and 529 savings accounts? The Senate had that right under the Byrd rule and they exercised it. Democrats went after homeschooling parents and said: No tax breaks for you. They had the right to do it, but to describe that as some sort of proofreading error over here is a mistake. It was intentional to give homeschooling parents that opportunity and it was intentional when the Senate Democrats stripped it out. Secondarily, it was intentional to put a title on the bill: Jobs and Tax Cuts. It was intentional. That is why we came together to focus on this bill, because we care about jobs and we care about a 21st century tax system. Was the Senate completely within their rights to strip the title of the bill? Mr. Speaker, they were. If you believe when the Senate can’t fund the government, when the Senate can’t reauthorize CHIP, when the Senate can’t reauthorize a 702—you go right down the list—and if you believe it is an important use of the Democratic minority’s time on the Senate side to strike the title of the bill because it doesn’t actually impact deficit reduction, it is within their right. Does it represent the highest and best use of their time? It does not. Does it represent the highest and best of those of us who are here in public service together? It does not. I recognize that we have fundamental disagreements about the impact of tax reform and its merits. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I thank my chairman for yielding me time. Mr. Speaker, we have an opportunity to do great things together, and occasionally I come down to this floor and I put my heart into it. I don’t just put my heart into it on the floor, I put my heart into it for hours and hours, day after day, in the Rules Committee. I put my heart into it on the Transportation Committee. I put my heart into it on the Budget Committee. Mr. Speaker, do you know what? Sometimes I lose. Sometimes I lose. But what makes this process great is we both come down here and do the very best that we can. Let’s not describe what is going on here for the American people as some sort of proofreading error, as some sort of rush job where folks didn’t have time to do it right. That does a disservice not just to the Members of Congress, but to the staff that work through these issues with us side by side, day after day, week after week, month after month, and, yes, in the case of this bill, year after year. We have a choice with how we spend our days. I am proud that we spend our days doing fundamental tax reform. It has been far too long. We don’t call it once in a generation because it is a rhetorical tool. We call it once in a generation because there are men and women in this Chamber who were not alive the last time that we did it. It is important, and I am glad we are doing it. The Senate has every right to do what the Senate did yesterday. And by ‘‘the Senate,’’ I mean the minority Members who insisted on their point of order. We could have sent this bill to the President’s desk with protections for homeschooling parents who are doing their very best to provide for their kids, but my Democratic colleagues said no. So this bill is still going to go to the President’s desk. It is just not going to have those protections. I believe that is a mistake. I hope we will come back together. I hope we will right that wrong in the coming days. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman so much for his leadership on this issue. Mr. Speaker, I thank the Chair for his leadership on this issue. Regular order takes some time. I am glad we are getting it done. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds to say to my friend from Georgia that it wasn’t Democrats who found that. The Parliamentarian in the Senate found those errors, and they had to be corrected. Let’s put history in the right perspective. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DOGGETT ), who is the distinguished ranking member of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Tax Policy. Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, let’s make no mistake about it. We are here this morning solely because of a mistake. This is the blunder rule. This is not the first big blunder in this bill, and indeed it certainly won’t be the last. We will be cleaning up this mess and the blunders in this bill all of next year. The only questions are: How many people will get hurt in the process? How much money is lost to the United States Treasury because of the many loopholes in this Swiss cheesekind of a bill that they have created? How many loopholes will deny revenue that eventually will come out of the pockets of the middle class and will come out of the small businesses of this country to make up for all these special interest provisions that the lobbyists got added? b1045 This is what happens when you run roughshod over the process, when every member of the Trump administration lacks the intestinal fortitude, the courage, to come and answer any questions about this bill. That is what happened here. Americans need to understand that. Trump is over there tweeting away. He is bragging about all the wonderful things. But is he willing to send one official—even one—to come before any committee of this Congress and respond to questions about the many wrongs that are contained in this bill? Of course the answer is absolutely no. What about the businesses across America that are impacted by this bill? What about the academic experts of all political points of view who could come and respond and help perfect and avoid errors just like this? They were all left out. There was not one minute of examination from any objective source coming in and talking in a hearing to the committee about this bill. I am one of the conferees to adjust the differences between the House and the Senate. My, was that a great honor, a great experience in the new democracy that these Republicans are providing for America. In that conference committee, the chairman of the committee refused to entertain a single motion or a single amendment. But he told us not to worry. After we adopt this conference report behind closed doors and agree to it, you can look at it and can read it over the weekend before you vote on it at the beginning of the next week. You just can’t change it in any way. You cannot study it in any way. You cannot share it with anybody in any way because we are only interested in sharing it with those lobbyists with whom we have special connections and operate in secrecy behind closed doors. Of course, one of the many sad things about this particular bill is that it lost its name in the Senate in what we are considering this morning. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Texas an additional 2 minutes. 
Mr. DOGGETT. In fact, if you turn to the bill, which is a big old thick stack, you see it says ‘‘short title, et cetera,’’ and it stops. It is nameless at this point. It is a bill that has no name. And, of course, it has no heart. But what is the solution to that? Well, every time Donald Trump touches a tower, he puts his name in bold letters across it: Trump Tower. This is the only accomplishment that President Trump can point to this year. Why don’t we put his name on this bill? We could call it the ‘‘Donald J. Trump Inequality Act,’’ because it will do more than any legislation we have considered here in recent years to widen the gap between those at the very top and the rest of us. Or we could call it the ‘‘Donald J. Trump Family Windfall’’ bill, because he and his family are going to pocket an immense amount of money. There is no surprise they are over there at the White House celebrating all afternoon. He and his family personally will walk away with a huge amount of resources out of this. Or we could just call it ‘‘Fat Cats Get Fatter,’’ because one of our colleagues on the Republican side who is closest, perhaps, to President Trump admitted and said quite candidly: I can’t go back to my donors if we don’t pass this legislation. What a study in wise investment. The Senate Budget Committee, last night, pointed out that Goldman Sachs contributed over $26 million to Republicans since 1990. They get about a $6 billion tax cut. Where can you get a return like that? Or Pfizer, who contributed $15 million, they get a nearly $39 billion tax cut. Yes, this bill is a job creator. It creates more jobs for accountants and tax lawyers than anyone can imagine because they will be going in there trying to undo some of the things that were done and shape the loopholes a little more favorably for their folks. What we have here is a bill that is compared also with the other issues that we have here. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman again has expired. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Texas an additional 1 minute. Mr. DOGGETT. I know how much the gentlewoman cares about the future of our children and the Children’s Health Insurance Program. I think of the Family Visiting program to help young parents. That is in our committee. I think about our crumbling roads and bridges and the fact that we need dollars to invest in them to keep our transportation system competitive. They agree on all these measures. They make speeches about them. The only thing is they don’t want to put any money into them. They say we can’t afford to do that. If we don’t steal Medicare premium money to fund the Children’s Health Insurance Program and use general revenue dollars, that will drive up the debt. At the same time, they are willing to drive the debt up trillions of dollars, they refuse to invest in people, or invest in our children and provide them the healthcare that they deserve. In short, this is a Christmas gift to those at the very top—and especially to the Trump family and his billionaire buddies and other real estate moguls who gain in the conference report. They get the Christmas gift. The American people, the middle class, get the gift wrapping, and that is it. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, how much time is remaining on both sides? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 11
1⁄2minutes remaining. The gentlewoman from New York has 16
1⁄2minutes remaining. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. BRENDAN F. B OYLE ). Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, with the Christmas season upon us, a favorite tradition in my family every year is to sit around the television and watch one of our favorite movies, ‘‘It’s a Wonderful Life.’’ Like most people, it is hard not to get a lump in your throat at the end as George Bailey and his family prove triumphant. But it occurred to me this week in reading the Republican tax plan that I guess not everyone roots for George Bailey when watching that movie. There are a few people pulling for Mr. Potter. Well, here we have a tax plan that is written for and to the benefit of Mr. Potter and the rest like him: the wealthiest onetenth of 1 percent. The richest 1 percent in our country are going to get 83 percent of the money in this tax plan, and the wealthiest one tenth of 1 percent will get the majority of the money in this plan. Today, do you know how much you have to make in order to be in the wealthiest onetenth of 1 percent in our country? $5 million a year or more. So the Mr. Potter we have in the White House these days is going to be pretty happy, and his family is going to make out. But the working people of Pennsylvania and the working people of America are getting stiffed. Income inequality is higher today than at any point in American history. Many Americans haven’t received a pay raise in decades, in real terms, and here we have a tax plan that is going to take that existing problem and make it much worse. This is wrong. This is unfair. It does nothing for the hardpressed, hardworking middle class of our country who deserve a pay raise. Let’s give them a Christmas gift. Let’s give them the happy ending that they deserve, the Hollywood movie ending. Let’s say that the Mr. Potters of this country have had it damn good for the last 20 years, and let’s help out the George Baileys, especially at this Christmastime. Let’s say ‘‘no’’ to this tax bill. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY ). Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding and also for her tremendous leadership. Let’s talk a little bit about the winners in this bill. I think it is interesting to note that, if you are General Electric, since 1990 to 2017, you have contributed over $20 million to Republican campaigns. What you get back in tax relief from this legislation is almost $16 billion over the life of this bill. If you are Microsoft, you have contributed over $17 million, and you get back $27 billion from this tax bill. This is such a great investment for big corporations who have given money to Republican candidates over the years. But if you are not part of the country’s wealthiest 1 percent, this GOP tax scam is a really bad deal for you. It is especially bad for America’s senior citizens. This tax scam raises premiums for those 50 to 64 by 10 percent, an average of $1,400, and the deficit it creates will require, under the law, $25 billion in a Medicare tax cut next year. We have heard the Republicans say we are going to get that money back, but in this bill there is a $25 billion cut in Medicare next year. That is only the beginning. It gets worse. Republicans aren’t even hiding the fact that they intend to use this deficit that they created of $1.5 trillion as justification for slashing Medicare and Medicaid. They have said it. They have admitted it. They are even talking about raising the age of Social Security eligibility in order to give these tax breaks to the rich. Seniors should not have to foot the bill for a tax scam that gives 83 percent of the benefits to the top 1 percent. American seniors deserve a better deal. So do 86 million families who would see a tax increase as a result of this scam. To my Republican colleagues, you really do have a second chance. Because the bill got messed up, there were mistakes, it was done so fast, done in secret, it is coming back to us today. So you have a second chance to do the right thing. Please take it. Vote ‘‘no.’’ Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Indiana (Mr. MESSER ), the chairman of the Republican Policy Committee. Mr. MESSER. Mr. Speaker, today is an exciting day for the people of Indiana. With the passage of President Trump’s tax plan, working Hoosiers will see more jobs, bigger paychecks, and a fairer, simpler Tax Code. The scare tactics of my Democratic colleagues come from a tired playbook written decades ago. It is oldstyle 
class warfare politics and tired arguments that are just not true. The proof is in the paycheck. The truth is, an average Indiana family will see tax cuts of between $1,000 and $2,000 under this plan. Let me say that again. Despite the rhetoric, working families will see a tax cut of between $1,000 and $2,000 under today’s tax plan. Child tax credits will double to $2,000 per child. The standard Federal deduction will double, too. We get rid of the unpopular and unfair Obama individual mandate tax. Now, Hoosiers will not be taxed depending on their healthcare decisions. Job creators will see tax cuts, too, making America’s small businesses and big businesses competitive in the global economy and better able to create goodpaying jobs. All of this is good news for Indiana’s working families. With today’s tax cut, help is on the way. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the Trump White House released a National Security Strategy Report on Monday, and it pointed out: ‘‘The national debt, now over $20 trillion, presents a grave threat to America’s longterm prosperity and, by extension, our national security.’’ So what do we do about that? We are going to add $1.5 trillion more. The overwhelming majority of expert analyses show that, even with growth taken into account, this bill will cause the deficit to skyrocket. It isn’t just a threat to our economic security. According to the White House, it is a grave threat to our national security as well. The bill in front of us costs $1.5 trillion and includes permanent tax cuts for corporations, but temporary ones for individuals. b1100 So who do you think is going to lose those first? It is really very troubling, I think, too: the idea of looking ahead to what we are going to be dealt with. And we understand already that next year the cry will be: Oh, look at this debt. This is awful. We are going to have to cut spending. Entitlements will be the place where the Republicans prefer to go. So let’s prepare all of our senior citizens on Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Of course, that also hurts the ACA, that they are going to be on the line next year. Future Congresses will be pressured to reject the budget gimmick and extend many of those tax cuts, meaning the true cost of the bill is much higher. According to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, the expirations and delays hide potential further costs, which could ultimately increase the cost of the bill to $2.2 trillion. I am sure that my Republican colleagues will argue that growth will prevent the deficit from skyrocketing. But the CRFB reports that even with dynamic scoring, the total cost of the bill without budgetary gimmicks would be over $1.6 trillion and up to $2 trillion with interest. And that takes growth into account. As a result, our debt could exceed the size of our economy by 2027. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget’s analysis, entitled ‘‘Final Tax Bill Could End Up Costing $2.2 Trillion.’’ 
[From the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, Dec. 18, 2017] FINAL TAXBILLCOULD ENDTIPCOSTING $2.2 TRILLION  The final conference committee agreement of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) would cost $1.46 trillion under conventional scoring and over $1 trillion on a dynamic basis over ten years, leading debt to rise to between 95 percent and 98 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2027 (compared to 91 percent under current law). However, the bill also includes a number of expirations and longdelayed tax hikes meant to reduce the official cost of the bill. These expirations and delays hide $570 billion to $725 billion of potential further costs, which could ultimately increase the cost of the bill to $2.0 trillion to $2.2 trillion (before interest) on a conventional basis or roughly $1.5 trillion to $1.7 trillion on a dynamic basis over a decade. As a result, debt would rise to between 98 percent and 100 percent of GDP by 2027. Ignoring the expirations in this bill is particularly disingenuous given the claim that using a ‘‘current policy baseline’’ reduces the bill’s costs. The (flawed) idea is that the bill should be compared to a current policy baseline that counts expired and expiring provisions as if they are continued permanently. (For more on this, see Current Policy Gimmick Would Add HalfTrillion to Debt (http://www.crfb.org/blogs/currentpolicy gimmickwouldaddhalftrilliondebt)). Using such a construct does not make sense if cost of continuing future expirations contained in the bill are not included in the initial cost estimate. Policymakers are effectively claiming $450 billion of current policy savings while ignoring over $700 billion of current policy costs. This latest estimate updates our tally of the gimmicks from a previous version of the bill (http://www.crfb.org/blogs/senatetax billcouldultimatelycost2trillion). The changes made in conference include both tax increases and decreases that mostly offset each other, with a net increase in the ten year cost of $9 billion (compared to the Senate bill). With these changes, the bill now has a total cost of $1.46 trillion, or roughly $1.77 trillion with interest. While there is no new dynamic score of the bill, assuming it continues to produce very roughly $400 billion of dynamic feedback (http:// www.crfb.org/blogs/officialdynamicscore showssenatetaxbillwillstillcostover1 trillion) would reduce that cost to about $1.05 trillion, or roughly $1.30 trillion with interest. However, this cost does not account for as much as $725 billion of potential gimmicks that the conferenced bill contains. In the earlier version passed by the Senate, we identified $585 billion (http:// www.crfb.org/blogs/senatetaxbillcouldultimatelycost2trillion) of arbitrary sunsets and sunrises of certain provisions. Most significantly, nearly all of the individual income tax provisions would have expired after 2025. Additionally, the expensing provisions ‘‘bonus depreciation’’ began to phase down starting in 2022, and a number of new tax increases appeared in 2026. Some provisions were set to expire even earlier, such as an expanded deduction for medical expenses and provisions for craft beer and paid leave— clearly setting the stage for future extensions. The conferenced bill adds to the Senate bill’s gimmicks, which we explain here (http://www.crfb.org/blogs/senatetaxbill couldultimatelycost2trillion). Most significantly, it advances the start date of the bill’s requirement for research expenses to be amortized, which nearly doubles the ten year savings of the provision. Additionally, the bill tightens its limits on the business interest deduction four years in the future— a future tax hike that may not be allowed to ever occur. Other changes are smaller and move in both directions. Adding these gimmicks to the cost of the bill would increase the total cost to $2.0 trillion to $2.2 trillion. Though the dynamic effect of making the bill permanent is unknown, we estimate a permanent bill would produce roughly $450 billion of feedback, leading to a dynamic cost of roughly $1.6 trillion to $1.7 trillion. With interest, these costs would rise to $2.4 trillion to $2.5 trillion, or $1.9 trillion to $2 trillion with dynamic effects included, over a decade. 
As is, the bill would cause debt to increase from 77 percent of GDP this year to 95 percent or 98 percent of GDP by 2027, depending on whether dynamic effects are included, as compared to 91 percent projected under current law. If expiring provisions are extended and latestage tax hikes avoided, debt could reach as high as 98 percent or 100 percent of GDP by 2027. In other words, the national debt could exceed the size of the economy. 
Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, we have urgent spending needs. This bill could keep us from dealing with infrastructure, education, healthcare, medical research, and, of course, we have to pay the costs of our military. Make no mistake, exploding the deficit to pay for this bill—this giveaway to the rich—will come at the expense of all of those priorities. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS ). Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, late in June of 2012, like many Americans, I anxiously awaited a ruling by the Supreme Court of the United States while they were considering the constitutionality of the individual mandate. Of course, we were 
Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the majority is clearly unable to responsibly run the House of Representatives, because here we are fixing the bill less than 24 hours after it was passed. It is a perfect example of why we need to go back to regular order: actually holding hearings, have expert witnesses and testimony, and properly vet bills. That is pretty elementary, but it surely is true. It is especially true for bills of this magnitude that will effect every single citizen in America. All the while, the government is about to run out of money, and we haven’t even been able to reach a budget deal. That is Friday that the government will close if we do not do that. We still haven’t funded the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which provides needed healthcare to more than 9 million children. We haven’t reauthorized the community health centers, which serve more than 25 million people. We haven’t renewed the Perkins Loan Program, which many lowincome students rely on for their education. All of those programs expired back on September 30. But here we are, wasting valuable time trying to fix the disaster of a bill that the majority passed just hours ago. It is embarrassing and it is humiliating. If we don’t do better, the public is going to make us pay the price. I want to close by quoting an article that appeared this morning in The Washington Post, written by a great columnist, Dana Milbank. I wouldn’t miss his writing for the world. ‘‘Maybe he is right and all those bluechip economists and the nonpartisan analyses by the Joint Committee on Taxation, the Congressional Budget Office, and others are wrong. Maybe growth will dramatically exceed forecasts, millions will enter the labor force and find work, wages will soar, and the $1.5 trillion tax bill will pay for itself. But if all that doesn’t happen, the Trump tax will be blamed.’’ Mr. Speaker, I end the quote there, reminding you, as Senator SCHUMER  did yesterday, that this could be an anchor around your ankles for the rest of your lives. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the previous question, on the rule, and the bill. For heaven’s sake, let us take this opportunity given us and not force this onto the American public. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New York not only for her service to the Rules Committee, but also for her service to this body and to her party. b1115 Mr. Speaker, the bottom line is, I will take her up on that. We will bet that this works because we looked at what happened when President Obama, Harry Reid, and Speaker PELOSI put a $1 trillion tax increase on the American people; then spent $870 billion on a surplus; then added in $1 trillion of debt when they worked the deal that was for student loans; then we did cash for clunkers; then we did cell phones for all; and it just went on and on and on and on. And now they want to place the $20 trillion deficit on Republicans. What we are trying to do is to recognize that we did look at what happened economically during the 8 years that President Obama was here: 1.2 percent annual GDP growth, while our trading partners around the world—Germany, Japan, India, China—all raised their GDP numbers off growing economies because the average rate in Europe for corporate tax is 23.6 percent, while America was at 39 percent, and States all across the United States raised their taxation just like President Obama encouraged them to do: to grow government, to make it more expensive. But what happened is, then the free enterprise system was not competitive. We began losing jobs all across the country. We began losing our competitiveness because of the high taxation rate. That is why we are going to do something about it. So when you raise taxes $1 trillion and spend an extra $10 trillion over 8 years, there is an impact. Of course, there is an impact. What we are trying to do is respond back to the American people, who last November said: Instead of going that way, why don’t we go this way; why don’t we be the world’s leader; why be 24th in the world in competitiveness for business; why not be first or second; why not add jobs; why not do something that places Americans, the middle class of this country in a better position? That is the call that we are about. That is what Republicans have been trying to do, and we are responding with a bill that is going to take Americans—instead of being the most expensive tax country in the world, we are going to make us among the best. We are going to be an attractor of jobs, of investment dollars, of opportunity. The real problem with this country, the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. NEAL), a Member of Congress, spoke about it to the Rules Committee, tens of thousands of jobs that pay up to $60,000 in his home State are going begging right now. Thousands of jobs in this country are going begging because we do have a problem where America doesn’t want to come and take these jobs; where we cannot have people who pass drug tests; where we have people who say: Well, I don’t have those abilities. Well, in Dallas, Texas, my home, we have $21anhour jobs begging for people who could come and work. Mr. Speaker, what we are trying to do is to encourage America and Americans, let’s get to work. Let’s make this happen. Let’s not blame it on somebody else. There are jobs available in America, and we are going to answer the question. We are going to answer the bell. The Republican Party is going to stand on what we do right now, and we are willing to take what comes that way. And I will tell you what comes that way. When you go from 39.6 percent, the highest corporate tax in the world, to where you mark yourself down where virtually the rest of the world is at 23, in this case 21, we are going to be competitive. Americans are winners. Americans want to win. Americans are the best at entrepreneurism. They are the best at being innovative. We are now—instead of Uncle Sam taking 39 percent and making us drain our resources, we are going to incent Americans to go do it. Mr. Speaker, my staff, Ron Donato, my tax man, who has spent a lot of time working with me listening to people back in Dallas, Texas, we think this is a good deal to make the free enterprise system, which is the greatest system in the world. We are going to fuel it; we are going to fund it; we are going to make it work. Mr. Speaker, for that reason, we will be willing to land on what happens here, so mark your calendar right now. Go look at where we are, and watch where we are going. For this reason, I urge my colleagues to support this rule. The material previously referred to by Ms. SLAUGHTER is as follows: 
ANAMENDMENT TO H. R ES. 668 O FFERED BY  MS. SLAUGHTER  At the end of the resolution, add the following new sections: 
THEVOTE ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION : WHAT ITREALLY MEANS  This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the House of Representatives (VI, 308–311), describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.’’ To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition’’ in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (RIllinois) said: ‘‘The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.’’ The Republican majority may say ‘‘the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.’’ But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here’s how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ‘‘Although it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.’’ In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled ‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ‘‘Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon.’’ Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Republican majority’s agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous question. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered.

ELECTING A MEMBER TO A CERTAIN STANDING COMMITTEE OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Democratic Caucus, I offer a privileged resolution and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as follows 
The resolution was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 668, I call up the bill (H.R. 1) to provide for reconciliation pursuant to titles II and V of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018, with the Senate amendment thereto, and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. YODER ). The Clerk will designate the Senate amendment. Senate amendment: 
Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert: TITLE I 
ON OR BEFORE DECEMBER 15 , 2017.—Subclause (II) shall not apply to any indebtedness incurred on or before December 15, 2017, and, in applying such subclause to any indebtedness incurred after such date, the limitation under such subclause shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the amount of any indebtedness incurred on or before December 15, 2017, which is treated as acquisition indebtedness for purposes of this subsection for the taxable year. ‘‘(IV) BINDING CONTRACT EXCEPTION .—In the case of a taxpayer who enters into a written binding contract before December 15, 2017, to close on the purchase of a principal residence before January 1, 2018, and who purchases such residence before April 1, 2018, subclause (III) shall be applied by substituting ‘April 1, 2018’ for ‘December 15, 2017’. ‘‘(ii) TREATMENT OF LIMITATION IN TAXABLE

Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the motion. The text of the motion is as follows: 
Mr. Brady of Texas moves that the House concur in the Senate amendment to H.R. 1. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 668, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BRADY ) and the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. NEAL) each will control 10 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, both the House and now the Senate have taken action on legislation to reform America’s Tax Code for the first time in 31 years. Unfortunately, two targeted provisions did not meet Senate rules and had to be removed. Today, the process continues to move forward, and, with this vote, it will be the House, the people’s House, that officially sends this historic legislation to President Trump’s desk. I know the American people are excited. More than that, I know they are feeling a sense of relief. They are relieved that, for the first time in years, they are going to see more money in their paychecks that they can keep. Think about that middleincome family of four, earning $70,000 a year. These are working families, and the tax cut of more than $2,000 they will see under this bill, that $2,000 is real money. It is real money these families worked hard to earn, but, until now, they have had to send it to Washington instead of being able to use it for their own needs, whether that is paying bills, saving for the future, or putting new tires on a car. Think about the relief our job creators and our workers will feel. For so long, Americans have barely seen any growth in their paychecks, yet they are going to their jobs every day, and they are working harder than ever. b1200 With this bill, that hard work is finally going to be rewarded, and we are going to see the growth of jobs and paychecks like we haven’t seen in years. For our businesses, large and small, no matter if they are a small startup with just three workers or a large company with 3,000, they are finally going to have a Tax Code that works with them as they grow, innovate, and invest in our communities. They are going to see relief from complexity and high rates and the feeling they are always having to compete with one hand tied behind their back. For all these Americans, all the hardworking men, women, and families who bring life to our communities and to our economy, I think the major source of relief is knowing that, starting in the new year, none of us has to accept this broken Tax Code and this slow growth status in America any longer. With the new tax system we will deliver today, things will change for the better, and they will change immediately. This new Tax Code will be simple, it will be fair, and it will be focused on the needs of the American people, not on Washington’s special interests. This new Tax Code will be modern. It will be competitive. It will create more goodpaying jobs right here in our communities, not drive them overseas. Above all, this new Tax Code, America’s Tax Code, will not belong to the special interests anymore. It will belong to the American people. It will help more Americans realize their own American Dream, whatever that may be. For all the Americans who struggle and who have been left behind under today’s broken Tax Code, that has to be the biggest relief of all. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. PELOSI ), the distinguished leader of the Democratic Party. Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time, and, once again, I commend him for being a champion of middle class families. I want my colleagues all to hear the esteem in which we hold our Democratic members of the Ways and Means Committee. I thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. NEAL, for being our ranking member and for your extraordinary leadership on behalf of America’s middle class working families, and that includes millions of veterans. Thank you. Mr. Speaker, today is a very sad day in the history of America because we have, on the floor, probably the worst bill in recent time to come to the floor. That doesn’t mean it doesn’t have stiff competition from other legislation the Republicans have brought to the floor, but this is the worst because so many people are affected in such a negative way and because trillions of dollars of impact on our economy have been voted upon without any hearing, without any hearing from the people who will be most affected by it—no hearings, no experts, no listening to the American people. Yesterday, our Republican colleagues stood on this floor and voted for a GOP tax scam that the American people oppose 2 to 1. Our Republican colleagues stood on the floor and cheered. They 
cheered a bill that will raise taxes on 86 million middle class families and hand a staggering 83 percent of its tax cuts to the wealthiest 1 percent. Shamefully, the Republicans were cheering against the children as they robbed from their future and ransacked the middle class to reward the rich. Today, the Republicans take their victory lap for successfully pillaging the American middle class to benefit the powerful and the privileged. I come to the floor with stories of men and women and children that Republicans shamefully cheered against yesterday. Yesterday, I wish the Republicans had heard, as we did, the story of Ady Barkan, 30 years old, father of a beautiful baby son, and Ady is suddenly stricken with ALS, 30 years old. From his wheelchair, with a strong but wavering voice, he begged Congress not to pass this bill. He pleaded with anyone who would listen not to vote for this tax scam that will raise his health benefits and condemn Medicaid to devastating cuts as the logical next step. He has been lobbying on Capitol Hill against this bill for a while. Ady said yesterday it would do so much damage. 
It would deprive me of the Medicaid I need to stay alive a little longer and see baby Carl learn to read and teach him how to play chess and watch him go to first grade. 
But Republicans didn’t listen, said ‘‘no,’’ and cheered. Yesterday, we heard the story, and I wish our Republican friends could have heard it, of Laura Hatcher, mother of sweet and kind 11yearold Simon, one of the Little Lobbyists. Simon has a rare disease and cerebral palsy. His mother spoke of how their family watches the Muppet version of ‘‘A Christmas Carol’’ and how Simon sees himself in Tiny Tim, another kind boy with braces on his legs. Unfortunately, this story, as of today, does not have the same kind of happy ending as ‘‘A Christmas Carol.’’ But the story is not over, and like Tiny Tim, Simon and his family now find their future in danger because of the greed of those with power, the cruelty that is in the heart of the tax scam. As Simon’s mother, Laura, said: 
Very soon I could, once again, be facing a future where I don’t know how I will be able to care for my child. This is a thought I simply find too difficult to bear. 
Since you didn’t hear yesterday, I will go on to say what she said. 
We parents of medically complex kids understand consequences. We know what will happen if this tax bill passes, if our country does not turn from this destructive and immoral path. 
But the Republicans didn’t listen. They said ‘‘no,’’ and they cheered. They cheered against Simon because Republicans value the wishes of the special interest lobbyists over the Little Lobbyists, the voices of Little Lobbyists, sick children standing up for themselves and for their siblings, children standing with their siblings. Yesterday, we heard from faith leaders, too. They implored Congress to reject this bill that punishes working families and rewards the wealthiest 1 percent. I repeat: 83 percent of the benefits go to the top 1 percent; 86 million American working middle class families will have their taxes raised. Sister Simone said she wept for the fact that our Representatives are not weeping over the damage they are doing to families across America. They challenged us to honor our faith in this holy season, to remember that our first responsibility is to those who have the least, not to enrich those who are already privileged and powerful. They challenged us to heed not only the message of Christmas, but to remember the words of Jesus enshrined in the Gospel of Matthew. But Republicans didn’t listen. They said ‘‘no.’’ They cheered. They cheered. They cheered against little Simon. They cheered against Ady Barkan. They cheered against people in need. The GOP tax scam is a monumental con job, but who got conned? President Trump will sign the bill whenever he signs it. I know it is supposed to be today, but I hear the special interests are weighing in for him to delay it for some reason or another. President Trump will sign a bill that betrays the promises he made in the campaign. President Trump promised to eliminate the carried interest loophole; yet the Republicans wrote a tax scam that not only continues this outrageous loophole, but it gives even more loopholes to the wealthy and well connected. President Trump promised to stop corporations from shipping jobs overseas, but Republicans wrote a tax scam that gives corporate America even bigger incentives to ship jobs overseas. President Trump promised tax reform focused on middle class families, tax breaks for middle class families. Republicans wrote a tax scam that raises taxes on 86 million middle class families in our country. President Trump promised he would protect Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, but Republicans wrote a tax plan to explode the deficit and use it as an excuse to cut Medicare and Medicaid. They have made no secret of their plans. They have even said this week, to raise the Social Security age. So who got conned? Did the people get conned by the promises? Did the President get conned by the Republicans? Is he signing a bill that betrays his promises to the American people? It is all about the Republicans in Congress. They have in their DNA trickledown economics. Tax breaks for the rich, tax breaks for corporations, and the former Speaker even said: If trickledown creates jobs, that would be good. If it doesn’t, so be it. That is the free market. As Republicans head to the White House for their victory lap, hopefully they won’t trip over the wheelchair of Ady Barkan and other Americans with preexisting conditions. I caution them not to trip over the wheelchair of Simon Hatcher and other children with severe medical needs. They will be in the path of your victory lap. Don’t trip over the sisters and brothers and mothers and fathers who tend to the health and wellbeing of their sick children and their siblings and who will not stop fighting to protect them. I told you yesterday in a public forum: I caution you not to get in the way of a mother and father of a child with special needs and disabilities or extreme medical conditions. They will do anything to protect that child, and they notice what you are doing here. 
As you are on this victory lap, you will probably have to put on earphones so you can block out the pleas of faith leaders speaking up for hardworking American families. I know the Republicans want to talk so they can’t hear the truth about their bill, but the American people won’t forget the false representations you have made. They won’t forget how loudly you cheered when you hurt their families, their children with special needs, their families struggling to attain some financial stability. And why? These people say to me: How could they be so cruel as to put the health provision in this bill that would possibly eliminate 13 million people from the rolls of health insurance? How could they do that? Why did they do that? Why? The answer is always the same: to give them room to give tax breaks to the wealthiest people in our country and to corporate America, unpaid for, permanently. Our distinguished colleague from Massachusetts will show his credit card again today. They are putting this bill on a credit card that our children are going to have to pay for, robbing from their future. This holiday they are talking about giving people a Christmas present? Well, Joe Sixpack, whom the President said he was there to help, and I hope that that is true, Joe Sixpack will be delivering the champagne to their parties. That is how this is. This isn’t about anything better for working class families. This is about champagne glasses clinking and wealthy families across the country. I don’t begrudge them their success or their wealth or their achievement. I just don’t want to see it at the exploitation of America’s working families. Shame on you for voting for this outrageous theft from the American middle class. Mr. Speaker, once again, I urge my colleagues to do the right thing in this people’s House and vote ‘‘no’’ on behalf of the American people. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to direct their remarks to the Chair. 
Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, we hear a lot of false claims these days by opponents of tax reform. We hear that this isn’t relief for the middle class, that people will see their taxes increase. But the Tax Policy Center, the most liberal economic group there is, just grudgingly admitted yesterday that 90 percent of Americans will see real tax cuts in this Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. In fact, the only ones who won’t are the onetenth of 1 percent who could. We hear today about betrayal. Well, let’s talk about that. This tax reform bill doubles the child tax credit and expands it to nearly four times as many Americans, helping them with the expensive costs of childcare. Democrats oppose helping our parents raise their children. That is betrayal. b1215 In this tax reform bill, we increase the amount of medical expenses Americans can write off—medical expenses driven up by ObamaCare. Democrats oppose helping families write off these costs. That is betrayal. Now we are expanding the number of Americans who can, and how much, give in charity to our churches and to their causes. Democrats oppose helping people give to the community and to the causes they believe in. That is betrayal. In this bill, we, for the first time, allow families who are saving for their kids’ future to be able to use that and transfer it to the new ABLE accounts because their child has special needs and may need help throughout their life. Democrats oppose letting families save for their disabled children’s future. That is betrayal. Then we hear over and over again how some stand for small business, our Main Street businesses. Republicans, for the first time ever, provide a 20 percent deduction for our Main Street and small businesses across America. Democrats oppose helping our Main Street businesses. That is betrayal. For too long, we have watched our jobs move overseas. This changes. This tax cut bill brings those jobs back and, more importantly, allows our companies, when they compete and win around the world, to bring those dollars back to be reinvested in our communities, in jobs, in manufacturing, and in research. Democrats oppose bringing jobs back to America and bringing those dollars back to reinvest in our community. Mr. Speaker, that is betrayal. At the end of the day, we have a choice. Do we give back to families, parents, small businesses, and to America the hope and opportunity of a new economy driven by what is important to them, not what is important to special interests in Washington, D.C.? That is what this bill is all about. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute. Mr. Speaker, the President just said in the last few minutes that the most important part of this legislation is the corporate tax cuts. Stop the nonsense that you are doing this for the middle class. In the 20 hours that have elapsed, Mr. Speaker, since we last had this debate, we were promised a number of things. The only thing they left out was that this tax bill was going to stem the tides, take us to Mars tomorrow, and the Cleveland Browns were going to win the Super Bowl. The certainty of what they are telling us—if the stockmarket goes up, then they did it. The stockmarket has been going up since March of 2009. They talk about economic growth. Economic growth has now proceeded for 88 straight months. They keep telling us the rocket is about to launch because of this tax bill. Do you know what is great about this, Mr. Speaker? Reporters outside are starting to ask: Are you going to help them out if all of these things don’t occur in the way they have said they are going to occur? I said: After the appropriate period of review. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER ), who is the Democratic whip. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, the other thing that the chairman did not say is that, after your last round of tax cuts, we had the deepest recession anybody in this body has experienced, starting in December 2007, when you had the Presidency, the House, and the Senate. You are at it again. Mr. Speaker, I rise in sadness and disappointment that the House passed such an irresponsible, dangerous, and debtexploding legislation yesterday. We should be better than this. We should be more responsible than this. This bill gives 83 percent of its benefits to just 1 percent of the richest Americans. Why didn’t we have it reversed and give 83 percent to the people you talk about, Mr. Chairman? It takes 13 million people off their health insurance coverage and it raises the deficit by $1.5 trillion. There can be little doubt that the majority party is fixated on cutting taxes for the richest in our country. Defeat this bill. Do right by the American people. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute. Mr. Speaker, let’s talk deficits. Our Democrat opponents just hate the thought that we would give Americans back what they earned. In 2009, when President Obama lifted the national debt by $1.6 trillion—more than this tax bill—they cheered. In the next year, when President Obama raised the national debt by almost $2 trillion in 1 year, they cheered. Three more times, President Obama and Democrats raised our national debt more than $1 trillion every year. And now—now—they oppose it. Why? Because that was about Washington spending your money. This is about giving it back to the American people, and now, suddenly, you object. Two trillion dollars of deficit in 1 year. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. LEVIN), who is the longest serving member of the Ways and Means Committee. Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, if you will listen, this bill is trickledown at its worst. Except for the very wealthy trickle, it is, at best, a trickle; and for millions, not even that; and for the economy at large, a discredited theory. It is a deficit time bomb. The Speaker said to the middle class: Don’t worry, the expiring tax cuts will surely be extended. That means the real deficit from this bill is $2.5 trillion, a humongous deficit wrapped in your hypocrisy—in your hypocrisy. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are again reminded that they should address their remarks to the Chair. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. BARR). Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to applaud the great work of the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, my good friend from Texas (Mr. BRADY ) for his good work to overhaul America’s Tax Code to deliver historic tax relief for workers, families, and job creators. I resent the rhetoric from some of my friends on the other side of the aisle who talk about this as hurting disabled families. I am the brother of a disabled sister, and I am voting for this bill because it helps families with loved ones with disabilities, like expanding the ABLE Act. I thank Chairman BRADY for working with me and others to address a provision in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which would negatively impact work study colleges, such as Berea College in my district. The gentleman has fulfilled his commitment to me to fix this problem in the conference committee for work study colleges and other small schools so that their endowments would be exempt from the excise tax on large college endowments. Regrettably, last night, Senate Democrats used procedural rules to insist that this exemption be stripped out of the final conference report. It is unfortunate that they put partisan politics ahead of ensuring that students— many of whom are lowincome and 
firstgeneration college students—at workstudy colleges would continue to be able to receive a tuitionfree education. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from Kentucky. Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, these are firstgeneration college students who receive a tuitionfree education. I know that Chairman BRADY shares my commitment and that of Chairman ROGERS , Senator M CCONNELL , and others to make sure that Berea College and other workstudy colleges continue their important mission. Accordingly, I ask the gentleman’s commitment to work with me to permanently exempt workstudy colleges from the excise tax on endowment income in a timely manner, in the tax extenders, or another appropriate legislative vehicle as soon as possible. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. BARR for his leadership. The gentleman is correct, Senate Democrats stripped this out. I am committed to working with the gentleman to find a permanent solution to this problem as soon as possible. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. LEWIS), who is an extraordinary man. Our friend is the ranking member of the Oversight Subcommittee. Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, taxpayers stood up and spoke out against Republicans lining the pockets of their donors by any means necessary. Did you hear their cries? Can you feel their pain? You did not, Mr. Speaker. You chose to turn a deaf ear and a blind eye to their hopes and their dreams. This bill is a shame and a disgrace. Mr. Speaker, I urge each of you to be on the side of the people, on the side of history, and to vote against this bill. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DOGGETT ), who is a valued member of the Ways and Means Committee and the ranking member of the Tax Policy Subcommittee. Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, we are here solely because of Republican blunders. Hardly the first blunder. Many more blunders will need correcting from this trumpedup partisan bill. If President Trump blunders into signing it today, it will trigger $25 billion in Medicare cuts. This sad bill is left without any name. Like other towers, this towering monstrosity should be called ‘‘Trump’’ the ‘‘Trump Inequality Act,’’ the ‘‘Trump Family Enrichment Act,’’ or perhaps just call it the ‘‘Whopper’’ because it is a lie wrapped in lies. The truth will eventually catch up with these lies. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from California (Mr. THOMPSON ), who is a Vietnam veteran and a distinguished member of the Ways and Means Committee. Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, this is one of the most important bills that any of us will ever vote on—no hearings, no expert witnesses— and now we get 30 seconds on the floor to debate it. So let me just use my 30 seconds to say that this is a bad bill for working families. It is going to cause middle class working families to pay more in taxes. It is going to strap our citizens with $2.3 trillion more of national debt. I ask for a ‘‘no’’ vote. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr. CROWLEY ), who is the chairman of the Democratic Caucus and a valued member of the Ways and Means Committee. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, a revote—a revote—within less than 24 hours of original passage. This proves that this bill is rotten to its core. But here is what the Republicans aren’t going to fix: They didn’t fix the fact that this bill won’t provide economic security to hardworking families. They didn’t fix the fact that this bill will subsidize mansions for the wealthy, not renters or firsttime home buyers. They didn’t fix the fact that it won’t help families save for education or their retirement. They didn’t fix the fact that it will saddle our grandchildren with $2 trillion of debt. Mr. Speaker, this bill is not an investment in hardworking men and women or Americans. In fact, it rips healthcare from 13 million Americans. It is an investment in the GOP’s base— corporate special interests—the wealthiest among the wealthiest, and the entire Trump empire. This bill is a political calculation they think will get them a win on election day. But be warned: Americans are fed up and fired up. They know their cronies are laughing all the way to the bank. But the American people are organizing all the way to November. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. DANNY K. D AVIS), who is a champion of any and all things Chicago. Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, think of Robin Hood in reverse: take from the poor and give to the rich. When you take away social safety net programs and when you take away Medicare and Medicaid, then it reminds me of Marie Antoinette. When the people had no bread, she said: Let them eat cake. I was opposed to this before it was released, I was opposed yesterday, I will be opposed tomorrow, and I will be opposed next week. It is no good for the American people. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, might I inquire as to how much time is remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Massachusetts has 31⁄2 minutes remaining. The gentleman from Texas has 1 minute remaining. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close on this side, and I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, so in 1 month we have taken the entire revenue system of the United States without hearing from one expert witness, without having had one public hearing, without using any precedent, and we changed the entire tax system of the country, tilting it clearly to the people at the very top. b1230 When they say, as they certainly will, ‘‘We have been doing hearings for 5 years,’’ we never had one hearing on this legislation. Not one. We did not seek testimony from one witness in the conference committee. We got to offer opening statements and no amendments. There was no chance for any input on our side. More than anything else, this is a missed opportunity. This was a missed chance to take a system that we all know to have fallen into competitive failure across the globe. But instead, they decided to go it alone. So here is the way you want to think of this, for those of you who are following this debate: They are borrowing $2.3 trillion for the purpose of cutting the top tax bracket from 39.6 percent to 37 percent and calling that middle class tax relief; They are doubling the exemption on the estate tax to $22 million and calling that middle class tax relief; They are eliminating the alternative minimum tax for people at the very top and calling it middle class tax relief. By the 10th year of this tax proposal, 83 percent of the benefit accrues to the people at the very top of our economic system. That is not in dispute. They say things like: Well, in 5 years, we are going to correct this measure. Then they talked about the idea that somehow this was about simplicity. When you get into the phaseins and the phaseouts, you are all going to pass out from trying to read this tax proposal. The complexity they add to the system is unparalleled, all to secure a tax cut for people at the top. So here we are in the holiday season, and they are telling us, by the way, that if we just borrow this money, everything is going to be fine. What did they say about borrowing when Bill Clinton was President? What 
did they say about borrowing when Barack Obama was President? They lectured us, day in and day out, in an unyielding manner, even though the economic performance of Clinton and Obama outweighed the two Republican Presidents in between. So here is the game plan for the holiday season. Do you know what the holiday hangover on your credit card is? People go out and use their credit cards, and they figure out all year how to try to pay for it. It is going to take you more than 10 years to try to pay for this, all upon the spurious notion that they guarantee economic growth, as the President said, by the way, that is going to exceed 6 percent. That is 6 percent. They are telling us that the stock market has gone up because of them, even though it has gone up since March of 2009. They are telling us now that this is going to spur unparalleled economic growth, even though the economy has been growing for 88 straight months, all on the credit card for the American people. Mr. Speaker, this is the worst piece of legislation that has come from the House in the 29 years that I have served here, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I say to my Democratic colleagues: The worst bill in 29 years? With ObamaCare, don’t sell yourselves short. Today, we have a choice to make. We can either stick with the status quo— we just heard it—or we can take bold action to overhaul this broken Tax Code and restore hope, opportunity, and prosperity to Americans. Our choice is clear, and I have made mine. I will vote to send this bill to President Trump’s desk to get real tax reform done for the American people for the first time in 31 years. We will deliver for the American people. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to join me in support of this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 668, the previous question is ordered on the motion to concur. The question is on the motion to concur by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BRADY ). The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. NEAL.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REFORM AND TRANSPARENCY ACT OF 2017 Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 657, I call up the bill (H.R. 4015) to improve the quality of proxy advisory firms for the protection of investors and the U.S. economy, and in the public interest, by fostering accountability, transparency, responsiveness, and competition in the proxy advisory firm industry, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. BOST). Pursuant to House Resolution 657, an amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 115–46 is adopted, and the bill, as amended, is considered read. The text of the bill, as amended, is as follows: 
H.R. 4015 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Corporate Governance Reform and Transparency Act of 2017’’. 
Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and submit extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4015, the Corporate Governance Reform and Transparency Act of 2017, and I thank the sponsor of this legislation, the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. DUFFY ), the chairman of the Housing and Insurance Subcommittee of our committee, for offering this bill. Each year, Mr. Speaker, public companies hold shareholder meetings wherein shareholders vote for the companies’ directors and on other significant corporate actions that require shareholder approval. Mr. Speaker, the Securities and Exchange Commission requires that, before these annual shareholder meetings take place, public companies must provide shareholders with proxy statements that include all important facts about matters to be voted on at a shareholder meeting. Many shareholders and investment advisers rely on information provided by proxy advisory firms to guide their votes on these matters. H.R. 4015 would enhance transparency in the shareholder proxy system by requiring proxy advisory firms to register with the SEC, disclose potential conflicts of interest and codes of ethics, and make their methodologies public. Mr. Speaker, this is a pure disclosure bill, nothing more, nothing less. Proxy firms play an outsized role in the U.S. economy in shaping corporate governance. They counsel pension plans, mutual funds, and other institutional investors about how to vote the shares of corporations that they own. With respect to institutional investors, Mr. Speaker, the share of institutional investor ownership was roughly 46 percent as recently as 1987, but today, that figure is more than 75 percent; in other words, the volume of proxy votes for which investors are responsible has grown into the billions. In 2003, the SEC adopted a rule under the Investment Advisers Act that requires an investment adviser to vote in 
the best interest of their clients’ own proxies. A series of SEC noaction letters give the investment adviser a fundamental safe harbor from liability if they use a proxy adviser. As a result, institutional investors have increasingly relied on proxy advisory firms to help them decide how to vote their shares. However, regulators, market participants, and academic observers have highlighted potential conflicts of interest that are inherent in the business models and activities of proxy advisory firms. The committee, for example, is aware of numerous instances whereby the two largest proxy advisory firms have issued vote recommendations to shareholders that include errors, misstatements of facts, and incomplete analysis. For example, in one instance, a company reported that, even though the total shareholder return the company actually had generated for its shareholders was 64 percent, a proxy advisory firm, Glass Lewis, erroneously reported this calculation to be 26 percent. Another company reported that ISS erroneously reported that the company’s longterm cash awards will vest and pay out their maximum opportunity in the event of a change in control. Well, this was reported even though the company’s plan had been amended and approved by the shareholders years earlier in a manner that would pay out at target upon change in control, and there are many other examples. Some proxy advisory firms’ recommendations have been made without any contact to the public company at all, and then these same proxy advisory firms encourage companies to join their service in order to have the privilege to ‘‘influence’’ an advisory firm’s recommendations. I suspect, for many people, this simply does not pass the smell test. An industrial company told its shareholders, Mr. Speaker: ‘‘ISS’ negative recommendation was based on flawed analysis of our compensation programs that did not appropriately take into account the significant declines in our CEO’s pay in 2015 or the performance based nature of our annual and long term incentive compensation programs.’’ A pharmaceutical company responded to a proxy advisory firm’s recommendations with this statement: ‘‘For the second year in a row, Glass Lewis did not include its full pay for performance analysis in this report. For shareholders who rely only on Glass Lewis materials to make voting decisions, there is no discussion of the company’s industryleading performance over this time period.’’ Again, Mr. Speaker, there are many, many more examples like these. So another concern that many people have, Mr. Speaker, is that the two largest proxy advisory firms collectively— collectively—make up 97 percent of the proxy advisory industry—97 percent. This monopolization and the lack of transparency regarding proxy advisory firms means that the writings, analysis, reports, and voting recommendations of these two firms have a disproportionate effect on fundamental corporate transactions like mergers or acquisitions, the approval of corporate directors, and shareholder proposals. In other words, these two firms have a huge impact on our economy. The bill of the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. DUFFY ) helps address these concerns by setting up a new regulatory regime for proxy advisory firms that looks out for the interest of investors, shareholders, by ensuring they receive complete information through the proxy process and can better vote in a manner consistent with shareholder interest as opposed to the potential conflicted interest of a proxy firm. Mr. DUFFY ’s bill also helps ensure that shareholders and their proxies have access to accurate information regarding companies by allowing companies to provide input on proxy recommendations. This is especially important for emerging growth companies that rely heavily on investors. A bad proxy recommendation in which emerging growth companies cannot refute the recommendation can be devastating to those emerging growth companies and, thus, have a harmful impact on our economy. In a letter to our committee, the Biotechnology Innovation Organization wrote: ‘‘Small business innovators operate in a unique industry that values a strong relationship with investors. Yet they are often held to standards that are not applicable to their company and forced to engage in proxy fights over issues that do not add value to shareholders.’’ H.R. 4015 would provide for SEC oversight of proxy advisory firms, ensuring that they operate within appropriate boundaries and can be held accountable to regulators and the public. To be clear, Mr. Speaker, nothing in this bill permits companies to rewrite a proxy firm’s report or forces a proxy firm to change its recommendation based on feedback received from the company. In summary, H.R. 4015 will improve transparency in the proxy system and enhance shareholder access to information by ensuring that proxy advisory firms are registered with the SEC, disclose potential conflicts of interest and codes of ethics, and make publicly available their methodologies for forming proxy recommendations and analysis. For every Member who believes in investor protection and supports a healthier economy, they should support H.R. 4015. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. b1315 Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4015, the socalled Corporate Governance Reform and Transparency Act, would create an untested, inappropriate, and burdensome regulatory framework for proxy advisory firms, making it much more difficult for shareholders to obtain unbiased research used to make wellinformed voting decisions about the companies they own. Institutional investors, like pension funds and mutual funds, typically invest money on behalf of hardworking Americans in a large number of public companies. In exchange for their investment, companies provide investors with shares of ownership and a say on important proposed changes to how the companies are run. These proposals may relate to who sits on the board of directors, how much executives are paid, environmental practices, employee minimum wage, and nondiscrimination policies. Shareholders often hire independent researchers called proxy advisory firms to help inform their voting decisions on the many proposals they consider each year. H.R. 4015 contains numerous provisions that would undermine proxy advisory firms and the shareholders that rely on them for unbiased advice. First, H.R. 4015 would essentially fulfill the wishes of corporate management by regulating proxy advisory firms out of existence. The bill requires proxy advisory firms to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission and authorizes the SEC to deny applications on a whim. Additionally, H.R. 4015 would force proxy advisers to publicly disclose their internal proprietary research methodologies and voting policies, which firms invest time and money into developing. The bill would also require proxy advisers to hire a sort of compliance department dedicated entirely to the grievances of corporate management rather than the adviser’s own shareholder clients. These burdensome requirements would deter new proxy advisers from entering the market and squeeze out smaller, costsensitive firms. As a result, shareholders would be faced with everincreasing fees to obtain research from a shrinking universe of advisers. Second, H.R. 4015 would grant corporate management the right to review and weigh in on a proxy adviser’s draft recommendations before the shareholderclients, who pay for the recommendations, get to see a final report. If management raises a complaint that the adviser disagrees with, the bill allows management to get the last word by publishing its dissenting opinion in the adviser’s final report. In other words, the bill is the equivalent of requiring that a teacher clear a report card with a student before sending it to his or her parents. Finally, H.R. 4015 is unnecessary in light of existing Federal securities 
laws. For example, some proxy advisers, such as the largest firm, Institutional Shareholder Services, are already registered and regulated as investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. As such, they already owe heightened obligations to their customers; must make regular, comprehensive disclosures to regulators and the public; and are subject to periodic compliance examinations, among other legal responsibilities. Additionally, the SEC has already provided guidance on due diligence and oversight related to proxy advisers. H.R. 4015 would replace this wellunderstood guidance with a harmful and inappropriate regulatory regime that undermines investors’ ability to simply exercise their shareholder rights. Tellingly, nothing in H.R. 4015 advances the bill’s purported goals of ‘‘fostering accountability, transparency, responsiveness, and competition in the proxy advisory firm industry.’’ Shareholders hold corporations and their management accountable by casting wellinformed votes on important issues of corporate governance, including issues of diversity. For example, a recent study by Ernst & Young found that corporate board diversity and gender pay equity were key themes in the 2017 proxy season. Specifically, Ernst & Young found that over half of the investors it interviewed included diversity as a board priority in 2017, and ‘‘proposals asking boards to report on and increase their board diversity are among the top shareholder proposals submitted this year.’’ H.R. 4015 would render these important accountability efforts ineffective, as the institutional shareholders driving governance changes would be less able to obtain the research needed to inform voting decisions. Now, I can imagine that Americans listening to this debate may get confused that Republicans, who have been singularly focused on repealing important safeguards and protections for America’s consumers and investors, are now claiming that they are seeking to protect investors with these new rules, but, Mr. Speaker, if this bill truly helped investors, why have so many from all over America written letters to Congress opposing H.R. 4015? To name a few, the bill’s opponents include public pension funds and government officials from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, New York, Ohio, Oregon, and Washington. These investors joined a letter from Council of Institutional Investors stating that H.R. 4015 ‘‘would weaken corporate governance in the United States; undercut proxy advisory firms’ ability to uphold their fiduciary obligation to their investor clients; and reorient any surviving firms to serve companies rather than investors.’’ Proponents of effective corporate governance, including Americans for Financial Reform, Consumer Federation of America, Public Citizen, and Principles for Responsible Investment, have similarly written to oppose this bill. For example, the Consumer Federation of America wrote that H.R. 4015 ‘‘would empower companies to bully proxy advisory firms into dropping their objections to management proposals or watering down their recommendations.’’ Private institutional investors also agree that H.R. 4015 would leave shareholders reliant on biased information tilted toward the interests of company management. Sound corporate governance requires shareholders to have access to impartial information when voting on key corporate issues. If our Nation’s investors, who provide the capital for businesses to grow jobs and our economy, are unable to hold corporations accountable, they will be increasingly reluctant to invest. H.R. 4015 would, thereby, hurt the very businesses it purports to assist. Mr. Speaker, for these reasons, I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing H.R. 4015. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 10 seconds. Mr. Speaker, it is a historic day in America. Republicans deliver historic tax relief for working Americans and small businesses. The ranking member has articulated concern over burdensome requirements. I look forward to working with her now on reducing the burdensome requirements of the DoddFrank Act. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. HUIZENGA ), the chairman of the Committee on Financial Services’ Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Securities, and Investments. Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, as has been pointed out each year, public companies convene these shareholder meetings at which the companies’ shareholders vote for the companies’ directors and on other significant corporate actions that require shareholder approval. As part of this annual process, the Securities and Exchange Commission requires public companies to provide their shareholders with a proxy statement before those meetings. A proxy statement includes all important facts about the matters to be voted on at the meeting, including, for example, information on board of directors candidates, director compensation, executive compensation, related party transactions, securities ownership by management, and eligible shareholder proposals. The information contained in the statement must be filed with the SEC before soliciting a shareholder vote on the election of directors and the approval of these other corporate actions. Solicitations, whether by management or shareholders, must disclose all important facts about the issues on which the shareholders are being asked to vote. Institutional investors, including investment advisers to mutual funds and pension funds, typically hold shares in a large number of public companies. Each year, the investment advisers to these funds vote billions of shares on behalf of their clients on thousands of proxy ballot items. What you have heard about, really, was the theoretical way this is supposed to run. Unfortunately, that is not reality, and that is not what you are hearing from the other side, because in 2003, the SEC adopted a rule under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, requiring an investment adviser that exercises voting authority over its clients’ proxies to adopt policies and procedures designed to ensure that the investment adviser votes those proxies in the best interests of their clients. Perfect. That is exactly what they should be doing. The SEC’s release adopting the rule clarified that ‘‘an adviser could demonstrate that the vote was not a product of a conflict of interest if it voted client securities, in accordance with a predetermined policy, based upon the recommendations of an independent third party.’’ Okay so far, but here is where we see the problem. As a result, institutional investors increase their reliance on these proxy adviser firms to help them decide how to vote their shares. In 2004, the SEC staff, without a Commission vote, just the staff, issued two ‘‘no action’’ letters ‘‘effectively blessing the practice of investment advisers simply voting the recommendations provided by a proxy adviser,’’ according to SEC Commissioner Dan Gallagher. Largely, as a result of the SEC’s regulation, proxy adviser firms now wield tremendous outside influence on the U.S. proxy system. Studies have shown that the two largest proxy adviser firms are comprised of approximately 97 percent of all the proxy advisory industry and can control a significant percentage of share votes in corporate elections, which is sometimes as high as 40 percent. There have been numerous instances where these two firms have issued vote recommendations on publicly traded companies that include errors, misstatements of fact, and incomplete analysis. Additionally, some proxy advisory firms’ recommendations have been made without any sort of communication or contact with the public company that they are actually reviewing. In fact, these same proxy advisory firms even encourage companies to join their service on the other side of the ledger in order to have the privilege to ‘‘influence’’ an advisory firm’s recommendations. Members heard from the ranking member about a teacher having to check with a student about what their grades are going to be as a student. Well, what this is, Mr. Speaker, this is the teacher shaking down the student for their lunch money and milk 
money to make sure that they are behaving. So let’s talk about reality here. Regulators, market participants, and academic observers have highlighted potential conflicts of interest inherent to this business model and activities of these proxy firms. For example, proxy advisory firms may feel pressured by their largest clients, who may be activist investors, to issue voting recommendations that reflect those clients’ specific agendas, not the boards’ or the corporations’. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. HUIZENGA ). Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, additionally, proxy advisory firms often provide voting recommendations to investment advisers on matters for which they also provide consulting services to public companies. Talk about, again, a conflict of interest. Some proxy advisory firms also rate or score these public companies on their governance structures, policies, practices, and they are trying to actually influence the corporate governance practices of these companies. Essentially, these proxy advisory firms have hijacked the proxy system by aligning themselves with activist shareholders, who also might be their clients, to push social and political initiatives rather than using shareholder votes to maximize shareholder value and increasing shareholder returns. b1330 Well, H.R. 4015 is to the rescue on this. It would foster greater accountability, competition, responsiveness, and, most importantly of all, transparency. This legislation would ensure that voting recommendations at proxy advisory firms are, in fact, in the interest of longterm shareholders. So let’s not misunderstand. The role of these proxy advisory firms serves a very important place in our economy. However, these firms aren’t immune to conflicts of interest. The good work of my friend, Mr. DUFFY , on H.R. 4015 will improve that transparency. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. It is not enough that my friends on the opposite side of the aisle just voted to give the biggest tax breaks to America’s richest corporations. They are back here now supporting the control and the dominance of corporations over our investors who need protections. The difference between us and them, they are for deregulation of Dodd Frank and protection for consumers to support, however they can give it, the biggest corporations in America. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. CAROLYN B. M ALONEY ), the distinguished ranking member of the Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Securities, and Investments. Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of investor protection and in opposition to H.R. 4015. Proxy advisers provide recommendations to institutional investors on how to vote on board of director elections and shareholder resolutions. Big institutional investors are shareholders at thousands of public companies, and they simply don’t have time to carefully review every single hundredpage proxy statement in detail, especially because most public companies hold their shareholders meetings at about the same 3month period. So institutional investors rely on proxy advisers for vote recommendations, which are often tailored to the investor’s particular corporate governance preferences. They also rely on proxy firms for their data management on shareholder votes and corporate governance. This is healthy. Proxy advisers do actually have the time to carefully read all of the statements and proposals because they are professionals that are hired to do just that. I agree that the current regulatory system for proxy advisers is not perfect. Two proxy advisory firms account for 97 percent of the market—ISS and Glass Lewis—but, for some reason, they are regulated differently. ISS is a registered investment adviser, while Glass Lewis is not. Surely, this is not an ideal setup, so I am open to the idea of a better and more consistent regulatory regime for proxy advisers. But there are several things in this bill that concern me deeply. I don’t see why companies should have a statutory right to receive and comment on a proxy adviser’s draft recommendations before they are sent to investors. Proxy advisers aren’t Federal agencies with a noticeandcomment for private companies. They are working for private companies that are providing a valuable service. This is not appropriate at all. Asset managers that use proxy advisers also tell me that they would find proxy advisers a lot less useful if the proxy firm had to give the company an opportunity to comment on their vote recommendations before sending them to the asset manager. And a new addition to the bill is very troubling. This would raise the possibility of proxy advisers being forced to send the clients the companies’ own complaints about the proxy adviser’s recommendations, even if the complaint is completely untrue. This is totally inappropriate and, I would say, plain wrong. So while I am sympathetic to the idea that a better and more consistent regulatory regime could be developed, I cannot support this bill, and I have good company here. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  a letter from the Comptroller of the State of New York, Comptroller DiNapoli; a statement from the AFL– CIO of the United States of America; a statement from the Council of Institutional Investors; a statement from the Consumer Federation of America, and a statement by Glass Lewis. This is a troubling bill. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on it. It is bad for safety and soundness and for good governance in this country. STATE OF NEWYORK, OFFICE OF THE STATE COMPTROLLER , Albany, NY, December 14, 2017. Re Opposition to H.R. 4015, Corporate Governance Reform and Transparency Act of 2017. DEAR MEMBERS OF THE NYS C ONGRES SIONAL DELEGATION : I write to express my strong opposition to H.R. 4015, the Corporate Governance Reform and Transparency Act of 2017, which I understand will soon be voted on by the United States House of Representatives. I believe that H.R. 4015, if passed and enacted, would require unnecessary and expensive regulation. Further, this legislation was not promoted by those it purports to protect: shareholders. It would weaken corporate accountability and shareholder oversight, undercut proxy advisory firms’ invaluable independence, increase costs to consumers of research and redirect proxy advisors to answer to companies rather than the clients it serves. As Comptroller of the State of New York, I am the Trustee of the New York State Common Retirement Fund (Fund) and the administrative head of the New York State and Local Retirement System (the System). As a fiduciary responsible for the benefits of over one million state and local government employees, retirees, and beneficiaries, I am especially troubled by H.R. 4015’s provisions that would weaken corporate accountability and shareholder oversight. The system of corporate governance that has evolved in the United States relies on the accountability of boards of directors to shareholders, and proxy voting is a critical means by which shareholders hold boards to account. Currently, proxy advisors provide shareholders of corporations with independent advice. The proposed bill threatens that very independence, which is integral to the responsible exercise of a shareholder’s voting rights. In public comments defending H.R. 4015, members of the Financial Services Committee have voiced the erroneous assertions that proxy advisory firms dictate proxy voting results and that institutional investors utilizing proxy advisors do not make their own voting decisions. I personally review and approve the Fund’s customized Proxy Voting and Corporate Governance Guidelines (Guidelines). In 2017, the Fund voted on nearly 30,000 agenda items on its portfolio companies’ proxy statements, and every single one of those items was voted pursuant to the guidelines which state: ‘‘proxy voting decisions are based on internal reviews of available information relating to items on the ballot at each company’s annual meeting. . . . The Fund analyzes a variety of materials from publicly available sources, which include but are not limited to, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, analyst reports, relevant studies and materials from proponents and opponents of shareholder proposals, thirdparty independent perspectives and studies, and analyses from several corporate governance advisory firms.’’ All of our proxy voting decisions are made independently and in the best interest of our System’s participants. Proxy advisory firms provide costefficient, informed, and independent research, 
analysis, and advice for institutional shareholders, which often hold thousands of companies in their investment portfolios. The independence of that advice is absolutely essential, and if proxy advisors are required to obtain corporate review and rebuttals before releasing their research to investors, that independence would be compromised, depriving public pension funds and other institutional investors of a vital resource. Such a requirement would also delay investors’ access to research in the already constricted time frame available to consider ballot issues and develop independent voting decisions in an informed fashion. As you consider your vote on this bill, please take into account the concerns I have expressed on behalf of the more than one million members, retirees and beneficiaries of the System for whom the Fund invests. Thank you for your consideration of this very important matter. Please feel free to contact me if you would like to discuss these issues further. Sincerely, THOMAS P. D INAPOLI , State Comptroller. 
AFL–CIO, Washington, DC, December 14, 2017. DEAR REPRESENTATIVE : On behalf of the AFL–CIO, I am writing to express our strong opposition to the ‘‘Corporate Governance Reform and Transparency Act of 2017’’ (H.R. 4015). H.R. 4015 will create a costly and untested regulatory regime for proxy advisory firms that provide research and voting recommendations to shareholders. The bill claims to foster ‘‘accountability, transparency, responsiveness, and competition in the proxy advisory firm industry,’’ while in reality it will interfere with shareholders’ access to impartial analysis and undermine shareholders’ ability to hold corporate management accountable. For example, H.R. 4015 will undermine investors’ ability to hold corporate management responsible on issues such as executive pay. H.R. 4015 would give corporate executives an effective veto over proxy advisor recommendations by enabling companies to delay vote recommendations. Corporate executives will be able to object to any proxy voting recommendation that is contrary to their own preferences, including votes on their own executive compensation packages. The bill is based on the false idea that shareholders blindly follow the recommendations of proxy advisors. In reality, proxy advisors provide independent and unbiased research on proxy votes to help investors formulate their own proxy voting decisions. This flawed bill will create unnecessary regulations that undermine this free flow of information to investors. For these reasons, we strongly urge you to vote against ‘‘Corporate Governance Reform and Transparency Act of 2017’’ (H.R. 4015). Sincerely, WILLIAM SAMUEL , Director, Government Affairs Department. 
CONSUMER FEDERATION OF AMERICA , December 18, 2017. Re Vote No on H.R. 4015, the ‘‘Corporate Governance Transparency Act’’. DEARREPRESENTATIVE : We understand the House is scheduled to vote this week on legislation (H.R. 4015, the Corporate Governance Reform and Transparency Act) that would undermine the ability of shareholders to get reliable, independent analysis of proxy issues on which they are asked to vote. We urge you to vote no. Although H.R. 4015 is presented as a bill to regulate proxy advisory firms in order to better protect investors and the economy, its effect would be to undermine their independence, simultaneously increasing their costs and undermining their value to the investors who use their services. Indeed, several of the bill’s provisions are specifically designed to give the companies whose proxy proposals the firms are supposed to independently analyze greater input into and influence over their recommendations. It would, for example, require proxy advisory firms to give companies a first look at their draft recommendations and an opportunity to comment on them before any recommendation to investors is finalized. Proxy advisory firms would also be required to employ an ombudsman to take complaints about the accuracy of the voting materials from the companies that are subjects of the recommendations, and provide those companies with an opportunity to include a comment in materials sent to investors if their complaints are not resolved to their satisfaction. Together, these provisions would empower companies to bully proxy advisory firms into dropping their objections to management proposals or watering down their recommendations. We certainly agree that proxy advisory firms should be subject to appropriate regulation. Rather than create a bureaucratic new regulatory regime for a handful of firms, however, we believe that is better achieved by regulating these firms as investment advisers, with a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the investors who rely on their services and an obligation to minimize and appropriately manage conflicts of interest. For these reasons, we urge you to vote no on this misguided and misdirected legislation. Please feel free to contact me directly if you have questions about our position on this bill. Respectfully submitted, BARBARA ROPER , Director of Investor Protection. 
GLASS LEWIS, December 18, 2017. Re HR 4015—Corporate Governance Reform and Transparency Act of 2017. Hon. PAULRYAN, Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. NANCY PELOSI , Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARSPEAKER RYAN AND LEADER PELOSI : I am writing to express opposition to HR 4015, the Corporate Governance and Reform and Transparency Act of 2017, which seeks to exert additional regulatory control over proxy advisory firms at the expense of investors. I urge a no vote when this legislation is considered by the full House of Representatives. Shareholder voting, a regulatory obligation for U.S. registered investment advisors, is a primary means by which a public company’s owners can influence company operations, corporate governance and activities of corporate social responsibility. As such, it is important for institutional investors (pension funds, mutual funds and other asset managers) to have access to the resources— including unbiased proxy research—that enable them to execute their votes in accordance with their views. Glass Lewis is dedicated to helping institutional shareholders of public companies better understand and connect directly with the companies in which they invest. Our duty, as a proxy advisory firm, is to support—not usurp—the role of our clients as investors/ owners, a distinction we take very seriously. It is reflected in how we develop and update our proxy voting policies, create our research, and engage with public companies, shareholders and other stakeholders. H.R. 4015, as drafted, would damage investors in public companies by attempting to silence research firms that provide investors data, analysis and independent voting recommendations to support their fiduciary activities related to proxy voting. It would require the SEC to develop a new registration scheme that would compel proxy advisory firms to share their proprietary research reports with the subject public companies prior to distributing those reports to their investor clients—thereby granting the subject companies an unprecedented right of prior review. The proposed legislation also would establish a system whereby issuers could dispute recommendations of proxy advisory firms before the investor clients of proxy advisory firms were granted access to the research. No other investment research analysts are subject to these prior review rules; in fact, FINRA prohibits investment research analysts from doing this to avoid conflicts of interest. In SEC Staff Legal Bulletin No. 20 (June 30, 2014), the SEC restated that investor consumers of proxy advisory firm services are responsible for holding their advisors accountable. These investor consumers are satisfied with the current system. Indeed, it is telling that the call for regulating proxy advisory firms is coming not from investors but from the companies that are the subjects of the advisors’ reports. In October, the United States Department of Treasury issued its report to President Trump on ‘‘A Financial System that Creates Economic Opportunities, Capital Markets.’’ As part of that report, extensive outreach was undertaken to identify views of company management teams and other market participants on the role and activities of proxy advisors. Treasury found that ‘‘institutional investors, who pay for proxy advice and are responsible for voting decisions, find the [proxy advisory firm] services valuable, especially in sorting through the lengthy and significant disclosures contained in proxy statements.’’ More significantly, the Treasury did not call for legislation of the proxy advisory industry. Further, in 2012, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), which comprises all the securities regulators in Europe, and the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) conducted comprehensive reviews of the proxy advisory industry and its activities. Both regulatory agencies concluded that neither binding nor quasibinding regulation of proxy advisory firm activity was warranted. ESMA and the CSA each recommended the development of an industry code of conduct. In accordance with the specific direction of these regulators, the Best Practice Principles for Shareholder Voting Research (‘‘Principles’’) were launched in 2014. Glass Lewis and ISS, the largest U.S.based proxy advisory firms, apply the Principles globally. The Principles encourage transparency, conflict management and disclosure, and engagement with companies when appropriate. Glass Lewis meets the’ Principles’ standards by making its full guidelines; research approach and methodologies; conflict avoidance and disclosure policies; and publiccompany engagement procedures available publicly on its website. Most recently, in an effort to ensure that the Principles remain fully aligned with applicable regulation, a global consultation was launched in order to seek views from investors and companies on whether the Principles have been effective in ensuring the integrity and efficiency of the services provided by shareholder voting analysts and advisors. The review is being carried out by a Steering Group comprised of five representatives of the current Principles’ signatories, chaired by Chris Hodge, former Director of Corporate Governance at the Financial Reporting Council in the UK, and supported by an Advisory Panel whose members have broad experience and knowledge of investors, companies and different national markets, including the United States. By way of example, one of the key items on the agenda is the consideration of what actions will be needed in order to ensure the Principles are fully compatible with the revised EU Shareholder Rights Directive, which includes mandatory requirements for proxy advisors operating in the EU, scheduled to take effect in 2019. The Corporate Governance Reform and Transparency Act is an attack on investors to the detriment of their beneficiaries—notably the millions of U.S. teachers, municipal employees, law enforcement officers, firefighters, retirees and mutual funds investors. If enacted, it will result in less informed, more timeconstrained investors who will be less able to properly hold companies accountable for poor returns, overpaying executives at underperforming companies and ignoring shareholders and shareholder interests. Glass Lewis joins with the many pension funds, institutional investors, and consumer advocates urging you to vote no on HR 4015 to protect shareholder rights. Sincerely, KATHERINE H. R ABIN, Chief Executive Officer. 
Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. HILL), our Republican Conference whip. Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support today of the Corporate Governance Reform and Transparency Act of 2017, and I appreciate my good friend, SEANDUFFY ’s work on it. Over the past 3 decades, I have advocated for responsible shareholder activism and urged for corporate boards of directors to perform their responsibility of careful stewardship, particularly in their essential functions in evaluating corporate strategy, hiring able hardworking executive management, and, critically, capital allocation. For example, as Berkshire Hathaway’s CEO, Warren Buffett, recommends, corporate compensation committees must be composed of ‘‘sabertoothed tigers,’’ not ‘‘house cats,’’ in their work. Likewise, investors must take their responsibility to hold boards accountable for their irreplaceable role in maximizing returns for shareholders, while executing a corporate strategy that balances shareholder returns with employees and customers. So the question is: How can investors effectively lower agency costs and actively meet this accountability mission? For 20 years, this has been a much discussed area by thoughtful experts like Warren Buffett, ISS founder Robert Monks, Marty Lipton, and Lawrence Cunningham. Grad schools at UCLA, Stanford, Harvard, Yale all researched this challenge. Organizations of institutional investors and corporate directors all proffer best practices. And how do we best align these interests for this mission, but make conflicts of interest readily apparent? The role of proxy advisory firms in the U.S. economy has grown over the last 2 decades and is a major shaper of corporate governance, and it is of national importance. These firms counsel our pension plans, our mutual funds, other institutional investors, which are more and more in the market; 75 percent of the market, compared to when Robert Monks started thinking about the idea in the late 1980s. Under the current system, two proxy advisory firms now have 97 percent of the market, Mr. Speaker, and this monopolization and the lack of transparency regarding their work means that the writings, analyses, reports, and vote recommendations of just these two firms have a disproportionate effect on the fundamental corporate transactions, like mergers and acquisitions, the approval of corporate directors, and other shareholder proposals. Also, this has created more of a checklist mentality in the boardroom. Directors today need information, yes, but, more importantly, they need wisdom. And the proxy advisory firms are driving people in boardrooms, in my view, to more of a checklist mentality, regulatory mentality, and less using their business judgment and wisdom to guide our public companies. Proxy advisory firms aren’t immune to conflicts of interest. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from Arkansas. 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, these conflicts are provided by providing additional recommendations to the very firms that they are rating. So, Mr. Speaker, we need balance in this arena, and I think Mr. DUFFY ’s bill provides a step toward that balance, an improvement in transparency in the proxy system, thereby enhancing shareholder access to important investment information. I appreciate his work on it. I thank him for his work in our committee. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. DAVID SCOTT), a hardworking member of the Financial Services Committee. Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, this is indeed a very, very important issue. I come at this from one who has worked with my good friend, Mr. DUFFY , on this issue. More than that, I voted with Mr. DUFFY for this bill in committee. However, there are some troubling things about this bill that could do one very damaging thing. It could put many of these proxy firms out of business. I want to take a moment to explain what the danger is in the bill that made me change my mind. I chatted with Mr. DUFFY about it. He understands it. This is not to shed any negative light on his objective, but it is what he is doing to get to that objective that disturbs me and, I think, should disturb the people of this Congress and this country, and that is this: It could be summed up in, basically, 2 words: unilateral authority. That is what this bill provides to the Securities and Exchange Commission: unilateral authority to set the requirements, first of all, for what it means to be a proxy firm. When you put unilateral authority into the hands of a regulatory agency, we know the damage that can be done. And I agree that there may be some things that need to be done, but these words, ‘‘unilateral authority,’’ would mean that the Securities and Exchange Commission could establish any number of hurdles for these proxy advisory firms to jump over in order to just stay in business. Unilateral authority to do such things as setting financial requirements, one would say that nothing may be wrong with that; but other hurdles that the Securities and Exchange Commission could put up likely will be arbitrary, illogical, such as them setting requirements for how many employees a proxy firm should have. Mr. Speaker, this is a step too far, especially during a time in our country when Federal regulators have used their powers to attack the American people at any and every level. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from Georgia. Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, second, let me give you an example of how you can put too much regulatory authority into an agency. When HHS, this year, used their powers to attack women’s health, that happened; or when the Department of Justice used their powers to reverse community policing reform at the Department of Justice. All I am saying in this particular argument, Mr. Speaker, is that Mr. DUFFY is wellintended, but this goes too far, and I urge my colleagues to reject and vote ‘‘no’’ on this bill. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. BUDD). Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4015. I thank Chairman DUFFY for his leadership on this bipartisan piece of legislation, which will improve our country’s shareholder proxy system. Since the early 2000s, we have seen market share and the shareholder proxy system consolidate, essentially, into a duopoly, as two firms control 97 percent of the market, so, under the current system, potential conflicts of interest abound. For example, proxy advisory firms that provide voting recommendations to advisers often provide consulting services to those same public companies. So wouldn’t it make sense that they at least notify their shareholders of this potential conflict of interest? Well, right now, while the SEC has offered guidance on this problem, the proxy firm wouldn’t be required to do so. We need to get this bill on the books just to address this problem. b1345 This bill is also timely because we have seen proxy firms align themselves with political causes, unions, and interest groups that do not always represent their shareholders’ best interests. Shareholders oftentimes aren’t even aware of these conflicts. Again, reform is needed. So it should go without saying, Mr. Speaker, that the two problems outlined above pose problems for the shareholder and for the average investor. We cannot continue to allow the security laws and processes to be wrapped in a service of political agenda. Mr. Speaker, we have dealt with this issue in the Financial Services Committee on a number of fronts with regard to disclosure of information that is being weaponized against public companies, from mining to conflict minerals. It is time to deal with the proxy issue today. The number of public companies has fallen in recent years. It was never easy to be public, to be subject to the financial markets and the pressures that come from being accountable to your shareholders. This issue, the proxy issue, is part of a larger tapestry of challenges that public companies face. They are increasingly choosing not to play the game. They are getting capital from dark pools; they are getting capital from hedge funds; and they are just staying private. That puts investment opportunities in the hands of the 1 percent, and that leaves retail investors out in the cold. Mr. Speaker, my constituents and North Carolina shareholders are from the parttime trader to the fulltime trader. They deserve better than this. Luckily, this body can do something to address these problems, and that is where Chairman DUFFY ’s bipartisanship legislation comes into play. His bill will bring about muchneeded accountability, competition, and, most importantly, transparency in the proxy advisory firm industry. This bill also protects clients and their financial future from being influenced by activists and outside interest groups. His legislation accomplishes this by mandating that proxy advisory firms register with the SEC, disclose potential conflicts of interest to the shareholders, and make their methods for coming up with proxy recommendations available to the public. Two proxy advisory firms should not have this much control of the marketplace and the power to disproportionately affect fundamental corporate transactions. This bill is a win for the consumer, a win for the free market, and should be a bipartisan priority for this body. A number of outside commentators have been clear that the proxy industry has gained a worrisome degree of authority over companies. In fact, Columbia Law Professor Jeffrey Gordon said that the burden of annual voting would lead investors, particularly institutional investors, to farm out evaluation of most pay plans to a handful of proxy advisory firms who, themselves, will seek to economize on those very proxy review costs. There are a host of others who are saying these same things about the way things are today in proxy voting. Ultimately, the shareholder is the one who suffers. We should put a stop to it. Mr. Speaker, once again, I want to thank Chairman DUFFY for leading the fight on this issue, and I urge adoption of his legislation. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. CAPUANO ), an invaluable member of the Financial Services Committee. Mr. CAPUANO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding time to me. Mr. Speaker, this is one of those mundane issues that 95 percent of America doesn’t understand. I didn’t understand much about it a while back because I don’t have any proxy advisers. I do have money in retirement funds. I do get those 100page documents in the mail, saying, ‘‘We are having a proxy fight and you should read it,’’ in the smallest print possible, and I do what 95 percent of America 
does when I get those: I throw them right in the trash. Now, that doesn’t make me smart. It just means I can’t read through that stuff. I can’t understand what they are doing with my pension funds. I kind of have to go on faith that they are not sticking it to me. That is what most of us do, and most anybody listening to this, that is the only thing they have to do with this issue. So I went out and found out what is a proxy adviser. Here is what it is. The pension funds—not always, but mostly pension funds—that invest my pension money do it all across the board. Many of them are small. Some of them are big. And when it comes time to reading those 100page documents and the thousands of companies they invest in, they go and hire somebody to help them do it, a proxy adviser. They go through those documents with accountants and actuaries and give them advice. Not a demand— advice. Now, I don’t know about you. I get advice from my lawyer on occasion. I get advice from my accountant on occasion. I get advice from my priest on occasion. And it is none of your damn business what advice they give me, because two of them I am paying and one of them loves me. When a person or an entity hires someone else to give them advice, it is no one else’s business what that is. This bill says it is. It now would be the business of the company about whom they are giving the advice. I paid them. Why should I share that information with you? That is what a proxy adviser is. It is not some big swami sitting in the back sticking it to big corporations. It is a paid adviser. Now, we have heard, oh, terrible things that these advisers do. Who do they work for? Well, they work for pension funds—mostly pension funds, by the way, that are public pension funds, not all. They have the pension money of teachers, firefighters, police officers, trash collectors, water workers all across this country. And then there are private pension funds that work for union members: the AFL–CIO, the Bricklayers, the SEIU. That is who is doing most of this investing on behalf of little people like me who don’t have the knowledge or the time to be able to go through 100 pages of really fine print, really detailed stuff, to determine which person I should vote for on a board of a company I don’t know much about. That is it. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from Massachusetts. Mr. CAPUANO. Mr. Speaker, let’s figure out who are the worst of the worst of the people who hire these people. Well, it turns out the Dominican Sisters hire a proxy adviser. Oh, they are put together for the very purpose of ripping the heart out of corporate America. Those Dominican Sisters, they are evil investors. Let’s not forget the Daughters of Charity. Oh, terrible, terrible people. They are so busy caring for the poorest people in the world that they take time out of that in order to find a way to stick it to the biggest corporate people in the country. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has again expired. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from Massachusetts. Mr. CAPUANO. Mr. Speaker, they use proxy advisers. Let me see. Who wants this bill? Every corporation in America. Why? They don’t want you knowing what they are doing. Let’s see. Whose side am I on? I think if I have a choice between being on the side of the biggest corporations in this country or being with the Dominican Sisters, I am choosing the Dominican Sisters. They are doing God’s work. They use and need proxy advisers. Leave them alone. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 10 seconds just to say that, if the gentleman is so busy he can’t read a 100page proxy statement, perhaps he could read a 20page bill and he would realize that his comments have almost absolutely nothing to do with the bill whatsoever. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. DUFFY ), the sponsor of the legislation and the chairman of the Financial Services Subcommittee on Housing and Insurance. Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman for yielding time to me, the chairman of Financial Services, Mr. HENSARLING . I appreciate his leadership and stewardship on our committee. Mr. Speaker, I want to get into the bill in a second, but I can’t let the Dominican Sisters reference go. It is not the Dominican Sisters who are using proxy advisers. It is the largest financial investors in the world that are using these advisers, which we are going to get into in a little bit. And if you want to talk about sisters, I will talk about the Little Sisters of the Poor, who have been ravaged by ObamaCare because they can’t practice their faith, if you want to talk about sisters. We are not going to go there today. Mr. Speaker, we are in a situation where, my friends, if you listen to the debate, you might say, ‘‘Well, Republicans are asking for a little more regulation in the proxy advisory space,’’ and Democrats, miraculously, are saying, ‘‘We don’t want any regulation.’’ Well, our concern is that you have consolidated power in two companies that control 97 percent of the industry, and some have made the claim and the allegation that there might be political motivations behind both—or at least one—of these massive proxy advisory firms, because Glass Lewis is owned by the Ontario Teachers’ Pension fund, and they might have a political agenda that might affect the recommendations that have a massive impact on American corporate governance. Maybe that could be the distinction between the two parties in today’s debate. Mr. Speaker, we have covered this quite a bit, but I want to go into it again. The role of proxy advisory firms in the U.S. economy is incredibly important. It is important stuff. These firms counsel pension plans and mutual funds and institutional investors on how to vote their shares. No one is trying to get rid of proxy advisory firms. We think they are a good thing, but we think they should have a little bit of regulation and a little bit of oversight. I think it is troubling, when you look at the share of institutional ownership, in 1987, it was 46 percent. Today, that has grown to 75 percent, meaning that institutional investors control billions of shares. There was a recent study that was done by Stanford that says that asset managers with $100 billion or more under their control only make 10 percent of the decisions on these proxy issues, meaning they outsource 90 percent of the decisions to one of two firms, consolidating great power in these proxy advisory firms. This was pointed out before as well, but, again, two firms, 97 percent of the market share, writing analysis reports, voting recommendations that affect the fundamentals of corporate governance, mergers, acquisitions, approval of corporate directors, and shareholder proposals. What is of greatest concern is that these firms are not free of conflicts of interest. For example, in addition to providing recommendations to institutional investors about how to vote, proxy advisory firms may advise companies about corporate governance issues, rate companies on corporate governance, help companies improve those ratings, and advise proponents about how to frame a proposal to get the most votes. They are playing every side of the issue. They are getting every dollar from anybody who cares about the corporate governance space. They play everybody. And if you want access, you pay. I am going to give you an example in just a little bit of one of the hundreds of letters that I have received on this issue. But before I do that, I think it is important to say: What are we asking for? What is the radical idea that we brought to the floor today, which, by the way, had six Democrats’ support? Mr. SCOTT commented about his support as well, and I know he had an issue about the cost that this would have on proxy advisory firms; but the CBO, which I rarely quote, did a study on this and said the cost to proxy advisory firms of this bill is minimal, if 
Upon contacting ISS and seeking explanation on one of the recommendations, we were told there was a firewall between the ISS recommendation group and the ISS group that deals with corporate matters. Ultimately, we were advised that if we were willing to join ISS, which includes payment of a relatively substantial amount of money, we could have input in the recommendations before they were made. 
So, Mr. Speaker, pay for the input. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from Wisconsin. Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Speaker, it goes on to say: 
Meanwhile, during our latest discussions we were again advised that we could avoid some issues by subscribing to ISS corporate services and thereby have some input before such recommendations are published. 
Mr. Speaker, of course, such a subscription would entail big payouts. It goes on to say: 
On the one hand, ISS makes wholly unsupportable, unreasonable, and irrational recommendations regarding corporate elections without investigation, regulatory support, or even contact with the victim company. While, on the other hand, seeking fees from the victim company for the privilege of influencing ISS’s recommendations. 
Mr. Speaker, so what you have here is you have the mafia on the streets. So, lo and behold, your little shop on the street corner gets burglarized at 10 o’clock one night and at 8 o’clock in the morning, and lo and behold, the thugs come in and say: Do you want to buy some insurance? Do you want to buy some protection? Pay up. We will keep you safe. ISS, Glass Lewis, you pay up, and we can help you with your recommendation. We can help you with your ratings. Mr. Speaker, this is thuggery. Let’s have a little commonsense oversight in this space. It is a good bill. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman talked about what is happening in corporate America. They are dancing in the streets after that big tax cut that was just given by my friends on the opposite side of the aisle. As to just a couple of companies—or too few companies—that are doing the advising for these investors, it was just a week or so ago that my friends on the opposite side of the aisle came here representing one company, Berkshire Hathaway, where they were asking this Congress to allow them to charge higher interest rates on the most vulnerable people in our population, with high interest rates and the terrible foreclosure practices all over this manufactured housing that Berkshire Hathaway is selling to these most vulnerable people in our society. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Texas (Mr. ALGREEN ), who is the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I would also like to note that the ranking member, the Honorable MAXINE WATERS , is often the sentinel on watch. She is the person who is there to protect investors. She is there to protect persons who might, but for her absence, be taken advantage of. So I am honored to speak with her and to stand with her. Mr. Speaker, I oppose this bill today because this bill epitomizes what I believe is a business model that allows corporate America to take advantage of investors. This business model is one that has been perpetrated and perpetuated by my colleagues on the other side. This business model is one that surfaced in 2008, when the credit rating agencies became captives of the businesses that were providing the instruments that were to be rated. They were catering to the businesses to the detriment of the investors. I believe this business model is one that allows the fiduciary rule to be compromised. The fiduciary rule simply said that, if you are working on behalf of an investor, you can’t put your interest ahead of the investor’s interest. That rule was compromised by my colleagues on the other side. So today they again come with another business model that will allow investors to be taken advantage of. Caveat emptor is going to apply in a way that it has never been seen before as it will relate to these investors. It is time for us to prevent the business model of allowing investors to be taken advantage of and to present a business model that allows the investor to have the benefit of advice from the proxy. That is what we have currently. Let’s not change the business model. Let’s make sure that the investor is properly protected. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON  LEE.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California for yielding. It is certainly my pleasure to be on the side of the gentlewoman from California. Every time we have got in these fights to attack DoddFrank, she has been on the right side of the issue. So let me clearly, though my voice is a little raspy, speak on behalf of those, as my colleagues have spoken about, of us who certainly have a degree of education and receive those long statements where there are big fights and the print is so small. I will tell you that the proxy advisers are representing not us, but those vulnerable pensioners who put everything they have ever had in that pot, and those advisers give those public pension funds the counsel and advice that is necessary. First of all, this bill is entirely impractical. Pension plans and other institutional investors often hold shares in thousands of public companies. The bill will require proxy advisory firms, who provide voting recommendations to these shareholders, to provide the management with more than 4,000 public companies with the opportunity to present detailed comments on the firm’s draft recommendations before paying shareholders receive a final report. It also wants to burden them with all kinds of extra trinkets that they have to give information about, an unprecedented right to weigh in by the corporations on voting recommendations, executive compensation, nondiscrimination policies. Again, the proxy advisers work with the public pension funds. Who are they? They are the coal miners and the bus drivers. They are, in fact, those teachers, firemen, and policemen. They are Americans who depend upon their pensions. Mr. Speaker, the reason that I wanted to stand on this floor today is, just a few minutes ago, we again voted for this catastrophic tax bill. I wanted to tie this to, as I heard my good friend from Texas, jumping up and celebrating. I assume they will run to the White House when this bill is passed in one way or the other. 
Let me describe to you what I believe is the scenario on the tax bill. We all like cliffhanger movies. Cliffhanger movies always get the family together to be able to tell the story or to sit in the movie and look at the cliffhanger because it is always the heroes that win on a cliffhanger. You are waiting for the hero to launch down and save everyone. Here is the Republican cliffhanger: it is this tax bill, and the cliffhanger is you are going up a mountain. As you go up the mountain, here are the Republicans and this tax bill that is going to take away millions of dollars from Medicaid. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. JACKSON LEE. They are throwing over the cliff the Medicaid recipients, people with dementia. My good friend who has ALS, who is in a wheelchair, thrown over the cliff. They are throwing over teachers. They are throwing over individuals who are believing them that they are going to get jobs, but they are getting no jobs. They are throwing over families, working class families, 86 million of them— throwing them over the cliff. It is not a good ending. It is a tragic ending, and they are standing one by one by one and throwing them over this cliff with this phony tax bill. They are not going to be able to do what is right for those who are truly in need. The benefits for those who are working Americans is temporary, and those of corporations is forever. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  letters from the California Public Employees’ Retirement System, the California State Teachers’ Retirement System, the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System, and the National Conference on Public Employee Retirement Systems. 
over proxy voting. Moreover, the proposed legislation is likely to limit competition by reducing the current number of proxy advisors and imposing additional barriers to entry for potential new firms—again raising costs for investors. Thank you for considering our views on this very important matter. We would be happy to discuss our perspectives with you or your staff at your convenience. Should you have any immediate questions or wish to discuss our concerns, please contact Aeisha Mastagni, Portfolio Manager. Sincerely, ANNESHEEHAN , Director of Corporate Governance. 
OHIOPUBLIC EMPLOYEES  RETIREMENT SYSTEM , Columbus, Ohio, December 15, 2017. DEARREPRESENTATIVE : We are writing on behalf of the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System (OPERS) to oppose HR 4015, the Corporate Governance Reform and Transparency Act of 2017 (Act), a bill that could significantly and negatively impact OPERS’ ability to effectively and efficiently vote its proxies and fulfill its fiduciary obligations. OPERS is the 12th largest public retirement system in the country, with more than one million active, inactive, and retired members, which means that almost one out of every 12 Ohioans has some connection to our System. In order to provide secure retirement benefits for our members, OPERS has invested more than $78 billion in capital markets around the world, including holdings in more than 10,000 public companies. As a fiduciary, OPERS is required to act in the best interests of its members, and this responsibility extends to the prudent management of the investments we make with our members’ retirement contributions. We believe it is our duty to engage with, participate in, and exercise our voting rights for each of public companies in which we are invested in an effort to ensure that those companies continue to generate value for their shareholders. However, with limited time and resources, it is difficult for an investor, even one as sophisticated as OPERS, to fully research every proxy and follow every issue. That is why we have engaged the services of proxy advisory firms—they perform the research and analyses that we cannot, and provide us with impartial voting recommendations that we consider against our own proxy voting guidelines. Without timely access to the reports provided by our proxy advisory firms, it would be significantly more difficult to meet our obligations to our members. We are aware of the criticisms that have been leveled at proxy advisory firms, namely that they wield undue influence over the proxy voting decisions of their clients, but OPERS has taken steps to ensure that this is not the case. Our Board of Trustees has adopted proxy voting guidelines to govern our voting decisions as shareholders. To the extent that a proxy advisory firm report or recommendation conflicts with our proxy voting guidelines, OPERS Corporate Governance staff will closely scrutinize the discrepancies and the firm’s recommendations can be disregarded. Given the sheer necessity of proxy advisory firms and the services they provide, it is troubling that the House of Representatives is considering changes that would erode investor confidence in the impartiality and independence of proxy advisory firm reports. If enacted, the Act would make it harder— perhaps impossible—for OPERS to effectively vote each of the thousands of proxies it receives during any given proxy season. In our view, this constitutes a violation of our duty to our members and the people of Ohio, and is therefore unacceptable We urge you to oppose the Corporate Governance and Transparency Act of 2017. Thank you for your continued support of Ohio’s public retirement systems. If you have questions regarding OPERS’ comments or proxy voting guidelines, please do not hesitate to contact OPERS’ Corporate Governance Officer, Patti Brammer. Sincerely, KAREN CARRAHER , Executive Director. PATTI BRAMMER , Corporate Governmance Officer. 
Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, they are frightened, absolutely frightened, that we could possibly be on the floor today negotiating with the opposite side of the aisle about investment advisers. They can’t understand why it is that we have Members of Congress who do not understand how important it is to have someone protecting the interest of middle class workers all over America. You have heard the reference to the teachers, firefighters, garbage collectors, and on and on and on. These people work every day. They invest in their retirement and they expect their retirement to be taken care of, honored, and not to be basically undermined by corporate interests. So these investment advisers are extremely important to the investors of these retirement systems. Having said that, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4015 is simply the latest effort by Republicans to check off every item on the corporate wish list before the holidays. The bill would empower corporate management at the expense of institutional shareholders, like our Nation’s public pension plans, by allowing corporations to unfairly influence proxy voting recommendations. Because of the size of their portfolios, public pension plans who may hold shares in thousands of companies must rely on proxy advisers to provide independent research and voting recommendations on the merits of proposals. Without the work of proxy advisers, institutional investors would, in practical terms, be left voiceless on corporate matters that are important to them, including governance, board 
compensation, executive pay, and environmental sustainability. H.R. 4015 would give corporate management the unprecedented right to interfere in the relationship between institutional investors and the proxy advisers they hire. At its core, the bill is based on the false premise that shareholders blindly follow the recommendations of proxy advisers who themselves are beholden to activist interests. This belief is directly contradicted by reality. For example, in 2017, the largest proxy advisory firm recommended ‘‘no’’ votes on less than 12 percent of sayonpay proposals, which are nonbinding votes on executive compensation practices required under the Dodd Frank Act. That means they sided with company management 88 percent of the time. When it comes to director elections, the largest proxy firm voted ‘‘yes’’— ‘‘yes’’ votes for 90 out of 100 directors. Proxy advisers understand that the vast majority of companies’ proposals are good for shareholders, but not for all. Mr. Speaker, I ask for a ‘‘no’’ vote on this misdirected bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 2 minutes remaining. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, while I was fascinated to hear so many of my friends on the other side of the aisle exclaim how much they care about working Americans, it just makes we wonder why now twice—twice—in the last 24 hours they have voted against giving the average working American a $2,059 tax cut. Twice now they have voted to deny working Americans tax relief in order to bolster their paychecks. I wonder about that. I also wonder, as I listened to this litany of groups whose letters were entered into the RECORD , how often I heard labor union; government pension; Washington, D.C.; and special interest group. What I didn’t hear about is average working Americans who have their investment in trying to save to buy a home, trying to perhaps fund a small business, or send a kid to college. It is their interest that we are trying to stand up for. So what we know is that the SEC— the Securities and Exchange Commission—have, for all intents and purposes, required investment advisers to use one of two proxy advisory firms, one of which, as my colleague, the author of the bill pointed out, is owned by a foreign labor union. Yet the SEC requires us to use them. So here is the radical nature of the bill: the bill, H.R. 4015, simply says that we ought to have transparency— something apparently my friends across the other side of the aisle are against. We say they have to register with the SEC—something my friends on the other side of the aisle are against. They have to disclose potential conflicts of interest. Apparently my friends on the other side are against that. They have to disclose codes of ethics. Apparently my friends on the other side of the aisle are against that, as well as making their methodologies public. This is a disclosure bill to help investors, pure and simple. We ought to vote in favor of H.R. 4015. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD the following letters: 
AMERICANS FOR FINANCIAL REFORM , Washington, DC, December 18, 2017. DEARREPRESENTATIVE : On behalf of Americans for Financial Reform (AFR), we are writing to urge you to vote against H.R. 4015, the ‘‘Corporate Governance Reform and Transparency Act of 2017’’, which will be considered on the House floor this week. By placing an excessive and unnecessary regulatory burden on proxy advisory firms, this bill would unfairly disadvantage shareholders as compared to firm management, and raise serious First Amendment concerns as well. AFR joins major representatives of shareholders such as the Council of Institutional Investors (CII) and the California Public Employee Retirement System (CALPERS) in opposing this bill. H.R. 4015 would establish a new Federal regulatory scheme for proxy advisory firms. These firms provide institutional investors, including pension funds, with the research and information they need in order to exercise their voting rights as shareholders. The regulations proposed in H.R. 4015 would require proxy advisory firms to provide the management of public companies with detailed voting recommendations relevant to their firms before these recommendations were shown to shareholders who paid for proxy advisory services. Advisory firms would also be required to resolve any complaints from firm management, and employ an ombudsman to ensure that such complaints were addressed. If complaints were not resolved to the satisfaction of firm management, then the full text of complaints from companies would be included next to voting recommendations in proxy advisory reports. Regulations would also mandate extensive disclosure requirements for the details of proxy advisory methodologies, reducing incentives to invest in developing such methodologies. The costs of this regulatory regime would be passed on to investors and pension funds that use proxy advisory services. The regulatory scheme is a transparent attempt to weaken if not eliminate the independence of proxy advisory firms from firm management by placing sharp restrictions on their expression of opinions which differ from those of firm management. Besides raising First Amendment issues, this improperly restricts the ability of shareholders to obtain independent views on how they should exercise their voting rights. This legislation cannot be justified, as some have attempted to do, by any analogy to the regulation of credit rating agencies. Proxy advisory services do not face a fundamental conflict of interest in their business model because they are not paid by securities issuers while providing certification of securities quality to securities investors. They also have not been implicated in massive fraudulent behavior that contributed directly to a global financial crisis. Further, proxy advisory services are clearly recognized as providing opinions regarding voting decisions, in a context where many other such opinions are available, rather than being entities that certify the quality of securities. Any concerns about the independence of proxy advisory services can be addressed by simply requiring such services to register as investment advisors under the Investment Advisors Act. The radical regulatory scheme laid out in H.R. 4015 goes far beyond anything even mentioned in the recent Treasury Department report on capital markets, which examined the issue of proxy advisory firms and recommended only that regulators engage in ‘‘further study and evaluation of proxy advisory firms, including regulatory responses to promote free market principles if appropriate.’’ The regulatory scheme in H.R. 4015, besides being misguided in other ways, certainly does not promote free market principles. The effort in H.R. 4015 to eliminate the independent voice of proxy advisory services should be rejected. We urge you to vote against it. For more information please contact AFR’s Policy Director, Marcus Stanley. Sincerely, AMERICANS FOR FINANCIAL REFORM . 
COUNCIL OF INSTITUTIONAL  INVESTORS , Washington, DC, November 9, 2017. Re Proposed Legislation Relating to Proxy Advisory Firms. Hon. JEBHENSARLING , Chairman, Committee on Financial Services, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. MAXINE WATERS , Ranking Member, Committee on Financial Services, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARMR. CHAIRMAN AND RANKING MEMBER  WATERS : On behalf of the Council of Institutional Investors (CII or the Council) and the undersigned 45 investors and investor organizations, we are writing to express our opposition to legislation that has recently been introduced and is pending in the Committee on Financial Services related to proxy advisory firms. CII is a nonpartisan, nonprofit association of public, corporate and union employee benefit funds, other employee benefit plans, state and local entities charged with investing public assets, and foundations and endowments with combined assets under management exceeding $3 trillion. CII’s member funds include major longterm shareowners with a duty to protect the retirement savings of millions of workers and their families. H.R. 4015, the ‘‘Corporate Governance Reform and Transparency Act of 2017,’’ and similar language which was incorporated in Subtitle Q of Title IV of H.R. 10, ‘‘the Financial CHOICE Act,’’ would require, as a matter of federal law, that proxy advisory firms share their research reports and proxy voting recommendations with the companies about whom they are writing before they are shared with the institutional investors who are their clients. In essence, while the stated goal of the proposed legislation is the ‘‘protection of investors,’’ as the primary customer of proxy advisory firm research, institutional investors believe that adding the new proposed requirements to the industry is unnecessary, overly burdensome and counterproductive. The proposed legislation appears to be based on several false premises, including

b1415 The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 657, the previous question is ordered on the bill, as amended. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. 
Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill? Mr. SARBANES. I am opposed. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to recommit. The Clerk read as follows: 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Maryland is recognized for 5 minutes in support of his motion. Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended. Mr. Speaker, this amendment is about promoting greater transparency and shareholder review of political campaign activity of public corporations. As we have heard, the underlying bill would create new restrictions on proxy advisory firms that would erode their capacity to provide reliable, independent advice to public company investors: institutional investors such as pension funds that serve firefighters, teachers, and police officers. My amendment would restore the ability of advisory firms to provide research and vote recommendations regarding a public company’s spending on political campaign contributions. Over the past half a century, public companies have increasingly entered the political arena, spending huge sums on political contributions and campaign activity. Court rulings like Citizens United and SpeechNOW.org have opened new avenues of influence for corporate America and have worked to amplify the role of public companies in our politics. Mr. Speaker, the public is becoming increasingly anxious about this. 
Fortunately, in recent years, some shareholders and public interest organizations have successfully put pressure on public corporations to adopt shareholder review of corporate political activity, stemming the tide of unchecked political spending from public corporations. Yet the underlying bill would unwind that progress, giving corporations direct influence over proxy advisory firm recommendations to shareholders regarding political activity, knocking down yet another pillar of political accountability in our politics. Mr. Speaker, we need more, not less political accountability from our Nation’s corporations. As this week has shown, corporate America has an outsized influence in our Nation’s public policy. Look no further than today’s vote on the GOP tax scam or yesterday’s further deregulation of some of our Nation’s largest financial institutions. There is no mystery as to why this has happened. A sophisticated corporate influence economy involving campaign contributions, aggressive lobbying, a web of trade associations, corporatebacked think tanks, and outside political organizations has sprung up in Washington to shape who runs for office, who wins office, and the policies we in Congress adopt. Mr. Speaker, Americans hate this system. They hate the arrogance with which monied interests exert their influence on our politics and our government. They feel that their voice, the voice of the people, is ignored while Big Money insiders have their way on Capitol Hill. They want us to change the corrosive status quo. Mr. Speaker, we can take a small step forward with this amendment to restore the American people’s faith in our ability to stand up to corporate power. We should adopt this modest, but important change to an otherwise flawed piece of legislation. At a minimum, we should protect the opportunity for institutional investors to receive independent research and advice when it comes to the political activity of public companies. It is about transparency. It is about accountability. It is about the public interest. Mr. Speaker, to that end, I urge my colleagues to support the motion to recommit, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I listened carefully. I didn’t hear anything about labor union political campaign contributions, known political allies of the Democratic Party. This is yet one more assault on the First Amendment’s freedom of speech by my friends on the other side of the aisle. Mr. Speaker, it ought to be rejected, and I yield back the balance of my time.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and thank somebody who has been a key part of my team since I got elected into House leadership. He is the floor director right now for the whip’s office, Mr. Matt Bravo. Matt Bravo has been with my team and has helped us through some critical key legislative victories, not the least of which is the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act today, helping pass the bills through the floor and helping us get our work done as we whip the bills to make sure we can move the majority’s agenda. Matt has worked for years, Mr. Speaker, not just in the whip’s office for me, he has also worked for former whip and majority leader Eric Cantor. He has worked for the Energy and Commerce Committee. Matt Bravo has dedicated more than 10 years of his life to public service in this institution with honor and integrity. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Matt Bravo is somebody who has the full respect of not only our Members on the House Republican side, he is respected by the Democratic leadership as well and is a key part of our staff and, again, has helped us pass critical legislation. I would call him the best floor director ever. We are going to miss him here. Jennifer and I wish him and his wife, Summer, and their soontobe growing family all the best in their future life. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank him for the time and the public service he has given to this House of Representatives. 
Again, thank you, Mr. Matt Bravo, for the service you have given to all of us. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, will my friend yield? Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER ). Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me. Mr. Speaker, I agree with everything the gentleman said. Maybe he is not the best floor director—I have got a pretty good one myself—but he is a very, very good floor director. Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, we can maybe disagree on that like we disagree on who has the best crabs, but we will enjoy that disagreement. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I was going to say that one of the problems that I have with Mr. Bravo is that he thinks that Louisiana crabs are better than Maryland crabs, but loyalty is an important aspect of our service. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise to join my friend, Mr. SCALISE , the majority whip, and thank Matt Bravo for the leadership that he has given on this floor, and particularly on behalf of my floor staff with whom he has worked very closely, both when he was with Mr. Cantor, with whom I worked very closely, and now Mr. SCALISE , with whom I work closely. We thank him for his service to this House. Every time I rise, I say, whether it is a Democratic or a Republican staffer who works this floor, they work with all of us, and they work in a way that tries to facilitate the doing of the people’s business. They are not always as successful as they would like to be. It is the fault of the Members, not of the staff. They have good plans that go awry because the Members do not cooperate. Mr. Speaker, I would like to tell Matt that I understand that very well. Mr. Speaker, we want to thank Matt for the very collegial, positive, constructive way in which he has worked with my staff, with the leader’s staff, with other staff on this side of the aisle, as well as staff on his side of the aisle to assure that we can, to the best extent possible, work in a constructive way on behalf of the American people. I am sure that Matt will be as successful in future endeavors as he has been here, and, if so, very, very successful indeed. Mr. Speaker, I thank the majority whip for yielding me time, and I wish Matt Bravo the very best. Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the Democratic whip for his kind words and for the way that our offices do work together on those occasions. Frankly, it is most occasions where we are working together on things. Obviously, there are times when we are not; but even in those times, our staffs have a great working relationship and a trust level that is really important to the House getting its business done. Mr. Speaker, I thank the Democratic leader. Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield? Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I would be honored to yield to the chief deputy whip, Mr. MCHENRY . Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend for yielding. Mr. Speaker, it is a special pleasure to come and speak to the career of a great public servant, Matt Bravo. Matt has worked here in the House for 11 years in various roles. He started off as body guy for Leader Cantor when Leader Cantor served as chief deputy whip. In addition to that, he has held various roles in the whip operation, in the leader’s office on the Republican side of the aisle, as well as important work on the Energy and Commerce Committee. Matt Bravo has a great sense of humor, a great love for the game of golf. He is much better at the game of golf than he is at his jokes. We love Matt Bravo. We love teasing him. We love giving him a hard time, but we know his true character. We know how he works intensely to see things through, to grind out the votes to get 218 to pass our agenda. Mr. Speaker, we know Matt will be successful in this next phase of his career. We thank him for his friendship. We thank him for his service to this House. On both sides of the aisle, the respect that he has gained is immense, and we congratulate him on this next phase. Mr. Speaker, we thank Matt for his service in the people’s House, to his government, to the United States of America’s people. We will miss him. Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I would be remiss if I didn’t recognize that Matt’s lovely wife, Summer, is in the balcony, too, and I thank her for the time that she lent him to us and to this great institution. The best of luck to her family and her future with Matt. 
PROTECT BOB MUELLER (Mr. COHEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, today the Republicans showed their values. They showed their values in the tax bill that gave 83 percent of the dollars to the upper 1 percent of the economic strata in this country. They showed their values in giving real estate developers special tax breaks, like President Trump and others, and gave people who are extremely wealthy the opportunity to will more money to their children or whoever they choose than they can today, an $11 million break. It has been sad sitting on the Judiciary Committee and watching the Republicans be aiders and abetters of the President in trying to demean the reputation of one of the finest Americans and public servants I have ever had the opportunity to know, Bob Mueller, and probably with the intention of firing him, something that should wake Republicans up to the fact that our country is in jeopardy. We shouldn’t be doing things that help the Russians get away with efforts to change our elections and interfere with our country’s values. America first, Russia last. Protect Bob Mueller. f 
HEZBOLLAH IS A TERRORIST GROUP AND A CRIMINAL ORGANIZATION (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Hezbollah is not only a terrorist group, it is a criminal organization that funds its terror through drug trafficking, arms dealing, and money laundering. Hezbollah is believed to raise $4 billion to $5 billion, annually, through these criminal activities. Tons of Hezbollah cocaine makes its way into the United States every year, but the past administration refused to designate Iran’s proxy, Hezbollah, as a criminal organization making it possible to prosecute Hezbollah in the United States. They repeatedly delayed and denied DEA requests to investigate and prosecute Hezbollah drug dealing and arms dealing networks. Why? So Iran would not back out of the nuclear deal. In 2016, the White House even let a Hezbollah arms dealer with connections to Putin go free. That is why Representatives COOK, R OSLEHTINEN , and I sent a letter to the President yesterday urging him to designate Hezbollah as a transnational criminal organization and a kingpin entity. No more backroom deals for Iran. We must change course quickly. Every day more illegal money flows into Hezbollah’s coffers. Hezbollah terrorists and criminals ought to be prosecuted. And that is just the way it is. 
GOP TAX BILL IS THE GREATEST TRANSFER OF WEALTH (Mr. BEYER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, the tax bill we passed today has little in common with what Speaker RYAN described to us yesterday. Putting more money into the pockets of working people would be great, but that is not what they wrote this bill to do. I have grown a business, made payroll every 2 weeks for more than 40 years, and invested many millions of dollars in plant and equipment. I still voted ‘‘no,’’ though, because I was just wise enough to realize that without our people, our employees, we have nothing. I would be enthusiastic about a tax bill that actually put more money into their pockets instead of mine. We have 381 hardworking men and women on our payroll today. Not a single one will benefit from the doubling 
of the estate tax exclusion, but every one will be affected by the medical insurance premium rates, which this bill will drive up. Every one will be at risk when their minimal socalled tax cuts expire in just a few years. Mine, by the way, are permanent. Our children and grandchildren will suffer ever more greatly as we continue to balloon the Federal debt. This tax bill may be the greatest transfer of wealth from working Americans to the idle rich in the history of our country. Mr. Speaker, this is a very sad day for the country I love. 
HONORING TWO NAVAJO CODE TALKERS (Mr. BIGGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the lives of two Navajo Code Talkers, George B. Willie Sr. and Teddy Draper Sr., who recently both passed away in my home State of Arizona. While both young men, Mr. Willie and Mr. Draper enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps and valiantly served in World War II in the Battles of Okinawa and Iwo Jima. The Navajo Code Talkers used the Navajo language to transmit and receive messages that could not be translated or intercepted by the Japanese. This unique skill was a great advantage for the United States’ victory in the Pacific theater. In 2001, both Mr. Willie and Mr. Draper were awarded the Congressional Silver Medal for their service and selfless devotion to duty. The sacrifices of Mr. Willie and Mr. Draper and their families during World War II will be remembered for generations. We will be forever grateful for their dedication to our Nation. 
GOP TAX PLAN (Mr. LOWENTHAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, the tax bill passed by the House GOP today embodies everything that Americans dislike about Congress: It was drafted behind closed doors where the drafters cast aside expert analysis and relied instead on special interests and faulty disproven assumptions. The plan slashes tax rates for multinational corporations and the superwealthy, but leaves hardworking Americans in the 47th Congressional District to pay the bill. It penalizes taxpayers in California and other blue States for investing in our schools, in our roads, and in our public services. It cruelly hits children, seniors, and lowincome Americans by putting at risk Medicare, Medicaid, SNAP, and Social Security. Mr. Speaker, I could not, and proudly did not, vote for this disastrous piece of legislation. f 
UNION COUNTY FREEHOLDER VERNELL WRIGHT RETIRES (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor a public servant from my district in Union County, New Jersey, Freeholder Vernell Wright, on the occasion of her retirement. Freeholder Wright began her career in public service in 1966 as a title 1 teacher at Jefferson School in Union Township, New Jersey. For 36 years, she helped educate the county’s public schoolchildren. In 2012, the people of Union Township sent their beloved educator to represent them on the Union County Board of Chosen Freeholders. Freeholder Wright’s legacy as an elected official is best characterized by her unselfish devotion to the constituents whom she represents. As recognition for her dedicated work and selfless service, she has been awarded New Jersey’s Freeholder of the Year Award and Union County’s Chester Holmes Humanitarian Award. Freeholder Wright is a model for the next generation of public servants. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me and the people back in Union County tonight at a dinner to honor Freeholder Wright’s lifetime of service. I am honored to be her Member of Congress. God bless Freeholder Wright. 
b1915 HONORING THE LIFE OF LORIMER ARENDSE, PRINCIPAL OF GRAND PRAIRIE HIGH SCHOOL (Mr. VEASEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Lorimer Arendse, the principal of Grand Prairie High School, who lost his battle with stage IV lung cancer on December 15. Never shy about sharing his hatred for school during his formative years, Lorimer found his passion for academics once he met and fell in love with his wife, Jeanelle, while attending Grace College in Warsaw, Indiana. Upon graduating Grace College, Lorimer continued his passion for education upon earning his master’s degree in educational administration from Ashland University. From there, he began his career in education as a math teacher and advanced to assistant principal. In 2013, Lorimer was named principal of the Young Men’s Leadership Academy at Kennedy Middle School in Grand Prairie. In 2014, he was named principal of Grand Prairie High School. Although his time with us was short, let us all be encouraged by his final lesson: treat each other with kindness. Be respectful. Be courteous. Be what a Gopher is. At this time, I ask my colleagues to join me in extending their prayers to Principal Lorimer Arendse’s family and the Grand Prairie High School community. f 
CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF COUNCILMAN PETER BROWN (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to celebrate the life of a dear friend, the Honorable Peter Brown, former council member at large for the city of Houston. Tomorrow he will be memorialized in Houston, Texas. It saddens me that I will not be able to join him and his family and the many, many Houstonians and friends who will come to honor him. The reason is because Peter Brown was Houston’s chief champion. He loved Houston. He loved to talk about mobility in Houston. Even before most Houstonians understood the value of the light rail system, Peter Brown was on the forefront. He was an architect, and he understood beauty and planning. He had a humorous and wonderful touch, but he also was serious and stern when it came to planning and the environment. Peter Brown wanted to see Houston as it is and as it continues to be a world class city. Before we spoke of greenery and all the things that make a city great, the parks, green space, Peter Brown was doing so. Peter Brown was also a dear friend to me, my family, and so many others. He lost his battle just about 10 days ago to a terrible and vicious disease. But as I visited Peter, I can assure you that on the occasions I went to see him, he was always thinking about others and thinking about the city, thinking about our State and the Nation, always sharing, but fighting his fight. To his family and his children and to the people who love him, I just simply want to say: tonight and tomorrow we honor a great American, a friend to us all. He may be from Houston, Texas, but if you got a chance to know him, you would love him, too. Mr. Speaker, I ask for a moment of silence in honor of the Honorable Peter Brown. 
HEALTHCARE AND LITTLE LOBBYISTS (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to defend our Nation’s children. The GOP tax scam repeals the provision assuring all families have health 
insurance access. Nonpartisan experts estimate 13 million fewer Americans will be insured because of the Republican repeal, including millions of children. Yesterday I met with families from the Little Lobbyists. I was struck by Laura Hatcher’s story of her child and her emotion when she learned about the passage of the Affordable Care Act. She burst into tears. She knew her son, who has cerebral palsy, could gain insurance with no fear of discrimination due to preexisting conditions. Ms. Hatcher urged yesterday that America must turn from its destructive and immoral path. She said: We are here to show what access to affordable, quality healthcare and programs like Medicaid mean for our families. These programs that the Republican Congress intends to cut to fund tax breaks to wealthy heirs and corporations are the difference between our children having a future or being forced back into institutions reminiscent of a Dickens novel. This is wrong. Mr. Speaker, Members of Congress were elected to protect and defend the American people, not put families like the Hatchers at risk because of the Republican’s billionaire tax bill. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  Laura Hatcher’s remarks: 
LAURA HATCHER REMARKS  Thank you Leader Pelosi for inviting the Little Lobbyists here today to speak on behalf of families of children with complex medical needs. It’s the holidays and the Muppet version of ‘‘A Christmas Carol’’ has been on repeat at my house. We’re all big Muppet fans and my 11–yearold son Simon loves music, silliness, and a sweet story. I also think another reason Simon likes the movie so much is because he identifies with the character ‘‘Tiny Tim.’’ It’s easy to see the resemblance. Like Tim, Simon is sweet and kind, he loves Christmas, he even sits by the fireplace and sings sometimes. Dickens doesn’t identify Tiny Tim’s diagnosis, but I imagine he might have had cerebral palsy like Simon. Simon has trouble walking and like Tim, he wears braces to support his legs. Though I miss him being little enough to carry on my shoulders the way Bob Cratchit carries Tiny Tim, Simon still loves to be held and hugged. And I do hug him all the time, as often as I can. Because, like the Cratchits, due to another rare disease we don’t yet understand, we Hatchers don’t know how long we’ll have Simon with us. I also find it’s strikingly easy to draw another analogy between ‘‘A Christmas Carol’’ (Muppet version included), and what’s happening in our lives right now. In the story, the miserly Ebenezer Scrooge is warned that his decisions have farreaching consequences that impact many people. The same can be said of the decisions being made by Congress today. The choices they’re making, like whether or not to pass this tax bill, have far reaching consequences for us all. It is for this reason my family has been coming to Capitol Hill with the Little Lobbyists since July. Our government seemed to turn away from protecting people with disabilities and complex medical needs, like my little boy, and began trying to take away the legal protections and programs my son’s life and my family’s future depend on. Lately it seems like everything is under threat—accessibility, education, and health care. It was less than 10 years ago that the passage of the Affordable Care Act made sure that people with preexisting conditions, like my Simon, would always have the right to health care. It promised families like mine could not be cut off by insurers and forced into bankruptcy because our child’s health care was just too expensive. It expanded Medicaid, including waiver programs, so more kids like Simon can have access to the therapy, health care, and inclusion programs they need to survive and thrive in their communities. I remember the exact moment it passed—I was in the grocery store and I burst into tears of relief when my husband texted me with the news. After years of worrying every single day about how we’d be able to care for our sweet boy in the future, it finally seemed like things were going to be okay. Living with that knowledge has been a huge gift for a family like ours, who routinely deal with life and death situations most families can’t imagine. But since this summer there have been multiple attempts to repeal the ACA, including as a part of this Tax Bill. Nonpartisan experts have told us that 13 million people will lose access to health insurance if it passes. Once the ACA is weakened, protection for people with preexisting conditions will become too costly to afford. Very soon, I could once again be facing a future where I don’t know how I’ll be able to care for my child. This is a thought I simply find too difficult to bear. And all of this is happening against the advice of experts. Without the input of those it will impact. It makes one wonder who our government is listening to, if not us. According to lobbying disclosure forms, this tax bill was written with the input of over 6,000 (real, not little) lobbyists. Some representatives have even said publicly that their donors have told them to ‘‘get it done, or else.’’ Or else. We parents of medically complex kids understand consequences. We know what will happen if this tax bill passes, if our country does not turn from this destructive and immoral path. And so, here we are. We are the ghosts of ‘‘Christmas present.’’ We are here to show legislators what access to affordable, quality health care and programs like Medicaid mean for our families. These programs, that Congress intends to cut to fund tax breaks to wealthy heirs and corporations, are literally the difference between our children having a future in their homes and communities, or being forced back into institutions reminiscent of a Dickens’ novel. This is wrong. We’re also here to show everyone that kids with complex medical needs and disabilities are just kids. They love to play, they love to learn, they love the Muppets. And as Americans they deserve to have a government that protects them. Today, as a mother and as a voice of conscience, I’m asking everyone that can hear me that can see these children—please protect them. Help us make sure that Christmases yet to come are even more joyful than those past. God bless us, everyone. f 
THE INFAMOUS TRUMP TOWER MEETING (Mr. HUFFMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, June 9, 2016, was the date of the infamous Trump Tower meeting with at least five Russians with Kremlin ties. That date is about the only constant in a tangled web of lies we have heard from Team Trump. When Donald Trump, Jr., was first asked about this meeting, he said it was just about adoption, not a campaign issue. But he changed his tune when the New York Times revealed emails showing it was all about the campaign; in fact, an offer to get damning information on Hillary Clinton as ‘‘part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump. . . .’’ Now, Donald Trump, Jr.’s, response to this illegal offer says it all: ‘‘. . . if it is what you say, I love it. . . . ’’ We may never know how much collusion was set in motion at this meeting, but we do know two things: First, Team Trump has repeatedly misled us, concealing it from security clearance forms, issuing a false statement dictated by President Trump himself. Second, the Russians did go on to produce a massive cache of stolen emails and helped the Trump campaign in other ways. These are damning facts, Mr. Speaker, and there are many more to come. We need to find out what else they lied about and what else they are hiding. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. KUSTOFF of Tennessee). Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. 
CONGRATULATING AMSTERDAM RADIO LEGEND SAM ZURLO ON HIS RETIREMENT (Mr. TONKO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Amsterdam radio legend, Sam Zurlo, on his retirement this week. For over 60 years, Sam’s voice has greeted the residents and visitors of Montgomery County, New York. Sam has been working in broadcasting since 1953. Now at 82, he hosts the longest running talk show in the history of the county. Sam’s broadcasting career was born from his service with Armed Forces Radio in Germany, where he delivered a nightly broadcast for 3 years. Sam also worked as a print journalist for the Schenectady Gazette for some 35 years. Decade after decade, his distinctive voice has been the catalyst for free and open debate. He has brought an air of familiarity and of community to our humble corner of upstate New York. Listening to conversations about current events with Sam has always made the abstractions of politics a little more real. Sam’s personality has inspired many and brought light, comfort, and connection to countless neighbors and friends. Mr. Speaker, I thank Sam Zurlo for his years of exceptional work and a legendary career in local journalism. I wish him the best for an equally special retirement. 
THE GOP TAX SCAM (Mr. RYAN of Ohio asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, what a day in Washington, D.C. We have many Republicans in this town saying: What a great day it is for the American people; what a great Christmas for America. The average family—63 percent in America—can’t withstand a $500 emergency. With this tax cut, Apple is going to get $47 billion and Donald Trump’s family is going to get $1 billion. They are going to toss out a few crumbs to working class families who work 60, 70 hours a week, and the fat cats in Washington and Wall Street are going to run off with the whole pot of gold. Whatever happened in this country where we said, To whom much is given, much is expected? We need to challenge the wealthy corporations. They are sitting on $4 trillion worth of cash. If they want to start a factory, buy a machine, or hire workers, they could do it now. They don’t need to take it from the middle class. 
PROJECT CASSANDRA The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. JODYB. H ICE) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. 
Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia? There was no objection. Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to speak on an issue that is just now beginning to gain momentum and traction. Already, this issue of great importance is bringing great alarm and concern, as well as focus. I speak specifically in regard to the Obama administration’s apparent decision to sacrifice the opportunity to take down Hezbollah and bring terrorists to justice. What most Americans know about Hezbollah is that it is an Iranbacked proxy militia based in Lebanon, which was responsible for a string of terrorist attacks against Americans in the 1980s, including the attack in 1983 of the Beirut barracks, which killed 241 American servicemembers. Since that time, Hezbollah has openly attacked Israel. They have propped up regimes supported by Iran, like Bashar alAssad in Syria. They are defined by their violence and human rights abuses. But what most Americans are not aware of, Mr. Speaker, is that over the last 30 years, Hezbollah has evolved beyond its origins as Iran’s attack dog in the Middle East and they now run one of the world’s most expansive and dangerous multinational criminal networks in the world. Hezbollah works directly with corrupt governments, like Venezuela and others, to create criminal networks across Latin America, Africa, Europe, and the Middle East. They have literally moved tons—metric tons—of cocaine across the world, laundered money, and trafficked weapons and individuals. They are a critical part of a network responsible for the use of IEDs in the Middle East, which have killed literally thousands of American soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan. Hezbollah, Mr. Speaker, is a scourge not only in the Middle East, but throughout the entire world. The reason we know this—which has just, in recent days, started to become public— is because, in 2008, the DEA launched a campaign known as Project Cassandra, which amassed evidence over 8 years of investigation regarding Hezbollah’s criminal activities. They used wiretaps, undercover operations, informants, and so forth to map Hezbollah’s illicit networks with the help of some 30 different U.S. and foreign security agencies. These DEA agents traced the activities all the way to the inner circles of Hezbollah and its state sponsors in Iran. But—and here is where all of this starts coming into play—when the time came to extradite and prosecute these terrorists, the Obama administration’s Department of Justice and Department of State refused to move forward. That is unthinkable to me. It is unthinkable to many people in our country. The Justice Department refused to file criminal charges against suspects that were already in custody in Europe. The State Department refused to put meaningful pressure on allied countries to extradite Hezbollah leaders to the United States. Why? Why did they refuse to get involved? According to an Obama administration Treasury official, in her written testimony to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, investigations to Hezbollah were tapped down for fear of rocking the boat with Iran and jeopardizing the nuclear deal. b1930 The nuclear deal is already deeply, deeply flawed in so many ways. The Iran nuclear deal apparently took precedence over crippling a foreign terrorist organization directly responsible for the deaths of American citizens and one of the world’s largest drug and weapons trafficking networks. Hezbollah is responsible for procuring parts for Iran’s nuclear and ballistic missile program, the very program that the nuclear deal was supposed to curtail. Hezbollah is supplying parts to them. Instead of prosecuting the leadership of Hezbollah and shutting down Iran’s weapons pipeline, the Obama administration legitimized Iran’s nuclear program and let Hezbollah leadership slip through the cracks and let them totally off the hook. After the conclusion of the Iran nuclear deal, the Obama administration shut down Project Cassandra. We lost all that we had gained in 8 years of investigations—all the information. We had them in our grasp, Mr. Speaker, after 8 years of investigation. We lost unprecedented insight into these global criminal networks. Mr. Speaker, this is morally reprehensible. It is stunning that we had our previous administration and that administration’s Justice Department and State Department evidently involved, engaged, and deliberately letting these criminals off the hook. How in the world can our allies in the global war on terror trust us when we won’t prosecute terrorists when we have the chance to do so? How can our allies in Latin America trust us when we refuse to prosecute leaders of one of the world’s largest drug trafficking networks? I have a few colleagues here tonight who are going to address this issue as well. Before I introduce the first one, I want to bring up one more point. Ali Fayad is a suspected leader in Hezbollah. He is an operative and a major weapons supplier. He has been indicted on charges of planning the murders of U.S. citizens, attempting to provide materiel support to a terrorist organization and attempting to acquire, transfer, and use antiaircraft missiles. For nearly 2 years, this terrorist was held in custody in the Czech Republic. For 2 years, the Obama administration failed to provide enough pressure to the Czech Republic, our NATO ally. The Obama administration refused to put pressure to extradite that terrorist to the United States. Ali Fayad now, as we speak here tonight, is a free man and alleged to be back in the business of arming militants in Syria. This is inexcusable. Mr. Speaker, I want to personally thank those who served on Project Cassandra for their service to our Nation and for the work they did. I want them to know that what they did mattered. I am appalled that the Obama administration did virtually nothing to stop Hezbollah’s criminal activities. I think this warrants an investigation by the U.S. House of Representatives, and that is what this Special Order tonight is all about: getting to the bottom of what is yet another example of a swamp that stinks to high heaven that needs to be cleaned up and drained out. We need an investigation into what happened in the Obama administration, the Department of Justice, and the Department of State in allowing these 
terrorists and this terrorist network to get off the hook. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. BIGGS), a good friend. He has been a leader in issues such as this, bringing to our attention both the highlighting of dangerous, harmful activity such as this tonight. He has been a great champion. Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Georgia for yielding. This is a very important topic. I am going to touch on this by beginning with this idea of the distinction between the current administration and its foreign policy as outlined in the recent statement from President Trump and that of the previous administration. The distinction is very clear. The previous administration basically clung to an idea of neoliberal institutionalism. That is to say, where there was a vacuum of power, we did not set the stage. America did not fill it. It remained a vacuum, with the idea being that an institution would fill that. Maybe the United Nations, maybe some other regional institution. But in doing so, we ceded over much of our sovereignty and failed to act to preserve and protect America’s best interests. The current administration has taken a more realistic point of view. They are realists. That is, America’s interests will be first and paramount. We will see to it, we will foster alliances, and we will foster participation with our fellow nations to preserve America’s best interests. When America is strong, there is a greater chance for peace in the world. I believe that. That is the position of realists all the way back to Hans Morgenthau. Even neorealists like Kenneth Waltz might agree. One thing that we know is that this particular episode that unfolds is a scandalous episode that put America in greater danger, probably, and perhaps, in order to foster political gains by the previous administration. One Treasury Department official who served in the Obama administration testified to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs that, under the Obama administration, these Hezbollahrelated investigations were tamped down for fear of rocking the boat with Iran and jeopardizing the nuclear deal. That becomes the heart and the rationale for how the previous administration handled a political decision instead of a foreign policy national security decision. We know a number of things that took place, and this is why the House needs to conduct its own investigation: so we can know how this played out, why this played out, who is responsible, and we can resolve never to do this again. We had Project Cassandra. This was a DEA campaign designed to expose a money laundering scheme in which Latin American drugrunning was being funneled to Hezbollah. Hezbollah is a proIranian Lebanese malitia and has been a foreign terrorist organization since 1987, and so designated. It fosters alliances with rogue nations such as North Korea, Iran, and is violently antiIsrael and antiUnited States. It has become a player in international cocaine trafficking—using the proceeds of that drug trafficking to purchase explosives, EFPs, which is the deadliest type of IED used against American soldiers in Iraq. EFPs killed hundreds of American soldiers, and they were supplied by the Iranian Government and its Hezbollah allies. EFPs were literally ripping M1 Abrams tanks in half. It is a weapon that makes all the armor protection they have irrelevant. Mere threats of EFPs shut down all ground supply routes near American bases on the Iranian border. The result: cut off the head or the financing of Hezbollah through these international cocaine distribution routes. Project Cassandra was born in 2008. It found clear evidence that Hezbollah had grown from a Middle Eastfocused military and political organization into an international crime syndicate, likely collecting somewhere in the neighborhood of $1 billion a year from drug and weapons trafficking, money laundering, and other criminal activities. For 8 years, DEA agents conducted highstakes investigations—dangerous investigations—using technology as well as undercover operations and informants. That type of capital is expensive and dangerous. The result was to map these illicit drug networks. They did this with the help of 30 U.S. and foreign security agencies. They saw worldwide, far flung international drug trafficking from South America to Africa, from Europe to the Middle East, and in the United States, where drug funds were funneled through an array of businesses, including used car lots. What happened? As we saw the previous administration’s desire and design to leave a signature legacy foreign policy win, the negotiations for the Iran nuclear deal got going and were in place. Project Cassandra’s agents say the Justice and Treasury Departments repeatedly hindered their attempts to pursue these investigations—the prosecutions, arrests, and financial sanctions against the key figures in this farreaching drug scheme. This was a policy decision. It was a systematic decision. David Asher is quoted as saying: ‘‘They serially ripped apart this entire effort that was very well supported and resourced, and it was done from the top down.’’ They didn’t bring criminal charges. They didn’t continue to pursue these Hezbollah members or the banks that were laundering those billions in drug profits. Instead, they tore down the apparatus that was working on apprehending the head of the snake. Well, we are going to go on with this. We need to go on with this. We need to investigate this further. This type of political decision that impacts and actually works crosswise to our very purpose in the Middle East must be stopped, and we must find out why that happened. Those who allowed our men and women to be put in harm’s way for a political decision need to be held accountable. So, Mr. Speaker, those who cling to the neoliberal institutionalist mantra, who rely on multilateral institutions rather than putting America first, are the ones who produced this result. We are going to find out more in the coming weeks. My request is that the leadership in Congress, in this House of Representatives, instigate and prosecute an investigation to get to the bottom of this very heinous and very wrongheaded and dangerous decision. I thank the gentleman for allowing me to participate and for his lead on this tonight. Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, this highlights the importance of the issue that we are dealing with and the need for an investigation. Hundreds, even thousands, of lives have been put in danger, not to mention our own Nation’s national security interests. Next up is a tremendous leader, not only here in Congress, but in our military. He is a general who has done an outstanding job. I don’t know that anyone understands the importance of the issue any more than my good friend. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. PERRY ). I am honored to have him here addressing this issue. Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. JODY B. HICE), my good friend. I thank him for bringing this issue to the attention of the Congress and for this Special Order. When I was growing up, Mr. Speaker, I believed that my government would do all it could to stop crime from happening in the community I lived in, including drug use. b1945 I have always been, my whole life, an ardent opponent of drug use. I have never used drugs, but yet I have seen the ravages and the devastation in the community I live in of this. You just knew in your heart that your government—the police, so on and so forth— were stopping those kind of things. Then years later, as I grew up and was privileged to serve in uniform, I ended up going to Iraq. I got a briefing on this new type of weapon that was being used in Iraq called an EFP, an explosively formed penetrator, for which we had very little defense. There were other kinds of IEDs, whether they were used with a cell phone or a pressure plate or whatever, but these things were particularly grave because 
we didn’t have anything to stop them. We all knew, from the briefing, that they were coming from Iran. And, of course, we thought, wearing the uniform, that our government would do everything it could to protect the servicemembers who were in harm’s way and to protect our national security. That includes making sure that we got to the bottom of these EFPs, where they were coming from, and prosecuting and persecuting those who were providing them. So imagine my surprise and my dismay just a few short days ago reading an article from a publication here in Washington, D.C., that outlined how our government, essentially, sanctioned not only the use of these EFPs from Iran in Iraq and Afghanistan, but, essentially, allowed for them to be paid for and enabled the paying for them. There was this operation ongoing called Operation Cassandra to root out drugs coming into the United States being supplied by Hezbollah, a client of Iran. While this was ongoing, this nuclear agreement concern came into being. It was, apparently, so important that all of the work that was done in Operation Cassandra to stop these drugs from coming into the United States, that had to stop because we didn’t want to irritate, we didn’t want to disrespect, we didn’t want to insult the Iranians when they were so close to getting a nuclear deal. So we said, well, all these people have been working on this for years— this Operation Cassandra—to identify these people from Iran who were using this operation of selling drugs, illicitly moving stolen cars, and laundering money to then sell drugs into the United States and Europe, but also to use that money that they got from selling the drugs and the used cars to make these EFPs, to send them to Iraq, to send them to Afghanistan to kill American soldiers. That all had to stop because, heaven forbid, we can’t offend Iran. We can’t offend Iran. Now, I will tell you this, Mr. Speaker. Nuclear war is a grave issue and it is worth a lot. If we have to stop nuclear war and give up some things to do that, I get it, I get it completely. There are no second chances with nuclear war. Once the bomb goes off, it is over. So if you have to give a little bit to get something on that, that is something even I could understand, even though I find some of it objectionable. Where I come into conflict is this, Mr. Speaker. There is no question, at this point, whether Iran will have a nuclear weapon. There is no reason to be testing ballistic missiles except to deliver a nuclear weapon. They are not delivering leaflets, Mr. Speaker. They are going to deliver a nuclear weapon with that, which is why they are testing it. There is no reason to have centrifuges. There is no reason to enrich to the level that Iran is except to create a nuclear weapon. We don’t need that to have a nuclear power plant, which is what Iran says it wants to do. And, of course, we all know, since the Ayatollah took over and took American hostages back in the day that Iran is a known liar. That is what they do. They lie. They obfuscate. They just say one thing and do another. It is not a question of if they will have a nuclear weapon, Mr. Speaker; it is a question of when. So what we did here was we said, look, let’s not offend the Iranians. Even though they are killing Americans on the battlefield, and even though they are killing Americans in your hometown by selling drugs to them—and the two are working towards each other; they are selling drugs and using that money to buy the articles of war, the implements of war that are killing Americans—it is okay. We are going to allow that to happen as long as we delay Iran from having a nuclear weapon for 15 years. That is exactly what it looks like. Now, I didn’t do the investigative reporting. It is, I think, 14,000 words, so it is pretty indepth. But I will tell you this. It is being discredited out there. These are a couple of rogue employees who just disagreed with the policy. Mr. Speaker, the Drug Enforcement Agency agent on the case, who has over 20 years of government experience tracking the financing of terror networks, said this of the leader of Hezbollah: 
I had no clue who he was, but this guy was sending money into Iraq to kill American soldiers. 
The point is he had 20 years on the job. This wasn’t some piker who just showed up on the job at Treasury and said: ‘‘Hey, track this money and see what you can find.’’ This is a guy who did this for a living for 20 years, and he ran into Hezbollah. He ran into Hezbollah, based on his investigation. And then they tracked him. They tracked the money. They tracked the drugs—not just a little bit, tons—tons of drugs coming into the United States, literally at a time when we have 60,000 Americans dying, annually, of drug overdose. That is more people than we lost in Vietnam, Mr. Speaker, in the whole time of Vietnam. A year, that is how many are dying in America based on drug overdose. These people tracked it. They tracked the weapons on the other side, and they were told to stand down. They went to get these guys. They had one in custody in Prague. He was arrested. The United States wanted him extradited and prosecuted. Do you know where he is right now, Mr. Speaker? He is back on the battlefield because we let him go. So not only did Iran get to sell drugs in the United States and kill American citizens in your hometown, but they used that money to then make EFPs to kill the soldiers from your hometown who went to defend America’s freedom. And, oh, by the way, in less than 15 years now, you can expect Iran to be a nuclear armed power. Mr. Speaker, if nothing else, if absolutely nothing else happens here from this, we need to have hearings on this in both the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Oversight and Government Reform Committee to make sure that this never ever can happen again, that we don’t trade the safety of the lives of American servicemembers overseas and American citizens at home for a bad deal overseas of something that we are never really going to be able to reconcile with, which is a nucleararmed Iran. We are going to have very few options at stopping them, like we do with North Korea right now. That is where we are headed. We will not only have North Korea to deal with, but we will also have a nucleararmed Iran. That circumstance can never happen again, which is why hearings are so critical, so that we get to the truth, so that we get to the bottom of this, so that there are no skeletons in the closet, Mr. Speaker, so we understand who did what for why, so we can rationalize was this worth it or was this just political expedience. We need to know that so that we learn from that, so that we never make those mistakes again. Mr. Speaker, again, I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. JODY B. HICE). I appreciate his interest in this topic, as I am, and bringing it to the floor. Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman so much. I just think it is critically important that in a Special Order such as this we have someone who has been there, on the front line, who knows exactly from the perspective of a soldier defending our country what has been taking place. I appreciate his expertise and his willingness to talk about it here this evening. Another colleague who is going to address the seriousness of the issue this evening is KENBUCKfrom Colorado, a good friend and another leader on this issue and many others like this. The American people deserve to know what happened. The dots are coming into play. The dots are being connected. We need to finish connecting those dots to find out what went on and let the American people know. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. BUCK). Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague, Representative Jody Hice, for the opportunity to speak this evening on such an important issue. We are here today to discuss the recent revelations that the Obama administration, in their pursuit of the Iran deal, blocked important efforts by U.S. law enforcement officials to fight the terrorist organization Hezbollah. The past administration’s treatment of Iran reveals an imprudent and negligent approach to American foreign policy that must never be repeated. We see in their actions, at best, an incompetence born of a lack of clarity and information and, at worst, an administration determined to create a false foreign policy legacy so that America’s 
best interests were thrown to the wayside. In a recent report from Politico mentioned by some of my colleagues already, we have learned that the Obama administration allegedly blocked efforts by U.S. law enforcement officials to fight Hezbollah’s transnational drug and weapons trafficking operations. Hezbollah, Iran’s terrorist proxy organization, has also become one of the world’s most powerful and dangerous criminal organizations, receiving over $1 billion every year from their illicit activities. We have learned that, through an expansive criminal trafficking network, they funnel cocaine throughout the Middle East, Europe, Africa, Latin America, and the United States. It has also come to light that Hezbollah launders millions of dollars through schemes involving used car purchases in the United States, and, ultimately, the money earned through these activities can be used for violent terrorist activities aimed at spreading fear and pain throughout the world. Politico quoted the following from a confidential DEA report on Hezbollah’s criminal activities: Hezbollah ‘‘has leveraged relationships with corrupt foreign government officials and transnational criminal actors . . . creating a network that can be utilized to move metric ton quantities of cocaine, launder drug proceeds on a global scale, and procure weapons and precursors for explosives.’’ It ‘‘has at its disposal one of the most capable networks of actors coalescing elements of transnational organized crime with terrorism in the world.’’ The DEA’s acting deputy administrator in 2016 stated that Hezbollah’s criminal operations ‘‘provide a revenue and weapons stream for an international terrorist organization responsible for devastating terror attacks around the world.’’ Certainly, an organization like that deserves America’s utmost scrutiny; and for years, the men and women of the Drug Enforcement Administration’s Project Cassandra poured their lives into investigating Hezbollah’s criminal activities. These agents tracked financial transactions, cultivated sources, and trailed operatives. But, in several cases, when the DEA asked for prosecutions, arrests, or sanctions, President Obama’s Department of Justice delayed or denied their requests. The State Department also reportedly declined to demand the extradition of important suspects who could have aided the investigation and spearheaded the downfall of this international operation. Unfortunately, thanks to multiple sources involved in the matter now coming forward, we have learned that the Obama administration likely stalled the Hezbollah investigations and prosecutions in order to keep Iran happy and nuclear deal talks on the table. If the DEA rocked the boat by arresting and charging key members of Hezbollah’s drug and weapons trafficking operations, then Iran might walk away from the negotiating table. This thinking reveals a fundamental blindness to reality. Hezbollah is funded by Iran. Hezbollah is Iran. While negotiating with Iran, the former administration turned a blind eye to Hezbollah’s extensive criminal activities that were only worsening the drug crisis here in the United States and feeding weapons to terrorists in the Middle East region. American foreign policy can be pragmatic, but this was not pragmatism. This was foolishness. U.S. foreign policymakers traded an end to Iran’s nuclear program for the protection of Iran’s terrorist program. And even then, we can’t even trust Iran to abide by the agreement meant to end their nuclear program. So we are left with a bad deal. I have said it many times before. But now we know the deal is even worse than we suspected. Aside from just delivering pallets of cash to Iran, aside from just freeing billions in frozen assets, aside from just lifting important sanctions, we are also giving a transnational criminal organization and terrorist network free rein over the world. We are here today to affirm to the world that Iran and its affiliated terrorist organization, Hezbollah, are enemies of the free world. We should never negotiate with terrorists. I urge President Trump and America’s law enforcement community to once again turn its attention to Hezbollah. This terrorist organization has spread its evil influence throughout the world, and we have a duty to fight it. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the gentleman from Georgia, for this opportunity today, and I thank him for bringing this issue up and shining some light on this important subject. Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative BUCK in his leadership on this, as well. Mr. Speaker, I just want to say, not only to Mr. BUCK, but to all of the participants in our discussion this evening, a big thank you for coming and being a part of this. As more information is beginning to come to light, I am convinced that we are just at the tip of the iceberg of gaining information as to what has taken place here that has jeopardized our national security. I believe it is incumbent upon Congress at this time to fulfill the obligation that we have to exercise oversight over the executive branch and follow through with a thorough investigation of the Obama administration’s refusal—absolute refusal—to follow through on the work that was done by the DEA. b2000 We had these terrorists in our grasp, Mr. Speaker, and we let them go. How could this happen? The American people deserve to know why, and we need to get to the bottom of this. That is why tonight we are calling for an investigation into all aspects of this Hezbollah scandal, regardless of where it leads us: to the very top of the Obama administration, the Secretary of State, the previous Department of Justice, wherever it may lead. We need to get to the bottom of this, and we are calling for an investigation. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. f 
ROBERT MUELLER SMEAR CAMPAIGN The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to be organizing this special hour on behalf of the minority. We are going to be talking tonight about the growing smear campaign against Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating contacts between Russians interfering in our Presidential election in 2016 and Americans. What we have seen over the last several weeks is a rising tide of criticism of Mr. Mueller in attempts to undermine and sabotage the special counsel investigation. We are going to be talking about all the different components of this attack, and we are going to be asking the question: Why? Why suddenly is Mr. Mueller, who was once a hero to our friends across the aisle, a decorated Vietnam war veteran, former Director of the FBI, former U.S. Attorney for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the State of California, a celebrated law enforcement figure, and a registered Republican—why suddenly has he come under withering attack by everyone from our colleagues across the aisle in the House, to Republicans in the Senate, to people in the White House, to FOX News? Why has the whole rightwing propaganda machine turned on Mr. Mueller in the special counsel investigation suddenly? And what is it that we can do to try to prevent an assault on the special counsel in an effort to dismantle the special counsel investigation? To begin tonight, I am going to call on a colleague from Florida (Mrs. DEMINGS ), who is an extraordinary freshman class Member in the House of Representatives representing the people of Florida. She was the chief of police in Orlando, Florida, before she came to Congress; so she has exceptional law enforcement experience and a whole career in law enforcement. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. DEMINGS .) Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Maryland. I thank him for his leadership on this issue and shining a light on this very important issue tonight. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to speak about the promise of America: that 
every person living in this country, a country that we say is the greatest country in the world, where every person can have an opportunity, where every person can have a right to life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness, and the pursuit of justice. The promise of America, though, relies on the police officer who walks his beat, come rain or shine. Mr. Speaker, either we enforce our laws, or, if we do not, they are just words on a piece of paper. The promise of America is fulfilled every time a person receives a fair trial. For you see, without a fair minded search for the truth, we have no society. Or, Mr. Speaker, put it another way, the truth will, indeed, set us free. The special counsel is a decorated veteran. You have heard my colleague say it, a registered Republican appointed by a Republican President, President Bush. I have personally met Mr. Mueller. After serving 27 years in law enforcement, working very closely with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, I know him to be a person of honor and integrity. Mr. Mueller has been praised for his integrity by every Republican leader. You see, he is, Mr. Speaker, a man searching for the truth, and the truth does matter. Without truth, life becomes death, liberty becomes slavery, and the pursuit of happiness becomes impossible. If a President can shut down an investigation into his activities and deny our right to the truth, then the promise of the America that we love to celebrate is broken. Over the past year, our institutions—law enforcement, the judiciary—have come under daily assault, so persistent, so relentless, that we, on occasion, have tuned it out or brushed it aside. But these assaults, Mr. Speaker, undermine what is essential to our country and our society. If President Trump chooses to fire the special counsel or otherwise interfere with the legal and appropriate investigation into himself and his staff, it would be a deliberate act to dismantle the fundamental institutions that preserve American democracy and liberty. Mr. Speaker, we cannot allow that, and I hope that my Republican colleagues will remember why they came to Congress in the first place. You see, Mr. Speaker, as Members of Congress, we are truth seekers, and we know that the special counsel will go only where the evidence leads him. That is the man President Bush appointed, and that is the same person leading this investigation at this very time. Mr. Speaker, we must let the special counsel finish his work. Failure to do so leaves us with only one question: What is the administration afraid of? Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mrs. DEMINGS for her passion and her leadership. I am delighted to learn today that she will be joining the House Judiciary Committee as a new colleague next week, and I am thrilled about that. Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the congressman. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, Mrs. DEMINGS focused our attention on the rule of law and the startling disdain for the rule of law that is being shown in Washington right now, and the President’s basic confusion about the proper role for the Department of Justice. One of my revered colleagues on the House Committee on the Judiciary from California (Mr. TEDLIEU), who also serves on the Committee on Foreign Affairs, has had a front row seat to everything that has happened over the course of this year. He saw the Speaker of the House praise Mr. Mueller’s appointment; he saw Senator MCCONNELL praise Mr. Mueller’s appointment as special counsel; he saw Mr. Mueller’s nonpartisanship and professionalism being widely heralded by our colleagues on the Republican side; and now he is watching every day as they do everything in their power to destroy the reputation and the credibility of Mr. Mueller and his excellent team at the special counsel’s office. I have invited Mr. TEDLIEUto come up and speak and tell us what he thinks is going on and what is behind this smear campaign. Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman RASKIN  for organizing this terrific forum tonight. I am here to, first of all, commend Senator WARNER for going on the Senate floor earlier today and drawing very bright lines for the President of the United States. If Donald Trump were to either get Robert Mueller fired or parting key witnesses, he will be violating those red lines. Now, everyone is entitled to their opinions, but not to your own facts. So I am going to run through three facts about the special counsel’s investigation. The first is that it is being led by three people: Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who is overseeing the entire investigation; Special Counsel Robert Mueller; and FBI Director Christopher Wray. All three of them are Republicans. They were also appointed by a Republican President. FBI Director Christopher Wray also happened to have given over $39,000 in political contributions exclusively to Republicans. So the notion that this investigation is somehow a Democratic investigation is false. It is a Republican investigation investigating a Republican President. The second fact you should know is Donald Trump cannot actually fire Robert Mueller directly. He would have to fire Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein first because Mr. Rosenstein came to the Judiciary Committee and testified under oath that there is no cause to fire Special Counsel Mueller. So for this to happen, Donald Trump would have to get Rod Rosenstein fired. He would have to fire him. Then he would have to find another person to put in that position who would fire Robert Mueller. So the next person to take Rod Rosenstein’s place would be Associate Attorney General Rachel Brand. And while she is conservative and while she also made over $37,000 of political contributions exclusively to Republicans, she is also known as a person of integrity. I believe she will not fire Robert Mueller. So Donald Trump would have to then fire her. He would then have to stick a third person in, find anyone to fire Robert Mueller. Well, that is exactly what Richard Nixon did in the Saturday Night Massacre when he fired three Department of Justice officials because the first two would not fire their investigator against Richard Nixon. So if Donald Trump wants to follow in the footsteps of Richard Nixon, he is certainly welcome to try, but it will not end well for him. And then the third fact that you should know is that no one has been able to attack the actual legal actions of Robert Mueller. There has been two guilty pleas: one of George Papadopoulos, a Trump campaign official on the foreign policy team; and the second is Michael Flynn, the former National Security Advisor to Donald Trump. No one disputes that those guilty pleas have a solid legal and factual basis. Two other people have also been indicted: Paul Manafort and Mr. Gates. As people know, Mr. Manafort was the campaign manager for Donald Trump for a period of time. No one disputes that those two indictments have a solid factual and legal basis. So nothing Robert Mueller has done can be attacked, and that is why they are now doing a smear campaign on his team because they are getting desperate. And when I say ‘‘they,’’ I am talking about the White House as well as some of my colleagues in the House on the Republican side. I sat through a Judiciary Committee hearing that I thought was disgraceful, with Members on the other side of the aisle trying to smear not only FBI Director Christopher Wray, but also Rod Rosenstein and Director Mueller. These are good people. They have integrity. And if they think that the Women’s March was large, wait till they see what happens if the President actually tries to take these unconstitutional and, what would really amount to, criminal actions because he would be obstructing justice. So, at the end of the day, it is very important for the American people to understand that no one is above the law. That was the central lesson of Watergate, it is the central lesson of American history, and I urge the President to understand what happened in Watergate and to refrain from taking criminal and unconstitutional actions. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. TEDLIEUfor his excellent presentation. I would ask one question, and I hope that the law professor in me isn’t showing too much, but I wanted to ask 
Mr. T EDLIEUabout one thing he said at the beginning. Mr. TEDLIEUmade the point very well that Mr. Mueller is a distinguished law enforcement officer, who is also Republican, and he was appointed by a Republican. Mr. Rosenstein is another distinguished and wellrespected law enforcement official, who himself had been appointed by Attorney General Sessions, who is a Republican. b2015 All of that is true. But then Mr. LIEU said this is not a Democratic investigation, which certainly it is not. It is a Republican investigation. But wouldn’t it be more appropriate to say it is a law enforcement investigation? And if you want to be searching for some kind of partisan tilt, you are going to find that these are Republicans, not Democrats. Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for letting me clarify that statement. It is a law enforcement investigation led by Republicans. Mr. RASKIN. It is a critical point because, up until all of this started, basically the President respected the independence of the Department of Justice and we didn’t go around searching in people’s garbage cans trying to find out whether their wife was a registered Democrat or whether they voted Republican. Rather, we assumed that prosecutors and FBI agents and police officers can have a partisan registration and they can vote and participate as long as they do their jobs. Mr. LIEU’s point here is they are doing their job. Nobody is making any complaint about any of the guilty pleas or any of the prosecutions. They are complaining about a bunch of irrelevant stuff. Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, that is absolutely right. I trust FBI Director Christopher Wray and Associate Attorney General Rachel Brand to do the right thing, even though they have made contributions to Republicans, because it is demeaning and offensive to the FBI and Department of Justice prosecutors to say that somehow they can’t be fair just because they have a political opinion in exercising their rights under the First Amendment. Keep in mind that under our democracy, fundamental to it is the rule of law. To attack law enforcement and smear their credibility just because you don’t like where an investigation is heading is disgraceful. Mr. Speaker, let me conclude by quoting my favorite Press Secretary. Sarah Sanders previously said: When you are attacking FBI agents because you are under investigation, you are losing. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. LIEUfor all of his excellent work and leadership both in the Judiciary Committee and the Foreign Affairs Committee. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. SCHNEIDER ), another distinguished colleague on the House Judiciary Committee, who is also a member of my class, of sorts. He has been in Congress several different times and he makes a great contribution for his people whenever he is here. Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Maryland for organizing this special hour this evening and for leading the conversation. Mr. Speaker, I share my colleagues’ concern about the unfounded attacks on the special counsel and the need to make sure that the investigation is allowed to proceed to its conclusion. But, Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues tonight in also raising grave concerns about the unwillingness of our present administration, including not only the President, but the Justice Department as well, to take seriously the threat of foreign interference in our elections. It is the unanimous assessment of our intelligence community that the Russian Government launched a focused campaign, at the direction of Vladimir Putin, to interfere in our elections last year. Irrespective of President Trump’s refusal to accept this objective reality or his ongoing efforts to obfuscate the truth, the ongoing threat to the integrity of our elections is real and only likely to increase in 2018. As the Russians sought to disrupt our elections last year, and as they have done so in elections around the world, we can be certain that they will be back next year. That is why we, as Congress and as a country, need to be urgently focused on how to prevent in future elections the kinds of foreign interference we saw in 2016. Mr. Speaker, the first primary elections are barely 3 months away and Americans will collectively head to the polls in less than 11 months. The clock is, quite literally, ticking. Without a serious effort to address these varied and increasing threats, we as a nation remain vulnerable. Over the past month, I have had the opportunity to ask both the number one and number two official at the Department of Justice, as well as the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, about our efforts to secure our elections. Their answers have been far from satisfactory. In November, Attorney General Jeff Sessions came before the House Judiciary Committee. Three weeks prior to that, in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, he admitted to Senator SASSE that his Department had fallen short in addressing election security. I was, therefore, surprised when I asked Attorney General Sessions about the actions he had taken to secure our elections subsequent to his Senate hearing. He could not name any single specific step taken by the Justice Department. He admitted: ‘‘I have not followed through to see where we are on that.’’ And then he committed: ‘‘I will personally take action to do so.’’ Nevertheless, when Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appeared before the committee a month later, he could not demonstrate that the Department had even formally reviewed the matter. It is clear to me that the administration is not handling this threat with the seriousness it deserves. Last month I led a letter with 15 of my Judiciary colleagues to the Attorney General, calling on him to make good on his commitment to urgently brief Members of Congress on the Department’s efforts to secure our elections from foreign meddling. The deadline for this request has come and gone, and there is still not one—no commitment from the Department of Justice to work cooperatively with Congress on this critically important issue. This inaction is unacceptable. The clock is ticking until our next election, and we need to act and we need to act now. Our Nation needs—and the American people are right to expect—this administration to urgently and aggressively take measures to protect our elections. Mr. Speaker, this is not a partisan issue. The very foundation of our democracy depends on the integrity of our elections. I urge my colleagues to join us in our efforts to defend against foreign interference and hold this administration accountable for doing all it can to prevent any interference in the future. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that excellent and indispensable discussion about what is really at stake here, which is democracy itself. If we can’t rely on the integrity of our elections and the authenticity of the results, then democracy is in danger, in deep peril. I thank the gentleman for his leadership and for his outspokenness. Mr. Speaker, to recap, we are here in this Special Order hour to defend Robert Mueller, because, in America, we live and die by the rule of law under democracy. The rule of law is the revolutionary idea, the one that our forebears fought for in the 18th century, that the most powerful officials in the land will be governed just like everybody else: by constitutional and statutory boundaries fixed in writing in the law in order to protect democracy and the rights of the people. Ever since he whipped up chants of ‘‘Lock her up’’ in the 2016 campaign, Donald Trump has displayed complete ignorance of the difference between a constitutional democracy and a banana republic, a complete ignorance of the role of judges and the Justice Department. The men and women who work at the Department of Justice for us, they inhabit a world of law, facts, and evidence. They cannot be forced to execute the President’s personal vendettas 
or prosecute his enemies, real or imagined, or provide support for his propaganda and delusional alternative facts. President Trump has been on a collision course with the rule of law for a long time. Remember during the campaign, Mr. Speaker, when he attacked Judge Curiel for being Mexican American, implying that his ethnic identity somehow disqualified him from being a competent judge with integrity. In February, he trashed Federal judges hearing arguments about his Muslim ban order. He has questioned the separation of powers, which he says is somehow obsolete. He has railed continuously against the free press and the media, which he describes as the enemy of the people. He has continued, in direct violation of the Foreign Emoluments Clause in Article I, section 9, clause 8, to collect money from foreign governments at the Trump Hotel, at the Trump Tower, at the Trump golf courses without obtaining congressional consent first, which is what the Constitution requires. The critical flash point for President Trump’s hostility to the rule of law recently has been his stubborn and baffling refusal to accept the reality of the Russian campaign to interfere in our election last year, and then his seemingly determination to undermine the investigation into what actually happened. Most Americans have regarded this campaign of cyber espionage and cyber sabotage of our election as a frightful danger to democratic sovereignty in our country and a reason to dramatically improve election security across the land, as Congressman SCHNEIDER  just argued; but Donald Trump keeps denying that the autocrat Vladimir Putin, the former director of the KGB, did anything wrong in our election. He tried to convince thenFBI Director James Comey to drop his investigation into Trump’s National Security Advisor Michael Flynn and to swear a personal loyalty oath to the President. When Comey refused these orders, when he refused this entreaty to change the course of the criminal investigation, when he refused to override his oath to the Constitution of the United States by swearing a personal oath to the President, something that we had never heard of before, Trump fired him. This was about as naked a case of obstruction of justice as you can imagine. Now we hear from President Trump’s personal lawyer that the President cannot be guilty of obstruction of justice. They say, by definition, the President cannot be guilty of obstruction of justice because the President is the chief law enforcement officer in the land. This is analogous to the old monarchical dogma that the king can do no wrong, the king cannot commit a crime, the king is above the law; if the king does it, it can’t be illegal. Well, our friends seem to have forgotten this is the United States of America. We have got a Constitution here. We have got a Bill of Rights here. We have no kings here. We have no queens here. We have no royalty. We have just we the people, a government of laws, not of men. We have got a Bill of Rights and popular government. Our friends across the aisle once understood that nobody was above the law. They brought impeachment charges against President Bill Clinton—two charges. One of the charges was obstruction of justice. They moved to impeach President Clinton for obstructing justice, which is now an offense that our friends say a President can’t even be guilty of. They brought a case against President Clinton, Clinton v. Jones, which established that a President can even be sued while he is in office and can be deposed and so on. They understood that at one point. They understand, when a Democrat is President, that nobody’s above the law. But now, suddenly, Mr. Speaker, this President is above the law and he gets to determine the course of criminal investigations in the United States of America. That is not constitutional democracy. That is a banana republic, when the President dictates to law enforcement, dictates to prosecutors what they are going to do, who they are going to investigate, and who will be prosecuted. So now the race is on, Mr. Speaker, to smear the FBI. The race is on to smear Mr. Mueller, the very man who was praised by Senator MCCONNELL , who was praised by Speaker RYAN, who was described by all of our colleagues as beyond reproach, unimpeachable, the former Director of the FBI, former U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts and California, a decorated veteran of the Vietnam war. Now, suddenly, they cry havoc. They set loose the dogs of war on Mr. Mueller. Why? Because he is doing his job. Because we have two guilty pleas: one by the President’s former National Security Advisor, Mr. Flynn; and one by Mr. Papadopoulos for lying to government agents. We have got 12count indictments that have been handed down against Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates, and they are afraid that investigation might be closing in on the very highest levels of government. So what do they do? They attack the prosecution. That is what we have been seeing in Washington over the last couple of weeks, a truly extraordinary display of contempt for the rule of law, for the Justice Department, and honest prosecution and law enforcement in the United States of America. Now, the first effort revolved around an FBI agent who Robert Mueller removed from the investigation in the summertime. He removed him because there were text messages revealed in which he was trashing a lot of political figures, not just President Trump. He was trashing BERNIE SANDERS , who he called an idiot. He also called President Trump an idiot. b2030 He had unkind words for Eric Holder, and he had very harsh words for my friend and the former Governor of Maryland, Martin O’Malley. He was an equal opportunity insulter. But our friends, seeing the progress of the TrumpRussia investigation of this special counsel’s work, now suddenly decided: We found a villain. We have got our villain. His name is Peter Strzok, and he wrote all these texts, so let’s go back to a guy who was removed from the investigation in the summertime. Let’s leak all these texts out in the most mysterious and suspicious way, because this was the middle of an inspector general investigation, and they leaked out thousands of texts. When I asked Mr. Rosenstein about it, he said it had been approved by the inspector general. But the inspector general released a statement the next day which professed that they had not been contacted about it, so there is a whole mystery there. But, clearly, somebody wanted to get these texts out there. They wanted to create a thick fog of propaganda and confusion. And all that we heard from our colleagues was: Did you see what he said in this text to his friend? Did you see what he said in this text to his friend? Nobody claimed that the guilty pleas by Flynn or Papadopoulos were legally flawed in any way. They didn’t say there were any legal problems with anything that the special counsel had done—no illegal searches, no illegal seizures. They didn’t say anything was wrong with the indictment. But they find some text messages by a guy who was removed from the investigation, and then this becomes the big propaganda smoke screen, this guy who insulted, to my count, a lot more Democrats than he insulted Republicans. Regardless, he showed unprofessionalism. He was removed quickly by Mr. Mueller—unlike, for example, what President Trump did when he learned that General Flynn, his National Security Advisor, was a serial liar, was lying to Federal agents, was lying to Federal officers, was lying to the Cabinet about his dealings with Russia and foreign governments. It took President Trump 18 days before he removed him from office in the most begrudging way, and then, even then, after learning that he had been lying about his contacts with foreign agents, he tried to get Mr. Comey, the thenFBI Director, to cancel out the investigation of Michael Flynn, asserting that he is a good guy. Let it go. Let the whole thing go, he said. But, no, that is not what Mr. Mueller did, the special counsel. When he learned that there were these text messages going out attacking various public figures, he said: We don’t need that 
kind of stuff on this investigative team. And he got rid of them, end of story. Except this: It is an opportunity to create an irrelevant distraction from what is going on, to put up a big propaganda smoke screen. And that wouldn’t even be such a big deal in itself. Their arguments are transparently silly. We have colleagues who are saying this is a fruit of the poisonous tree, they intoned. It is all fruit of the poisonous tree. Except it has nothing to do with fruit of the poisonous tree. That is a Fourth Amendment document which says that, if there is an illegal search or seizure by the government, the government may not use that unlawfully obtained evidence against someone in court. At that point, the exclusionary rule operates; the exclusionary rule is activated. We asked our colleagues, and I asked Mr. Rosenstein: Was there an illegal search? No. Was there an illegal seizure? No. There was no illegality. You had an agent who sent some text messages trashing a bunch of politicians in the middle of a Presidential campaign, which is what millions of people were doing. It was irresponsible. He got removed, end of story. That didn’t work so well. That was the first time that they were throwing spaghetti with tomato sauce on it all over the walls. They threw it up and it slipped off. Nobody bought it. So the next day, or a day later, they came back with another claim about asserting that the GSA had improperly released emails of the Trump Presidential transition team. Well, there are a few problems with that. One is everybody was told from the beginning that all of those are government property. They were turned over by Trump’s GSA, voluntarily. And Mr. Mueller released a onesentence statement saying that all of the information that we have received was either voluntarily given or was lawfully obtained, end of story. That didn’t work so well either. Threw some more spaghetti against the wall in this smear campaign, and it slides off. It leaves a tomato sauce stain all over the wall, but it doesn’t really stick. Now they are going after Mr. McCabe, the number two person at the FBI. And I haven’t been told exactly what their complaint is, but we are going to have a closeddoor hearing about it tomorrow in the House Judiciary Committee. From published reports, all I understand is that he has committed the great sin and crime of being married to a woman who is active in Democratic Party politics. Look, let’s get something straight here. This is the United States of America, and law enforcement officers have a right to be registered as a Democrat, as an Independent, as a Republican, as a Green Party member, as a Libertarian. They can register however they want. And consistent with the Hatch Act, they can be involved in politics and members of their family can be involved in politics. There is nothing wrong that. There is nothing wrong with the fact that Mr. Mueller, who is now the target of all of their venom, is a registered Republican or that he got appointed by another Republican, Mr. Rosenstein, or that he got appointed by a Republican, Attorney General Sessions, or that he got appointed by a Republican, President Trump; right? All those people are Republicans. They have a right to be Republicans, but they have got to do their public duty. The irony, of course, is that the Republicans are attacking Republicans in office for being partisan against Republicans. It is completely incoherent; it is fantastical; and it shows the desperation of this smear campaign. It just doesn’t make sense to anyone. So we will see if they are able to smear another good, qualified, competent law enforcement official, which is what they want to do with the number two person at the FBI. And what is interesting is that the people who are attacking their fellow Republicans for somehow being partisan just for doing their jobs never have anything to say about what we know was the real political corruption and contamination of the FBI back in the days of J. Edgar Hoover, when he used the resources of the FBI to go after Martin Luther King, Jr., and the civil rights movement, or the days of COINTELPRO, where the FBI actively tried to disrupt the civil rights movement and the antiwar movement and so on. They don’t say anything about that. It would strengthen their argument, of course, that their fellow Republican partisans somehow might be capable of political bias, but they don’t even have the historical context to do that, and they don’t believe in it. The fact is that the FBI used to have a real problem with being a tool of political prosecution, and it has gotten over that. It has gotten beyond it today, in 2017. Now, suddenly, all of their fire is trained on Mr. Mueller. It is trained on the special counsel: discredit and undermine him. And it wouldn’t be such a big deal if they were just exercising their First Amendment rights, which they have every right to do. If they were just exercising their rights under the Speech and Debate Clause, which they have every right to do, to use their place in this body in order to denounce the FBI, to attack Mr. Mueller, to try to discredit law enforcement, they have got the right to do it. But what everyone is afraid of now is that they are trying to set the stage for the removal of Robert Mueller. Now, that is no simple thing. The President can’t simply fire Mr. Mueller. He would have to get Mr. Rosenstein to do it. And he can’t be fired for any reason at all. He can only be fired for misconduct, for conflict of interest, or for some other good cause or incapacity. So there has got to be a reason why. And when we asked Mr. Rosenstein whether he saw any reason to remove Mr. Mueller now, he said, no, that he is totally satisfied with the conduct of the investigation. So what trumpedup alibi could they produce? What trumpedup justification could they find for the removal of Mr. Mueller? It would create a serious constitutional emergency and crisis in America. And, of course, when we say a constitutional crisis, it is not the Constitution that is in crisis; it is us. They would be creating a political crisis that would require a resort to extraordinary constitutional mechanisms. This would be a clearly impeachable offense for the President to use his power in order to thwart a criminal investigation that implicates the President. That is the very definition of obstruction of justice. It would just be an expansion and a refinement of what the President was doing when he fired Mr. Comey way back in the beginning of the administration for refusing to lay off Michael Flynn and for refusing to swear a personal loyalty oath to the President of the United States instead of to the Constitution and the people of the country. So that is where we are. The people need to know. The people need to know what is going on, that there is an organized campaign being orchestrated at the highest levels of government to discredit Mr. Mueller and the special counsel investigation—not for not doing their job, but for doing their job. That is why they are being attacked today. Mr. Speaker, I close with a thought just about the rule of law. The rule of law is the idea that even the people who occupy the highest office in the land are subject to the Constitution, are subject to the laws of the people, because here the people govern. We have no kings here. That is what we rebelled against. Our Founders believed, with Madison, that the very definition of tyranny is the collapse of all powers into one, where someone says: I have got all the power; I am the boss. Our Founders said: No, we are going to divide powers up: Article I, we will vest the lawmaking power in the representatives of the people in the House and the Senate; Article II, we will create a President who will take care that the laws be faithfully executed; And then Article III, we will vest the judicial power in the Supreme Court and the Federal judiciary to sort out actual cases or controversies about what the law means. But notice what comes first there, Article I. The people’s representatives come first. The President works for us. The President works for a Congress, 
which works for the people. The President implements the laws that we pass here. The President is not above the law. The President is subject to the law, and the President has the honor of enforcing the laws that we adopt. So let’s get that straight. No one is above the law. Anybody can be found guilty of obstructing justice if one thing can be shown: if they obstruct justice. And it looks like they are setting the stage for a further obstruction of justice with this outrageous smear campaign being leveled this week against Robert Mueller, against Mr. Rosenstein, against Mr. McCabe, and against the men and women of the FBI. That is what is taking place in Washington today. Mr. Speaker, the people need to know, and we in Congress have got to do our constitutional duty, too. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. LEWIS of Minnesota). Remarks in debate in the House may not engage in personalities toward the President or Members of the Senate, whether originating as the Member’s own words or being reiterated from another source.
