Mr. GAETZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Ms. Kristen White as the 2018 Santa Rosa County Teacher of the Year. Ms. Brown has a long history of serving the Santa Rosa County School District with exceptional passion and an unwavering commitment to helping her stu-dents. In Northwest Florida, we are fortunate to have some of the best teachers in the Nation. It is recognized that the teaching profession is one of the most difficult yet rewarding profes-sions in existence. Ms. White has exception-ally performed her teaching duties, while also striving to be an active and supportive mem-ber of her community. Ms. White has served as an elementary reading and writing intervention teacher at East Milton Elementary and coordinates the Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math (STEAM) Innovate Lab, which serves K– 5 students. She also provides professional de-velopment to teachers, coordinates Discovery education assessments, and collects and in-terprets data for grade levels. Previously she has served as a Kinder-garten teacher and grade level chair. Her sup-port and mentoring extends far beyond the walls of her classroom through her willingness to serve as a Professional Learning Commu-nity facilitator. I commend Ms. White for her steadfast willingness to serve those that mat-ter most, the students and youth of our Nation. For all of her admirable contributions, I am truly proud to have Ms. White as a constituent in Florida’s First Congressional District. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the United States Congress, I am privileged to recognize Ms. Kristen White for her accomplishments and her commitment to excellence in the Santa Rosa County School District. I thank her for her service and wish her all the best for con-tinued success.

RECOGNIZING LIEUTENANT COLO-NEL STEVE ‘‘THIRSTY’’ SMITH FOR REACHING 10,000 FLYING HOURS IN A B–52 BOMBER 
HON. MIKE JOHNSON 
OF LOUISIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 6, 2017 Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, it is with great honor that I rise today to com-mend the achievements of Lieutenant Colonel Steve ‘‘Thirsty’’ Smith for making United States Air Force history on March 3, 2017 by being the only currently serving member of the United States Air Force to reach 10,000 flying hours in a B–52 heavy bomber, officially la-beled a B–52 Stratofortress, and contributing to the backbone of the manned strategic bomber force for the United States. Lt. Colonel Smith joined the United States Air Force after graduating from the ROTC pro-gram at the University of Mississippi. He con-tinued on to graduate navigation school at Mather Air Force Base in 1985 where he earned his wings and received his first assign-ment for the B–52. As a navigator with the 93rd Bomb Squad-ron belonging to the 917th Wing at Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana, Lt. Colonel Smith has distinguished himself as one of our na-tion’s most experienced navigators. He spent seven years on active duty before becoming a reservist for over 20 years. He has flown 10,000 B–52 hours and 1,819 B–52 sorties in-cluding 496 combat hours and 42 combat sor-ties over the span of four different wars; Oper-ations Desert Storm, Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom and Inherent Resolve. He was awarded the Air Medal in 1991 and the Aerial Achievement Medal in 2002 and 2004. His expertise with the B–52 played an in-strumental role in modernizing the aircraft with a targeting pod that provides greater accuracy leading to more successful missions. Addition-ally, he has been an inspiration to many young navigators as a flight instructor, teach-ing over 180 young weapons systems officers at Barksdale Air Force Base in the same air-craft. Dating back to World War I, the 93rd Bomb Squadron has repeatedly distinguished itself in its contributions to the security of the United States during deployments around the world. This distinction has continued today with glob-al demonstrations of strategic attack capabili-ties. Lt. Colonel Smith is greatly regarded throughout the Air Force and Louisiana com-munities and is known as a humble man who has selflessly given back to the country he loves so dearly. He has earned widespread respect for his continued commitment to serve in defense of our great nation. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the United States Congress, it is my pleasure to join a grateful community in saluting his outstanding achieve-ments. My wife Kelly and I thank Lt. Colonel Smith for his dedicated services and wish him all the best for continued success in what is an already remarkable career. f 
IN REMEMBRANCE OF THE KHOJALY MASSACRE 
HON. DONALD M. PAYNE, JR. 
OF NEW JERSEY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 6, 2017 Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor all those lost in the Khojaly Massacre. On February 25, 1992, a little more than 25 years ago, over 600 people were brutally mur-dered in Khojaly, Azerbaijan. These were mostly elderly men, women, and children—in-nocent victims that should have never been part of such a heartbreaking tragedy. It is es-sential that we take the time every year to re-member those who lost their lives during this horrific event in Azerbaijan. Their unwilling sacrifice continues to serve as a reminder to hold fast to the principles of democracy. Azerbaijan is a strong partner of the United States in a strategically critical and compound region of the world. I ask my colleagues to join me and our Azerbaijani friends in commemo-rating the tragedy that occurred in the town of Khojaly. f 
HONORING SAM SCINTA FOR HIS DEDICATED SERVICE TO THE COMMUNITY 
HON. BRIAN HIGGINS 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 6, 2017 Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor Mr. Sam Scinta, a dedi-cated volunteer for the Democratic Party and resident of Tonawanda, New York. Sam’s tire-less service is recognized today by his friends on the City of Tonawanda Democratic Com-mittee. Sam has committed countless hours to further Democratic causes in our community and is most deserving of the City of Tona-wanda Democratic Committee’s Man of the Year Award. Sam was raised in Buffalo, New York where he attended Public School 76 and Hutchinson Central High School. In 1954, he enlisted in the U.S. Navy. He is a Korean War Veteran and worked in aviation as a line captain and mechanic. He served in Kingsville, Texas, in a Patrol Squadron in San Diego, and in the Phil-ippine Islands, until he was discharged in 1958. In 1959, Sam began his career with the Erie Rail Road as a locomotive fireman and was promoted to locomotive engineer in 1966. When the Erie Rail Road merged with the Lackawanna Rail Road, he became active in the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen as an organizer, rising to the rank of Vice President, then Local Chairman. Fol-lowing a union merge he became Local Chair-man of the United Transportation Union. In 1976, he went to work for Con Rail after the North East Railroads merged, where he served as a locomotive engineer until his re-tirement in 1999. Sam moved to Tonawanda in 1998 and fol-lowing his retirement became active in the City of Tonawanda Democratic Committee and has served as Vice Chairman of the Committee for over a decade. One example of his dedication is Sam’s command of the Smoothie Booth for the City Committee’s fundraiser during Canal Fest since 2003. He constructs the booth, does the scheduling, works in the booth and is there from open to closing all 8 days. Each year, Sam puts in a long day at the Commit-tee’s annual picnic in August. Sam is also the proud custodian of the Committee’s banner.

As a volunteer on Hillary Clinton’s success-ful campaign for Senator in 2000, and at Con-gresswoman L
OUISE SLAUGHT er’s campaign headquarters in 2001, Sam worked tirelessly. In 2005 he hopped on board Legislator Michele Iannello’s campaign.

In 2008, he went to work for the Erie County Board of Elections and retired again in June, 2016.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE WHISNANTS 
HON. MARK MEADOWS 
OF NORTH CAROLINA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 6, 2017 Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize The Whisnants, a musical ensemble from Morganton, North Carolina. On behalf of the people of Western North Carolina, I would like to congratulate The Whisnants for nearly 50 years of the continued growth of their re-markable ministry. This ministry began many years ago in 1970, when John and Betty Whisnant and their family began singing gospel music in Morganton, North Carolina. The group has ex-panded over the years, with members coming and going, but they have always remained true to their mission. This family has asked God to use their ministry to touch more and more lives, and he has clearly used their music to do so. In the 47 years since they got their start, the Whisnants have performed across the nation and the world. The Whisnants have been recognized as leaders in gospel music, and their songs have fre-quently been awarded top accolades through-out their career. As the family’s ministry continues to grow and as new generations of Whisnants take new roles, they do so with my prayers and continued best wishes. The Whisnants have been extraordinary representatives of our community across our state and nation. On behalf of the people of Western North Caro-lina, it’s my honor to recognize them on this important family milestone. f

HONORING GAYLE SYPOSS FOR HER DEDICATED SERVICE TO THE COMMUNITY 
HON. BRIAN HIGGINS 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 6, 2017 Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, my hometown county Democratic committee gath-ered recently to honor the longtime chair of the City of Tonawanda Democratic committee, Gayle Syposs, to commemorate her service both to her community and to the Democratic Party. A career public servant, Gayle has in the past served as an elected member of her hometown city council, as a civil servant and appointed public servant in county govern-ment, and at present once again serving her hometown as the Tonawanda City Clerk, where its elected leadership—be they Repub-lican or Democratically affiliated—agree that her experience and institutional knowledge was critically important when the longtime in-cumbent city clerk retired in 2015. But it is how Gayle came to public life that helps illustrate what is great about America, and about how committed people, working to-gether, can be an effective voice for the com-munities they love. In the 1970s, New York State government had plans to ‘‘improve’’ transportation in the city of Tonawanda—but the local community didn’t think much of it. The state wanted to change Niagara Street into a four lane high-way, which would have turned this main thor-oughfare adjacent to the city’s waterfront parks into a dangerous highway totally not in keeping with the needs and wants of city resi-dents, destroying the city’s character in the process. This ill-conceived action midwifed the birth of a great civic and political activist in Gayle Syposs. After reading a newspaper article de-tailing the number of old-growth trees destined to be removed to build this highway, Gayle formed a citizens’ committee that successfully fought the state’s top-down plan, preserving Niagara Street and the character of her home-town the right way, in a grassroots, bottom-up fashion, energizing and educating neighbors to join the fight. Today, Niagara Street remains as it was, a low-speed thoroughfare adjacent to county and city parks, preserved, we hope, in per-petuity for the enjoyment of residents and fam-ilies during each of Western New York’s great four seasons. Gayle’s activism spawned a ca-reer in public service and politics, leading her to 6 non-consecutive terms on the city council, and into greater governmental and political ac-tivism—something from which so many West-ern New York Democrats have benefited. Indeed, while I have known Gayle for the better part of thirty years, I have come to ben-efit most directly since her city was included into my congressional district in 2012. In addi-tion to being a steadfast supporter, Gayle has been a friend and an important link for me and for my staff to her local community—a service she has been kind enough to provide to me and to the people I work to serve. Gayle is, as I mentioned, currently the chair of the city of Tonawanda’s Democratic Com-mittee, but that is only one of many titles she has held. While she has served as chair as long as many of us can remember, she also serves as Chair of the Erie County Association of Town Chairs, as Treasurer of the county Democratic party, and as a member of the New York State Democratic Committee. A few weeks ago, Gayle was honored by our Erie County Democratic Committee as the 2017 recipient of the Joseph F. Crangle Leg-acy Award. Named for our legendary former county and state chairman, this award is the gold standard for local Democrats; it rightfully raises Gayle’s name among the great leaders of our party. But no one should imagine that earning this award will mean that Gayle will slow down anytime soon. Gayle will likely read this speech, reflect upon it for a few moments, and quickly move on to a call she recently re-ceived about a broken sidewalk, or pass along the re´sume´of a neighbor’s college-aged grandson who is looking for an opportunity as he works his way through college. Gayle’s dedication to her country, her community and, yes, her party, represent all that is great about Western New York, and I am thankful for the opportunity to honor her and to have the House take note of the many positive contribu-tions she has made throughout our commu-nity.

HONORING MS. AILEEN CLARKE HERNANDEZ 
HON. BARBARA LEE 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 6, 2017 Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the extraordinary life of Aileen Clarke Her-nandez. With her passing on February 13, 2017 in Irvine, California, I look to recognize her passion for women’s equality, and the in-valuable influence it has had on our nation. Aileen was born in Brooklyn on May 23, 1926, to Charles Henry Clarke, and Ethel Lou-ise Hall. Ms. Hernandez excelled in school and graduated magna cum laude from Howard University, where she was drawn into politics and worked with the NAACP. In 1951, she took an organizing job with the West Coast di-vision of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union. Her work with the Garment Workers Union brought her to California, and led to her in-volvement in California politics and govern-ment, where she eventually was appointed as

the assistant chief of the Fair Employment Practices Division for the State. In 1964, Clarke was appointed by President Lyndon B. Johnson, as the first woman to serve on the U.S. Equal Employment Oppor-tunity Commission (EEOC), and in 1966, she left the commission to form her own consulting firm, Hernandez and Associates. Her firm worked to end racism, sexism and all forms of discrimination, and to establish standards for equity in government and corporations. In 1970 she was appointed the second President of the National Organization for Women (NOW) where she was instrumental in organizing the national Women’s Strike for Equality on August 26, 1970. In 1973, Ms. Clarke took initiative and founded Black Women Organized for Action in San Francisco. In addition, Ms. Clarke was the Co-Chair and Founder with Marilyn Fowler, of the California Women’s Agenda, a network and action alliance of over 600 organizations in California, and was chairwoman of the com-mittee that led to the founding of the National Women’s Political Caucus that worked to in-crease political power for women. Aileen Clarke Hernandez was a leader and fought against discrimination for more than seven decades. She took it as her mission to ensure a voice for women of color in the wom-en’s movement and civil rights movement, and worked on behalf of all people seeking social justice. Her monumental efforts have guided our nation on the right trajectory toward a more just society. On a personal note, I met Aileen in 1972 during Shirley Chisholm’s groundbreaking presidential campaign. She became a mentor and helped shape my political views and guid-ed my growing political involvement. I was constantly amazed at how she could build bridges between activists in the feminist move-ment, people of color, and the civil rights movement, in order to work together for posi-tive change. I was proud to call Aileen my friend; I know that her legacy will live on, and her spirit will continue to guide us through the many challenges that we continue to face. Today, California’s 13th Congressional Dis-trict honors Aileen Hernandez’s memory and her lifetime of service working on behalf of so-cial justice and equality. We join her loved ones in celebrating her incredible life with a promise to honor her tremendous legacy.

REMEMBERING MAJOR REID B. NANNEN, UNITED STATES MA-RINE CORPS 
HON. DARIN LaHOOD

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 6, 2017 Mr. L
AHOOD. Mr. Speaker, today, I would like to honor United States Marine Corps Major Reid B. Nannen, who passed away Sunday, March 1, 2014, while training at TOPGUN NAS in Fallon, Nevada. Reid attended Olympia High School where he was a two-year captain of the swim team, a section leader for the drum line, and an Illi-nois State Scholar. Reid then attended the University of Illinois where he participated in the Marching Illini Drum Line, and also served as commander of the NROTC Drill Team his senior year. After graduating, Reid married the love of his life, Sarah M. Simpson, on August 6, 2005, in Peoria, Illinois. Reid was commissioned as a 2nd Lieuten-ant in May 2004. After completing The Basic School, Reid attended Naval Aviation Training and received his Wings of Gold in February 2007. He deployed to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom from May to December of 2010. Reid attended Tactical Air Control Party training in 2011 and proceeded to Camp Pendleton, California, for duty as a forward air controller. Reid deployed for the second time to Afghanistan from October of 2011 to May of 2012. Reid’s valor and leader-ship led him to serve as a decorated hero re-ceiving the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, Navy Unit Commendation, Navy Achievement Medal, and the Navy Commendation Medal and Air Medal. In honor of Reid’s sacrifice, it is my privilege to commemorate his service through the des-ignation of the Major Reid B. Nannen Highway in Hopedale, Illinois. My prayers and thoughts go out to his wife, Sarah, and their four chil-dren, who have lost a loving husband and fa-ther. Our Nation is blessed to have service-men like Captain Reid who have selflessly given their life in defense of our country and our freedom. f 
HONORING ST. PAUL’S EPISCOPAL CATHEDRAL 
HON. BRIAN HIGGINS 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 6, 2017 Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the rich history of St Paul’s Episcopal Cathedral, a long standing commu-nity pillar that is celebrating its 200th anniver-sary this year. The Episcopal Cathedral was incorporated on February 10, 1817 in the city of Buffalo. This building was Buffalo’s first permanent house of worship and was consecrated on February 25, 1821. A major milestone in the Church’s history was the consecration of a new edifice. This building was designed by renowned architect Richard Upjohn and began a second period of growth for the Church. St Paul’s Cathedral flourished in the city until May 22, 1888 when it was tragically de-stroyed by a fire. Through perseverance and a strong commitment to the community, the re-stored St Paul’s Cathedral was inaugurated just two years later. The Church committed to remaining in the downtown community of Buffalo. Even with the hardships of the twentieth century around the country and in Buffalo, St Paul’s Cathedral took advantage of every opportunity to grow and serve the community. St Paul’s Cathedral is where The Most Rev. Michael Bruce Curry, Presiding Bishop and Primate of The Episcopal Church, attended while he was going through Buffalo Public Schools. Through different projects throughout the city of Buffalo, the people of St Paul’s Cathe-dral have shown their commitment to social service and preserving their history. Mr. Speaker, I honor a long standing institu-tion in the city of Buffalo. I am proud to cele-brate St Paul’s Episcopal Cathedral’s bicen-tennial and I wish the Church good fortune for many years to come. f 
INTRODUCTION OF THE ANIMAL WELFARE ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY ACT 
HON. EARL BLUMENAUER 
OF OREGON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 6, 2017 Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, early last month, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) abruptly pulled animal welfare viola-tion documents from its website. This data-base contained thousands of inspection re-ports and other information about violations of the Animal Welfare Act and the Horse Protec-tion Act made by research laboratories, zoos, dog breeding operations, and other facilities. While the agency has begun to repost some of these documents, it has so far only restored a small fraction of the information that was taken down. In the meantime, consumers and animal welfare advocates lack the trans-parency needed to make informed decisions and hold violators accountable. For the life of me, I can’t understand why USDA would hide this vital information. Ensur-ing transparency under these laws is a no- brainer. Luckily, many of my colleagues feel the same. Today, I am pleased to introduce, with 34 of my colleagues, the Animal Welfare Accountability and Transparency Act. This bill would require USDA to repost this information on its website and would increase account-ability for those who treat animals inhumanely. Providing consumers with information about where their pets come from and how animals are treated is the least we can do to discour-age people from violating the law. It is critical that we ensure the standards set forth by Ani-mal Welfare Act and the Horse Protection Act are upheld. This is why the Animal Welfare Accountability and Transparency Act would create an additional incentive to abide by these laws. The bill would take away certain tax benefits for businesses that are found to be in violation of those laws. Under current tax rules, the costs of breeding and working animals are treated the same as machinery and equip-ment, and businesses may deduct these costs from their taxes over a specified period. The bill would prohibit businesses found to have violated the Animal Welfare Act or the Horse Protection Act from claiming these accelerated depreciation bonuses for tax purposes. I am also happy to have worked with my colleague from Oregon, Senator R
ONWYDEN , who introduced a Senate version of this legis-lation late last week. This bill is a small step that this Congress can take quickly to show that we respond to animal abuse and that the federal government should be transparent with consumers. I call on my colleagues to support this bill so that we can send a strong message to animal abusers across this country that their horrendous actions will not be kept in the shadows.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 6, 2017 Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 90th Anniversary of Sac-ramento’s Memorial Auditorium. As the City of Sacramento celebrates one of its most valued and awe inspiring buildings, I ask all my col-leagues to join me in honoring this historical piece of architecture in Sacramento. The Memorial Auditorium, listed on the Na-tional Register of Historic Places since 1977, opened in 1927 and is dedicated as a tribute and memorial to those in our community who gave their lives to our country. The Memorial Auditorium has provided the venue for a vari-ety of events including concerts, local gradua-tions, competitions and gubernatorial inau-gurations. The building has many unique ar-chitectural design elements and operational features. In honor of this anniversary, the City of Sac-ramento is offering a viewing of the classic comedy and silent film ‘‘Steamboat Bill, Jr.’’ accompanied by the local organist Dave Moreno live. This Buster Keaton film has spe-cial connection with the area, as it was filmed on the Sacramento River in 1927 the same year the Memorial Auditorium opened. Mr. Speaker, as the City of Sacramento honors the 90th Anniversary of the Memorial Auditorium, I ask all my colleagues to join me in honoring this staple of the Sacramento area and all it has provided to the community.

HONORING DONALD R. WHITE 
HON. BARBARA LEE 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 6, 2017 Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the extraordinary work of Donald R. White, who recently retired after 32 years of serving as Alameda County’s Treasurer-Tax Collector. I recognize his exemplary work and the invalu-able influence he had on our community in the County of Alameda. Mr. White graduated from California State University, Hayward (now Cal State East Bay) where he earned a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration. He is a Certified Public Accountant, a member of the California Society of CPAs, and a member of the Amer-ican Institute of CPAs. These qualifications helped him become the first African American auditor at Ernst and Young’s San Francisco office and he later co-founded Adams, Grant, White & Co, a minority owned accounting firm that had offices in Washington, D.C., Oakland, and Fresno. Donald began his work for Alameda County in 1985 when he made history as the first Afri-can American to be elected to the position of Treasurer-Tax Collector. As Alameda County’s Treasurer, White oversaw billions of dollars in county funds, managed multiple departments, and supervised a staff of over 60 employees. Mr. White is a trailblazer. He dedicated his career to serving and supporting his commu-nity, investing years with countless community service organizations. He has committed him-self to numerous non-profit boards, including service on the Board of Trustees for the East Oakland Youth Development Center and on the Board of Directors and as chair of the Audit Committee of the Episcopal Diocese of California. He served as treasurer for the Alpha Gamma Boule Foundation and treasurer of the Black Elected Officials and Faith Based Leaders of the East Bay. Over the years Mr. White has also com-mitted his time and expertise to numerous pro-fessional organizations, including the Cali-fornia Association of County Treasurers and Tax Collectors, National Association of Securi-ties Professionals, National Association of Black Accountants, and is an active member of the Oakland Chapter of the National Asso-ciation for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Mr. White is an exemplary model of a posi-tive community activist, promoter of equality, and role model for all. He has worked tire-lessly as a public servant and committed him-self to expanding and promoting diversity in every aspect of professional services for the county. On a personal note, I had the privilege to be involved in Don’s first campaign, when I orga-nized an event for him with Congressman Har-old Ford. Don was also a member of a busi-ness delegation that I led to Africa, and the group benefitted tremendously from his exper-tise and insights. More than anything, Don al-ways lived up to his role as an exemplary pub-lic servant, and I am proud to call him my friend. Today, on behalf of California’s 13th Con-gressional District, I salute the long and suc-cessful career of Donald R. White. I offer my congratulations and acknowledge the positive impact that he had on the communities of Ala-meda County. f
