Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Claire Lovell, an accomplished columnist and devoted resident of Seaside, Oregon. North coast residents are richer for Claire’s presence, and I join them in celebrating her life and her legacy. For 27 years, Claire’s column chronicled the happenings of Seaside with cogent prose and an observant eye. First known as ‘‘Overheard: Notes from Seaside,’’ and later ‘‘Scene and Heard,’’ her column was the first thing readers went to when they eagerly opened their newspapers. Indeed, some readers bought the newspaper just for her column. Claire was a Seaside resident for almost all of her 96 years, and no one was better qualified to document the city’s life. Whether she was sharing her observations on politics, popular culture, growing older, or the birth of her first greatgrandchild, Claire enriched each topic with her signature verve and keen love of the written word. In a recent column, Claire wrote: Whether one is 5years old or 95, as the case may be, life’s small pleasures are very important. 
For decades, one of Seaside’s small pleasures was reading her column. It is my honor to recognize Claire Lovell’s many contributions to our community and to offer my condolences to her family and the Seaside community on the loss of this remarkable woman. Her wit, wisdom, and wellchosen words will not be forgotten. 
HONORING THE WORK OF THE STATE COLLEGE FOOD BANK (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge the good work of the State College Area Food Bank in Centre County, Pennsylvania. In 1982, the food bank opened in the basement of the St. Andrew’s Episcopal Church as a temporary solution to a temporary need. As the need continued, so did the food bank. Today, it has a permanent home in a large facility on South Atherton Street. The need is great, and the statistics are alarming. Nearly 15 percent of Centre County’s population lived in food insecure homes in 2015—the highest in the Commonwealth. It means that more than 22,000 individuals lack regular access to adequate food. Thankfully, the food bank is filling a void in the community. In 2016, it distributed more than 400,000 pounds of food and fed nearly 1,700 individuals. I rise today as the chairman of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Nutrition but also as a proud citizen of Centre County. The food bank hopes that one day no one will go hungry in Centre County. Thankfully, it is working every day to realize that goal. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP’S 100 DAYS (Ms. DELBENE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. DELBENE. Mr. Speaker, President Trump’s first 100 days have been chaos and confusion for American families and businesses. One thing is clear: he has consistently ignored the middle class. His budget decimates programs like Meals on Wheels. His tax plan is a huge giveaway to the wealthiest few. And now, he is trying to eliminate protections for people with preexisting conditions. The Republican’s latest bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act would be devastating. And as I have heard from constituents—hundreds of constituents throughout my district—getting sick should never mean going bankrupt, like Christine, from Kirkland, who was born with a congenital heart defect and relies on costly medical care to stay alive. She told me her condition is, ‘‘a cruel reality that is nobody’s fault. But it is malicious and disgraceful that we might face financial ruin for me to stay alive.’’ President Trump spent his first 100 days putting families like Christine’s in jeopardy. This must change in the next 100 days for Christine and so many others. f 
CONGRATULATIONS TO USA TEAM AND HARRISON TURONE ON WINNING GOLD AT CULINARY COMPETITION (Mr. BACON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning to congratulate the USA Team on winning gold at the Bocuse d’Or culinary competition in Lyon, France. I would also like to recognize one team member, Harrison Turone, a Nebraska high school graduate. Harrison grew up in Omaha. During his high school career, he enrolled in the Omaha Public Schools Career Center culinary program where he received college credits to the Institute for the Culinary Arts at Metropolitan Community College in Omaha. In addition to his academic pursuit of the culinary arts, Harrison worked at many restaurants in our area and in California. He then moved to New York to train with Chef Mathew Peters for the USA Team selection for the Bocuse d’Or while working at Per Se restaurant. After winning the team’s selection and the honor to represent the United States, Peters and Turone moved to Napa Valley to train for a year for the Bocuse d’Or competition. The Bocuse d’Or is a prestigious culinary competition that is held in Lyon, France, every 2 years. It is named after the wellrenowned French chef Paul Bocuse. He is recognized as the father of the modern French cuisine and has been awarded ‘‘Chef of the Century’’ by the The Culinary Institute of America. While fighting Nazi Germany during World War II, he was shot in the chest and treated at a U.S. Army hospital. He was given a transfusion of blood that saved his life. The United States competed against 23 other countries in the Bocuse d’Or and won. This was the 30th anniversary of the competition, and it marked the first time the United States took home the gold. I send my congratulations to the entire team and a special congratulations to Harrison Turone. You represented your team and our State admirably. 
WHERE IS THE PLAN, PRESIDENT TRUMP? (Mr. BROWN of Maryland asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Speaker, as we approach President Trump’s 100th day in office, I rise to address the vision, the agenda, and the plans the White House has laid out. Except, Mr. Speaker, there are no plans to speak up. President Trump promised an agenda that was supposed to make America great again, but no one in America or the administration seems to know what that includes. As the dust settles on the cruise missile strike in Syria and the dropping of bombs in Afghanistan, where is the plan for ISIS, Iraq, Syria, or Afghanistan that Candidate Trump promised? The President said his $1 trillion infrastructure plan to create millions of jobs is coming fast, but, again, where is the plan? Instead, President Trump’s onepage proposal is a massive $2 trillion giveaway to corporations and the wealthy and doesn’t include a penny for infrastructure. That is a missed opportunity. I could keep going. Where is the plan on fixing America’s water infrastructure? Where is the plan on making trade fair for American workers? Where is the plan to provide affordable childcare that the President promised? Mr. Speaker, there is a hard truth the President needs to realize: the difficult work of governing on behalf of the American people is more than tweets and photo ops. The President’s first 100 days have been all talk and no action. f 
QUALITY ACCESS AND INCLUSION FOR THOSE WITH DOWN SYNDROME (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of my constituent Evan Rothholz, an energetic, techsavvy kindergarten student who happens to have Down syndrome. Down syndrome is a condition that results from having an additional full or partial copy of chromosome 21. Since his diagnosis, 6yearold Evan, along with his parents, Mitchel and Julie, advocate for others with Down syndrome and help educate families facing this unexpected diagnosis. I am appreciative of the work of the Pennsylvania Down Syndrome Advocacy Coalition, a group of concerned parents, selfadvocates, supporters, committed to achieving quality access and inclusion for all individuals with Down syndrome in the State of Pennsylvania. As a member of the Congressional Task Force on Down Syndrome, I am very proud to support H.R. 1896, the ABLE to Work Act, which provides more flexibility for thousands of individuals with disabilities, allowing them to save and plan for the future. It is Evan’s hope that individuals with Down syndrome, and all of those in the special needs community, will have the same educational and financial opportunities that are afforded to others. 
HEALTH PLAN NEEDS TO COVER PREEXISTING CONDITIONS (Ms. ROSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. ROSEN. Mr. Speaker, the GOP is trying to pull a fast one over working families. This week, House Republicans and President Trump gave into extreme demands of the Freedom Caucus by colluding on a dangerous amendment that would gut protections for individuals with preexisting conditions, allowing insurers to once again discriminate against sick Americans. We all know that the ACA isn’t perfect, but we cannot, in good conscience, throw out essential health benefits that have helped working families to get the protections that they need. The MacArthur amendment would take us back to the days before these key protections helped save lives. Without protections for preexisting conditions, my constituents with serious illnesses and health conditions would face discrimination from insurance companies solely based on their illness. How can Speaker RYANseriously tell Americans that this plan is somehow better for people with preexisting conditions? We need a health plan that will help working families pay for their health coverage, not one that puts health insurance out of reach. 
b0915 PRESIDENT TRUMP’S FIRST 100 DAYS (Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow marks President Donald Trump’s first 100 days in office. While President Trump has claimed that this is the most productive any President has been, he has not met his own deadlines that were set during his campaign and subsequent victory. Since day one, this administration has pursued only works that represent the detriment to this country and our democracy. He has made outlandish, hateful, and harmful healthcare proposals. He has plans to gut the Federal budget in exchange for tax cuts for his wealthy friends. He has rolled back the progress made by the Department of Justice under the previous administration. He and his family continue to make money off of his position, and he has used the Congressional Review Act to roll back protections for our environment, public education, gun safety, and women’s rights. We are 100 days in, and we have over 4,000 more days to go. Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, and the residents of New Jersey’s 12th Congressional District, we are counting down those days. 
FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2017 Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 289 and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: H. R ES. 289 Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in order to consider in the House the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 99) making further continuing appropriations for fiscal year 2017, and for other purposes. All points of order against consideration of the joint resolution are waived. The joint resolution shall be considered as read. All points of order against provisions in the joint resolution are waived. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the joint resolution and on any amendment thereto to final passage without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Appropriations; and (2) one motion to recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. POE of Texas). The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN ), my friend, the ranking member of the committee, pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule. It is a fair rule that enables this body to continue working in a bipartisan fashion to get our work done for the American people. Essentially, it is to fund the government for one more week as final preparations are made and as the Appropriations Committee finalizes its work. It enables us to continue to serve our constituents. It enables the American people to have confidence not only in what we are doing, but to provide the necessary resources so that this Nation can continue to protect itself also. I also rise in support of the underlying legislation that is in this rule. This shortterm CR, while being far from ideal, is exactly what we need to do so that we can allow our colleagues in the House, as well as the Appropriations Committee and this body, to move forth a bill that will find its way to the United States Senate and to the President’s desk. For months now, our colleagues on the Appropriations Committee, under the great work of our brandnew chairman, Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN from New Jersey, have been working towards funding a government agreement while they are trying to reach a long term bridge. Yesterday at the Rules Committee, the young chairman, along with the ranking member, Mrs. LOWEY from New York, came and spoke to the Rules Committee not only with great confidence about the work that they are doing, but with great confidence about how they worked well together. It was once again another opportunity for Members of Congress in the performance of their duties to have confidence not only in their working relationship, but in the product that they would wish to move forward. The Rules Committee was quite blunt to them that, while we were pleased to see them, we wanted to see them get their work done a week from now. I think the American people feel the same way. I think they are willing to take the time to do it right, but it is now time to feel a little bit of pressure towards completing the work that needs to be done. Mr. Speaker, today we are going to have one of the most distinguished members of the Rules Committee who will speak with us. He shares a role not only as vice chairman of our committee, but he also has an opportunity to sit on the Appropriations Committee; a person responsible as a cardinal for a massive part of not only the Federal Government spending, but the authority and responsibility for the Federal Government to deliver in so many areas in support of the American people. I will be introducing the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE) in just a few minutes, who will also provide detail and information not only in support of the great work that is being done, but why we are doing that for the American people. Mr. Speaker, I am confident that my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee are going to continue their work. We are asking this body today to consider this rule to move forth legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. SESSIONS ), my good friend, the chairman of the Rules Committee for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. (Mr. MCGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I want to begin with some good news for my colleagues here in the House and for the American people, and that is my Republican colleagues have decided to pull their abysmal repeal and replace bill with regard to the Affordable Care Act from consideration this week. We can all breathe a sigh of relief. The American people dodged another Republican bullet here. Their bill, as my colleagues all know, would have caused 24 million Americans to lose their health care. It would have cut Medicaid by over $800 billion, and then they would have given a trilliondollar tax break to the richest people in the country. It would have compromised Medicare. It would have 
basically denied Americans essential health protections that they currently are guaranteed in their health insurance; things like emergency room care, maternity care, mental health care. I can go on and on. Then with their latest addition to their abysmal bill, they would have even allowed insurance companies to once again discriminate against Americans with preexisting conditions; something that they said that they wanted to protect, yet their adjustments to their abysmal healthcare bill would have allowed Americans with preexisting conditions to be discriminated against. I mean, when we talk about essential health benefits, I want to stress the word ‘‘essential.’’ They are important, yet they are going down a road that I think is disastrous for millions of American people. Let us begin by being thankful that we are not going to do great harm to our country this week. Now, there is always next week—we have to worry about that—but at least this week they had the common sense to pull this terrible healthcare bill that they have been working on for so long. Let’s hope that we never ever see the bill. I think it is important for people to understand what is at stake. There is an awful lot at stake for tens of millions of Americans here today all across the country. Mr. Speaker, that brings us to today. Let us be clear about why we are here again with yet another continuing resolution, the 29th—yes, you heard that right, the 29th—continuing resolution since Republicans have taken control of the House. Republicans have nobody to blame for this mess but themselves. They control the White House, they control the Senate, and, unfortunately, they control this House. They were even the ones who set this artificial deadline of April 28 in the first place. That was after Republicans gave themselves a 2 month extension and then a 5month extension. Mr. Speaker, this should have all been sorted out last fall, but for 7 months Republicans have played games and delayed and bickered amongst themselves about government funding and health care and other priorities. What do they have to show for it? Nothing. Now, maybe the delay was caused by this obsession from the Republican Conference with repealing the Affordable Care Act and ripping health care away from 24 million Americans. Maybe Republicans have been too busy trying to defund Planned Parenthood, trying to undo important consumer protections put in place by Democrats, trying to tear down commonsense rules to protect public safety and the environment. Perhaps if Republicans had been responsibly working with Democratic leaders during the past 7 months, we could have already funded our government and we could be getting to work on other things that our constituents sent us here to do, like creating jobs and repairing our crumbling infrastructure. We could have avoided events that have transpired during the past 48 hours: an emergency Rules Committee meeting, another Republican martial law rule, and threats of a Saturday session. Mr. Speaker, to put it bluntly, this is about Republican dysfunction and incompetence, plain and simple. If Congress could be sued by the American people for malpractice, we would be in big trouble. This is indefensible. I am sure people who are watching these proceedings are scratching their heads saying: What the hell is going on in the people’s House? For the life of me, I cannot understand why we are constantly at the edge of a cliff. This Republican leadership jumps from one manufactured crisis to the next, and has proven ineffective at carrying out even its most basic responsibilities, like keeping the government’s lights on and funding programs that help our constituents. But don’t take it from me. Listen to what some of my Republican colleagues are saying about the priorities of their own leadership. Representative ROONEY , a Republican from Florida, said: ‘‘I have been in this job 8 years, and I am wracking my brain to think of one thing our party has done that has been something positive, that has been something other than stopping something else from happening.’’ Representative MARIO DIAZBALART  from Florida commented: ‘‘It is pretty evident that we don’t have the votes among Republicans to, in essence, do anything that is real.’’ Mr. Speaker, when you have members of your own party making these kinds of statements, you really have to question the capacity of the Speaker and his leadership team to govern effectively. Mr. Speaker, I very much regret that we are here today to consider another shortterm CR. One week—that is all this bill does, keeps the government running for one additional week. Our constituents expect and deserve better from their elected officials. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman, my friend from Massachusetts, for his words of wisdom about the direction we ought to be going. That is what we are going to do; we are going to continue moving. I find in my job, as I perform my duties, that I have a chance to really interact with a lot of people in government. Over Christmas, I had a chance to visit our troops around the world and look at them and give them the confidence that what we do in Washington will allow them to keep working for freedom and to represent us. Dr. Francis Collins at the National Institutes of Health, an enormously brilliant man who helped with the genome project, who keeps NIH up and working; and at the National Eye Institute, Dr. Paul Sieving; and so many others who do count on us getting it right, whether it be the United States military, whether it is our border patrol, whether it is our health and human services, but the person who knows these characteristics of what it takes to get agreements is also on the Rules Committee. He is a valuable member of our Rules Committee. He is the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE). Mr. Speaker, I yield 10 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE), vice chairman of the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Subcommittee. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman, my good friend, for yielding me the time and for those incredibly gracious and generous remarks. Mr. Speaker, I certainly rise to support the rule and the underlying legislation. By the very nature of Rules debates, everything seems to be partisan because it seems to be sort of shirts and skins as it is on the rules. The reality is the legislation we are talking about has actually been requested by both parties. We had both the chairman and the ranking member in there requesting because they are working together in a bipartisan way to produce a major piece of legislation that will direct spending for the United States government in the range of about $1 trillion between now and September 30. The important thing to note is that it is a very bipartisan negotiation between two very skillful legislators, Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN and Ranking Member NITALOWEY . When they bring that legislation to the floor, as they will next week, it is going to have some pretty important and pretty major things on it. We are not only going to adequately fund our military, we are going to increase that. We are going to give the President some things he has asked for in terms of supplemental money for defense to upgrade and improve our military. b0930 We are going to give him some additional things for border security as well that, again, both parties have agreed on. I think we all want secure borders. We know there is always some debate about exactly how or what we should do, but, in this case, we have a bipartisan agreement. We will actually give a very substantial increase to the National Institutes of Health, which, as the gentleman from Texas (Mr. SESSIONS ) mentioned, great work is done on behalf of the American people in that institution. Frankly, it has been Republicans that first doubled that back in the late 1990s and early 2000s and now have reignited the biomedical research engine by putting additional resources in there. It is 
something our friends support, but actually it was Republicans who took the initiative to achieve. We will see some really important increases in some education programs that give some of our less advantaged citizens opportunities to go: TRIO, GEAR UP. Both prepare individuals for higher education and then have a chance to exploit the opportunity when it comes. So that bill will have a lot of good things in it that will be bipartisan. My good friend from Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN ) mentioned—and I think appropriately so—that there is a certain amount of dysfunction in the appropriations process. Where we probably disagree is—I have got to tell you, it is not new. Since we passed the Budget Control Act over 40 years ago in 1974, budgets and appropriations have been completed on time exactly four times. It didn’t matter who was in charge. So maybe we ought to go back and look at that defective process that was set in motion by our friends back when they controlled both Chambers in overwhelming numbers and rethink how we do this. I do agree with the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN ) that it is important to focus on first things first. And while tax reform is a very important goal that, I think, this Congress will achieve and while health care is a very important goal, which I certainly hope this Conference achieves and I think we are working toward, there is no question the most important thing we do around here is fund the government every day. We make sure that our military has what it needs to protect us and that our border control officials have what they need to make sure they are secure, that we do things like look for cures for Alzheimer’s and cancer at the NIH. To me, that always is the most important thing it has to do. So, in this bill and in the bill that will follow next week, we are actually doing what we should do. We are putting first things first. Let’s make sure these basics are done for the American people, and then let’s get about the important business of changing their Tax Code and making sure that they have the best health care in the world. In my view, Congress could have— and to my friend’s point—could have and should have done this months ago. It is important to note that the Appropriations Committee had reported out all 12 of the bills that fund the dayto day operation of the budget. Five of them actually moved across the floor. We did run into problems in the United States Senate where there was a lot of obstruction, but the Appropriations Committee did its job. We just have to now, as a Congress, do our job and make sure those bills get to the floor in a timely manner, and that we do the right thing so that they pass. The Appropriations Committee can only prepare them. They don’t get to schedule them on the floor. They don’t get to move them across the floor. That has to be done with all sides working together for the good of the American people. Again, it is worth noting that we can do this process. Two years in a row, we have done all 12 bills. So I would hope in the future, as we make these decisions—and my friend is right, a decision was made in November or December. It is not one I agreed with—to wait and say let’s let the new administration have some input on this. Now, there is certainly nothing wrong with that. The new administration wants to come in, and there is a vehicle called a supplemental, where, if they want to tweak the budget, they can do that and they can bring it to the floor, and that is what we should have done. But we shouldn’t ask them to write the budget for the very year in which they show up. They simply don’t have their people in place. They are not ready to do that. They have got to get their Cabinet appointed. So I would hope, in the future, we remember that and do first things first. Still, it is never too late to do the right thing, as my mom used to say. And the right thing to do today is to pass this rule, pass this bill, give our friends, the appropriators, the time that they need to negotiate a final bill. I am confident we will do that; I am confident we will do it on a bipartisan basis, Mr. Speaker; and I am confident we will be back here with a bill the American people can be proud of because that will have been negotiated in good faith, it will be bipartisan, and it will give us the stability that we need from now until September 30. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, also I want to recognize the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE) for another birthday today. The gentleman from Oklahoma was very silent last night at the Rules Committee. He didn’t let us know, so we didn’t say anything. But today is his birthday, and I congratulate him for that. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I have a number of the day for my colleagues. I feel like I am on Sesame Street. This is the 29th closed rule this year. This is the 29th CR of this Republican majority. And the government is about to shut down when the calendar flips after midnight, and it is the 29th. So 29 must be the number of the day. I want to wish the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE) a happy birthday. Maybe he is 29, so it all kind of fits together. I would just say to my colleagues, as an indication of how dysfunctional this place is: How do you get 29 closed rules in 4 months? How do we run a place in such a closed manner? This is supposed to be a deliberative body. We are supposed to be debating issues. People are supposed to have a giveandtake on matters of importance. We have had 29 closed rules in the first 4 months of this year. It is unprecedented. As I have been saying time and time again, when you have a lousy process, you usually end up with lousy legislation. I think that is the case with regard to the repeal and replace of the Affordable Care Act. Here we are at the last minute trying to keep the government open for a week so we could have more time to keep it open for the rest of the year. I mean, this is not the way this place should be run. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. CASTOR), a former member of the Rules Committee. Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, the American people deserve better. The majority is not serving the interest of the families we represent back home. They are not focused on lifting the economic prospects of our small businesses and hardworking families. They are not focused on lifting wages. Instead, we are debating what could be the smallest little extension of government funding ever: 1 week. Are you kidding me? We have just come back this week from a 2week recess. You would think that the majority party would have had the wherewithal to be able to fund the government as required through the end of the fiscal year, which is only September 30. This was leftover business from last year. How small. How unfocused. What a letdown for the people we represent. Has the majority party brought a bill to the floor of the House that we can debate on jobs, on lifting Americans that work hard every day? No. Has the majority party brought a bill to debate where we could talk about how we fix roads and bridges and connect communities and address congestion across the country and create jobs that way? No. The majority party, after the very serious military strike on Syria, could have brought a debate about an authorization of the use of military force where the Congress has been derelict for years in having the debate about a country that has been at war for 16 years. That is very important. People expect us to address the difficult issues, but they haven’t brought that debate. Across the country this week, a lot of seniors in high school are deciding where they are going to attend college or university. We could be having a debate on how we help those families and students afford the cost of a college education or address the student loan crisis. But, no, that debate hasn’t been brought There is going to be a big march in Washington again this weekend on the changing climate. We could discuss and debate the cost of the changing climate, extreme weather events. Boy, my folks back home in the State of Florida are having to look at increased insurance costs, property insurance costs, infrastructure costs because of 
the changing climate, but that debate hasn’t been had. Instead the Congress has been consumed with a healthcare bill that rips coverage away from families, harms Medicare, raises cost on everyone, and they were stuck in a debate this week about ending the guaranteed protection that families now have if they have a preexisting condition. Remember, under the Affordable Care Act, you can no longer be discriminated against if you have a preexisting condition like cancer or diabetes. They were consumed with: Well, how do we end that and send that back to the States to do that? Thank goodness that bill hasn’t been brought to the floor. Instead, here is an extension of running the government. Again, how small. Maybe it does match what is happening in the White House. With the flipflopping, unfocused President, this Republican majority is having real trouble governing the country. I understand the President is consumed with an investigation of associates from his campaign over collusion with the Russians. He is consumed with conflicts of interest and how he doesn’t want to be transparent, whether it is his tax returns or the emoluments under the Constitution. The American people deserve better, and that is what brought me to the floor today. I didn’t have to come and talk about the rule that is on the floor. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. MCGOVERN. I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Florida. Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I didn’t have to come to the floor to oppose a rule and this 1week appropriations bill. But I am so frustrated, just like families and businesses are across this country, that this Congress still refuses to have the debates, have the discussion on the issues that really impact our families back home. They deserve better than this dysfunctional Republican majority. Why don’t we stand up for them for a change? The Democrats are willing to have those debates. Let’s debate and discuss jobs. Let’s debate and discuss how kids can afford the cost of a college education. Let’s discuss how we lift our public schools. Let’s discuss rebuilding America and creating jobs through modern infrastructure investments. Let’s have these debates. Let’s not take up the time of the American people on a silly 1week extension of funding government so we can do this again next week, where we have to debate and take up all the time on how we fund the government until September 30. American families deserve better. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, last night at the Rules Committee, we had a debate where we focused our attention not only on the legislation, but also on the need to get this done. I appreciate the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. CASTOR ), the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE), and the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN ) and their attention to the ideas that they have. They do have ideas, and they do have decisions that would help make this process even better. We are here today for the right reasons. I would advise the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN ) that I do not have any further speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time pending his close. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to close. Mr. Speaker, I think it is clear that there is a lot of frustration on our side because of what is obviously a dysfunctional House. The fact that we are here again at the last minute trying to just keep the government running really is unfortunate. It is sad because it is not like we didn’t know about this date. We have known about it for a long time. My Republicans friends set this date. They have had months and months to figure out a way to keep the government running. They, again, are in control of the House. They are in control of the Senate. They are in control of the White House. Once again, we have a manufactured crisis where we are right at the edge of a cliff, and the best we could do today is kick the can down the road for a week and we will have this little debate again next week. Perhaps if the leadership of this House actually focused on the people’s business instead of on legislation that is about messaging or press releases, perhaps if they focused on the people’s business rather than trying to undermine basic healthcare protections for people, we wouldn’t have these crises all the time. I said at the beginning of my remarks that we can breathe a sigh of relief today because my friends on the Republican side are not bringing up their abysmal repeal and replace of the Affordable Care Act bill. b0945 They have been changing it and changing it, and there was some rumor, President Trump was saying that they would probably bring a bill up to pass it in his first 100 days because somehow it is more important to do something in 100 days than it is to get it right. But, nonetheless, they added another provision which they claim makes it more palatable to their Members. But I want my colleagues to understand that what they have done is made a bad bill worse. The American College of Physicians sent us a letter to all Members, Democrats and Republicans, and I will just read one sentence from it. ‘‘This amendment’’ that my Republican friends added to their healthcare bill ‘‘would make the harmful AHCA even worse by creating new coverage barriers for patients with preexisting conditions and weakening requirements that insurers cover essential benefits.’’ I include in the RECORD the letter from the American College of Physicians. 
AMERICAN COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS , April 24, 2017. Hon. PAULRYAN, Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. MITCH MCCONNELL , Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Hon. NANCY PELOSI , Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. CHARLES SCHUMER , Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. DEAR SPEAKER RYAN, M INORITY LEADER  PELOSI , MAJORITY LEADER MCCONNELL , AND MINORITY LEADER SCHUMER : On behalf of the American College of Physicians (ACP), I am writing to urge Congress to move away from the harmful changes to patient care that would occur if the American Health Care Act (AHCA) were to become law, and to instead work for bipartisan solutions to improve the Affordable Care Act (ACA) rather than repealing and replacing it. We believe that the AHCA, which would repeal and replace the most important coverage and consumer protections created by the ACA, is so fundamentally flawed that it cannot be made acceptable. We understand that the leadership in the House of Representatives continues to explore ways to bring a modified version of the AHCA to a vote, based on a draft amendment reportedly being developed by Representatives MacArthur and Meadows, a summary of which was made available to the public through news organizations. This amendment would make the harmful AHCA even worse by creating new coverage barriers for patients with preexisting conditions and weakening requirements that insurers cover essential benefits. The American College of Physicians is the largest medical specialty organization and the secondlargest physician group in the United States. ACP members include 148,000 internal medicine physicians (internists), related subspecialists, and medical students. Internal medicine physicians are specialists who apply scientific knowledge and clinical expertise to the diagnosis, treatment, and compassionate care of adults across the spectrum from health to complex illness. The draft MacArthurMeadows amendment would create what is known as the ‘‘Limited Waiver Option’’ that would allow states to eliminate or severely weaken vital ACA Title I consumer protections—specifically, community rating and essential health benefits (EHBs)—returning the country to the preACA days when persons with preexisting ‘‘declinable’’ medical conditions in most states were priced out of the market and the insurance products available in the individual market did not cover medically necessary services. Specifically; The MacArthurMeadows amendment would create an option for states to obtain Limited Waivers from certain federal standards that would gut existing law consumer protections. Based on a summary of the draft amendment, states could seek Limited Waivers for: Essential Health Benefits (EHBs) Communityrating rules, except for the following categories, which are not waivable: Gender or Age (except for reductions of the 5:1 age ratio previously established) or Health Status (unless the state has established a highrisk pool or is participating in a federal highrisk pool) To obtain the waiver, states would only need to ‘‘attest that the purpose of their requested waiver is to reduce premium costs, 
increase the number of persons with healthcare coverage, or advance another benefit to the public interest in the state , including the guarantee of coverage for persons with preexisting medical conditions. The Secretary shall approve applications within 90 days of determining that an application is complete.’’ [Emphasis added in italics]. In other words, as long as a state attested that there was a ‘‘benefit to the public,’’ insurers would be once again allowed to charge more to people with preexisting conditions, or decline to cover needed benefits like physician and hospital visits, maternity care and contraception, mental health and substance use disorder treatments, preventive services, and prescription drugs. This would take us back to the days when people had to fill out intrusive insurance company applications to document their previous health history, even before being advised what the premium would be based on their individual health risk. Unlike community rating, which bases premiums based on the expected costs associated with all persons in the insurance pool (adjusted only by age, tobacco use, and family size), the Limited Waiver would again allow insurers in states that obtain a waiver to again charge people exorbitant and unaffordable premiums for their preexisting conditions. Before the ACA, insurance plans sold in the individual insurance market in all but five states typically maintained lists of so called ‘‘declinable’’ medical conditions—including asthma, diabetes, arthritis, obesity, stroke, or pregnancy, or having been diagnosed with cancer in the past 10 years. Even if a revised bill would not explicitly repeal the current law’s guaranteedissue require ment—which requires insurers to offer coverage to persons with preexisting conditions like these—guaranteed issue without community rating allows insurers to charge as much as they believe a patient’s treatment will cost . The result would be that many patients with pre existing conditions would be offered coverage that costs them thousands of dollars more for the care that they need, and in the case of patients with expensive conditions like cancer, even hundreds of thousands more. An amendment to the AHCA reported out of the Rules Committee on April 6th to establish a ‘‘Federal Invisible Risk Sharing Program,’’ which would create a fund that states could use to reimburse insurers for some of the costs associated with insuring sicker patients, would not offset the harm done to patients with preexisting conditions by allowing the Limited Waiver of community rating and essential benefit protections. The preACA experience with highrisk pools was that many had long waiting lists, and offered inadequate coverage with high deductibles and insufficient benefits. Unless a national highrisk pool is supported with a massive infusion of funding it will not be sufficient to cover the millions of people with preexisting conditions that would be denied or charged more for coverage under the AHCA. One paper estimates that a national highrisk pool would cost $178.1 billion a year, roughly $176.4 billion more than the annual funding provided to the Invisible Risk Sharing Program. Also, shifting people out of the existing health insurance marketplace to a highrisk pool would undermine the assurance that enrollees could keep their existing coverage. The Limited Waiver Option will also allow states to seek waivers from the essential health benefits required of all plans sold in the individual insurance market, with the result that millions of patients will be at risk of losing coverage for essential services like maternity care, cancer screening tests and treatments, prescription drugs, preventive services, mental health and substance use disorder treatments, and even physician visits, prescription drugs and hospitalizations. Prior to passage of the ACA, 62% of individual market enrollees did not have cov erage of maternity services, 34% did not have substanceuse disorderservices, 18% did not have mentalhealth services and 9% did not have coverage for prescription drugs. A recent independent analysis found that the AHCA’s repeal of current law required benefits would result in patients on average paying $1,952 more for cancer drugs; $1,807 for drugs for heart disease; $1,127 for drugs to treat lung diseases; $1,607 for drugs to treat mental illnesses; $4,940 for inpatient admission for mental health; $4,555 for inpatient admission for substance use treatment; and $8,501 for maternity care. Such increased costs would make it practically impossible for many patients to avail themselves of the care they need. The result will be delays in getting treatment until their illnesses present at a more advanced, less treatable, and more expensive stage, or not keeping up with lifesaving medications prescribed by their physicians. Allowing states to eliminate the EHB will threaten our nation’s fight against the opioid epidemic. A study concluded that with repeal of the ACA, ‘‘approximately 1,253,000 people with serious mental disorders and about 2.8 million Americans with a substance use disorder, of whom about 222,000 have an opioid disorder, would lose some or all of their insurance coverage.’’ Finally, allowing states to drop important benefits like maternity, substance use disorder treatment, and preventive services will do little to reduce premiums. A report by Milliman found that the main drivers of premium costs were ambulatory patient services, hospitalization, and prescription drugs. These are crucial services that form the core of any health insurance plan. To be clear: while some younger and healthier persons might be offered lower premiums in states that obtained a ‘‘Limited Waiver’’ of communityrating and essential health benefits, it would be at the expense of making coverage unaffordable for those who need it most, older and sicker persons, and result in skimpy ‘‘barebones’’ insurance for many others that does not cover the medical care they would need if and when they get sick. Finally, even without the Limited Waiver Amendment, ACP continues to believe that the AHCA has numerous other provisions and policies that that will do great harm to patients including: The phaseout of the higher federal match in states that have opted to expand Medicaid and the ban on nonexpansion states being able to access the higher federal contribution if they choose to expand Medicaid; Converting the shared federalstate financing structure for Medicaid to one that would cap the federal contribution per enrollee; Providing states with a Medicaid block grant financing option; Eliminating EHBs for Medicaid expansion enrollees; Imposing work or job search requirements on certain Medicaid enrollees; Regressive agebased tax credits, combined with changes that will allow insurers to charge older people much higher premiums than allowed under current law; Continuous coverage requirements for patients with preexisting conditions; Legislative or regulatory restrictions that would deny or result in discrimination in the awarding of federal grant funds and/or Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program funding to women’s health clinics that are qualified under existing federal law for the provision of evidencebased services including, but not limited to, provision of contraception, preventive health screenings, sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment, vaccines, counseling, rehabilitation, and referrals, and; Elimination of the Prevention and Public Health Fund, which provides billions in dollars to the enters for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent and control the spread of infectious diseases. The College strongly believes in the first, do no harm principle. Therefore, we continue to urge that Congress move away from the fundamentally flawed and harmful policies that would result from the American Health Care Act and from the changes under consideration—including the proposed ‘‘Limited Waiver’’ amendment—that would make the bill even worse for patients. We urge Congress to instead start over and seek agreement on bipartisan ways to improve and build on the ACA. The College welcomes the opportunity to share our ideas for bipartisan solutions that would help make health care better, more accessible, and more affordable for patients rather than imposing great harm on them as the AHCA would do. Sincerely, JACKENDE, MD, MACP, President. 
Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, we have a press release from the American Hospital Association. Their line here is: ‘‘Our top concern is what this change could mean for older and sicker patients, including those with preexisting conditions such as cancer patients and those with chronic conditions’’ could suffer. ‘‘This amendment proposed this week would dramatically worsen the bill.’’ I include in the RECORD the American Hospital Association press release. 
[From the American Hospital Association— April 27, 2017] STATEMENT ON THE AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT (By Rick Pollack, President and CEO, American Hospital Association) The latest version of the AHCA continues to put health coverage in jeopardy for many Americans. Our top concern is what this change could mean for older and sicker patients, including those with preexisting conditions, such as cancer patients and those with chronic conditions. For these reasons, along with our previously stated concerns about the AHCA, we cannot support the bill. However, we urge Congress to continue to work with stakeholders on a solution that provides meaningful coverage. The amendment proposed this week would dramatically worsen the bill. The changes included put consumer protections at greater risk by allowing states to waive the essential health benefit standards, which could leave patients without access to critical health services and increase outofpocket spending. This could allow plans to set premium prices based on individual risk for some consumers, which could significantly raise costs for those with preexisting conditions. Additionally, the Congressional Budget Office has not yet scored the amendment. However, CBO previously projected that the AHCA would result in 24 million fewer people covered in 2026. It is unlikely this amendment would improve these coverage estimates. As the backbone of America’s health safetynet, hospitals and health systems must protect access to care for those who need it and ensure that the most vulnerable patients are not left behind. The AHCA continues to fall far short of that goal. 
Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, the AARP issued yet another statement saying: ‘‘This harmful legislation still puts an age tax on older Americans and puts vulnerable populations at risk through a series of backdoor deals that attempts to shift responsibility to States.’’ I include in the RECORD the statement from the AARP. 
WOULD HARM AMERICAN FAMILIES  WASHINGTON , DC.—AARP Executive Vice President Nancy LeaMond released the following statement today in response to the amended House bill that would create an ‘‘Age Tax,’’ increase premiums, eliminate protections for preexisting conditions, cut the life of Medicare, and give sweetheart deals to big drug and insurance companies. In a letter sent to all 435 members of the U.S. House of Representatives, AARP restated its strong opposition to the bill and urged each Representative to vote ‘No’ on the proposed legislation. AARP believes this legislation will have a significant harmful impact on the health of millions of older Americans ages 50 to 64, as well as other vulnerable groups, including poor seniors and disabled children and adults: ‘‘This harmful legislation still puts an Age Tax on older Americans and puts vulnerable populations at risk through a series of backdoor deals that attempts to shift responsibility to states. Older Americans need affordable health care services and prescriptions. This legislation still goes in the opposite direction, increasing insurance premiums for older Americans and not doing anything to lower drug costs. ‘‘AARP continues to oppose legislation that would impose an Age Tax, eliminate protections for preexisting conditions, weaken Medicare, erode seniors’ ability to live independently because of billions of dollars in Medicaid cuts, and give sweetheart deals to drug and insurance companies while doing nothing to lower the cost of health care or prescription drugs. ‘‘We intend to let all 38 million of our members know exactly how their Representative votes on this bill in newsletters, in our publications, on social media and in other formats. Our members care deeply about their health care and have told us repeatedly that they want to know where their elected officials stand.’’ Past statements and releases about this bill can be found here, here, here, and here. Public policy fact sheets about the Age Tax and other harmful policies can be found here. AARP’s full letter to the House of Representatives can be found below: APRIL 26, 2017. DEAR REPRESENTATIVE : AARP, with its nearly 38 million members in all 50 States and the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and U.S. Virgin Islands, is a nonpartisan, nonprofit, nationwide organization that helps people turn their goals and dreams into real possibilities, strengthens communities and fights for the issues that matter most to consumers and families such as healthcare, employment and income security, retirement planning, affordable utilities and protection from financial abuse. We write to again share our opposition to the pending American Health Care Act (AHCA) and urge you to vote NO. Throughout consideration of the AHCA, we have been expressing serious concerns about the impact that this legislation will have on older Americans. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO)’s last estimate further demonstrates the harmful impact of this bill on older Americans and some of our most vulnerable. Specifically, we are concerned that the American Health Care Act will weaken the fiscal sustainability of Medicare; dramatically increase premium and outofpocket costs for 50–64 year olds purchasing coverage on the individual insurance market; substantially increase the number of Americans without insurance; and put at risk millions of children and adults with disabilities and poor seniors who depend on the Medicaid program to access longterm services and supports and other benefits. In addition, changes under consideration that would allow states to waive important consumer protections—such as allowing insurance companies to once again charge Americans with preexisting conditions more because they’ve had cancer, diabetes or heart disease—would make this bad bill even worse. Our members and others 50 years of age and older care deeply about health care and want to know where their elected leaders stand. Recognizing the importance of the upcoming vote on the American Health Care Act, AARP intends to inform our members, and others over age 50, how their elected officials voted. We’ll communicate the results of the vote in our widelycirculated publications, in email alerts, in our online channels, and through the media. Again, we urge all Representatives to vote NO on the American Health Care Act in its current form. MEDICARE  Our members and older Americans believe that Medicare must be protected and strengthened for today’s seniors and future generations. We strongly oppose any changes to current law that could result in cuts to benefits, increased costs, or reduced coverage for older Americans. According to the 2016 Medicare Trustees report, the Medicare Part A Trust Fund is solvent until 2028 (11 years longer than preAffordable Care Act (ACA)), due in large part to changes made in the ACA. We have serious concerns that the American Health Care Act repeals provisions in current law that have strengthened Medicare’s fiscal outlook, specifically, the repeal of the additional 0.9 percent payroll tax on higherincome workers. Repealing this provision would remove $117.3 billion from the Hospital Insurance trust fund over the next ten years, would hasten the insolvency of Medicare by up to four years, and diminish Medicare’s ability to pay for services in the future. 
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS  Older Americans use prescription drugs more than any other segment of the U.S. population, typically on a chronic basis. We are pleased that the bill maintains the Medicare Part D coverage gap (‘‘donut hole’’) protections created under the ACA. Since the enactment of the law, more than 11.8 million Medicare beneficiaries who have fallen into the coverage gap have saved over $26.8 billion on the improved coverage for prescription drug costs due to closure of the donut hole. We do have strong concerns that the fee on manufacturers and importers of branded prescription drugs, which currently is projected to add $24.8 billion to the Medicare Part B trust fund between 2017 and 2026, will be repealed by the American Health Care Act. Rather than repeal this fee for Medicare, AARP believes Congress must do more to reduce the burden of high prescription drug costs on consumers and taxpayers, and we would be willing to work with you on bipartisan solutions. 
INDIVIDUAL PRIVATE INSURANCE MARKET  About 6.1 million Americans age 50–64 currently purchase insurance in the nongroup market, and nearly 3.2 million are currently eligible to receive subsidies for health insurance coverage through either the federal health benefits exchange or a statebased exchange (exchange). We have seen a significant reduction in the number of uninsured since passage of the ACA, with the number of 50–64 year old Americans who are uninsured dropping by half. We are deeply concerned that the AHCA would be a significant step backwards and result in millions of older Americans who cannot afford their health care, including many simply losing their health care. Based on CBO estimates, approximately 14 million Americans will lose coverage next year, while a total of 24 million Americans would lose coverage over the next 10 years. This is especially troubling given that in the CBO and Joint Committee on Taxation’s (JCT) assessment ‘‘the nongroup (individual) market would probably be stable in most areas . . . under current law.’’ Affordability of both premiums and cost sharing is critical to older Americans and their ability to obtain and access health care. A typical 50–64 year old seeking coverage through an exchange has a median annual income of under $25,000 and already pays significant outofpocket costs for health care. We have serious concerns—reinforced by the CBO estimate—that the bill under consideration will dramatically increase health care costs for 50–64 year olds who purchase health care through an exchange due both to the changes in age rating from 3:1 (already a compromise that requires uninsured older Americans to pay three times more than younger individuals) to 5:1 and reductions in current tax credits for older Americans. CBO concluded that the bill will substantially raise premiums for older people and force many into lower quality plans. Age rating plus reduced tax credits equal an unaffordable age tax. Our previous estimates on the agerating change showed that premiums for current coverage could increase by up to $3,200 for a 64 year old, while reducing premiums by only about $700 for a younger enrollee. Significant premium increases for older consumers will make insurance less affordable, will not address their expressed concern about rising premiums, and only encourage a small increase in the enrollment numbers for younger persons. In addition to increasing premiums from the age rating change, the bill reduced the tax credits available for older Americans to help purchase insurance. We estimate that the bill’s changes to current law’s tax credits alone could increase premium costs for a 55 year old earning $25,000 by more than $2,300 a year. For a 64year old earning $25,000, that increased premium rises to more than $4,400 a year, and more than $5,800 for a 64year old earning $15,000. Overall, both the bill’s tax credit changes and 5:1 age rating would result in skyrocketing cost increases for older Americans. In their analysis, CBO found that a 64 year old earning $26,500 a year would see their premiums increase by $12,900—758 percent—from $1,700 to $14,600 a year. In addition, older workers could also face higher outofpocket costs because the bill eliminates costsharing subsidies which help lowerincome Americans with their copays and deductibles. It cannot be overstated how much this bill would erase recent gains in health care coverage and affordability for 50– 64 year olds, leading to large spikes in the number of uninsured and financial hardship for millions of older Americans. Current law prohibits insurance companies from discriminating against individuals due to a preexisting condition. We are extremely concerned that the bill may now repeal pre 
existing condition protections and would once again allow insurance companies to charge Americans more due to a preexisting condition. We estimate that 40 percent of 50 to 64yearolds (or about 25 million people in this age group) have a deniable preexisting condition and risk losing access to affordable coverage. We strongly oppose any weakening of the law’s preexisting condition protections which benefit millions of Americans. 
SUPPORTS  AARP opposes the provisions of the American Health Care Act that create a per capita cap financing structure in the Medicaid program. We are concerned that these provisions could endanger the health, safety, and care of millions of individuals who depend on the essential services provided through Medicaid. CBO found that the bill would cut Medicaid funding by $880 billion over 2017– 2026. By 2026, CBO expects Medicaid spending to be about 25 percent less than what it projects under current law. Medicaid is a vital safety net and intergenerational lifeline for millions of individuals, including over 17.4 million lowincome seniors and children and adults with disabilities who rely on the program for critical health care and longterm services and supports (LTSS, i.e., assistance with daily activities such as eating, bathing, dressing, managing medications, and transportation). Older adults and people with disabilities now account for over sixty percent of Medicaid spending, and cuts of this magnitude will result in loss of benefits and services for this vulnerable population. Of these 17.4 million individuals: 6.9 million are ages 65 and older (which equals more than 1 in every 7 elderly Medicare beneficiaries); 10.5 million are children and adults living with disabilities; and about 10.8 million are so poor or have a disability that they qualify for both Medicare and Medicaid (dual eligibles). Dual eligibles account for almost 33 percent of Medicaid spending. While they comprise a relatively small percentage of enrollees, they account for a disproportionate share of total Medicare and Medicaid spending. Individuals with disabilities of all ages and older adults rely on critical Medicaid services, including home and communitybased services (HCBS) for assistance with daily activities such as eating, bathing, dressing, and home modifications; nursing home care; and other benefits such as hearing aids and eyeglasses. People with disabilities of all ages also rely on Medicaid for access to comprehensive acute health care services. For working adults, Medicaid can help them continue to work; for children, it allows them to stay with their families and receive the help they need at home or in their community. Individuals may have low incomes, face high medical costs, or have already spent through their resources paying outofpocket for LTSS, and need these critical services. For these individuals, Medicaid is a program of last resort. In providing a fixed amount of federal funding per person, this approach to financing would likely result in overwhelming cost shifts to states, state taxpayers, and families unable to shoulder the costs of care without sufficient federal support. This would result in cuts to program eligibility, services, or both—ultimately harming some of our nation’s most vulnerable citizens. In terms of seniors, we have serious concerns about setting caps at a time when perbeneficiary spending for poor seniors is likely to increase in future years. By 2026, when Boomers start to turn age 80 and older, they will likely need much higher levels of service—including HCBS and nursing home— moving them into the highest cost group of all seniors. As this group continues to age, their level of need will increase as well as their overall costs. We are also concerned that caps will not accurately reflect the cost of care for individuals in each state, including for children and adults with disabilities and seniors, especially those living with the most severe disabling conditions. CBO estimates that Medicaid spending on a perenrollee basis would grow at a faster rate than the consumer price index for medical care services (CPI–M)—3.7 percent for CPI–M versus an average annual growth rate of 4.4 percent for Medicaid over the 2017–2026 period. Over time, the difference in the growth rate under the per capita cap (CPI–M) and the actual cost of care would further shift costs to states, which could result in even greater potential harm to some of the most vulnerable individuals. AARP is also opposed to the repeal of the six percent enhanced federal Medicaid match for states that take up the Community First Choice (CFC) Option. CFC provides states with a financial incentive to offer HCBS to help older adults and people with disabilities live in their homes and communities where they want to be. About 90 percent of older adults want to remain in their own homes and communities for as long as possible. HCBS are also cost effective. On average, in Medicaid, the cost of HCBS per person is one third the cost of institutional care. Taking away the enhanced match could disrupt services for older adults and people with disabilities in the states that are already providing services under CFC and would result in a loss of about $12 billion for HCBS over ten years. AARP also has concerns with the removal of the state option in Medicaid to increase the home equity limit above the federal minimum. This provision would take away flexibility for states to adjust a Medicaid eligibility criterion based on the specific circumstances of each state and its residents beyond a federal minimum standard. AARP continues to support critical consumer protections included in current law, including guaranteed issue, prohibitions on preexisting condition exclusions, bans on annual and lifetime coverage limits and allowing families to keep children on their policies until the age of 26. Also, AARP continues to support restoring the 7.5 percent threshold for the medical expense deduction which will directly help older Americans struggling to pay for health care, particularly the high cost of nursing homes and other longterm services and supports. We look forward to working with you to ensure that we maintain a strong health care system that ensures robust insurance market protections, controls costs, improves quality, and provides affordable coverage to all Americans. Sincerely, NANCY A. L EAMOND, Executive Vice President and Chief Advocacy and Engagement Officer. 
Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, the American Medical Association sent letters to Speaker RYAN and Minority Leader PELOSI saying that ‘‘We are deeply concerned that the AHCA would result in millions of Americans losing their current health insurance coverage. Nothing in the’’ socalled ‘‘MacArthur amendment remedies the shortcomings of the underlying bill.’’ And then they say that, basically, this addition that the Republicans added to the healthcare bill ‘‘could effectively make coverage completely unaffordable for people with preexisting conditions.’’ I include in the RECORD the letter from the American Medical Association. 
AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION , Chicago, IL, April 27, 2017. Hon. PAULRYAN, Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. NANCY PELOSI , Democratic Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR SPEAKER RYAN AND LEADER PELOSI : After reviewing the MacArthur Amendment to H.R. 1628, the American Health Care Act (AHCA), the American Medical Association (AMA) remains opposed to passage of this legislation. As we have previously stated, we are deeply concerned that the AHCA would result in millions of Americans losing their current health insurance coverage. Nothing in the MacArthur amendment remedies the shortcomings of the underlying bill. The amendment does not offer a clear longterm framework for stabilizing and strengthening the individual health insurance market to ensure that low and moderate income patients are able to secure affordable and adequate coverage, nor does it ensure that Medicaid and other critical safety net programs are maintained and adequately funded. The MacArthur Amendment would allow states to apply for waivers from critical consumer protections provided in the Affordable Care Act (ACA), including the age rating ratio of 3 to 1, the requirements that health insurers must cover certain essential health benefits, and the ban on health status underwriting. The current ban on health status underwriting protects individuals from being discriminated against by virtue of their medical conditions. Prior to the passage of the ACA, such individuals were routinely denied coverage and/or priced out of affordable coverage. We are particularly concerned about allowing states to waive this requirement because it will likely lead to patients losing their coverage. Although the MacArthur Amendment states that the ban on preexisting conditions remains intact, this assurance may be illusory as health status underwriting could effectively make coverage completely unaffordable to people with preexisting conditions. There is also no certainty that the requirement for states to have some kind of reinsurance or highrisk pool mechanism to help such individuals will be sufficient to provide for affordable health insurance or prevent discrimination against individuals with certain highcost medical conditions. We continue to strongly urge Congress to engage in a bipartisan, bicameral dialogue with stakeholders to work on policies that enhance coverage, choice, and affordability. Sincerely, JAMES L. M ADARA , MD. 
Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I find all this particularly puzzling because my friends have said over and over and over and over again that they agree with Democrats when it comes to protecting people with preexisting conditions. They said that they do not want insurance companies to have the ability to discriminate against people with preexisting conditions. And yet what they have done is they have created a repealandreplacement bill that does just that and then goes after essential benefits. Again, we have been talking about essential benefits over and over and over again. And again, I want to remind my colleagues what the word ‘‘essential’’ means. Go to the dictionary. 
Look up the word ‘‘essential.’’ It says, absolutely necessary, extremely important. That is the definition of essential. And so when we talk about essential health benefits, that is what we are talking about. I have one additional speaker. I was going to close, but I would ask indulgence. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON  LEE). Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as the gentleman from Massachusetts was speaking, I rushed to the floor because he was making such eloquent and important statements, and I wanted to make sure to join him on recognizing that, though we are pushing the can down the road, we know what the mindset of the administration is in terms of funding this country. As a member of the Budget Committee, we received the skinny budget, and, to my dismay, it was a budget that harmed and hurt and undermined the governance of this Nation. I think it is important to match the Affordable Care Act with the outside needs of living and thriving in this Nation. So my Houston Housing Authority has now stopped vouchers for families in Section 8 housing for fear of not having the money. They had breaking news 2 days ago telling those families, don’t show up because we have no money to house you—similar to no money and no room at the inn. The zeroing out of the community development dollars, which ends our opportunities for parks and sidewalks and housing and fixing those hurricane roofs of senior citizens who are living in devastation from Hurricane Ike. It is not realizing the importance of the National Endowment for the Arts or recognizing the EPA and clean air and clean water for those of us who live near the Gulf or near the border. It is not recognizing that you are not the President of the 10 percent that may approve of what you are doing, but you are the President of the United States of America. And then, for those who work in health care, in a meeting I just had with the National Institutes of Health, $6 billion cut. Do you realize that one of the institutes sends 88 percent of their moneys out for grants so that researchers, young scientists who live here in the United States, can thrive and provide new kinds of research? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. MCGOVERN. I yield the gentlewoman from Texas an additional 1 minute. Ms. JACKSON LEE. There are 27 institutes in the National Institutes of Health. One of them happens to deal with diabetes. The number one is cancer. And for those of us who have experienced it, and for AfricanAmerican women and others who have the triple negative trait, breast cancer, the research of the NIH is crucial. Or Dr. Fauci’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Dr. Peter Hotez, in Houston, head of Baylor Infectious Diseases, understands Ebola and Zika. We need these resources. What an outrage to cut, in the skinny budget, $6 billion. So we may push this to another 7 days, but I can tell you that we are pushing the hearts and minds of Americans. We are creating a disaster. And I can’t appreciate the fact that law enforcement will be losing funding. The Department of Justice and the Civil Rights Division, in spite of who is leading that Department, it is a Department for the vulnerable. So I thank the gentleman for providing me with this time, but I wanted to make sure that we added this long litany of those who will be negatively impacted and that America is not about that. America is about serving all of the people of the United States. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank the gentlewoman for her remarks. I thank the chairman of the Rules Committee for his indulgence. I would just close by saying I think it is sad that we are here at the last minute trying to kick the can down the road to keep the government running again for 1 additional week. This could have been avoided and, again, it could have been avoided if, instead of trying to take away people’s health insurance, instead of trying to take away people’s essential health benefits, instead of trying to cut Medicaid by $800 billion and taking that money and giving a tax break of close to $1 trillion to the richest people in the country, that we actually focused on our job, which is keeping this government running. But my colleagues on the Republican side are in charge. We are where we are. We have to keep the government running. Having said all of that, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I want to thank the gentleman from Massachusetts. I want to thank the gentlewoman from Florida and the gentlewoman from Texas for their comments about trying to focus us on the activities that perhaps they would want or not want. Mr. Speaker, today we are here because Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN and Ranking Member LOWEY came to the Rules Committee yesterday and asked us to please consider the offer that they were laying on the table, and that is to fund the government for 1 more week, with an assurance that they needed 1 more week to complete their work. You heard the gentleman, the Honorable TOM COLE, distinguished gentleman from not only Oklahoma, but a gentleman from the Appropriations Committee, reinforce how important the work is. We have heard from our colleagues on the Democratic side how important the NIH is, Francis Collins, the work that he does there; the United States Military; Secretary of Defense Mattis; the men and women that protect us; those people that are in Homeland Security. That is what we are going to do, so that is what we are going to focus on, and that is just the way it is. So, Mr. Speaker, I would urge all my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying legislation. I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. The previous question was ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the resolution. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were—yeas 235, nays 178, not voting 17, as follows: [Roll No. 235] YEAS—235

b1021 Mr. LEVIN changed his vote from ‘‘yea’’ to ‘‘nay.’’ Mr. KATKO and Ms. ROSEN changed their vote from ‘‘nay’’ to ‘‘yea.’’ So the resolution was agreed to. The result of the vote was announced as above recorded. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 289, I call up the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 99) making further continuing appropriations for fiscal year 2017, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 289, the joint resolution is considered read. The text of the joint resolution is as follows: H.J. R ES. 99 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2017 (division C of Public Law 114–223) is further amended by— (1) striking the date specified in section 106(3) and inserting ‘‘May 5, 2017’’; and (2) inserting after section 201 the following new section: ‘‘SEC. 202. (a) This section may be cited as the ‘Further Continued Health Benefits for Miners Act’. ‘‘(b) Section 402(h)(2)(C)(ii) of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (30 U.S.C. 1232(h)(2)(C)(ii)) is amended— ‘‘(1) in subclause (II), by striking ‘April 30, 2017’ and inserting ‘May 5, 2017’; ‘‘(2) in subclause (II)(aa), by striking ‘the Continued Health Benefits for Miners Act’ and inserting ‘the Further Continued Health Benefits for Miners Act’; and ‘‘(3) by adding at the end the following: ‘For purposes of subclause (II)(aa), a beneficiary enrolled in the Plan as of the date of the enactment of the Further Continued Health Benefits for Miners Act shall be deemed to have been eligible to receive health benefits under the Plan on January 1, 2017.’. ‘‘(c) The provisions of section 167(d) of Public Law 114–223 (as added by Public Law 114– 254) shall apply to this section.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. FRELING HUYSEN ) and the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. LOWEY ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey. 
Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.J. Res. 99. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New Jersey? There was no objection. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today to present H.J. Res. 99, a shortterm continuing resolution that will keep our government open for an additional week while work is completed on a fullyear funding package. First, I would like to thank Ranking Member LOWEY for her efforts on this bill and, more broadly, on her valuable participation in the appropriations process over many years. Our current continuing resolution expires today at midnight. Working together with the Senate, our leadership, and the White House, we are on track to have a fullyear, fiscal year 2017 appropriations legislation completed soon, but we need a little more time to process it and prepare it for the floor. This resolution will ensure that the government stays open for another week, until May 5, 2017, to give Congress additional time. It extends current funding levels for essential government operations that the American people rely on, including, most importantly, our national defense. It continues all policy and funding provisions in the currently enacted continuing resolution. In addition, it includes an extension of the December CR provision for healthcare benefits for retired coal miners and their dependents for the length of the continuing resolution. Congress must pass this legislation today to keep the government open and operating as we wrap up our fullyear fiscal year 2017 work. It is our constitutional duty and responsibility. A continuing resolution is never anyone’s first choice for funding the government; however, this is our best path forward. This CR is very short term, very limited in scope, and will help us complete our important work of funding the government for the rest of fiscal year 2017. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. At the outset, I want to thank Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN . It has been a pleasure for me to work with him. I am cautiously optimistic that we will complete this process. Although overdue, we will get our work done. This is the third continuing resolution during fiscal year 2017. We should be voting today on a bipartisan omnibus appropriations act, not another stopgap bill to keep the government running. After all, we are 7 months into the fiscal year. Federal departments and agencies have been operating on outdated funding levels and policies for more than half of the year. This is unacceptable, and it cannot continue. Assuming we get to a solution that lasts the remainder of the fiscal year, I do hope Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN will help avoid this outcome in the future. The continuing resolution we are considering today is a simple date change to continue government funding through next Friday and to extend health insurance for miners through the same day. The backdrop of this continuing resolution is ongoing negotiations on an omnibus appropriations act. Democrats continue to work in good faith to develop a bipartisan omnibus that provides sufficient funding for critical priorities and rejects divisive poison pill riders. For many months, Democrats have been clear that we will not help pass an omnibus that fails to meet these basic standards, and that remains the case. 
As if this process weren’t difficult enough, it occurs as the majority is seeking to strip health insurance from 20 million Americans and repeal protections against insurance company discrimination for millions more. Meanwhile, President Trump continues to tweet false and damaging comments about the omnibus negotiations. It is my hope that these games will end so that we can come together to support investments that create jobs, improve infrastructure, provide a quality education for every student, and invest in technology and biomedical research that will benefit hardworking Americans. To achieve this, we must make progress on eliminating poison pill riders and advancing shared priorities in an omnibus appropriations act. Next week, we must not consider a fourth continuing resolution, but instead have a positive, bipartisan bill after this unnecessarily lengthy process. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. b1030 Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER ), the Democratic whip. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I am so pleased to be here in the House. I am not pleased that we are considering a continuing resolution. To that extent, I presume that I share the opinion of the chairman of the committee, Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN . I presume, as she has just articulated, that I share the opinion of the ranking member from New York. Mr. Speaker, we are now 7 months into fiscal year 2017. We have 5 months remaining, and the majority party has been unable to fund government for the balance of the fiscal year. They have over 218 votes in this body, and they have over 50 votes in the Senate. Now, you need 60 votes in the Senate, so it is more complicated. I understand that. But they now have a Republican President. As we did for the 2016 budget, which we passed in December of 2015 to the balance for September 30, 2016—I know all those dates run together—it was my desire and my advice, Mr. Speaker, that we do the same thing last December: pass an omnibus, take all the bills that the Committee on Appropriations has spent literally hundreds of hours hearing and making decisions on, make the compromises necessary in a democratic body so that 218 votes would be available. Now, the American public, if they have been watching closely, will see that not a single major appropriation bill has passed this House without Democratic help, so that everybody in this body knows that whatever is done in a major fiscal bill has to be done in a bipartisan way. The good news for this House is Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN understands that well, based upon his experience and his observations, and, in my view, is willing to work together. I know that that also applies to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. LOWEY ). I had the opportunity to be on the Committee on Appropriations for 23 years. I am still a member of that committee on leave because I am a whip at this point in time. I am going to vote for this continuing resolution, but I want to put my colleagues and the American people on notice, Mr. Speaker, that I will not vote for another one. I said to the press a month ago that I would vote for a continuing resolution today only if we had an agreement and the continuing resolution was for the purpose of allowing sufficient time to memorialize that agreement; in other words, put it down on paper and pass it through the House and the Senate. We are, unfortunately, not in that position today. It is my understanding from Mrs. LOWEY , with whom I talked this morning, that there are still significant items that are not resolved. Mr. Speaker, I talked to the Speaker, Mr. RYAN, and to the majority leader standing right there on the floor just hours ago yesterday. It is my understanding that the Speaker’s intention is that we have a bill filed Monday night so, in the Speaker’s words, we can give 72 hours to review that bill and then pass it on Thursday. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I hope that the Speaker’s intention is carried out, which will require, over the next 72 hours, hard work by Members and by staff and a willingness to understand that each side has some things it must have and each side has some things it cannot do. That is the nature of the legislative process. If we exercise the responsibility that our constituents hoped that we would exercise when they sent us to this body, surely we can do that. I want to tell my friend, the chairman, for whom I have great respect—I hope that doesn’t hurt him too much on his side of the aisle—that I want you to be able to say that Mr. HOYER said he was going to urge his colleagues not to vote for another CR, and that, therefore, unless you have 218 votes on your side for whatever the product that you produce, that if we are going to fund government, as we surely should do, that we come to an agreement. Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Committee on Appropriations for 23 years, I was very proud, it was the most bipartisan committee in the Congress, and we understood our responsibility that the appropriation bills are the one bill that must pass if we are to continue to serve our public and keep America strong and vibrant and economically growing jobs. This is a serious matter. Continuing to kick the can down the road ought to be an unacceptable alternative. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has again expired. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I urge every one of my colleagues—there are not a lot of people on the floor, Mr. Speaker, but I hope they are watching on television—to understand that the basic responsibility that we have of ensuring the functioning of the government of the people of the United States is one that we ought to perform in a responsible, effective, and timely fashion. Mr. Chairman, I will work with you, and I will work with Mrs. LOWEY over the next few days to ensure that next week we have a product that can pass this House because it has bipartisan support and is in the best interests of our country. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak about H.J. Res. 99, ‘‘Making Further Continuing Appropriations for Fiscal Year 2017.’’ This resolution is an imperfect vehicle for appropriations for FY 2017, because it does not fully fund the government for the entire fiscal year and it keeps in place sequestration. H.J. Res. 99 goes against sound fiscal practice by including the budget gimmickry known as sequestration, a fiscal bludgeon that makes across the board cuts in funding for the valuable services depended upon by American children, seniors, workers, veterans, students, and small businesses. Mr. Speaker, the Continuing Resolution before us extends current Fiscal Year 2017 government funding by seven days, through May 5, 2017, at its current rate, which means a continuation of the acrosstheboard cut of .19% for all accounts, defense and nondefense, contained in the expiring continuing resolution that was approved December 8, 2016. Mr. Speaker, I am disappointed that we have again been placed in the position of having to fund the government through the device of a continuing resolution rather than through the normal appropriations process of considering and voting on the twelve separate spending bills reported by the Committee on Appropriations. H.J. Res. 99 is far from perfect, but it is a modest and positive step since it ensures that funding for appropriated entitlements will continue at a rate maintaining program levels under current law and, for a week at least, prevents congressional Republicans from shutting down the government again and manufacturing a crisis that only harms our economy, destroys jobs, and weakens our middle class. The government shutdown of 2013, which was manufactured by the Republican majority lasted 16 days and cost taxpayers $24 billion. The enormous harm and disruption of the lives of federal employees and the people they serve, however, was irreparable. 
As I stated, Mr. Speaker, this Continuing Resolution is not perfect and it only funds the government until May 5, 2017. As veteran and seasoned Members of Congress, we have been in this challenging position before. But working together—in a spirit of goodwill, bipartisanship, and realism, I believe we can reach a longterm agreement that will avert a shutdown of government operations and the disruption a shutdown causes to the lives of millions of Americans who depend upon federal programs to do their jobs, educate their kids, care for their parents, and contribute to their communities. Our constituents look to the Congress and the President to make responsible choices and decisions to keep the nation safe, the economy prosperous, and to make necessary and prudent investments in education, healthcare and research, transportation and infrastructure, economic development, science, the arts and humanities, and the environment. This is, after all, just another way of saying that the American people expect their leaders in Washington be guided by the Constitution’s Preamble and pursue policies and provide the resources that will: ‘‘establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty.’’ The funding priorities that have been floated by the Trump Administration fail this essential test of leadership because they are irresponsible, impracticable, unrealistic, and, in many respects, insensitive or indifferent to the deleterious impact they will have on the lives of real people living in the real world. They do not command majority support in the Congress or of the public. To win such support, I believe that it is essential that any subsequent continuing resolution or omnibus appropriations bill achieves the following goals and objectives: ‘‘To establish justice’’ and ‘‘To promote the general welfare’’: 1. Full funding for the U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division and the Department of Education Office of Civil Rights so that they have funds needed to enforce laws protecting civil rights, voting rights, and prosecuting hate crimes. 2. Fully funds community development block grants and low income housing programs in urban and rural communities. 3. Fully funds the Legal Services Corporation so that working and lowincome persons who lack an army of lobbyists to represent them in Washington will at least have the assistance of counsel to defend their legal rights in courts of law. 4. Fully funds programs providing food assistance to housebound seniors, such as Meals on Wheels. 5. Fully funds programs that provide students from low and moderateincome families access to affordable higher education and provides students with special needs the support needed to receive the free appropriate public education (FAPE) in the least restrictive environment (LRE) guaranteed by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA Act). 6. Fully funds before and after school programs and other student enrichment programs that help students succeed. 7. Fully funds programs that make federal housing safer through energy efficient heating and cooling systems. 8. Preserves tax credit programs that help revitalize low income communities. 9. Fully funds the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Energy programs developing the next generation of clean energy and transportation technologies. ‘‘Provide for the common defense’’: 1. Provides robust funding for the Department of State and USAID to advance national security interests in places like Iraq and Afghanistan and to end violent conflicts in trouble spots which could threaten the security interests of the United States. 2. Provides adequate funding for United Nations peacekeeping missions throughout the world and distribution of food aid to people in developing and famine stricken countries, such as South Sudan, Somalia, Yemen, and Nigeria. ‘‘To ensure domestic tranquility’’: 1. Fully funds costsharing reduction subsidies, or CSRs, to compensate insurers for reducing deductibles and outofpocket maximums for lowincome customers on the Affordable Care Act exchanges. 2. Protects the adequacy, solvency, and integrity of the Medicare and Medicaid programs, which provide health sustaining support for 70 million Americans. 3. Fully funds the National Institutes of Health research programs so that patient access to lifesaving treatments is not delayed. 4. Does not convert funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention into block grants which would hinder the nation’s ability to respond swiftly and effectively to public health crises like Ebola, Zika, and HIV/AIDS. Mr. Speaker, I believe that if all members of the House and Senate work together, we can reach agreement on an appropriate budget framework that invests in the American people, preserves our national security, and keeps faith with the values that have served our nation well and made the United States the leading nation on earth. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 289, the previous question is ordered.

THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. HOLDING ). The unfinished business is the question on agreeing to the Speaker’s approval of the Journal, which the Chair will put de novo. The question is on the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. 
LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCARTHY ), the majority leader, for the purpose of inquiring of the schedule for the week to come. (Mr. MCCARTHY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the House will meet at noon for morning hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business. Votes will be postponed until 6:30. On Tuesday and Wednesday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning hour and noon for legislative business. On Thursday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business. Mr. Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next week, a complete list of which will be announced by close of business today. One suspension worth highlighting is H.R. 1644, the Korean Interdiction and Modernization of Sanctions Act, sponsored by Chairman EDROYCE . Mr. Speaker, last year, North Korea conducted two nuclear weapons tests and 26 ballistic missile flight tests. Congress has long led the charge to impose strict sanctions against the Kim Jongun regime. This bill would continue that effort by specifically sanctioning North Korea’s shipping industry, as well as targeting those who employ North Korean slave labor abroad. It is critical we send a clear and bipartisan message that North Korea’s reckless provocations cannot continue. In addition, Mr. Speaker, the House will consider H.R. 1180, the Working Families Flexibility Act, sponsored by Representative MARTHA ROBY. This bill would give employees the option to convert the overtime hours worked into paid time off. Mr. Speaker, hardworking Americans in the private sector deserve the same flexibility that public sector workers have enjoyed for decades. By passing this bill, we will give American families greater choice in how they spend their most important resource, their time. Finally, Mr. Speaker, the House will consider legislation providing further appropriations for the 2017 fiscal year. I am encouraged by the reports I have received from our Appropriations Committee regarding these negotiations, and I look forward to a strong vote on this agreement next week. Mr. Speaker, additional legislative items are possible. If any items are added, I will relay scheduling information to Members as soon as possible. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the majority leader for the information on the schedule for next week. I would ask him, with respect to Korea, that being on the floor—also, as I understand it, the committee has been working on a Syria sanctions bill. Obviously both of those areas are critically important. Does the gentleman have any information when we might anticipate the Syria resolution coming forward as well? I yield to the gentleman. Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman is correct. This is a critical area and one that we do want to make sure we speak with one voice and a bipartisan voice. I have spoken to the committee chairman. He is continuing to work on this. And I anticipate, not next week but in the future, that coming to the floor. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his focus on that issue because we agree, of course, that that is a serious and volatile matter with which we need to deal in a hopefully effective way. Two items, one that the gentleman mentioned. We just passed a continuing resolution, as the gentleman noted. And pursuant to our discussions, Democrats and Republicans both overwhelmingly voted for that, and it passed handily. I don’t know whether the gentleman heard my remarks on the floor, but what I had indicated is—and I have indicated to him privately—that we Democrats are in a position of not supporting an additional continuing resolution. In my discussions with Mrs. LOWEY , our ranking member on the Appropriations Committee, she believes that there is a possibility to get an agreement between the two parties, but it appears that the committees themselves have reached a point where they think they will need additional assistance from leadership, I presume, on 
both sides of the aisle to resolve some of the thorniest issues that are still outstanding. I want to thank the majority leader and the Speaker. In our discussions yesterday on the floor in private—they weren’t, I don’t think, private discussions because there were other people around. Both the Speaker and yourself are desirous of getting this done before the end of the weekend, posting something either as early perhaps as Sunday night or as late as Monday night on an omnibus, which would fund government between next week and the end of the fiscal year September 30. So the first question would be: We share that objective in common, I presume; is that accurate? I yield to the gentleman. Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Maryland for yielding. That is true. I want to thank the gentleman even for his comments earlier in the week. I know they might not have been the same comments as the rest on the other side of the aisle. It was our anticipation that we would not have to do a continuing resolution. I do believe that the committee is very close. It is the intention of the committee to get to an agreement. I hoped to get to an agreement as early as today, knowing that we do want to provide to the Members the 3 days so they can read through the entire bill and that we can vote on this before the end of this shortterm CR. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that, and I would urge the Speaker and the majority leader to engage with others because I think that would be useful in facilitating the reaching of an agreement. I know that Leader PELOSI and I will also be available to the extent that we could facilitate that. I know there are some thorny, tough issues still outstanding, but I know the majority leader agrees with me that the funding of government on a sporadic basis on a continuing resolution is very bad for morale of the Federal service, very bad for anybody who wants to plan on how to execute their obligations and responsibilities, and frankly very disconcerting not only to the American people but to people around the world who contemplate the shutdown of the Government of the United States of America on which so much of the world relies for some degree of stability. It is simply not a thing that we ought to be doing. So I would urge the leader and myself to be as engaged as we need to be to get us to that objective next week. Secondly, Mr. Majority Leader, I know we had some discussion about a healthcare bill. The Affordable Care Act, as you know, we think is working. We think, working together, we can make it better. I know the majority leader and his party disagree with that and want to see it repealed and that there is legislation to do that. The majority leader did not mention it in his comments, but does he anticipate the American Health Care Act, with or without amendments, being considered next week? I yield to the gentleman. Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I know we have had many discussions in regards to this, and we have a very strong difference of opinion. I would believe those individuals that have lost their doctors and that have lost their health care entirely, that they do not have someone providing it. If you look within Tennessee and one third of the entire country, they only have one provider. There are challenges. We cannot continue to sit back and just watch ObamaCare fail. We have to do something about it. We had committees work through a bill. We have made great progress over the Easter break. Members have been talking to one another. Members have seen a new amendment to add to the bill. They have been looking at it this week, and I anticipate as soon as Members have looked through that that we will bring that bill to the floor. I don’t have anything scheduled for next week. But as soon as a bill is scheduled, we will notify you. I anticipate the Members reading through it this weekend, and, as soon as possible, we will bring that bill to the floor. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that comment. The gentleman is certainly correct, we have very substantial disagreements. We believe the Affordable Care Act is working. I was pleased to see the administration, at least in the shortterm, indicate that they will not take actions to undermine it or sabotage it without passing a replacement, without having the ability to give to the American people an option. I think the administration did the right thing. I hope they will continue to do the right thing in making payments consistent with the law. We will have a very significant debate on that bill. Therefore, I would urge the majority leader if, in fact, the majority leader is going to bring that bill to the floor at some point in time, that significant notice be given so that not only Members of Congress, but that the American people can have the opportunity to assess the ramifications— in our perspective, the very serious adverse ramifications—that the passage of the American Health Care Act would have on the health care and the cost to every American of health insurance. The President, as you know, has indicated that he wants to make sure—and he said he would support a program where every American has insurance, not access to insurance. He has made comments numerous times during the course of the campaign and since he has been President of the United States that his program would provide for every American to have health insurance at a lower cost with better quality. I have told the people that, if he sends such a bill down, I would be inclined to support such a bill. He has not, of course, sent such a bill down. So, Mr. Leader, the bottom line is I am simply saying that this will be a very controversial item and deserving of very significant debate, discussion. Hopefully, we will get significant notice as to when the majority leader expects to bring it to the floor so that we could be prepared for that debate. I yield to the gentleman. b1145 Mr. MCCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. And yes, we have had a lot, ample debate already, through committee and part of the floor, but it is our anticipation that we will give you plenty of notification. We have already posted the amendment to make sure everybody has the ability to read it, and it has already been there 3 days. It is just 8 pages long, and we have provided the 3 days already. But we will give you, as soon as it is scheduled for the floor, notice of it coming. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, and I yield back the balance of my time. 
ADJOURNMENT FROM FRIDAY, APRIL 28, 2017, TO MONDAY, MAY 1, 2017 Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet on Monday, May 1, 2017, when it shall convene at noon for morninghour debate and 2 p.m. for legislative business. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. GARRETT ). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. 
CONGRATULATING MANNIE JACKSON (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mannie Jackson, a legendary basketball player at both the University of Illinois and Edwardsville High School, on his induction into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. Born in a railroad boxcar in southern Missouri, Mannie excelled at Edwardsville High School before attending the University of Illinois. He was one of the first AfricanAmerican letter winners and starters for the Illini. After graduating, Mannie played for the Harlem Globetrotters. While Mannie was a tremendous player, he also purchased the Globetrotters and helped revive the franchise, leading the team to 12 straight years of doubledigit growth. Mannie also continued his career as a philanthropist. He founded the Illinois 
Academic Enrichment and Leadership Program at the University of Illinois and has partnered with leaders at Lewis and Clark Community College to create the Mannie Jackson Center for the Humanities. I have had the privilege of meeting Mannie on multiple occasions and have nothing but admiration and respect for what he does to help others. It is an honor to congratulate him on his induction to the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame, but I am even more proud to recognize all of the contributions he has made to this world. 
21ST CENTURY CIVILIAN CONSERVATION CORPS (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, today is Arbor Day, and I rise to reintroduce my bill, the 21st Century Civilian Conservation Corps Act. In drafting this bill, I was inspired by the CCC Act first established by President Franklin Roosevelt in 1933 as part of his New Deal. This historic initiative generated more than 3 million jobs, especially for America’s young people, and inspired a widespread appreciation of America’s wealth of natural resources and our responsibility as stewards of these assets. Through current Federal programs like the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative and other conservation and restoration investments, Americans are once again connecting the dots between clean water, clean land, clean air, and thriving regional ecosystems and economies. With recent attacks on programs that help our Great Lakes, we should remember we don’t have to choose between protecting our environment and natural treasures and creating jobs. We can do both at the same time. Just Ohio and Michigan, alone, need 20 million new trees planted to make up for the devastation that the emerald ash borer and Asian longhorned beetle have done to our forest populations. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and its goal of putting young people to work across our country that will prosper our Nation and steward its resources forward. I am confident the young people of America will welcome this challenge. 
AUTISM AWARENESS MONTH (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Autism Awareness Month and the more than 3.5 million Americans currently living with an autism spectrum disorder. Today it is estimated that 1 in 68 people will be born with autism. There has been a significant increase in the number of people born with autism in just a decade. With an increase in diagnoses of Americans with autism spectrum, it is important that we expand research and provide adequate resources for people on the spectrum. By increasing awareness, we seek to support the numerous families along with millions of individuals managing an autism disorder. The earlier autism can be diagnosed and treated, the better chance that person has to pursue an independent and productive life. Thus, it is crucial that our early childcare programs, and especially our schools, have the knowledge, resources, and ability to provide assistance to those with autism. I also wish to acknowledge my friend and former constituent, Vincent McLaughlin, who serves as an inspiration for autism awareness. Vincent, like many Americans with autism, is an active and devoted member of his local community and proudly serves as a member of his local volunteer fire department. For years, Vincent has sought to increase awareness for autism and to serve as an example of just how beneficial early treatment can be. Autism should not be a barrier to preventing Americans from achieving success and pursuing happiness. It is to that goal that I stand here today to recognize all Americans with an autism disorder, and I am proud to acknowledge April as Autism Awareness Month. f 
PROTECT EVERY COASTAL COMMUNITY IN OUR NATION (Mr. CARBAJAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise because I am deeply troubled by the Trump administration’s executive order expected to be signed today that will potentially expand offshore oil drilling in the Pacific, Atlantic, and Arctic Oceans. My district, the central coast, knows all too well the havoc wreaked from gas and oil platforms off our coasts. We cannot afford another disastrous oil spill. California’s coastal region generates over $1.9 trillion per year in GDP. This order poses a direct threat to our local tourism economies and the success of local businesses, which are undeniably tied to a clean coast and healthy, thriving ocean ecosystem. It is crucial for Congress to pass my bill, H.R. 731, the California Clean Coast Act, to permanently ban drilling off California’s coast and to take further action to protect every coastal community across our Nation. 
42ND ANNIVERSARY OF THE END OF THE VIETNAM WAR (Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, this Sunday, April 30, will be the 42nd year of the conclusion of the Vietnam war. The conflict started between Communistbacked North Vietnam and the U.S.supported Government of South Vietnam in November 1955 and went on for another 20 years. While the motives and justification of the war were seen as controversial to many, what needs to be recognized is the service demonstrated by our brave men and women who risked their lives to do their duty asked of them. Many of them made the ultimate sacrifice. For that sacrifice, our Nation is eternally grateful. Of the nearly 3 million Americans who served in Vietnam, 58,220 laid down their lives in that service. We can find their names forever enshrined right down the road here in Washington, D.C., at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall. Oftentimes, those who did return were not treated well or properly welcomed home for having served in a war they did not create or ask for. Finally, and thankfully, that welcoming has improved for our Vietnam veterans in recent years as we honor their service. Much still needs to be done in regard to the effects of Agent Orange and other health issues. Of the 75 living Medal of Honor recipients, 52 earned their medal in Vietnam. In total, there were a staggering 260 soldiers awarded the Medal of Honor for heroic acts in the Vietnam war. As we commemorate the 42nd year of the fall of Saigon and the dissatisfactory ending of the war in Vietnam this Sunday, we must be thankful for the millions who served in what seemed a thankless role then, who risked their lives in battle for freedom, and for the many still missing or those who did not make it back alive. f 
TRIBUTE TO JOHNNY MATA ON HIS 80TH BIRTHDAY (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I first want to rise and salute a very special friend of mine, Johnny Mata, on his 80th birthday. Longtime Houston activist and leading founder of the Greater Houston Coalition for Justice, Johnny, we love you because you have been a fighter for justice all of your life. I look forward to coming home and celebrating you, not only as a fighter for justice, but a great American, and certainly one who served in the United States Army. I know that Johnny would not mind me making mention of the fact that, in the 100 days that this President has served, not only has he not provided any service to the American people in terms of providing for their comfort, but today he will celebrate his 100 days by going and speaking before the National Rifle Association, where over 80 percent of those members believe in responsible gun safety, but not one word 
has come from the President of the United States. Yet every day, 48 children and teens are shot in murders, assaults, and suicides in this country and, as well, over $200,000 in costs for health care is part of the tragedy of gun violence. I would hope that this Presidency will join Members of Congress for responsible gun safety to save lives, and stop catering to the special interests of the National Rifle Association—not its membership, but its leadership who are taking advantage and using this as a moneymaking machine. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to my constituent and longtime friend Mr. Johnny Mata on his 80th Birthday. Johnny Mata is a longtime Houston activist who is the presiding officer of the Greater Houston Coalition for Justice. He has been a champion of social justice, education, and civil rights in Houston and across the State of Texas fighting to improve the criminal justice system. He served his country with distinction in the United States Army and later joined the Gulf Coast Community Services Association, where he served for 32 to years helping struggling families to make better lives for themselves. His life has been a commitment to service on behalf of those less fortunate, particularly in the Latino communities where his outspoken voice against prejudice and injustice has had a profound effect on our criminal justice system. Johnny Mata has held numerous leadership positions including six terms as the Director of two local districts and two terms as Texas State Director for the League of United Latin American Citizens. He is responsible for bringing to the forefront issues regarding law enforcement and education in the Hispanic community and has been nationally recognized for getting public school districts to hire more Hispanic educators and administrators. In 1999, Johnny Mata founded the Greater Houston Coalition for Justice, an umbrella organization of more than 25 civil rights and advocacy groups dedicated to raising awareness of human rights issues and to addressing deficiencies in the Greater Houston area’s criminal justice system. In the same spirit as Cesar Chavez, Johnny Mata is an inspiration to us all because of his kind spirit and humble heart that allows him to continue his fight for the least of these and for those who just need an opportunity to achieve the American dream on a level playing field with fair and equal justice for all. Mr. Speaker, I commend Johnny Mata for his deep and abiding commitment to the causes of social justice and equal rights and offer him the very best for his continued success fighting for change and also to recognize his contributions to this country on his 80th birthday. Johnny Mata is an American hero. 
TRUMPCARE 2.0 (Mr. RUIZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, with TrumpCare 2.0, Republican leaders took a bad bill and made it worse. On top of causing at least 24 million more Americans to be uninsured, raising costs for middle class families, imposing an age tax on older Americans, and making everyone pay more for less coverage, this bill now guts protections for patients with preexisting illnesses and removes the essential health benefits: guaranteed coverage for things like prescription drugs, emergency care, maternity care, and mental health. All this while still giving billions in tax breaks to millionaires. Stop being ideologically driven. Put people above partisanship. Put patients first, and let’s work for a bipartisan plan to reduce outofpocket costs for care and medicine for all Americans. f 
AFFORDABLE COVERAGE (Mr. GARRETT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, over the past days we have heard a great deal of rhetoric as it relates to health care and what the best policy for the United States is. In fact, as we address the Affordable Care Act, which the Democratic Governor of Minnesota referred to as unsustainable and former President Clinton referred to as the craziest thing, we understand that the words ‘‘Affordable Care Act’’ do not, in fact, apply. The paradigm, Mr. Speaker, needs to be this. It need not be whether or not Americans have coverage. In a time when Americans, twothirds of whom cannot afford $1,000 in a time of financial crisis, as we see premiums and deductibles soar—$4,000, $6,000, $10,000— the paradigm should be: Do they have access to care? Because, in a world where you can’t pay your deductible, a premium or catastrophe creates an unaffordable outcome, and then coverage is a piece of paper that does not grant you access to what is truly important, and that is care. That should be the paradigm in this debate going forward. 
b1200 THE FIRST 100 DAYS (Ms. TITUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow marks 100 days of the Trump administration. So let’s take a look. What does that 100 days mean? It means hundreds of vacancies still left in important agencies like State and Defense, hundreds of hours wasted on meaningless executive orders, hundreds of miles flown back and forth to Mara Lago to play golf, hundreds of educational and cultural programs on the chopping block, hundreds of acres of public lands under threat, and hundreds of programs that benefit millionaires while causing hundreds and thousands of seniors to worry about losing Meals on Wheels, working families losing their health care, DREAMers losing their protection, women losing Planned Parenthood, and ordinary folks losing money out of their pocket to pay higher tax bills because of the new proposal. That is not much of a record, if you ask me. But what it also means is there are hundreds and thousands of voices rising up saying: We will resist, and we will persist. f 
PRESIDENT TRUMP’S BROKEN PROMISES (Mr. TONKO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to call our President’s attention to the working families both in New York’s capital region and across our great country who are hurting from his broken promises during his first 100 days in office. President Trump promised during the campaign that our working families would never be forgotten again. He has forgotten to keep that promise. This President promised to get lobbyists and special interests out of our government. Then he filled his Cabinet with former lobbyists, Wall Street and oil company executives, and other billionaires. Now reports are coming out that numerous members of his administration were exempted from his widely publicized 5year lobbying ban; therefore, it is no surprise that his policies, again and again, put corporate interests ahead of America’s middle class and working families. President Trump promised to punish companies that outsourced American jobs. Instead, he has continued to award lucrative government contracts to these outsourcing companies, rewarding them for bad behavior and doing nothing to hold other bad actors accountable. As a candidate, Donald Trump called NAFTA the worst trade deal ever approved in our country. He promised to hold China accountable for its bad behavior on trade. Mexico and Canada called his bluff this week on NAFTA. Instead of accountability, President Trump has offered China sweetheart trade benefits to get them to keep promises they had already made in dealing with North Korea. We know the difference between alternative facts and real results. We all do. 
RURAL AMERICA (Mr. PANETTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today for rural America. I represent the central coast of California, one of 
the most beautiful and bountiful districts in our Nation. With its many and diverse crops, it is the salad bowl of the world. Now, I know it is on the coast of California, but if you drive 1 or 2 miles east, you will be in rural America. I understand a majority of rural Americans voted for Donald Trump. It has been 100 days now, and all they have received is broken promises with an intended laceration of the Department of Agriculture budget by 21 percent and a lack of respect and a limited appreciation for what the men and women do in rural America. We ask the President to stop his lip service and start giving public service to rural America with investments in infrastructure, research and development, and, yes, immigration reform. It is time to stop the rhetoric and start recognizing that people who come here who work in agriculture contribute not just to our economy but to our country. Mr. President, all we ask is that you do what people in rural America do every single day. They get up, they work hard, they are stewards of the land, they provide security for our food and for our families, and they serve not just their communities, they serve our country. 
BLACK APRIL AND THE FALL OF SAIGON (Mr. LOWENTHAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, this Sunday, April 30, marks 42 years since the fall of Saigon, commemorated as Black April in VietnameseAmerican communities across the United States. Along with Congresswoman LOFGREN , Congressman CORREA , and other colleagues, I introduced a resolution in remembrance of this event, recognizing the service of U.S. Armed Forces and South Vietnamese forces, and honoring the contributions and sacrifices of Vietnamese Americans. This community, started by refugees, has prospered and thrived, giving so much back to this country. They continue to fight tirelessly for the basic human rights of people in Vietnam. I will continue to be a voice for Vietnamese Americans in Congress and for the rights of the people of Vietnam. 
HEALTH CARE The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. GARRETT ). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, on Friday, so many say TGIF. My late mother passed away in 1991, but she said TGIF one time, and the lady responded, SHIT, and mother looked shocked. She said: ‘‘Sorry, honey, it’s Thursday.’’ But this is not Thursday, it is Friday, and I really hoped we would be voting on a bill that wouldn’t totally repeal ObamaCare, but it would give people a great deal of relief. I know with all the talk from the other side of the aisle about how great ObamaCare is, when we look at the numbers, we know that promise after promise was broken in the passage of the ACA, or ObamaCare. People lost their insurance, they lost the medications that they were eligible to have under their prior insurance, they lost their doctor, and they lost their treatment facility. That does take a toll on people’s lives. There was bragging about the people that now had insurance that didn’t have it before. But we know it was clear, most of that was people that got stuck on Medicaid. It wasn’t real insurance. As we look at the evolution of health care in America, we see that insurance has changed to where it is no longer insurance. Right now in America, people who are actually medical doctors are some of the best and brightest that America has ever produced. But as an old history major and someone who continues to read and learn from history every week, it is worth noting that there have been strides made in health care and in medicine in the last 100 years that are unparalleled in the entire history of mankind. There was a book called ‘‘The Five Thousand Year Leap.’’ I don’t want to do it an injustice, but basically it points out that when settlers came to North America, not the immigrants that came perhaps from Russia who then later were referred to as Native Americans, but immigrants coming from Europe, the English, and even from Norway, during those years, they came in boats that were not powered other than by sail or by arm strength. Mankind had not made a lot of progress over 5,000 recorded years of history. If you looked at the implements that were used in farming when settlers in the 15th, 16th, and 17th centuries came to North America, there really had not been any great developments in production of food and in farming tools over the thousands of years that mankind had existed. Yet I think largely because the Founders of the United States of America recognized the importance of ingenuity and rewarding not only hard work but intellectual developments and processes—in fact, in the Constitution, the Founders had the incredible foresight to provide for something called copyrights or patents because they wanted to protect intellectual property. They felt that if we protect and reward intellectual property, then it will encourage people to develop new ideas and find new and better ways. Within the last 100 years, we have made much more than a 5,000year leap, and that is also certainly true in health care in the realm of medicine. I don’t think it is just pride in America. I think anyone objectively will have to note that if not for the Presidents of the United States of America and the medical breakthroughs in the United States of America and the contributions of medicine in the United States, we would not be where we are now with so much potential to cure diseases, to prevent diseases, to improve quality of life, and to elongate people’s years on the Earth. Some medical historians would say it was around 100 years ago that for the first time—some believe in the entire history of the mankind, recorded or otherwise—that for the first time, about 100 years ago, a person had a better chance of being healed or getting well after seeing a doctor than they had of getting sicker. It is extraordinary to think that for the thousands of years of man’s existence it is only in the last 100 years that physicians actually were able to have a better chance of healing than harming. We saw an old Saturday Night Live skit that played out where the barber was often also the doctor because he had sharp instruments to cut with. But even going back 200 years to 1799, just over 200 years, George Washington got ill. He had been out in the land that he loved there at Mount Vernon, just southwest of here, a place that he longed to be all during the Revolution. For the 8 years he served as the commander to the Revolutionary forces, all of those days, nights, and weekends, he longed to be back at Mount Vernon. But for the good of his country, he stayed with his troops. There were entries in journals and letters from people who served under him and were stationed at Valley Forge: Why, even though they weren’t fighting? Because Washington knew if he let the men go home, there was a good chance they wouldn’t come back. If they didn’t come back, then the Revolution was going to be over, and all of those who had participated would be killed by the British forces. So he stayed with the troops. He often allowed the officers to take leave and go home at night or on a weekend perhaps, but he stayed with the troops. After the war was won, he went back to Mount Vernon. He thought he was done. He had served his country and done what no one else had ever done in history. Although Cincinnatus did an incredibly selfless thing, it still wasn’t to the level of selflessness of George Washington. When he thought he was done in 1787, here came leaders begging him to come back and lead the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia because, as they eventually made clear to Washington, if he did not come back and reside, all would be lost. All those who fought during the Revolution would have fought for nothing: it would all go away, and the British would be back in charge. There would be chaos. b1215 So he agrees to come back. Then an incredible thing happened at the Constitutional Convention. After they 
could not reach any agreement on much of anything, as Ben Franklin pointed out, Randolph made a motion that they recess until after a celebration of the country’s birth, its anniversary in early July. Why don’t they go to church together, worship together, celebrate God’s love and his gift in this country, and then come back and try what had been so unsuccessful for the 5 weeks or so to that point? The motion passed. They went to church at the Reformed Calvinistic Church, a Christian church, and they worshipped God together. They asked for his leadership. The Right Reverend William Rogers, pastor of the Reformed Calvinistic Church in Philadelphia, did a powerful job of leading the worship of God in this Christian church. It was a nondenominational service. We still have a record of the prayer that was prayed by Reverend Rogers at that celebration. People noted after they came back that there was a different spirit. Yes, there was disagreement, but it wasn’t as rancorous as it had been before that. It eventually came to the great compromise that allowed one body to have equal numbers of representatives from each State, no matter what size, and another body would have equal power and its representatives would be chosen according to the number of people who lived in that State. That was one of the great compromises. We end up with a Constitution. George Washington thinks he is done, but after the Constitution is ratified, they begged him to allow them to elect him unanimously to be our first President. He doesn’t want to do it. He eventually agrees, gives in. They elect him unanimously. They have a contested vote for Vice President, but John Adams wins. After 4 years, he was ready to go home. They begged him again to allow them to reelect him unanimously. He eventually gave in and served 4 more years as President. Some did become disappointed with Washington during those 4 years because he would not allow the United States to get involved in the French Revolution. That irritated some people, but Washington believed that America was so weak in that time, that if we got involved in a foreign war, albeit a civil war, we would end up losing what had been gained to that point. So he didn’t let the United States get involved. When he was begged to stay and let them elect him to a third 4year term, it would not have been unanimous. He said, basically, that it would look too much like a monarchy if someone served 12 years. He refused and could not be deterred. He went back to Mount Vernon. There at Mount Vernon, as he loved to do, he was going around assessing what improvements needed to be made there on his property. It was cold. It began to rain. He was marking trees as to which ones would be cut and which ones would be allowed to remain. It got dark. He came to the house, not realizing that visitors had come. Since the Washingtons were always so hospitable, even if they didn’t know people were coming, Martha would provide food for them. George Washington came in. He was wet, he was cold, and Martha implored him to go change clothes, as did the guests, but he wouldn’t have of it because he was so polite, always more concerned about others. So he remained, ate in cold and wet clothes, and ended up developing some kind of cold or infection, and it turned into a very serious infection. A doctor was called, and he couldn’t understand why Washington wasn’t doing better. They were draining blood from Washington. It should have healed him. It should have made him all well. If we are getting the bad blood out of him, we don’t know why he is not getting better, but got weaker. Imagine that: you drain a man’s blood, he gets weaker. They didn’t understand what they were doing. That was 218 years ago. Washington got weaker. They were able to get ahold of the doctor, who was one of George Washington’s best friends in the world, Dr. Craik. Dr. Craik loved George Washington. Washington loved him like a brother. Craik wanted to do all he could to get him well. This man who loved Washington and cared so deeply was one of the better doctors of the 18th century. He bled him again. He drained more blood from Washington’s body, thinking that would help, and it didn’t. As we know now, that was not helping. It was hurting. It was doing great damage. That is what they thought just 218 years ago. In that intervening 218 years, the advancements in medicine have been staggering. We know now what helps and what doesn’t help. There will probably come a time when, if we continue to develop research, as we have in the past, we will be able to look back at the year 2017 and say there were things that we were doing that were not as helpful as we thought, may have been harmful, but never again to the extent as occurred where the doctors actually were responsible for killing their friend, our American hero. I don’t think we will get to that point again. It is worth noting historically the developments of health care so that we can adequately see what has happened in the 7 years since ObamaCare got passed. We have done damage to health care in America under ObamaCare. I know people talk about all the people that have health insurance now that didn’t before. So many lost their policy. They got a much worse policy. ObamaCare basically outlawed catastrophic insurance policies, which are those that have a high deductible with a low premium and ensure against basically something catastrophic, disease, injury. Yet, because of the problems that ObamaCare created, premiums skyrocketed for so many people and the deductibles dramatically increased. So many people have told me about their deductibles going from $250, $500 to $6,000, $7,000, $10,000. There are so many paying more than $10,000 for their health insurance with a high deductible that they can never pay. We have done great damage to people’s ability to get the health care they need, that they used to be able to afford. It was in the last 40 or 50 years that, when people brought up health insurance, it really was insurance. You paid a very small premium each month against some unforeseeable event out there in the future, a catastrophic disease or injury. So you just paid a small premium, like term life insurance, to ensure against something you hope never would happen. In the meantime, you just paid for your health care. I know that while growing up in Mount Pleasant, Texas, everybody knew the doctors that were there. We went to more than one. It was sometimes dictated by who raised their prices and who hadn’t. Now we don’t know who raises their prices. You get a bill from a healthcare provider and there is no way in the world to know how much the procedure costs, how much the visit costs, how much anybody is actually going to pay to satisfy this massive indebtedness. Chances are, maybe less than a tenth of what the bill says that the government will pay if it is Medicaid, Medicare, Blue Cross, Aetna, Anthem, or any of these health insurers. You can’t improve the cost of health care if you don’t know what it costs. You can’t have freemarket principles bringing down the cost of health care when nobody knows what it costs. We have gone from the days of having health insurance ensure against a distant catastrophic event to paying behemoth companies to manage our health care, to tell us what doctor we can see, which hospital we can go to. We pay for so many other people who come into the country illegally and don’t have insurance. We pay for people in the country legally that don’t have insurance. We pay exorbitant amounts for people that go to an emergency room because the Supreme Court has told us that, regardless of whether someone can pay or not, they have to be seen and treated. What happens at the emergency room costs those who do pay dramatically more than if those individuals had just gone to a health clinic and had the same treatment for the same problem. So there have been some great solutions proposed, none of which have been to have the government have more role, turn all of the Nation’s health care into a big Veterans Administration where things can often be catastrophic. One of the things that has really broken my heart to be a servant of the people of east Texas is so many veterans’ stories of how they were not properly cared for medically. They 
didn’t get the care they need. They were waiting for months. Then I will have people tell me they got treated very well. They are in the Lufkin Clinic named for Charlie Wilson. Overall, I think our veterans would still be better off if all of them were given a card and told: If you want to go to your local VA clinic, if you have one close, fine. You just go to whichever is closest and it gives you the best health care. That provides competition and it keeps our word to the veterans that they will have the health care they need. Veterans should not be penalized because they served our country and put themselves in harm’s way. My 4 years on Active Duty in the U.S. Army did not entitle me to life health care, so I don’t have that personal experience of dealing with the VA health care. I was not disabled. I still feel guilty because during my 4 years, 1978 to 1982, we were never in combat. b1230 We were put on alert in 1979 that some of us, at least, might be going to Iran, and we should have. I still feel that thousands of Americans would be alive today if we had been sent back then and had done the job of the radical Islamists that President Carter had been welcomed in. Ayatollah Khomeini, President Carter welcomed him as a man of peace, and he has done anything but provide peace. But we owe our veterans so much. George Washington knew that, and that is why in that picture just down the hall, that huge painting that John Trumbull had painted, Washington has his arm outstretched, piece of paper in there. On that piece of paper was his resignation. He had also sent a copy to all 13 Governors. Amazingly, the last part of his resignation was a prayer for the Nation. In that prayer for the Nation, he included that he prayed God would ensure that we would never forget those who had served in the field; talking about our veterans who had fought for this country because Washington knew if we were going to remain a free nation, then we would have to honor those, take care of those who suffered as a result of giving us, protecting our freedom. That is why also, if we ever fail to honor those who have honored us by serving us in the military, we won’t last past the next major conflict. It is important we do that, and Washington knew that. So, since Washington’s death was certainly propelled by blood being drained, we know draining somebody of their lifegiving blood is not normally a good idea, but in the last 100 years, just thinking about you have a better chance of getting well than you do of getting sick, look at the progress that was made in medicine in 100 years and look at the developments in medicine since ObamaCare came about. Yes, we know the big pharmaceutical companies signed on to endorsing ObamaCare, as did the American Hospital Association and the American Medical Association and AARP. For every organization that signed on endorsing ObamaCare, if you read the ObamaCare bill, as I did, you could normally find where they got their payoff. You could normally find something that they were given to buy their support. AARP has made more money than they would have ever dreamed before ObamaCare through the health insurance policies that they endorse. So, yes, there was a great deal of selfservice for AARP to endorse a bill that did massive medical damage to retired people, a bill that cut $716 billion out of Medicare. When people realize AARP endorsed a bill that did so much gutting of Medicare, how could they do that if they really care about retired people? Well, how they could do it is that they were going to be rewarded by selling or endorsing insurance that wouldn’t have the 2 percent tax on it that most insurance would have. They got some other benefits out of it. I haven’t seen how much profit they have made for a nonprofit organization, but I believe it was in 2008 that they made over $400 million, basically profit for a nonprofit, from their insurance sales. There is no telling how much that has increased. I would love to see the number since ObamaCare came about. But they got a big payday because they endorsed ObamaCare. The pharmaceuticals, we knew they were going to make tens of billions of dollars more than they ever had after ObamaCare. They were bought off to endorse it. But for some of us who could see clearly down the road where it was heading, as I have told some in the pharmaceutical industry: By endorsing ObamaCare, if it is not changed, you will have signed the death warrant for your own industry because eventually it will lead to failure to recoup research and development. Not initially, but by then the people who had endorsed ObamaCare from the pharmaceutical industry will no doubt have gotten their golden parachutes and could own an island somewhere. Who knows? But they will be plenty wealthy. They would have overseen the steps that would lead to the demise of the greatest developments in health care in thousands of years, really just in the last 50 or 60, extraordinary developments. Something has to be done. That is why a majority of Americans did not support ObamaCare in 2009 and 2010. It is why a majority of Americans wanted change. They had to have change. Like the old joke about the guy up in the tree who went up to get the gorilla out. After tangling for so long, he yells at the guy: Just shoot up in the tree. He said: Yeah, but I might hit you. And the guy yells: Yeah, but one of us has got to have some relief. People suffering from health care under ObamaCare have been crying for relief: Just do something. We have got to have relief. I have heard that from so many in east Texas. Look, something has got to be done. We can’t keep going like this. We can’t afford the premiums, and it is not going to get me help with health care because I can’t pay the deductibles. Something has to be done. I was hoping we would have a full repeal. The bill 2 years ago didn’t fully repeal ObamaCare. It did more than we have done in the bill we have now, but the reason I agreed to sign on was so many people were saying: We don’t like ObamaCare, but we have got to have some relief. We have got to have relief. We finally got concessions that would ensure that people’s premiums would come down in 2 years—too late for the year, but would come down in 2 years, and then would continue to make progress in the area of premiums. We would make great inroads in encouraging people. Instead of paying tens of thousands of dollars to health insurance companies, they would have a big hunk of that money going to their own health savings account. That was clearly going to lead us—and still can—to a place where patients control their own health care again, where they can go talk to a doctor and not have an insurance manager intervene and say: Uhoh, you can’t do that. Nope, you can’t go see that person. Nope, we haven’t given approval to this or that. It is a doctor and a patient relationship the way progress has been made in the last 100 years that has given us, to a point, the best health care in the history of mankind. Now, in the 1970s, when I was in the Soviet Union as an exchange student for a summer, I saw socialized medicine. We are talking real socialized medicine, the same kind of socialized medicine that President Obama and so many others called—they put this lovely sounding name—single payer. Now, it is socialized medicine. The government controls it all. You don’t have any choices. It is in the hands of the government. They see all; they know all. Once the government has that power, then they have the right—and an obligation even—to tell you what you have to do physically, what you can eat, who you can see, where you can go, when you can go. People who want total government control over people’s lives—not of their own, but everybody else’s—they understood, they had the vision that if we can get government control of health care, then we will be able to control all these minions all across America. There are a lot of people in this body who I disagree with, but I know they want to do what is right for America. But it is not right for America and for Americans to have the United States Government dictating every aspect of our lives. I long for the days when my liberal friends used to yell: We don’t want the government in our bedroom. 
Because since then, they have been saying: Yeah, let’s get the government in our bedroom, in our bathroom, in our kitchen, in our living room, in our garage. We want government control of everything. As I have said before, the only thing it appears that George Orwell got wrong was the date. It wasn’t 1984. But we still have a chance to get off this miserable road we are on. That is why the huge bulk of geographic America rose up on election day in November and said: We have got to have some relief. Whether we like Donald Trump or not, we have got to have some relief, we have got to have some change. That is why the huge geographical United States voted for Donald Trump. The fringes of the United States, the coast and a few major cities said: No, we like the government telling us what to do, how to live, what we can have. But across America geographically, that was not what people wanted. This is our chance. I really had hoped that by compromising again, as the Freedom Caucus, that we could have a vote by today on a bill that would start us down the road of getting rid of ObamaCare, getting us back on a road toward freedom. We knew it was going to be tough. If you don’t think it would be tough, look at the Soviet Union after the fall of the wall and the Soviet Government. There were so many Russians who said: What are we going to do? We have to look for a job—find our own job. We don’t want that kind of freedom. Well, they are finding out that perhaps they do. One of the things that we had gotten as a compromise to try to help Americans in the agreement that has developed to this point was the elimination of the taxes that would have been kept in place under the proposed bill that was first filed by our leadership. Another thing that would be in there is a requirement that if you are going to now be part of Medicaid, as we have had millions now having the government pick up the insurance through Medicaid, then we are going to put a similar work requirement, as was put on by Congress in the 1990s by the Republican House and Senate. And though President Clinton didn’t want to agree to that, once he saw they had the votes to override another veto, he agreed to sign it because rather than have his veto overridden—and now it is one of the things he brags about: Oh, yeah, while I was President, I reformed welfare, so you had to work. As a result of that reform in the 1990s—it was not a callous move. It was a caring move by Republicans in the House and Senate who understood that it is not a punishment to have a job. It gives you a feeling of selfworth. b1245 We are not going to get back to the days where as many people have jobs as used to until we restore that freedom and a requirement that, if you are going to make the American taxpayers pay for everything that you want and need, then, if you are able to work, you are going to have to do something. As a result of that work requirement in the 1990s, income for single mothers, when adjusted for inflation, for the first time since welfare began in the 1960s under the socalled Great Society, for the first time, that income increased for single moms when adjusted for inflation. The Federal Government, since the Great Society legislation, had begun to lure young women into holes, into ruts, from which they could not extricate themselves. After 30 years of the Federal Government luring people into holes they then could not get out of, they were required to get out of the hole, they did, and their lives improved. Now, I know the mainstream media has been there to defend every bit of government control as it took over more and more. They would take their potshots at people like me that probably were more intelligent on national testing than they were. But, nonetheless, used all kinds of excoriating terms, make fun. Like the time I mentioned that I was told by somebody that they were in line to get groceries and the person in front of them had crab legs that were expensive, and this person said: Gosh, I am wishing I could have afforded crab legs. But it turns out, when they pulled out the card, which let them know taxpayers were paying for those crab legs, he realized the reason that he can’t afford crab legs is because he is paying for his and this other person’s food. Well, the press went nuts over that. It has been some years back. It wasn’t long after that, after the media here in Washington belittled me, the media in New York belittled me, never brought it out, but we got a picture. They said nobody can get crab legs with money from food stamp programs, CHIP, any of that. You can’t do that. We have got pictures of crabs for sale and the sign saying ‘‘we take food stamps.’’ Anyway, it is very clear that, when you see the signs that say ‘‘we take food stamps’’ for the crabs, that the media that belittled me back in those days, they had their fun, but they were just wrong, and they were lying to cover for more and bigger intrusive government. I want to also thank my friend TOM MACARTHUR . I am not crazy about the amendment that he provided, but TOM is making a real effort: let’s reason together. Let’s come together on a bill. We compromise, and we get to a point where we can help our respective constituents. We can help America. I felt like, with all of the compromises, we were going to bring down premiums more quickly. We were repealing at least some of ObamaCare— not enough, but at least some of it— and we were going to be able to move the ball forward so that we could get back to great advancements in improving people’s health care and getting away from the insurance monopolies that have developed in each State. It has been reported that in around 30 States there is only one company left providing the insurance. Well, this body did a great thing, and I appreciate very much Speaker RYAN agreeing to do it. But he and KEVIN MCCARTHY allowed a bill to come to the floor. Our whip, STEVE SCALISE , found: Gee, this is a lot easier doing a whip on this thing than we thought. But it would eliminate the exemption for health insurance companies from antitrust laws. Under the state of the law since 1945, under the McCarran Ferguson bill back then, health insurance companies have been allowed to monopolize. They can take actions that, in some other industry, would cause the Department of Justice to come after them and sue them, take very strong actions, and could even result in criminal actions if someone is trying to monopolize. But, in health care, it has been allowed for years. You can go in and tell somebody: We want, in our agreement, that if you take any of these other upstart insurance companies’ insurance, you are going to be out of our network; and we are the big dog, so you will be out of luck. Well, you can’t do that when you are under the antitrust laws of the United States, but you can when you are exempt. That bill came to the floor. We had over 400 people on both sides of the aisle vote for it. And I know good and well that if Majority Leader MITCH MCCONNELL would bring that to the floor of the Senate, it will have probably every bit as high a percentage. It could even be unanimous. I can’t imagine somebody in the Senate voting against it. But, if we simply change the law to allow people to buy across State lines and we don’t eliminate the exemption from antitrust laws, then instead of having 30 monopolies in 30 States, you will have one monopoly for the whole country. The one big company can drive everybody else out because the healthcare providers will know, if they are going to survive, they have got to have this one monopoly paying them. And the monopoly can put in the contract: You won’t be in our network if you accept insurance from any other place. So that has to go. The House did that. I look forward to the Senate doing that. Our revised version that I was hoping we would vote on today still does not fully repeal ObamaCare, but by the negotiations that have occurred in the Tuesday Group, Freedom Caucus, Republican Study Committee, committee of jurisdiction, we have made a great deal of progress, and I thought we were there. We didn’t have any assurances that the Senate would pass exactly what we did, but we were going to move the ball forward. 
Now, today was as close as we have gotten to repealing and getting into law a big repeal of a big part of ObamaCare, but it didn’t happen today. It needs to happen, and it needs to happen very soon. But what did happen in the White House, the President has stood undeterred. Again, today, he signed another executive order. This one didn’t do as the prior administration and usurped power that was not his, that only Congress has. He is working well within the law and gets good advice on this stuff. I have got to say, even when I have talked to the President over the last few weeks, more than once, he wants to make sure that he is following the Constitution, and he is careful to say that. I like that. Let’s check to see and make sure we are following the Constitution and we are not missing something here. I love having a President that is concerned about that. For all of the grief that President Trump has taken, he is concerned about it. He does not want to exceed his authority. Unfortunately, we have judges in the Ninth Circuit, particularly, that exceed their authority on a regular basis. Mr. Speaker, that is why I am hoping that, in the very near future, we will break up the Ninth Circuit. It would be okay with me if we restricted the Ninth Circuit, who doesn’t have one care about precedence, about the Constitution. They just have their political agenda. If we are not going to get rid of them altogether, then let’s at least restrict their jurisdiction to controversies that arise within their building and then divide up the rest. We need a new circuit. Let President Trump appoint all of the new 12th Circuit that will be created. I am very pleased that our Judiciary Committee is wanting to do something major regarding the Ninth Circuit being out of control. And I do think an important step will be, when we eliminate the jurisdiction of a district court over immigration and naturalization matters, we have authority to create courts—all but one. The Supreme Court is the only one formed under the Constitution. All the rest of them, we brought them into the world and we can take them out. We give them their jurisdiction and we can take it away. We need to do that if we are going to save this constitutional Republic. So, Mr. Speaker, I would also like to finish by mentioning the National Day of Prayer recognition that is coming up on Thursday. Anne Graham Lotz took over the gavel from Shirley Dobson. Both are dear friends. Shirley Dobson has done an extraordinary job over the last 25 years. The National Day of Prayer has continued the tradition for many years now. We do have an observance at the Capitol. For a couple of decades, it has been at the Cannon Caucus Room. It seats more than the rooms here at the Capitol do. We had hoped to have it in the rotunda. It is nondenominational. There are others than Christians. There are Jewish leaders that will participate and always have. This coming Thursday is that day. Thousands of cities around the country will observe the National Day of Prayer that President Trump will do, as all the Presidents for many decades have done, and sign recognizing that as the Day of Prayer. Congress has passed it recognizing that. Though Senator SCHUMER wouldn’t let us have it in the rotunda, it will be in Statuary Hall, and it will be a day of prayer, thanksgiving, and fasting for some. Our National Day of Prayer is really a day of celebration. I think it is something that has characterized this Nation from our very beginning. We had an order like none other from any commander I am ever familiar with. In my 4 years in the Army, we never had a commander issue an order like this. And certainly if one had been issued under the Obama administration’s generals and admirals, the administration would have, no doubt, fired them immediately. Washington issued an order for all its commanders that they had to allow our military members fighting for the United States to worship on Sunday. They were to set up chaplains in each unit if there was someone who could fulfill that role, and, if not, they would be allowed to go to another unit’s worship of the Lord on Sunday. Now, that was back in our founding. That is when we were fighting for existence. And for all those who have turned a blind eye to the real history of America—which is really hard to do with all of the evidence that is so overwhelming. But if one would just go down to the State Department down the road here, within the glass case there at the State Department, they have a copy of the original Treaty of Paris, 1783. It surprised me. As much as I have studied history, I did not know how it started until I saw that. And I was actually with our pastor from Green Acres Baptist Church there in Tyler. He and his wife, Cindy, were with me and my wife, Kathy. I have actually not been on a tour of the State Department since. A lot of it is pretty boring, but this is intriguing. This is the front of the Treaty of Paris, 1783. This was the document that required England, Great Britain, to recognize, in writing, that the United States of America was an independent country, that we did not have to do what we were dictated to by Great Britain, and that we were free and independent. There was still concern there in 1783. b1300 Yes, they surrendered at Yorktown under General Cornwallis’ command, but it is still 1783, the delegates are there at Paris, and the United States delegates are trying to figure out: How do we get these people to swear that they recognize we have a right to be independent? What can we get them to swear under that is so important to us and so important to those delegates from England that they would not dare break that oath? Should we have them swear in the name of Allah, or Muhammad, or Confucius, or Buddha? What could we get the representative delegates from Great Britain, the United Kingdom, the most powerful empire in the world at that time, the most powerful military, navy to swear to? They are a lot bigger than us. What do we get them to swear under so that we know they have to take it seriously? Well, they came up with it, and it starts the treaty, and it is the only thing in the Treaty of Paris that is huge lettering. And even I was surprised. In huge lettering, it says: ‘‘In the name of the most holy and undivided trinity. . . .’’ That is how the Treaty of Paris starts. That is what the United Kingdom Representatives had to swear under: ‘‘In the name of the most holy and undivided trinity.’’ It is also worth noting, as Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the planner of 9/ 11—thank God he is still in Guantanamo Bay—he noted in his pleading, he gave the reference to the verse in the Koran that says that anyone who attempts to attach someone else to God, to Allah, should be killed. It is a capital offense. It is a deathpenalty offense the way Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, ISIS, and others read the Koran, the way the radicals read it. It is a deathpenalty offense, as he points out in his pleadings, if you say God has a son. If you say there is a Holy Trinity, that is worth the death penalty for the radical Islamists—not for the moderates, but some estimate 10 percent of Islam. It is a capital offense, and both the United Kingdom Representatives and the United States of America Representatives signed proudly the Treaty of Paris, recognizing our independence, proclaiming what Khalid Sheikh Mohammed says is a deathpenalty sentence. ‘‘In the name of the most holy and undivided trinity.’’ They said right there. It started our country, independently. We recognize there is a most holy and undivided trinity. We say the Declaration of Independence started us, but that didn’t really happen until somebody else agrees it is true. And our enemy, at that time, agreed it was true, and we began our Nation. And this National Day of Prayer is a day of rejoicing, a day of thanksgiving to the most holy and undivided trinity. And it would have been awesome if it could have been in the rotunda, but, under the rules of the Senate, if any Senator puts a hold on the bill, then it doesn’t go forward for unanimous consent. Hopefully, Senator SCHUMER is still there next year when it comes time. Hopefully, he won’t put a hold on it if Anne Graham Lotz still has a vision of having the National Day of Prayer 
celebration there in the Nation’s rotunda. But instead, next Thursday, it will be after 5 so it doesn’t interfere with the normal workings. I had no problem with having the Holocaust recognition at 11 a.m. in the morning. Not only did I not have a problem with it, I was proud that we did it during the day like that. It should be noted. People should understand that unless you stand up for freedom, stand up for the teachings of Jesus, stand up for things that are actually in the Bible, you are not going to have the kind of freedom that allows people to be part of the greatest country in the world because that greatest country in world history will end up sliding down to the dustbin of history. So it will be a great day. Mr. Speaker, I hope to see you there. I yield back the remainder of my time.

THE NEXT 100 DAYS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida (Mr. LAWSON ) for 30 minutes. Mr. LAWSON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, we have heard a lot of big ideas and promises from the President, but we haven’t seen much intangible action from the Republicans over the last 100 days. We know we need to continue to improve health care in this country, yet Republicans have failed to come up with a reasonable solution. As someone who has spent over 36 years working in the insurance industry, I stand willing and ready to work with my colleagues to improve health care for my constituents and the American people, especially in the Fifth Congressional District. What we really need is for my colleagues to focus on energy and creating jobs. That is so important here in America. What we don’t need is to continue with more of the antics from the President who is more focused on selling scores from the campaign trail than finding real solutions for the American people. It really is a sad day in America when Congress can’t come together to make real progress for the American people. Real progress. We need to put aside the bickering and roll up our sleeves in order to get the work done for the people in America. That is something we should all be able to do within the next 100 days. There has been so much concern about what is happening with the present administration over the next 100 days. So since that is prevalent and the American people have heard about it, now the concentration is on what Congress and the President are going to do for the next 100 days for the American people. I urge my colleagues to join me in doing what is right—right for their constituents, right for the American people. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the remainder of my time. f

PRAYER The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer: Let us pray. Eternal God, thank You for Your great mercies for us, for while we are yet seeking You, You find us. Before we call, You answer, and while we are speaking, You fulfill Your purposes. Guide our lawmakers on their legislative pilgrimage. Lord, provide them with a spirit of wisdom so that they will be able to discern what is best. May they strive to honor You in their thoughts, words, and actions. Help them to faithfully seek truth and justice for all rather than privilege for a few. O God, give us all the courage to go forth to live as we have prayed. We pray in Your strong Name. Amen.
