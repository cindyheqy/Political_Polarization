Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, Dana Milbank had an interesting column in the morning Post about the feckless congressional response to the opioid crisis. Both the administration and Congress have been good at hyping the crisis, but when it comes time to actually taking action, almost nothing happens. The failure to protect our citizens is appalling, especially since most of the opioid crisis is a result of failed public policies. We have spent over $1 trillion on a failed war on drugs that concentrates on prohibition and punishment instead of treatment, which would help people break the cycle of addiction. The challenges that drove people to abuse opioids in the first place, like chronic pain, depression, and lax policies prescribing vast quantities of ever more powerful opioids, should never have been allowed to happen in the first place. It was a public policy failure of government, the industry, and, sadly, some unscrupulous practitioners that allowed the addiction genie out of the bottle. When denied access to opioids, people, understandably, turn to heroin and other damaging and addictive drugs because they were trapped by these powerful forces. Few people willingly damage their bodies and destroy their families and careers, if not for powerful forces beyond their control. As appalling as this failure is, what is even worse is that we fail to take reasonable, commonsense steps to stop it. The easiest solution is to provide more access to medical marijuana, already available in 28 States. This availability, by the way, has been driven as a result of citizen action and not politicians, who have too often been afraid to touch it. The evidence is powerful and overwhelming. Where there is access to medical marijuana to treat the problems that drove people on the path to addiction in the first place, there are fewer pills prescribed and overdose deaths drop. It is clear that using medical marijuana is as effective, or perhaps even more effective, than opioids to treat pain. They cause less damage to people’s health and are far less costly than pharmaceuticals. I provided the subcommittee taking testimony with the facts and citations that would justify digging deep into this potential solution. Cannabis reduces overdose deaths, reduces opioid consumption, and it can prevent dose escalation and the development of opioid tolerance, which leads to that cycle, and too often, tragically, opioid deaths: 175 people a day. As my friend, GREGWALDEN , pointed out in the subcommittee hearing yesterday, more people die in Oregon from opioid overdose than traffic accidents. More benefits, fewer side effects, lower costs. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  the evidence I gave to the Subcommittee on Health yesterday. 
PHYSICIAN GUIDE TO CANNABIS ASSISTED  OPIOID REDUCTION  (Prepared by Adrianne WilsonPoe, Ph.D.) Cannabis reduces opioid overdose mortality. In states with medicinal cannabis laws, opioid overdoses drop by an average of 25%. 
This effect gets bigger the longer the law has been in place. For instance, there is a 33% drop in mortality in California, where compassionate use has been in place since 1996. This finding was replicated by Columbia’s school of public health, using a completely different analysis strategy. Cannabis reduces opioid consumption. Cannabis is opioidsparing in chronic pain patients. When patients are given access to cannabis, they drop their opioid use by roughly 50%. This finding has been replicated several times from Ann Arbor to Jerusalem. This opioid sparing effect is accompanied by an enhancement of cognitive function once patients begin cannabis therapy: this effect is most likely due to the fact that patients reduce their opioid use. Cannabis use is associated with a reduction in not only opioid consumption, but also many other drugs including benzodiazepines, which also have a high incidence of fatal overdose. In states with medicinal cannabis laws, the number of prescriptions for analgesic and anxiolytic drugs (among others) are substantially reduced. Medicare and Medicaid prescription costs are substantially lower in states with cannabis laws. Cannabis can prevent dose escalation and the development of opioid tolerance. Cannabinoids and opioids have acute analgesic synergy. When opioids and cannabinoids are coadministered, they produce greater than additive analgesia. This suggests that analgesic dose of opioids is substantially lower for patients using cannabis therapy. In chronic pain patients on opioid therapy, cannabis does not affect pharmacokinetics of opioids, yet it still enhances analgesia. This finding further supports a synergistic mechanism of action. Preclinical models indicate that cannabinoids attenuate the development of opioid tolerance. Cannabis, alone or in combination with opioids, could be a viable firstline analgesic. The CDC has updated its recommendations in the spring of 2016, stating that most cases of chronic pain should be treated with non opioids. The National Academies of Science and Medicine recently conducted an exhaustive review of 10,000+ human studies published since 1999, definitively concluding that cannabis itself (not a specific cannabinoid or cannabisderived molecule) is safe and effective for the treatment of chronic pain. When 3,000 chronic pain patients were surveyed, they overwhelmingly preferred cannabis as an opioid alternative. 97% ‘‘strongly agreed/agreed’’ that they could decrease their opioid use when using cannabis. 92% ‘‘strongly agreed/agreed’’ that they prefer cannabis to treat their medical condition. 81% ‘‘strongly agreed/ agreed’’ that cannabis by itself was more effective than taking opioids. Cannabis may be a viable tool in medicationassisted relapse prevention. CBD is nonintoxicating, and is the 2nd most abundant cannabinoid found in cannabis. CBD alleviates the anxiety that leads to drug craving. In human pilot studies, CBD administration is sufficient to prevent heroin craving for at least 7 days. Cannabis users are more likely to adhere to naltrexone maintenance for opioid dependence. 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. There is a reason that up to 90 percent of the American public favors greater access to medical marijuana. Last year, voters in Florida approved their program by over 70 percent. Mr. Speaker, the Federal Government continues to interfere, threatening medical marijuana programs, which requires Congress to step in to shield it, as we have done last year and for the previous 2 years. Unfortunately, the Rules Committee denied us a chance to vote on it. Last Congress, both Houses approved measures for VA doctors to be able to consult with veterans who have a serious overdose problem. Despite passing both Chambers, it was stripped out and the Rules Committee failed to allow us to vote on this as well. Most tragically, Congress continues to allow the Federal Government to have a stranglehold on research to be conducted to be able to definitely answer these questions. I strongly urge my colleagues to join my friend, Dr. ANDYHARRIS , and me on our research bill, H.R. 3391. There is no reason that the Federal Government denies research to be able to definitively answer these questions. I am tired of looking at the opioid damage in my State and around the country, and have Congress propose Bandaids when there is a simple, commonsense, widely accepted, and popular approach: allow people access to medical marijuana. The time to do it is now. Lives are being lost as we dither. 
NATIONAL BLUE RIBBON SCHOOLS AWARD The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LANCE ) for 5 minutes. Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of The Academy of Our Lady of Peace in New Providence, New Jersey, and the Woodland School in Warren, New Jersey, for being named Blue Ribbon Schools by the United States Department of Education. New Providence is in Union County, and Warren is in Somerset County, New Jersey, both in the district I have the honor of representing. The National Blue Ribbon Schools award honors public and private elementary, middle, and high schools where students perform at very high levels or where significant improvements are being made in levels of achievement. The Academy of Our Lady of Peace and the Woodland School were cited as exemplary highperforming schools, as measured by State assessments and national tests. This recognition is a testament to the outstanding work and dedication of the faculty and staff in creating schools where students master challenging content. These are among our youngest students, infectious in their enthusiasm because of the excellent schools they attend. I commend Joel Castillo, principal of the Academy of Our Lady of Peace; and Jeffrey Heaney, principal of the Woodland School, for all of their hard work. I also commend the faculty, parents, and the communities in general. This prestigious award is noted throughout the country, and certainly the United States Department of Education is to be commended for presenting these awards. The Academy of Our Lady of Peace and the Woodland School are proud examples of academic excellence and worthy of this national distinction. f 
ASSISTANCE FOR PUERTO RICO The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. GUTIE´RREZ ) for 5 minutes. Mr. GUTIE´RREZ. Mr. Speaker, a little over a month ago, Hurricane Irma struck the Caribbean island of St. Maarten very hard. Within a couple of days, I got a call from loved ones of a couple of constituents. They had family members trapped at a hotel in St. Maarten with dozens of other Americans. The power was out, they were running out of food and water, and incidents of looting were reported. So they called me, their Congressman, and I called the State Department to see what could be done. Within 36 hours of my call, our U.S. citizens—nearly 150 of them—were evacuated from an island, in the ocean, surrounded by water. Do you know where they were taken to for safety? Puerto Rico. Yes, Puerto Rico, where it has now been 3 weeks since Hurricane Maria and most people do not have power or clean drinking water, and where the deterioration of the healthcare system is leaving people without critical treatments and causing the death toll to go up. Now, in St. Maarten, this is what the State Department said, according to NBC News: ‘‘Evacuation efforts will prioritize U.S. citizens needing urgent medical care.’’ Within a few days, they had evacuated 1,200 Americans. So, right now, if a thousand U.S. citizens are facing danger in Japan, Ethiopia, or Finland, our State Department would arrange to save them. But we have millions of Americans facing danger in Puerto Rico and we can’t get the same help, not from the military, not from FEMA, and not from the State Department, because they don’t assist U.S. citizens who are on U.S. soil, even if that soil is a colony in the ocean surrounded by water, as our President reminds us. It took 36 hours to get evacuated from St. Maarten. Three weeks in Puerto Rico and still no plan for evacuation. This morning, the President is tweeting that he wants to pull FEMA and the military out of Puerto Rico. How long do we have to stay in Puerto Rico, Mr. President? Until every Puerto Rican’s name is taken off the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall or erased from the records of the Korean war, Afghanistan, and Iraq. 
As long as it takes. They gave their lives and died. Yesterday, a lot of us received military briefings from FEMA, the military, and Homeland Security. I wanted to know whether FEMA and the military are prepared to take people off the island, as we normally do in emergency situations. We did it in Houston, in Jacksonville, and New Orleans. No, the Governor has not asked for help in evacuating people, they told me. I asked: How many bridges, even temporary ones, have been constructed in Puerto Rico to replace those destroyed by the hurricane to allow for the transportation of supplies and the evacuation of people? They said: None, Congressman. Zero. We have not erected any bridges. Again, because the Governor of Puerto Rico hasn’t asked us to. When I was there, I flew over the town of Maricao in the mountains, well known for coffee. There are six ways in and out of the town, and five of those bridges are gone. Three weeks after Dday in 1944, the allies liberated the deepwater port of Cherbourg, one of the most important objectives in France. It took 20 days and we built bridges and communication lines along the way. We made better progress in the 3 weeks after Dday than we are making on Puerto Rico. And in Puerto Rico, to the best of my knowledge, there are no Germans shooting at us. Now, when I asked the officials about evacuating people from the island, they had no real answer. But if I remember correctly, FEMA and the military come to us to fund their budget every year. They are accountable to this Congress. We are accountable to our constituents. Constituents are coming to me, as they did in St. Maarten, and are saying: Help us get our families out of danger’s way. Mr. Speaker, when will we be able to give these constituents an answer as to why their family members and loved ones aren’t being allowed to leave the island and evacuated from danger? This weekend, Members of Congress are going to Puerto Rico. I spoke with a few of them and said: Hey, at night, you should go to this place where it is really bad. One stopped me, cut me off, and said: Congressman, we are not staying overnight. So, on an island where 95 percent of the power is out, our Members of Congress are only going to see things during the day, not during the pitchblack darkness, which is what Puerto Ricans are living with every single night for the last 3 weeks. Regardless of what my colleagues see during the day or what the President tweets in the morning, my friends stand in line for hours for food, if they can find it; my constituents are worried about their family members; and 5 million Puerto Ricans in the diaspora have run out of patience. We want our people free to live in the United States of America wherever they can. Mr. Speaker, my constituents want the government to help get their families out of danger’s way. 
HONORING THE MANY ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF STUART EPPERSON The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for 5 minutes. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize North Carolina Fifth District constituent, Mr. Stuart Epperson, whose work has positively affected so many in North Carolina and so many across this great Nation. Stuart, or ‘‘Stu,’’ as his friends know him, is living proof that not only is the American Dream possible, it is achievable if you are simply willing to work hard for it. Stu’s story is a model one for all. b1015 Growing up on a small tobacco farm in Virginia, Stu learned hard work and perseverance. In the 1980s, Stu and his brotherinlaw started the Salem Media Group to minister to and report positive news to families across the country. Under his leadership, Salem Media Group and Salem Radio now host 120 radio stations, 67 of which are in the top 25 markets, and operate 2,400 affiliates. Mr. Speaker, at a time when many Americans opt to turn off the news due to the negative content, Mr. Epperson’s audience is tuning in to be inspired and to be informed. The content put forth by the Salem Media Group serves as a beacon of hope to the many families seeking positive and instructive stories. Mr. Speaker, when I consider the body of Mr. Epperson’s work, I am reminded of the parable of the faithful servant in Luke 12:48. The Good Book tells us that: ‘‘For unto whomsoever much is given, of him much shall be required. . . . ‘’ The Lord has certainly gifted Mr. Epperson with some amazing abilities, and in return, Mr. Epperson has used these talents to give back to multiple community activities. Among those activities are the WinstonSalem Rescue Mission, Salem Pregnancy Care Center, One Kid at a Time mentoring program, and the Christian Association of Youth Mentoring, which he founded. Finally, Mr. Speaker, I am sure that Stu would agree that the adage ‘‘behind every good man is a good woman’’ is a true one for him. Stu married the love of his life, Nancy Etsinger Epperson, 54 years ago. This lovely couple has 4 children and 21 grandchildren. I commend Stu Epperson not only for his many accomplishments but also for his dedication to ensuring that radio remains familyfriendly and valuefocused. In recognition of Stu’s life and work, I am pleased to announce that soon Stu will be receiving the highly coveted Vision and Leadership Award from the Family Research Council. This award is justly deserved by such an accomplished man, and I add my salute to him. I know that the community in WinstonSalem, this Nation, and the wider world have benefitted from Stu Epperson’s many efforts to make the world a better place. I commend Mr. Epperson on his many accomplishments and his service to our Nation. 
STRUGGLES IN PUERTO RICO AND THE VIRGIN ISLANDS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. BROWN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Speaker, it is hard to tell where and in what direction Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands are heading today. There is not enough food, millions are struggling to live without drinking water and electricity, and only 8 percent of the roads are open to traffic. Containers with supplies, medical supplies, and food and other commodities are sitting in containers on the docks in the Port of San Juan and are not moving towards the people and the communities that need them the most. Struggles in the Virgin Islands are less heard about but no less real. The question is whether we, as a nation, are doing all we can for the citizens of this Nation. Let’s compare. After an earthquake hit Haiti in 2010, where the infrastructure was severely damaged, the U.S. military mobilized as if we were going to war. The very next morning, after the earthquake hit, an Army unit was airborne. Within 2 weeks, 33 ships and 22,000 soldiers had arrived, and more than 300 helicopters were delivering millions of pounds of food and water, not just to the port, but the people of Haiti. By contrast, today, there are fewer than 14,000 military personnel assisting in relief efforts in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, and there are only 88 helicopters and only 4 naval ships, one of them the USNS Comfort that are aiding 3.5 million Americans—3.4 million Americans in Puerto Rico, 100,000 Americans in the Virgin Islands. In Haiti, Mr. Speaker, we airlifted 15,000 U.S. citizens in 2010 after the earthquake, but in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, we are unwilling to evacuate a single American, even those who have relatives and friends in the many communities across the 50 States of this great country. As Americans are starving and Americans are desperate, our response needs to be more vigorous. Now, let’s be sure, the military is doing what we are asking them to do. This is not a criticism of the military 
not doing what we are asking them to do, but the White House is not asking the military to do enough. Mr. Speaker, the President must lead on this issue. We have got dedicated members of the Army, Air Force, Navy, Marines, and Coast Guard who are willing, ready, and able to be in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands to deliver the relief to our neighbors and our citizens. We need to ask the Department of Defense to send more engineers, more transportation companies, and expeditionary sustainment battalions. Yesterday, I asked a senior military leader: How many pontoon bridges have been erected in Puerto Rico to cross those washed out roads? Zero. How many miles of power transmission lines have been reestablished to get electricity out to more communities? The answer is zero. We have military engineers on the ground, but they have not been asked to do that. We need to direct our military to provide the direct services on the local or, in military parlance, on the tactical level. I am not talking about longterm rebuilding of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands by the United States military. I am talking about directing the Department of Defense to establish the minimum infrastructure necessary to do the job that we should be asking them to do, which is to provide relief to 3.5 million Americans in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Strategic movements are good, military assessments and evaluations help, but what is needed is no less than what was done 7 years ago in Haiti. Mr. Speaker, the President must lead on this issue, and the President must ask our military to do more. 
NATIONAL FARMERS DAY The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON ) for 5 minutes. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, today is National Farmers Day. From farm to fork, our farmers work hard to put food on dinner tables across this country and around the world. Today has traditionally been a day to recognize farmers and thank them for all their endless hard work. Records of National Farmers Day events date back to the 1800s. Mr. Speaker, our farmers are the cornerstone of our rural communities. They face tough odds by the very nature of the business, and food security is national security. Right now, there is a critical shortfall of skilled young and beginning farmers and ranchers. That is why, together with Congressman JOECOURT NEY from Connecticut and Congressman JOHNFASOfrom New York, we introduced the Young Farmer Success Act. This legislation provides incentives for those who would like to pursue a future in the agriculture industry by adding farmers to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, which currently offers loan payback assistance for professions such as government service, teaching, and nursing. Under the program, eligible public service professionals who make 10 years of incomedriven student loan payments can have the balance of their loans forgiven. On Monday, I heard from a number of young farmers in upstate New York in Congressman FASO’s district. The House Agriculture Committee hosted a farm bill listening session at SUNY Cobleskill, and we covered topics from dairy to specialty crops to nutrition assistance programs, and we heard a lot of excellent feedback from those who shared their stories with us. As the House Agriculture Committee works to craft the next farm bill, these listening sessions have allowed us to hear firsthand from those who are directly impacted by the farm bill. They provide us with real world examples of what is working and what isn’t working. With farmers in every region of this country, we heard from many different perspectives. This feedback will help us write the best farm bill possible. Mr. Speaker, food security is national security, and it aids the long term sustainability of our country. They provide fresh produce and products to communities throughout the country, and there is no better food than something grown locally. Today, we celebrate our food producers on National Farmers Day, but we should also celebrate them every day for putting food on our tables and in our grocery stores. Let’s face it, farming is a tough business. Long hours, unpredictable commodity prices, and, even more, unpredictable weather conditions, but it is also exciting, rewarding, and full of opportunities. Generations of farmers have worked every patch of American soil caring for the Earth, their animals, and their neighbors. Mr. Speaker, as vice chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, I want to wholeheartedly thank America’s farmers for providing our country with safe, sustainable, healthy, and nutritious food every day. Happy Farmers Day. 
AMENDMENT TO THE WAR POWERS ACT The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DEFAZIO) for 5 minutes. Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, well, last weekend I was shocked to read the statements of the Republican chair of the Foreign Relations Committee in the Senate, Senator CORKER . He said that, ‘‘Trump has put us on the path to World War III.’’ This makes it essential that Congress assert its full powers under the Constitution of the United States. In reaction to Nixon’s secret bombing of Cambodia and the aftermath, Congress passed something called the War Powers Act. Unfortunately, there was a dispute between the two bodies, and, ultimately, the Senate prevailed and watered down the bill. Instead of saying, ‘‘Before the President engages our troops in hostilities, that he or she must come to the Congress,’’ instead, the bill ultimately adopted saying, ‘‘48 hours after the President has engaged our troops in hostilities, he or she must report to the Congress and then seek subsequent authorization, or the troops would be withdrawn after 60 days.’’ I have introduced legislation in this and preceding Congresses to fix that. That clearly does not represent the constitutional powers of the United States Congress. The Constitution is absolutely clear. Only Congress has the authority to declare war. Once war is declared, the President, under the Constitution, is the Commander in Chief and would act with one voice to conduct the war and coordinate military efforts. So my bill would say—do away with the allowance of 48 hours and say: Before engaging U.S. troops and military in hostilities, that the President must first come to the Congress and seek a declaration of war. I think it is absolutely essential that this Congress act on this legislation and make it clear to the President of the United States that he does not have the authority to wake up one morning and tweet of an attack against another country and engage these people in an escalation that may end, as Senator CORKER says, in World War III. This is a very dangerous time for our country. It is time for this separate and equal branch of the government to assert its full authority to rein in any and all dangerous activities by this President. 
b1030 FREEDOM OF SPEECH The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. FRANKS ) for 5 minutes. Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, the First Amendment of our Constitution gives us this precious freedom of speech that we so cherish in America. Contrary to heated debate and public opinion, we, in the United States, rarely face the kind of persecution that necessitated this great protection. So I rise today to shed light on the abridgement of freedom of speech that is often widely discussed, but that few Americans ever have to endure. Across the world, Mr. Speaker, individual freedom of speech is frequently infringed. A posted critique or just sharing one’s views freely on the internet can be punishable, even by death. Late one evening in September, a wellknown Indian journalist, Gauri Lankesh, was murdered outside her 
home. She was ‘‘an antiestablishment figure with a reputation for her fearless criticism of undemocratic elements within the parties in power.’’ The circumstances of her death were ‘‘strikingly similar’’ to the murders of three additional Indian activists. Just weeks ago, another of India’s most prominent political journalists, Professor Kancha Ilaiah, known for critiquing India’s caste social order, was threatened by a Hindu member of India’s parliament. This member of parliament, who is an ally of the current BJP government, issued a statement that Kancha should be ‘‘publicly hanged.’’ Kancha subsequently received numerous death threats. These threats had a significant effect. A mob tried to attack Professor Ilaiah with stones as he and a coworker were driving to a meeting. Kancha is now under selfimposed house arrest because he is simply not safe otherwise. Was Professor Ilaiah’s crime significant? Kancha was called a modernday Dr. Ambedkar, who is known as the ‘‘Father of the Indian Constitution,’’ and Professor Ilaiah’s crime was he was the author of ‘‘Why I am Not a Hindu.’’ A recent translation of his 2009 book ‘‘PostHindu India’’ is what seems to have sparked the threats against him. This book described the polarized context of modernday India specifically dealing with the productivity of the Dalits and the ‘‘low’’ castes and the seeming spiritual and monetary monopoly of the ‘‘higher’’ castes. These critiques became even more relevant in India’s growing agrarian crisis, the resulting farmer suicides due to hopelessness, and the massive joblessness due to demonetization and economic slowdown. Mr. Speaker, I stand on the floor of the United States House of Representatives to state unequivocally that the United States and the entire global community is, and should be, deeply concerned about this threat to the life of Professor Kancha Ilaiah, one of the world’s wellknown intellectuals. Our trusted ally and friend, India, is better than this, Mr. Speaker. Professor Kancha Ilaiah’s right and freedom to speak should not be infringed; and his protection, and that of those like him, should be of the utmost priority to the Indian Government. I am able to express freely this viewpoint because we have freedom of speech in the United States of America, Mr. Speaker. May we remember at what cost and for what purpose we were given this priceless freedom. 
BREAST CANCER AWARENESS MONTH The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ ) for 5 minutes. Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Breast Cancer Awareness Month for millions of us in the breast cancer community. The statistics are sobering: one in eight women will get breast cancer in her lifetime. Earlier this year, I received a note from a former staffer. I had watched this young woman blossom from a young and eager intern to ultimately serving as my executive assistant and scheduler before she departed the Hill for graduate school, marriage, and a future full of promise. In the note, she wrote: ‘‘My wedding was about 2 months ago. It was the most magical night of my life. It was so incredible to be surrounded by so many friends and loved ones and good will. I can’t imagine ever being happier than I was that night.’’ She went on to say: ‘‘Unfortunately, things have gotten a little more complicated since then. While I was on my honeymoon, I noticed a small lump in my right breast. Since I had the benefit of working for you, I know that, while rare, it is possible that young women can get breast cancer, and I should take it seriously. I think you can probably guess where this is going . . . ’’ She continued: ‘‘We have no idea how this happened to me. I guess some people get struck by lightning, some people are deathly allergic to peanuts, and some people get breast cancer at 29 with no family history. ‘‘Luckily, it was caught early and the doctors have every confidence that it is fully curable and I will live a long and happy life.’’ She ended the note by thanking me for advocating for breast cancer awareness, specifically for younger women. She said: ‘‘DWS,’’ as I am often referred to by staff, ‘‘keep fighting the good fight. It is saving the lives of people like me.’’ Today, she is fighting the good fight, and I know she will win. Unfortunately, just like my former staffer, I know all too well that it can strike even when you are young. In 2007, when I was only 41 years old, I learned I had breast cancer. Like many others before me, when I was diagnosed, and later identified as a BRCA2 gene mutation carrier, I worried about many things: Would I be there to see my children grow up? Would I be able to beat this disease? Wasn’t I too young to have breast cancer? Fortunately, with the passage of the ACA—the Affordable Care Act—insurance coverage cannot be taken away from people like me and like my former staffer. Access to affordable, quality healthcare is now a right, not a privilege. As Members of Congress, we have a duty to protect this right. Instead of calling for senseless votes to repeal this legislation, I call on my Republican colleagues to join me in recognizing Breast Cancer Awareness Month by supporting those of us who are living healthier, stronger lives every day because of the Affordable Care Act. The statistics for breast cancer remain alarming. The American Cancer Society estimates that 40,610 women will die from breast cancer in 2017 alone, making it the second most common type of cancer death in women. Between the ages of 60 and 84, breast cancer incidence rates are markedly higher in White women than Black women. However, Black women have a higher incidence rate before age 45, and are more likely to die from breast cancer at every age. This is wholly unacceptable. We must take action to provide women with the preventative services and screenings available while educating them on their risks and treatment options. That is why, in 2009, I introduced the EARLY Act, a bipartisan bill that became law as part of the Affordable Care Act, to focus on equipping young women with the tools they need to make informed decisions regarding their breast health. I am proud that the EARLY Act was reauthorized in 2014, and even more proud that it has, and is, helping young women like my former staffer. This Congress, I also introduced the PALS Act with my good friend from Indiana, Congresswoman SUSAN  BROOKS . This bill would extend the moratorium on the United States Preventive Services Task Force mammography screening guidelines to ensure women have access to lifesaving mammograms beginning at age 40. It would also ensure women who have served our country—our women veterans—don’t have to face these same obstacles in getting the care they and their healthcare providers deem necessary. Because many insurance companies use the USPSTF guidelines as the basis for coverage, 22 million women between ages 40 and 49 could be at risk of losing coverage for this lifesaving screening. The bottom line is the vast majority of experts recommend beginning screening mammograms at age 40. Women need to be able to follow this guidance until scientific consensus can be reached. As someone who was diagnosed at just age 41, I can tell you that women need guaranteed access to these tests beginning at age 40. We must also ensure the National Institutes of Health has the funding it needs to continue their progress. I will continue to use my voice and my vote as an appropriator to ensure that critical funding is provided through the annual appropriations bill for breast cancer research, services, and support. My story and my former staffer’s story isn’t unique. That is why we must do more to support our mothers, sisters, daughters, and friends who are 
battling or who have survived this deadly disease. And we must do everything we can to eradicate breast cancer once and for all. I look forward to continuing to work together with all of you—my colleagues on both sides of the aisle—and with the advocacy community to help women know their risk, discover cancer early, and access the best treatment possible. 
HONORING THE MEN AND WOMEN OF EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. KNIGHT ) for 5 minutes. Mr. KNIGHT. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, I, along with my good friend, MARCY KAPTUR , reestablished the NASA Caucus. Last week, I spoke about the 50th anniversary of my father’s absolute airspeed record flight that happened on October 3, 1967. Two weeks ago was the 70th anniversary of the Air Force. On Saturday, we welcome the anniversary of supersonic flight. For years, there was a thought that there was a barrier present to stop aircraft or inhibit flight controls. Many believed attempting to pass through this barrier would be fatal. Well, on October 14, 1947, Captain Charles E. ‘‘Chuck’’ Yeager was dropped from a B–29 at about 45,000 feet and quickly accelerated through that invisible barrier we know as the speed of sound. The first man to achieve Mach 1, we know that as something simple today, but for the last 70 years, it was because of one man that we get to do this. General Yeager retired in 1975 as a brigadier general, after 34 years of flying, for the Army Air Corps and for the United States Air Force. What he achieved that day was something that many men didn’t think would happen. There were about two or three pilots at Muroc or the Army air field out at southern California that were trying to do it, but absolutely there was only one that did it. Captain Yeager, flying the Bell X–1, that he renamed Glamorous Glennis after his wife, was the man who achieved that. I am proud to represent the men and women of Edwards Air Force Base with my good friend, Leader KEVIN MCCARTHY. And I understand what they do on a daily basis from the F–35, to the F–22, to all of the aircraft that happen out there at Edwards, to all of the flying expertise that they have on a daily basis. I am very proud of them. I am proud of what Edwards Air Force Base means to the country, and I am proud of what they mean to the history of this Nation. But I am most proud of the men and women because on a daily basis they create history. For that, I am most proud. HONORING U.S. ARMY SERGEANT LA DAVID T. JOHNSON The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. WILSON ) for 5 minutes. Ms. WILSON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of U.S. Army Sergeant La David T. Johnson, who was killed in Niger, West Africa, during an ambush carried out by Boko Haram and other extremists linked to ISIS. This tragic loss of a life, still so young and so full of promise and potential, is one of the saddest ironies that I could ever imagine. Sergeant Johnson was just 25 years old, the father of two children, and a beloved member of the Miami Gardens community in which I reside. He and his two younger brothers, Keon and Richard, are proud members of the 5,000 Role Models of Excellence Project, an inschool dropout prevention program that I created soon after Sergeant Johnson was born, to ensure that he and other boys and young women of color have unfettered access to roads to success. Five thousand Role Models members all over the world are mourning his death. Sergeant Johnson is married to Myeshia Johnson and has two children, and Myeshia is expecting their third child. I sprung into action after Boko Haram kidnapped 276 schoolgirls in their boarding school in Nigeria. I traveled to Nigeria four times in my quest, and I have initiated the ‘‘Bring Back Our Girls Wear Red Wednesdays’’ in the Congress of the United States. I appreciate the support, especially from our leader, NANCY PELOSI . I traveled there in August and met over 100 girls who were once hostages of Boko Haram. I wanted them to know that this Congress loves them and we will never, ever forget them. Boko Haram actually means ‘‘Western education is a sin.’’ They believe girls should be denied the privilege of an education, and they have killed more people than ISIS. In fact, they have joined forces with ISIS in the region and have killed over 20,000 Africans, sexually abused women and girls, and sends them on suicide missions using babies as decoys. More than 1 million people have been displaced from their homes and are starving to death. What a tragedy. It would be an even greater tragedy to allow the deaths of Sergeant Johnson and his comrades—Staff Sergeant Bryan C. Black, 35, from Washington; Staff Sergeant Jeremiah W. Johnson, 39, from Ohio; and Staff Sergeant Dustin M. Wright, 29, from Georgia—be in vain. Nearly a year ago, this Chamber voted unanimously for legislation that Republican Senator SUSAN COLLINS  from Maine and I introduced that directs the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense and the Director of National Intelligence to jointly develop a 5year strategy to end Boko Haram’s reign of terror. The law also calls for a plan to assist the Nigerian Government, the Multinational Joint Task Force, and international partners in their efforts to counter this regional threat. b1045 Our soldiers were not there to fight but to provide training and assistance to the Nigerian Army forces and the multinational joint task force created to combat Boko Haram. Yes, my heart breaks for this monumental loss, but it is also bursting with pride for all that he achieved and would have accomplished. During the few years in which he bravely served our Nation, he received several awards and accolades, including the Army Achievement Medal, the Army Service Ribbon, and, ironically, the Global War on Terrorism Medal. Boko Haram is a threat to the many nations across the globe that, like the United States, have committed monetary and human resources to help defeat this terrorist group, and we must never ever forget that this heinous organization’s daily list of casualties could include one or more of our own, like Sergeant Johnson, Staff Sergeant Black, Staff Sergeant Jeremiah Johnson, and Staff Sergeant Wright. May they rest in peace. f 
BREAST CANCER AWARENESS MONTH The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. MARSHALL ) for 5 minutes. Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, as an OB/GYN and now a U.S. Congressman, I want to continue to highlight October as Breast Cancer Awareness Month. One out of eight women will develop breast cancer. Let me say that again, Mr. Speaker. One out of eight women will develop breast cancer. If you are a woman over the age of 35, you should ask your physician if you need a mammogram; and certainly if you are over the age of 50, every woman needs a mammogram every year. A mammogram is quick, it is easy, and the great thing about mammograms is how easy it can be to catch breast cancer at its very early stages and give us a great chance to treat the problem. Over my career as a physician, we have helped hundreds of women who have successfully fought this dreaded disease. There are great treatments out there and ways we can save lives, so I encourage every woman over the age of 35 to talk to their physician about a mammogram. It is one thing to be aware of breast cancer, but it is another thing to do something about it. 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join the National Women’s Business Council in recognizing October as National Women’s Small Business Month. 
Women bring unique and invaluable skills and experiences to the workplace. Across the country, there are over 9 million womenowned small businesses, and they contribute over a trillion dollars to our national economy. In Kansas alone, there are more than 73 businesses owned by women, representing industries such as accounting, veterinary medicine, and management consulting. As I have toured Kansas, I have met with women entrepreneurs in towns like Ellsworth and Emporia learning about how their businesses are growing local economies and the positive impact these businesses have on their communities. It is inspiring to see what these women have achieved and to hear their perspective on the challenges that smallbusiness owners face. I ask my colleagues to join me now in celebrating these women during National Women’s Small Business Month. 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, though mostly known as the top basketball program in the country, I want to acknowledge and salute the University of Kansas and our innovative work through the Kansas Heart and Stroke Collaborative. The collaborative has worked diligently over the past 3 years to establish a new model and standard for how to efficiently treat the care of heart disease and strokes in rural areas. They provide better care in a way that saves overall costs and is truly a win win. Fiftythree counties in Kansas, with more than 90 hospitals, clinics, and offices, now are represented in the collaborative care model. Not only do they better the lives of patients in rural Kansas, they do so based on a model that is a poster child for other conservativestyle demonstration projects. In 2014, the University of Kansas partnered with Hays Medical Center and received a $12 million, 3year innovation grant. Now that 3year window is closing, and I am pleased to say that the collaborative will continue as a selfsustaining entity. Let me say that again. This will continue as a selfsustaining entity, continue to provide efficient care, and, literally, save thousands of rural Americans’ lives and give them more meaningful life after their stroke or heart attack. As a physician in rural Kansas for three decades, this is one of the greatest success stories I have ever seen, and it will always hold a special place in my heart, as I have seen it unfold right before my eyes. The Kansas Heart and Stroke Collaborative provides hope and direction for rural healthcare in Kansas and beyond, and it should be looked at by other States. ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. ALGREEN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a proud Member of this House. I am always so honored to know that I have the preeminent privilege of standing in the well of the Congress of the United States of America. There are only 435 people who are elected as Members from the various States who have voting rights in Congress on legislation, who have this privilege, so it is an honor for me to do it. I want people to know that when I stand here, my words are sincere and my efforts are those that I believe can make a difference in the lives of all Americans. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, I called to the attention of the House of Representatives Articles of Impeachment, and I called these Articles of Impeachment to the attention of the House because it is a part of a process. It can be a threestep process, which has been used on multiple occasions in the past, a threestep process that allows the Member to give notice. After the Member gives notice, the Member does not have to allow a vote to take place immediately. The Member can decide that, rather than have the vote take place within 2 days, the Member can give notice a second time and then allow that process to move forward, and the Speaker can then set a time for the Member to give a final notice, or present the actual Articles of Impeachment. I have chosen to use the threestep process: initial notice; thereafter to come back before this House, which every Member has the privilege of doing and which has been done before, and again notice the House; and, thereafter, have the articles considered with a final reading. Mr. Speaker, I don’t think it is any secret that I have indicated that the President should be impeached. It is no secret. I don’t think it is any secret that I have indicated that there will be a vote in Congress on Articles of Impeachment. If perchance I have been misunderstood, allow me to make it perspicuously clear today: there will be a vote. There is a threestep process that we are pursuing. That process will continue when we return. And when we return, I assure everyone there will be a vote. There has been some confusion. My suspicion is because where there are few facts, there is much speculation, so there has been some confusion about why we didn’t go forward yesterday. So now allow me to make it abundantly clear: no person, no living, breathing child of God influenced my decision to move forward as I have. Others can give their opinions. No one did. I did not receive an opinion indicating that I should not go forward as I did. I have made my decision. This is where I stand. If I stand alone, Mr. Speaker, I have no fear of standing alone. If Rosa Parks could sit alone in a racist Southern town to deal with injustice and bring about some form of justice, surely I can stand alone in the well of the Congress and stand alone on where I stand with impeachment. If Dr. King could go to jail and write one of the greatest essays on human rights I have ever read, surely I can stand in the well of the Congress—if he could go to jail—and I can extoll and expand upon why I believe we have to move forward with impeachment. Finally, this: those of you who bothered to read the Articles of Impeachment, and I beg that you would, because that is why this time is being made available, so that everyone can read it and understand why we are going forward, and those of who you will read them will find that I don’t approve of anyone calling mothers dogs. I don’t approve of it. I don’t approve of it. I don’t care who you are. When you say ‘‘SOB,’’ you are saying that somebody’s mother is a dog. I don’t approve of that. By the way, that is not widely published that that is in the Articles of Impeachment, but it is there. It is there for all to see. So for those who believe that motherhood is sacred, for those who believe that a President of the United States ought not say ‘‘SOB,’’ and you know what it means—I never use the B word. I never use profanity. But I want you to know this: I am going to move forward with those Articles of Impeachment, and motherhood is sacred. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. 
RECOGNIZING MATT BELLINA The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK ) for 5 minutes. Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share the story of my constituent, Matt Bellina, of Holland, Pennsylvania. On April 9, 2014, at the age of 30, Matt was diagnosed with ALS, otherwise known as Lou Gehrig’s disease. ALS attacks the nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord, causing those with ALS to lose control of their muscles. Matt graduated from Virginia Tech in May 2005 and received his commission into the U.S. Navy as a naval aviator. Following the onset of his symptoms, which include cramping hands, twitching arms, stiffness in his legs, Matt was grounded from flying. He continued to serve in the Navy in an administrative capacity until he medically retired in 2014, with the rank of lieutenant commander. He eventually moved back home to Bucks County with his wife, Caitlin, and his young children to be surrounded by family and friends. 
Although this disease stopped Matt’s career in its tracks, he persisted and actively involved himself in the ALS community and became a strong advocate for righttotry legislation. Mr. Speaker, each year Americans like Matt Bellina receive the devastating news of a terminal diagnosis. Even with the amazing work done in American medical research, for too many families, access to these potentially lifesaving treatments will come too late or not at all. Thousands of terminally ill patients suffer needlessly while awaiting final approval for drugs, therapies, and other medical technologies. While the Food and Drug Administration carries out its threephase approval process, which can take years and cost billions of dollars, many patients simply want the chance to try treatments that are already demonstrated to be safe. A bill that was unanimously passed by the Senate will offer them a chance to extend their lives. The Right to Try Act would ensure that terminally ill patients, together with their physicians and pharmaceutical manufacturers, can administer investigational treatments where no alternative exists. In fact, this bipartisan idea is already the law in 37 States. A Federal righttotry law would prevent the government from blocking access to potentially lifesaving medications. It would require patients to first try all other available treatments and be unable to participate in clinical trials. For those patients caught between the traditional drug approval delays, the clinical trial process for which they do not qualify, and limited time, the right to try simply establishes the freedom for patients and their doctors to try therapies where the benefits far outweigh the risks. It gives them an option of trying to save their life. Mr. Speaker, whether it is a father courageously battling ALS or a brave child living with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, they deserve the right to try. 
MASS SHOOTING IN LAS VEGAS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. KIHUEN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about the tragedy that happened in my home town of Las Vegas last Sunday, October 1. Last week, a horrific mass shooting took place in the community that I grew up in. Immediately when I heard the news on Sunday night, like so many people, I felt helpless, and I rushed to the hospital to see how I could help. This shooting was the deadliest in modern U.S. history: 58 innocent people have died, and over 500 were injured. The 58 innocent victims came from all walks of life. They came to Las Vegas from all over the United States of America. Some were there to celebrate their birthdays, their favorite country singer, a night out with friends and family, and even celebrating their wedding anniversaries. b1100 Even though these families will never get another Christmas, another Thanksgiving, or another birthday with their loved one, they will never forget them, and we won’t either. As we grieve for those who were killed or injured, and pray for their families, I want to recognize the heroes who bravely and selflessly rushed to help: law enforcement officers and first responders, including some who were off duty and attending the concert, who ran toward the gunfire to protect the concertgoers and provide desperately needed care for victims; people at the concert who shielded those around them, gave them medical care, and led others to safety, exposing themselves to the hail of bullets while they tried to save others; people driving by who used their cars to help take shooting victims to the hospitals; strangers helping strangers; the healthcare professionals, doctors, nurses, support staff, and volunteers who have been working tirelessly around the clock to care for the more than 500 injured people; hospitality industry employees, who rushed to help however they could; and the Las Vegas businesses and residents, who have generously donated their money, time, and blood to help the victims. To all of these heroes, I say: Thank you. Thank you so much. Over the coming days and weeks, I plan to speak on this floor about each individual victim to honor their life and to tell their story. I will also be speaking out about what Congress needs to do to prevent another tragedy like this from happening. We should never forget the victims of October 1, 2017, but as we embark on the long process of healing, I am forever grateful for the incredible heart and spirit shown by the Las Vegas community. I have never been prouder to be a Las Vegan, and I have never been prouder to be a Nevadan, and I know that my city is and will always be Vegas Strong. f 
COMMANDER SETH ANTHONY STONE WAS A SOLDIER FOR THE LORD The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BABIN) for 5 minutes. Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Commander Seth Anthony Stone, a native Texan, a devout Christian, and a true American hero, who left us far too early on September 30, 2017, at the age of 41 years old. Twice the recipient of the Silver Star Medal, our Nation’s third highest combat award, Seth was among the most highly decorated U.S. Navy SEALS. As a SEAL platoon commander in Iraq during the Battle of Ramadi in 2006, he served alongside my son, Leif Babin, as they led some of the toughest sustained urban combat operations in the history of the SEAL teams. Seth was a storied and an exceptional combat leader that helped turn the tide for America in two of the most pivotal battles of the Iraq war. Seth and his SEAL platoon played an integral role in the victorious efforts of the U.S. Army’s 1st Armored Division’s Ready First Brigade Combat Team that transformed Ramadi from the most violent and dangerous place in Iraq to a stable, secure, and peaceful city. In more than 6 months of continuous urban combat, a number of his SEALs were wounded and killed in action, including MasteratArms Second Class Michael A. Monsoor, when he dove onto a grenade to save three of his SEAL teammates next to him. For his actions, Petty Officer Monsoor was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. Seth returned to Iraq 2 years later and led a SEAL task unit that included American Sniper, Chief Petty Officer Chris Kyle, also from Texas. Seth’s outstanding combat record placed him in a very special class that included Petty Officer Michael Monsoor, Chief Petty Officer Chris Kyle, Petty Officer Marc Lee, and Petty Officer Ryan Job. Seth epitomized the warrior ethos, risking his life on many occasions in combat against our Nation’s mortal enemies. He saved countless U.S. servicemembers, and he helped bring stability to embattled regions of the world. About his military service, Seth said: It was my honor to fight for my country. The best life is one lived as a sacrifice for others. I love my country, and I love the teams. That is what drove me to fight so hard for America while wearing the SEAL Trident. At the same time, I did not really consider myself to be a SEAL but, rather, a soldier for the Lord. 
In everything he did and throughout his life he served the Lord from a place of deep faith. He was a very special person. I was proud to know him, and I will be forever grateful for his service to our great country and the friendship and camaraderie that he had with my son and all those whom he served with. While Seth has left us on Earth, his passion for his friends, his country, and his Lord will certainly live on and never be forgotten. 
FEMA CAN DO BETTER FOR OUR FELLOW AMERICANS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR ) for 5 minutes. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, there was applause from the gallery, and every American applauds. Mr. Speaker, I have an alert for the Trump administration. The Trumpled FEMA, that is the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency, part of the Department of Homeland Security, is falling far short on disaster relief in Puerto Rico. In fact, I think one could say they are actually perilously short on helping the people, our fellow citizens, in Puerto Rico. It has now been 22 days, that is 528 hours, since Hurricane Maria destroyed Puerto Rico. Hundreds of thousands of our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico still—still—have no fresh water, no power, little food, with many villages lacking any means for communication. Many have no dry cots or even dry sleeping bags to replace the wet mattresses and moldy surroundings that characterize the Puerto Rico of today. Let me say that Puerto Rico is not a large island. It is a little over 100 miles wide, not much larger than my congressional district in Ohio which extends from Cleveland to Toledo. The difference with Puerto Rico is the topography is much more hilly. I ask myself the question: Why hasn’t FEMA had airdrops of vital sustenance from the very start? Where is that help to these farflung villages that have been cut off because, when the rains came, they washed out bridges and roads that make all these tiny towns inaccessible? Inaccessible. Fresh water packets can be airdropped. Our military does that all over the world. Why can’t those fresh water packets be dropped in Puerto Rico? We can drop packets with peanut butter and bread. We do that all over the world. Why can’t we do that in Puerto Rico? Why can’t we airdrop food? Citizens in Ohio with families and friends in Puerto Rico about whom they are desperately worried have been told that many smaller towns where they have relationships lack relief and any assistance now 528 hours, 22 days, into this deep human tragedy. I want to place in the RECORD , and I hope somebody at FEMA is listening, names of some of the villages that are completely cut off because roads and bridges were destroyed and no relief has come. No relief has come. Ponce, in the south, is one. Utuado, Jayuya, Arecibo, Yauco, Corozal, Comerio, Loiza, Toa Baja, Cabo Rojo, and Llanadas. Those are names we have been given. Aid to these pockets of desperation is almost 3 weeks overdue. People need relief now. FEMA also needs a better plan. In fact, they need a plan. I don’t think they have any plan to immediately evacuate people to the mainland for respite. Places like Cleveland, Lorain, and Toledo, Ohio, we could accept people who now are living in conditions you would wish on no American. We cannot risk more illness and death. Children should not be missing school after the horror they have experienced. We shouldn’t have the level of hardship that has been subjected to people who are still enduring the devastation of Maria. What is happening there is inhumane. Most of the television stations are down in San Juan, and that is where the Governor of Puerto Rico is most of the time when our codels go down there, but the desperation is in the countryside. It is outside of San Juan, which is inaccessible. President Trump, the people of America and, let me tell you, those in Ohio need you to help their families and countrymen now. FEMA can do so much better for our fellow Americans. FEMA’s initials stand for Federal Emergency Management. So where is the emergency? Where is the management? And where is the Federal reputation for excellence and leaving no man or woman behind? FEMA, shape up. America demands more, and Americans deserve more. ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. MESSER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge President Trump to decertify the disastrous Iran nuclear deal. There are reports that decertification may come as early as tomorrow, and I certainly hope so. The Iran nuclear deal was a giant mistake. It has been bad for America’s national security, bad for our ally Israel’s national security, and bad for the world. By decertifying the flawed Iran nuclear deal before October 15, the administration has a chance to send a strong message that the United States will not sit idly by while the Iranian threat continues to grow. The deal was premised on a naive notion that Iran would somehow evolve into a peaceful global partner, but that couldn’t have been further from the truth. Make no mistake about it: Iran is not our friend, does not share our values, and should not have been trusted. For decades, Iran has called the United States the Great Satan, and their leadership continues to call for the total annihilation of our ally Israel. Iran remains the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the world and is actively working towards obtaining a nuclear bomb. This much is clear: Iran has not upheld the spirit of this deal. Now is the time to reassert our authority on the world stage and hold Iran accountable. I look forward to working with President Trump to keep America, our allies, and the rest of the world safe from Iranian aggression. b1115 HONORING THE DISCOVERY OF HERNANDO DE SOTO’S 1539 ENCAMPMENT AND THE LOST NATIVE AMERICAN TOWN OF POTANO The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida (Mr. YOHO) for 5 minutes. Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the discovery of Hernando de Soto’s 1939 encampment and the lost Native American town of Potano, by the University of Florida professors, Dr. Fred White and Dr. Michele White, and University of Florida honor student Ethan White. This newly discovered archaeological site is the oldest confirmed New World contact site in the United States. In one of the most important events in U.S. history, de Soto was the first European to discover the Mississippi River and explore an area that today would hold 10 States. Until this incredible archaeological discovery, there was no physical evidence of de Soto’s 4,000mile journey. The collection of artifacts recovered near Orange Lake, Florida, includes very rare King Ferdinand coins, Queen Isabella coins, and a King Enrique IV of Castile coin that is the oldest dated European artifact ever unearthed in the United States. Other rare items include Murano glass beads and Spanish weapons and armor dated from the early 1500s. The artifacts were excavated in the lost ancient Native American town of Potano. Also discovered in the town of Potano were the remains of the first location of the San Buenaventura Franciscan mission built there in the 1580s. Within the floors of the 16th century mission, the team discovered the largest cache of medieval coins found in the American mainland so far. Acknowledgment for confirmation and identification of the artifacts goes to a large and diverse group of scholars throughout the country. The recent scientific findings were published in the peerreviewed International Journal of Archaeology and with the Florida Department of State, Division of Historical Resources, Bureau of Archaeological Research in Tallahassee, Florida. The collection of artifacts is at the Florida Museum of Natural History on the campus of my alma mater, the University of Florida. 
Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, additionally, I would like to recognize today is National Farmers Day, a day when we say thanks to all of our farmers and ranchers for the work they do. Our agricultural industry, in a lot of ways, is the backbone of this country. It feeds our Nation and a big portion of the world, and accounts for 11 percent of overall employment. Most people don’t realize how farmers affect their life, but it is important to reflect on the interdependence between rural and urban life. People often associate Florida with tourism, but agriculture is actually 
Florida’s number two industry, utilizing onethird of Florida’s available land. Without agriculture, urban developments—in fact, all developments— could not flourish. There is a simple symbiotic relationship between families and communities, and that is, if you are hungry, you are going to eat. Every time you get hungry you think about your farmer, so thank a farmer today. 
Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, it is fitting on National Farmers Day that I am able to rise and honor a true Florida legend, Mr. Bud Adams of Fort Pierce, Florida, and his contributions to the Florida cattle industry. He is an icon in Florida and the Nation’s cattle industry. Mr. Adams was a pioneer, a wildlife photographer, but more than anything else, he was a true American pioneer and cattle rancher. He was a real American cowboy in Florida, and they are known in Florida as Florida crackers. That name is derived from the sound of a bullwhip when it is used to round up and herd cattle. After a stint in the Navy during World War II, Mr. Adams returned home to work and grow the family ranch. For the past 80 years, you could find Mr. Adams on horseback surveying the land and the cattle that they raised. He was a strong advocate for conservation and was nationally recognized for his leadership in preserving the land for future generations. Even more so, Mr. Adams is known for creating the Braford breed of cattle, which is a cross between the Brahman cattle and the Hereford cattle, a heat tolerant, heavybeefproducing cow, ideal for the Florida climate. Mr. Adams was rightfully proud of this breed and went on to help found the United Braford Breeders Association. Additionally, Mr. Adams was a proud member of the Florida Cattlemen’s Association. He served as the president in 1958, and, for the last 59 years, he was always willing to offer a helping hand to the new Florida Cattlemen’s leadership. Mr. Adams will always be remembered for the impact he had on the Florida cattle industry and his willingness to nurture future generations of Florida cattlemen. He will be greatly missed. 
SUPPORTING THE CARE CORPS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN ) for 5 minutes. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to encourage my colleagues to support the Care Corps Demonstration Act. By the year 2030, there will be more than 72 million older Americans. As they age, many of these seniors will require longterm support and services, placing a significant burden on our elder care system that is already struggling to provide and finance services to our seniors. The Care Corps Demonstration Act, which my colleague Congresswoman MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM and I have introduced, will address this growing need by placing Care Corps volunteers in communities where they will provide essential services to seniors that will allow these older Americans to remain independent. In turn, these wonderful volunteers will receive assistance in paying down their educational expenses. More importantly, Mr. Speaker, this program will help us train a new generation of healthcare providers to meet our Nation’s demand for senior care services by giving our students essential, realworld experience in the field. Mr. Speaker, this bill will create stronger communities across our Nation by bringing generations of Americans together. I encourage my colleagues to support our bill, the Care Corps Demonstration Act, of this session. The bill number, Mr. Speaker, is H.R. 3493. So please contact my congressional office or the office of Congresswoman MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM to cosponsor H.R. 3493. 
NATIONAL FARMERS DAY The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. ABRAHAM ) for 5 minutes. Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize America’s farmers on National Farmers Day. I call our American farmers the thin green line because food security is national security. We can never discount the importance of our Nation’s ability to feed itself, and we can do so only by the hard work of the men and women in the agricultural community. In honor of National Farmers Day, I wanted to recite a poem first delivered by a radio personality, Paul Harvey, to the FFA Convention in 1978. The poem is as follows: 
And on the 8th day, God looked down on his planned paradise and said, ‘‘I need a caretaker,’’ so God made a farmer. God said, ‘‘I need somebody willing to get up before dawn, milk cows, work all day in the fields, milk cows again, eat supper, then go to town and stay past midnight at a meeting of the school board,’’ so God made a farmer. ‘‘I need somebody with arms strong enough to rustle a calf and yet gentle enough to deliver his own grandchild; somebody to call hogs, tame cantankerous machinery, come home hungry, have to wait for lunch until his wife is done feeding visit ladies, then tell the ladies to be sure and come back real soon, and mean it,’’ so God made a farmer. God said, ‘‘I need somebody willing to sit up all night with a newborn colt, and watch it die, and then dry his eyes and say, ‘Maybe next year.’ I need somebody who can shape an ax handle from a persimmon sprout, shoe a horse with a hunk of car tire, who can make a harness out of haywire, feed sacks, and shoe straps; who, planting time comes and harvest season, will finish his 40hour week by Tuesday noon, and then paining from tractor back, put in another 72 hours,’’ so God made a farmer. God had to have somebody willing to ride the ruts at double speed to get the hay in ahead of the rain clouds, and yet stop in midfield and race to help when he sees the first smoke from a neighbor’s place, so God made a farmer. God said, ‘‘I need somebody strong enough to clear trees and heave bales, yet gentle enough to tame lambs and wean pigs and tend to the pinkcombed pullets, who will stop his mower for an hour to splint the broken leg of a meadow lark.’’ It had to be somebody who would plow deep and straight and not cut corners; somebody to seed, weed, feed, breed, and rake and disc and plow and plant and tie the fleece and strain the milk and replenish the self feeder and finish a hard week’s work with a 5mile drive to church; somebody who would bale a family together with the soft strong bonds of sharing, who would laugh, and then sigh, and then reply, with smiling eyes, when his son says that he wants to spend his life ‘‘doing what dad does,’’ so God made a farmer. f RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess until noon today. Accordingly (at 11 o’clock and 25 minutes a.m.), the House stood in recess. 
b1200 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker at noon. 
PRAYER Reverend Joshua Leu, First Christian Church, Great Bend, Kansas, offered the following prayer: God, I ask today that You would open these honorable men and women of the House to the significance, weight, and sacredness of the work that they get to do. Remind them that the detailed decisions that they make here and now will not only have effects on the entire world, but will ripple through time for generations to come, making a way for all people. So gift them, O Lord, with Your wisdom today and every day they serve so they can be a part of causing Your kingdom to come, Your will to be done, on Earth as it is in Heaven. Amen. 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER. Will the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Ms. GABBARD ) 
come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Ms. GABBARD led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
WELCOMING REVEREND JOSHUA LEU The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. MARSHALL ) is recognized for 1 minute. There was no objection. Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to salute and say thanks during Pastor Appreciation Month. This one is particularly special, as one of my own church’s pastors gave the opening prayer to this body just moments ago. From baptisms to weddings to funerals, pastors give us encouragement to meet the demands of life. They give spiritual balance to a material world and are spiritual leaders for a nation deemed ‘‘one Nation under God.’’ I thank my current pastor, Pastor Josh Leu; his wife, Ashley; his lovely daughters, Karys and Khora. I also want to thank my pastor of 20 years, Pastor Bill Johnson, and his wife, Lois. Thanks for all you have done for us, for my family, for my community, and for my church. Like Pastor Bill always used to say: Have a good day, if you want to. Mr. Speaker, let’s all reach out to pastors and their families to tell them thanks for all they do for us. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, the Iran nuclear deal is far from perfect. There are outstanding issues, like ballistic missiles, that are and should be addressed outside the nuclear agreement. Ultimately, the goal of this deal was to prevent Iran from attaining a nuclear weapon and averting allout war. This is exactly what it has done. Now, President Trump is threatening to pull out from the deal and break our commitments to Iran and our allies, with no evidence to prove that Iran has not complied. In fact, the IAEA and our U.S. military and intelligence sources unanimously agree that Iran has remained compliant to the agreement. Walking away from the Iran nuclear agreement that, so far, is working will likely cause Iran to restart its nuclear weapons program, eliminate the possibility of diplomatic negotiations to denuclearize North Korea, kick off a nuclear arms race, and greatly increase the chances of nuclear war. If President Trump breaks our commitment to the Iran deal, the American people have everything to lose and nothing to gain. For the peace and security of the American people, we must uphold our commitment to this nuclear deal. 
RECOGNIZING ALABAMA STATE REPRESENTATIVE JAMES BUSKEY (Mr. BYRNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Alabama State Representative James Buskey. Representative Buskey recently announced that he will be retiring from the Alabama House of Representatives after 42 years of representing people in Mobile, Alabama. He was first elected to the House in 1976, making him one of the longest serving legislators in Alabama history. Outside of the legislature, Representative Buskey spent much of his life working in public education, including as a school administrator at E.S. Chastang Middle School in Mobile. While we have had our share of political differences, I have always appreciated his institutional knowledge and respected his passion for our local community. I am honored to call James a friend and appreciate his decades of service to the people of Mobile and Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I wish James and his wife, Vergie, all the best upon his retirement and the years ahead. f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF HANNAH AHLERS (Mr. RUIZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, on October 1, 2017, a gunman opened fire on thousands of innocent people at a music festival in Las Vegas. As our families mourn, I want to honor the life of Hannah Ahlers, a wife, mother, daughter, sister, friend to many, and beloved by her community, whose life was taken too soon. Her brother recently told me: ‘‘She was loved by everyone that met her . . . she was our sunshine.’’ Her beautiful personality was felt by all, from her family and friends, to the mothers she worked with in her children’s schools, to the volleyball team she volunteered with. As her husband shared: ‘‘She wasn’t too good for anybody; beautiful inside and out.’’ At 34, her dedication to family and community is felt in her home in the city of Beaumont and across the Inland Empire. On behalf of my wife, Monica, and the entire 36th Congressional District, we join together as a community to mourn her heartbreaking loss and celebrate her life. To Hannah’s husband, Brian; her children, Briannah, Brice, and Hailey, our thoughts and prayers are with you. We commit to take up Hannah’s mantle of dedication by serving our own communities. Her love and devotion will never be forgotten. 
NATIONAL FARMERS DAY (Ms. STEFANIK asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, when you eat today, you can thank a farmer. Across this great Nation, over 3 million farmers work tirelessly each day to produce the food that feeds our families and keeps our country running. From GraceWay Dairy Farm in Lowville to Everett Orchards in Peru, I have been blessed to meet with so many farmers that make up the backbone of our north country economy. Many of these family farms in my district produce dairy, apples, honey, wine, and the most delicious maple in the country. As Congress works on the next farm bill, we need to focus on supporting those who support our Nation’s food supply. 
Mr. Speaker, today, on National Farmers Day, I urge my colleagues to join me in thanking the men and women who rise before the sun each and every day to make sure our families are fed. 
HELPING FLOOD VICTIMS IN NEED (Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise to urge Congress to help the neediest and most vulnerable flood victims from our Nation’s recent hurricanes. Our district in Houston and Harris County, Texas, is familiar with hurricanes and disaster recovery. We rebuilt our communities after Allison in 2001, and again in 2008, after Hurricane Ike. Texans are proud and independent people. We take pride in our selfreliance and cando attitude. However, many members of our community— lowincome families, seniors, and disabled Americans—are in the greatest need and must rely on others for help. Current rules can prevent the neediest victims from receiving assistance they need to recover and rebuild their homes, including denying individuals Federal assistance for being able to afford flood insurance premiums that can exceed over $4,000 a year. That is out of range for most of these folks. As America’s elected representatives, we have a moral responsibility to act and protect our Nation’s most vulnerable disaster victims, especially our seniors and disabled, from being left with nothing. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF JAMES B. BRIEN, JR. (Mr. COMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember Mr. Jim Brien of Mayfield in Kentucky’s First Congressional District, who passed away on Friday, October 6. Jim’s decades of service established him as a titan within the western Kentucky legal community. Having served as assistant prosecutor for Mayfield, an assistant Commonwealth attorney, and as a partner at the Law Offices of Neely, Brien, Wilson, and Toombs, he developed an unparalleled legal knowledge and community network which he utilized to defend his fellow citizens and work tirelessly on their behalf. He was widely respected for his selfless service to his family and community, as evidenced by his leadership in community organizations and his membership at the First Baptist Church in Mayfield. For all who knew him, he was a dedicated public servant and a staunch advocate for Graves County, whose passion for bettering the community was rivaled only by his love for University of Kentucky football and basketball. May God continue to bless his sons, James B. Brien III and Joshua V. Brien, and his family and friends, through which his legacy lives on. f 
NATIONAL FARMERS DAY (Mr. ARRINGTON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent the people of west Texas, home to 14 million acres of farmland, making it one of the largest agriculture production regions in the world. I have spent a lot of time with these plowboys and cowboys over the years, and I can tell you this: these men and women don’t work our land and our cattle for the money, and they certainly don’t do it for recognition. But today is National Farmers Day. Let’s pause and pay tribute to the American farmer. Farming was man’s first profession. Farming saved and sustained our first colony at Jamestown. Farming helped fund the Revolution, securing the very freedoms we have and cherish today. Farming has allowed us to feed and clothe our own people, and that food and fiber independence has contributed to America being the most powerful, most prosperous, and most generous Nation in the history of the world. God bless our farmers. 
BEWARE OF POLLS (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, a recent Washington Post/ABC News poll professed to find that a majority of Americans supported amnesty for illegal immigrants. That is not hard to do, given how the survey was conducted. The polsters asked to speak only with the youngest adult at home; over sampled Democrats by at least 4 percent; used the word ‘‘undocumented’’ rather than ‘‘illegal;’’ questioned illegal immigrants, at least 3 percent of the population; and conditioned amnesty on requirements that can’t be met. Other than that, I am sure it was an accurate poll. Beware of polls done by liberal media organizations that have an agenda of their own. The American people may not be getting the facts. They deserve better. 
ADDRESSING OUR COUNTRY’S NATURAL DISASTERS (Mr. DENHAM asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the lives of the victims of the California wildfires. We have seen some devastating fires throughout California, specifically huge fires in northern California, that have already burned over 142,000 acres. It is one of the deadliest weeks in California wildfire history, already seeing 23 lives perish in those fires. Today, we will see disaster relief funding here on the floor. It is important that, while we have already passed one funding bill, we pass another to address all natural emergencies across the entire country. We must also have funding available for Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria in devastated areas like Puerto Rico, Texas, and Florida. We have had big challenges in this country, and it is time to make sure that we pass a second relief funding bill that will address many of those concerns in the disasters that we have seen across the country. Shortly hereafter, we are going to see another funding bill come forward that will address some reforms. While some of our States have building codes and are addressing the impacts so that we don’t see this devastation in the future, we need to make sure that these reforms are passed in the coming bill as well. We have three major bills. We will pass one today. Another one is soon to follow. We have to address the country’s national emergencies. f 
b1215 HONORING STAFF SERGEANT RYAN MCCARTHY AND STAFF SERGEANT CHAD HICKEY (Mrs. HARTZLER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor two valued members of Missouri’s defense community, Staff Sergeant Ryan McCarthy and Staff Sergeant Chad Hickey. They are both stationed out of Fort Leonard Wood in Missouri’s Fourth District, and these soldiers are exceptional representatives of their base, their State, and their service branch—the United States Army. Both men recently received top honors at the Association of the United States Army’s Annual Meeting and Exposition, where they were recognized for their leadership, excellence, and achievements. Staff Sergeant McCarthy, who is right here, was named the Noncommissioned Officer of the Year by AUSA. A combat engineer with more than 9 years of service, McCarthy has served multiple deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan. His dedication and leadership represent the best ideals of our Army and America’s fighting forces. Another Fort Leonard Wood soldier, Staff Sergeant Chad Hickey, pictured here, was named Drill Sergeant of the Year. Hickey received the honor after winning a grueling fitness, endurance, and combatreadiness competition 
against the Nation’s top drill sergeants. The fact that Staff Sergeant McCarthy and Staff Sergeant Hickey are both from Fort Leonard Wood is no surprise. The men and women stationed there serve with strength, seriousness, and purpose, setting an example of military leadership for the entire Army. To Staff Sergeants McCarthy and Hickey, and to all of the soldiers stationed at Fort Leonard Wood, I wish to extend to each and every one of you and your families our gratitude and congratulations. 
CONGRESSIONAL APP CHALLENGE (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, technology connects the world in ways like never before. From everyday conveniences at our fingertips to improved communications, technology plays an everincreasing role in our lives. We are becoming more dependent on applications, or apps, and the students of today will become the leaders of tomorrow by developing such technology. That is why my office is proud again to participate in the Congressional App Challenge. This competition allows K–12 students from across the country to practice their codewriting skills by developing an app. Winning apps will be displayed in the Capitol Building later this year. The 2015 winner from my office, Lachlan Campbell, created an app to store recipes and discover new dishes. I am proud that this State College student was able to show off his talents in our Nation’s Capitol. Mr. Speaker, it is my hope that students from across Pennsylvania’s Fifth Congressional District will put their skills to work, create an app, and submit it to the Congressional App Challenge. Submissions will close on November 1, and I can’t wait to see what our students create. 
RECOGNITION OF BIOENERGY DAY (Mr. WESTERMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Bioenergy Day, a day we celebrate natural renewable energy in America. On October 18, organizations across America will mark this special day by opening their doors to the public and highlighting how bioenergy is fueling America. Forest byproducts are a primary source of bioenergy, making my home State of Arkansas a leading producer in this field. Across the country, bioenergy keeps the lights on and so much more. Bioenergy produces just under 6 percent of the Nation’s total energy supply and provides fulltime jobs for tens of thousands of Americans, with more plants coming online in the near future. We need to do more research to find economical ways to harness renewable energy in our abundant biomass that we all too often continue to see going up in flames and wildfires. As we approach October 18, I encourage all Americans to learn more about bioenergy, forest byproducts, and the environmental benefits derived from our natural resources. f 
CREATING A TURNING POINT FROM A TRAGEDY (Mr. GALLAGHER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise as a cosponsor of the Dr. Chris Kirkpatrick Whistleblower Protection Act the House will be voting on later today. Dr. Kirkpatrick was a promising young clinical psychologist assigned to the Tomah VA in Wisconsin. Committed to finding innovative treatments for PTSD, he expressed alarm that patients of the VA were being overmedicated, preventing him from providing the treatment they so desperately needed. Rather than listen to his concerns, the VA retaliated against him and, ultimately, Chris was fired; and that very day, he took his own life. The VA investigation later found that Chris’ concerns about overmedication were entirely founded. Chris’ story is a tragedy, but can also serve as a turning point. Just as our veterans have earned worldclass care, their allies such as Chris deserve full protection should they bravely decide to document VA wrongdoing or abuse. By increasing these protections today, we are honoring Chris’ memory, serving as a fitting memorial to a life that was tragically cut short.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN ) and the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. LOWEY ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey. GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material in consideration of H. Res. 569. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New Jersey? There was no objection. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to present H. Res. 569, making additional supplemental appropriations for disaster relief requirements for the current fiscal year to help respond to recent devastating natural disasters. Over the past 2 months, millions of Americans have had their lives forever altered by destructive hurricanes in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, and by raging and deadly wildfires in the West. We all support those who are victimized, particularly those who lost their lives or lost loved ones, and we will continue to be with them every step of the way with the Federal support they need as they recover and rebuild. Our thanks go to the first responders, volunteers, and States who saved countless lives, protected communities, and demonstrated the best of humanity; that includes FEMA, the Army Corps of Engineers, the Department of Defense, the Coast Guard, and many other Federal agencies for getting the first installment of relief to those in need. However, with such massive, unprecedented damage, more help is clearly needed to continue to respond to these recovery efforts, to rebuild communities with dollars, with resources, with manpower, and with our support. This emergency funding legislation, the second installment, addresses urgent shortterm immediate priorities: replenishing FEMA’s Disaster Relief Fund, supporting ongoing Federal wildfire suppression efforts, providing debt relief for the Federal Flood Insurance Program, and other assistance that will help our fellow Americans in their time of greatest need. To summarize the $36.5 billion in emergency funding provided in this bill, in total, $18.7 billion is provided for the Disaster Relief Fund. This includes $13.77 billion for the most immediate response needs: lifesaving missions, emergency protection, the repair and restoration of public infrastructure like communications, power, transportation, and, yes, shelter, and financial assistance to individuals and families affected as they rebuild their lives. This package also includes $4.9 billion for community disaster loans, which will ensure local governments are able to provide basic municipal services such as police and fire protection and public education throughout this trying time. 
In addition to the Disaster Relief Fund, this bill provides a onetime payment of $1.27 billion to allow Puerto Rico and our fellow citizens to receive the same access to emergency disaster and nutrition program benefits that other States receive. The bill also ensures that the National Flood Insurance Program is able to meet its existing claim obligations as Americans cope with the tremendous flood damage to their homes and communities. For wildlife suppression, the bill contains $576.5 million. As we have seen, the situation out West has grown even more desperate and deadly. We must ensure that those heroic firefighters can continue to save lives and protect property. As we know, the needs of each disaster area are ever changing. Consequently, our Appropriations Committee and all of our Members continue to monitor the progress of recovery efforts as well as anticipate emerging needs. This will be a long process, Mr. Speaker, and the second package or installment of the Federal support will certainly not be all that is needed over the long term. Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this bill. It is important for the Nation, for the communities affected, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes. Mr. Speaker, since Hurricane Harvey wrought historic flooding in Texas, 12 major disasters have been declared. From a hurricane that damaged large swaths of Florida, storms that annihilated Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, and wildfires burning in the West, Americans deserve certainty the Federal Government will stand by them in their time of need. This is particularly important after the President threatened to abandon Puerto Rico in his latest Twitter this morning. Congress cannot turn its back on recovery, no matter how reckless the President’s outburst may be, as Americans are suffering and simply trying to survive. This package provides critical disaster relief, flood insurance aid, and help for communities devastated by wildfires. Puerto Rico would be aided by provisions to address its liquidity crisis by facilitating recovery, not paying creditors, and providing additional nutrition assistance. Additionally, the bill would continue aid to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands from the Department of Defense. However, more must be done to provide medium and longterm investments, including rebuilding ports, coastlines, airports, roads, bridges, repairing the electrical grid and other infrastructure, and ensuring the health needs of American citizens are met. I urge your support for this bill and your continued focus on ensuring the full recovery of American communities devastated by natural disasters. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. SERRANO ), the distinguished ranking member of the Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations Subcommittee. (Mr. SERRANO asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding. This bill is a first step in helping Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands recover from the devastation of Hurricane Maria. It will provide FEMA and the governments of the islands with the funds needed to address immediate relief needs and begin the recovery process. I do want to thank the chairman and ranking member for their commitment to this issue and for taking my phone calls at all different times, on weekends. You have been very helpful and very supportive. b1230 Both will be visiting the island tomorrow and will be able to see firsthand the dramatic and comprehensive needs that Puerto Rico is facing. Right now, 85 percent of the island still lacks electricity more than 3 weeks after the hurricane hit. One third of the island doesn’t have access to clean drinking water. Most of the island still lacks cellular service, hampering the vital information to deliver assistance in the areas that are needed. Federal employees on the island now are doing important and vital work, but we need more boots on the ground. This funding provides them with the resources needed to do that in the short term. But to succeed, there needs to be a commitment from the highest levels of government to ensure the recovery of all areas that are part of our Nation, including its territories. Unfortunately, given the President’s latest Twitter rant this morning, it seems unlikely that we have that focus and commitment. So it is up to us in Congress to make sure that the Federal Government doesn’t forget about Puerto Rico, and that is what I intend to do in the days and months ahead. But to both of you and to our membership here, thank you for not forgetting Puerto Rico. This is an ongoing battle and an ongoing issue. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. CALVERT ), the chairman of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee on Appropriations. Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the supplemental appropriations bill. I want to commend Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN and the committee staff for their quick and thorough work to put this supplemental package together, and I thank the leadership for its swift action in scheduling this for House consideration. In fiscal year 2017, the Forest Service had a shortfall of nearly $577 million in firefighting funds. To cover its immediate firefighting costs, the Forest Service borrowed from its nonfire programs, as well as the Department of the Interior. The bill will replace and repay those borrowed funds and close the books on fiscal year 2017. Specifically, it provides $526 million for the Forest Service and $50 million for the Department of the Interior. The cost of fighting fires on our national forests and other public lands has increased dramatically over the last 15 years, yet these fires and costs remain highly unpredictable. Right now the West is on fire. In my home State of California, firefighters are battling 22 large wildfires that have burned nearly 170,000 acres. The bill gives the government the tools it needs to assist local officials to get those fires under control as soon as possible. We, the Congress, need to fix the way we budget for wildland fire so that the Forest Service and the Department of the Interior can focus on managing our Federal lands appropriately. We also need to give them the necessary legal authorities and tools to improve the condition and management of our national forests. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. ROYBAL  ALLARD ), the ranking member of the Homeland Security Subcommittee. Ms. ROYBALALLARD. Mr. Speaker, the past few months have witnessed one of the most devastating natural disasters ever endured by our country. They include hurricanes, voracious wildfires in my home State of California that have killed at least 23 people, required mass evacuations, and burned more than 170,000 acres and thousands of homes and businesses. By acting quickly on this emergency supplemental, we are sending a strong message that we are here for disaster victims, including our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. But this is just a downpayment. We still don’t have the final damage estimates for many of the affected areas. In the coming weeks and months, we will need to once again support FEMA’s continued recovery efforts, including in Puerto Rico, despite the President’s threats to abandon the people there. There will be more to do to address unmet needs through the Community Development Block Grant program and other disaster relief programs. Mr. Speaker, I encourage support for this bill. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. MCCOLLUM), the ranking member of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee. (Ms. MCCOLLUM asked and was given permission to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this funding package. This bill is a downpayment on the recovery from the recent fires and hurricanes. I am pleased that it contains $576.5 million to fully repay the funds that the U.S. Forest Service borrowed last fiscal year to pay for wildfire suppression. We have all seen the devastation and the tragic loss of life from large fires burning across our country. Fiscal year 2017 was the most expensive year on record for wildfire suppression, costing $2.4 billion. As the duration and severity of wildfires grows, costs will continue to rise. Unfortunately, once again we have missed the opportunity to fix the way the Federal Government funds wildfire suppression. Let me be clear: the next supplemental must include a legislative fix for wildfire spending, and it must adequately support the Department of the Interior and its vital efforts to help our country rebuild from the recent fires and hurricanes. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 6 minutes to the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico (Miss GONZA´LEZCOLO´N), whose leadership in this time of crisis we all salute. Miss GONZA´LEZCOLO´N of Puerto Rico. Mr. Speaker, first, I thank the Speaker of the House and the whole leadership, Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN , and all of the members from the Appropriations Committee for allowing the Federal Government to help Puerto Rico in this dire situation. On behalf of the 3.4 million American citizens that live in Puerto Rico and the nearly 5.5 million Puerto Ricans that live on the mainland, I rise today in strong support of this disaster supplemental appropriations bill. They have been focused on Puerto Rico since before the arrival of Hurricane Irma, and then during Hurricane Maria. I also thank all of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle who have reached out during these past 3 weeks to express their encouragement and offer their assistance during this process. For that, my constituents and I will always be grateful to all of the Members of this House. As you may know by now, Puerto Rico was hit by two major hurricanes. First, Hurricane Irma, which caused significant damage on the eastern part of the island. That was on September 6. Then, on September 20, a few days later, we got hit by Hurricane Maria, which caused unprecedented destruction throughout the whole island and which many people consider that hurricane to be the most catastrophic natural disaster ever on U.S. soil. Today, 22 days after the storm hit, nearly 85 percent of our population remains without power, 44 percent without running water, and almost 58 percent without access to telecommunications. To this date, we still have towns like Las Marias, Maricao, Utuado, and many others in the central part of the island, that remain uncommunicated and can only be accessed by air since most of the roads and bridges were washed away. We are talking about more than 18 major roads and bridges that were just washed away. The death toll has reached 48 fatalities, and, unfortunately, certainly that number is going to increase in the coming days and weeks. This unprecedented humanitarian crisis in our own Nation has begun what is likely to evolve into a mass exodus of Puerto Ricans to the U.S. mainland, further jeopardizing the island’s longterm recovery. Mr. Speaker, I stand here today telling you that the American citizens that live in Puerto Rico still are suffering in different ways. This is not the time to focus on how and when resources will be withdrawn from Puerto Rico, or how slowly we are going to rebuild the island. Today, 85 percent of our island is without electricity, yet 3.4 million American citizens living there just got less than 15,000 people working to recover the power grid. I just want to remind you that Florida got more than 61,000 people helping to recover their power grid in just 4 days. That is not acceptable in our case, and we are still American citizens. I know a lot of problems persist. It is too difficult to address the issue when you are not part of the mainland, you are not part of the power grid. It is different when you get access and resources to Texas, Louisiana, or Florida, because you can drive or you can have helicopters. In our case, everything is by ship or air. That means it is more difficult for the Federal Government to assist directly. That is the reason we got more than 15,000 personnel from the Coast Guard, National Guard, Army Corps of Engineers, FEMA, Navy, and the assistance of all national guards—Virginia, Florida, and New York, just to name a few. The Puerto Rican communities in the States and on the island are showing the way, along with private companies, NGOs, and countless volunteers throughout the whole Nation. But there is still a lot that needs to be done as we begin the reconstruction. That is the reason this supplemental is so important for us. Allowing the people of Puerto Rico to access problems that we never have before, like SNAP, which will provide $1.3 billion to receive the same emergency disaster and nutrition assistance benefits as the States, this is the first time this Congress has allowed this to happen to Puerto Rico. I thank the Members and leadership of the House for allowing this money. This is the bill that provides for $18.7 billion to FEMA to have the disaster relief fund to help in lifesaving missions across the island for emergency protection and removal of debris—we continue to have a lot of debris on the island—and the repair and restoration of our infrastructure. That is going to be a matter of discussion on another day because we can’t rebuild or redo the infrastructure we did before from the fifties or the sixties. We need to redo a lot of things on our power grid. It will provide also—and this is a very important area—$7.4 billion to have liquidity to the local government of Puerto Rico just to match Federal funds that are needed to these recovery actions. This is the second step this House has taken in terms of helping the people of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, people that are American citizens. This is the second step. The first one was the first supplemental that was approved. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentlewoman. Miss GONZA´LEZCOLO´N of Puerto Rico. So this is the second step. This is not going to be the last one. We are going to need a lot more help in the coming months, and I know we can count on this House and on this Congress to make that happen. The people of Puerto Rico are grateful, they are resilient, and they are going to continue to show us the way to recover. It is going to take a lot of time, a lot of resources, a lot of money, and a lot of commitment as U.S. citizens, like we are. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 11⁄2minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ ), the ranking member of the Military Construction, Veteran Affairs, and Related Agencies Subcommittee. Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, let me just start by saying to the people of Puerto Rico: Despite President Trump’s indifference and soft bigotry, we will be there for the people of Puerto Rico until the last American’s life returns to normal. While I rise to support this critical emergency appropriations bill, this supplemental leaves much to be desired. This legislation provides vital recovery funds to my home State of Florida, as well as Texas; the U.S. Virgin Islands; Puerto Rico; and California, where wildfires remain ablaze. However, it neglects to include SBA loans for small businesses and homeowners, as well as making smart investments in our ports, coastlines, water systems, and electrical grids. This bill also neglects to address the devastating agricultural losses, especially to Florida’s $10 billion citrus industry. It is also important to note that, in Florida, this vital funding will not be able to address the public health hazard of debris strewn across our 
lawns and streets as Governor Scott shamefully refuses to allow our cities to fully access FEMA funds. While the majority has said these and other issues can be part of future omnibus negotiations, this delay will leave constituents waiting months longer to receive the services they so desperately need. They should not have to wait. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. b1245 Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ ), the ranking member of the Small Business Committee. Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank both the gentleman from New Jersey, the chairman, and the ranking member from New York for their work. Mr. Speaker, the people of Puerto Rico, 3.5 million of our fellow citizens, are suffering. The mayor of my home town, Yabucoa, where Maria made landfall, is predicting that as many as 5,000 residents are potentially facing starvation. More than 85 percent of the island is without electricity. Onethird of Puerto Ricans lack access to drinkable water, which will surge the number of bacterial infections and mosquito borne illnesses. As Puerto Rico faces this humanitarian crisis, the President of the United States is tweeting out threats to withdraw assistance. That is an outrage. It is an insult. It is an abdication of the President’s solemn duty to protect the safety and security of the American people. American citizens everywhere deserve better. Where the President is failing to lead, Congress must act, and act now. The legislation we are debating today is far from sufficient. It is not enough, but it is a start. It is a downpayment in helping the response process. It will keep FEMA operating, removing debris and distributing food and water. It also helps Puerto Rico’s Government address a looming cash shortfall. With the government running out of money by November 1, vital services could be suspended when residents can least afford it. This bill would provide a shortterm cash infusion for the government to keep going. The way this assistance is structured under the law, these funds will likely not be paid back, which is reasonable, given the challenges Puerto Rico faces. Some of those challenges have been created by the lack of action of the Congress when it comes to Medicaid. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30 seconds. Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, let’s be clear. There is going to need to be much more assistance in the future. Puerto Rico will need help rebuilding its energy grid, repairing telecommunications networks, and putting its ports, bridges, and roads back together, and we cannot forget shoring up the island’s Medicaid system, something that was critical before Maria, but is even more important now. This problem is of Congress’ making, and we must fix it. Make no mistake. Those priorities will require more money, and we will need to come back and address them in a few weeks. The people of Puerto Rico are American citizens. And, you know, what? Even when so many of my brothers and sisters are suffering in Puerto Rico, are facing a humanitarian crisis, at last, 50 percent of the people in this country who didn’t know that Puerto Ricans are American citizens are learning that fact. Yes, American citizens, when, in 1898, Puerto Rico was invaded and taken over by the U.S. Government. So now it is our responsibility to make Puerto Rico whole. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are once again reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DIAZBALART ), chairman of the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee on Appropriations. Mr. DIAZBALART. Mr. Speaker, I want to start by first recognizing one of our own, who has been a superb representative for Puerto Rico in these very difficult times. You rarely see somebody with the talent, the energy of the representative of Puerto Rico here in Congress. Miss GONZA´LEZCOLO´N has been, frankly, a hero, and I just wanted to mention that, because she has really made all of us understand the situation, and she has done so with great dignity and great passion and great brilliance. I just had to say that. Mr. Speaker, let me first thank the chairman for being incredibly accessible and engaged. Florida has gotten hit rather hard, as you know. This bill totals $36.5 billion. $18.67 billion of that goes directly to FEMA’s Disaster Relief Fund, and it also ensures that our National Flood Insurance Program has the resources that it needs to pay the claims, also an important grant food and aid loan eligibility to Puerto Rico, which is crucial. So far, Mr. Speaker, Florida has received $740 million for assistance for individuals through FEMA, and is working through over 608,000 applicants. Think about that. As we continue to recover, again, I look forward to continue working with the chairman, who has been phenomenal. Specifically, we are going to have to deal with the agricultural impact of this storm, and again, particularly on the citrus industry, that has been devastated by this storm. This is an important bill. It is an important bill. I want to thank the chairman for bringing it up so quickly. We must pass it. I look forward to working with Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN and with all our colleagues through this process, because we are going to need more assistance as the days and the months go. So this is an important bill. I urge your support. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER ), the Democratic whip. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and I rise in support of this legislation. Mr. Speaker, millions of our fellow Americans in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands are looking to Congress and the administration to work together to provide aid and assistance in recovery and rebuilding. I disagree with the President of the United States that we are going to leave Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands or any other American precipitously before we have done the job we need to do. The recent hurricanes have left 3.6 million Americans in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands still without power, fuel, clean water, food, electricity, and access to medical facilities. That is unacceptable, I say to the administration. We are witnessing a humanitarian disaster of historic proportions, and it will get worse if we do not come together as a nation and bring to bear the full force of the Federal Government to assist. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for bringing this bill to the floor to effect that end. That is why I have called on President Trump to muster every Federal resource, to muster and ensure that aid and supplies can reach those who need them, and to work on restoring power, water, and communications. Because many are still out of reach, we do not yet know the full extent of the damage and loss of life. Today’s Washington Post has a front page story chronicling the tragedy that continues as of now to unfold in Puerto Rico, where nightfall brings complete darkness, and diseases are spreading by way of contaminated water. The island has been plunged into the 19th century. The Virgin Islands shares that status. This supplemental must be followed in the weeks and months ahead by additional measures to provide disaster relief funding and financial assistance to bring the infrastructure of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands up to 21st century standards in order to prevent a repeat of what has occurred. According to a letter sent to the congressional leadership on October 7, by the governor of Puerto Rico, Ricardo Rossello´, the damage of that island is 
estimated to cost as much as $95 billion, which is 150 percent of Puerto Rico’s gross national product. This funding package is an important step, though it fails to provide urgently needed Medicaid funding to help the 1.6 million in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands who rely on Medicaid for their healthcare. Congress must do its part and ensure that the resources are available, but it is up to the administration to make certain that the resources we provide get to those who need them. So I ask my colleagues to join me in passing this bill, and I call on the President again to take every necessary measure to address this humanitarian crisis affecting our fellow Americans. Mr. President, do not send a message to any American that we will turn our backs on them. That is not fair, it is not right, and you ought to correct the statement you made this morning. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to address their remarks to the Chair. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, Puerto Rico has no power. The U.S. Virgin Islands has no power. St. Johns is completely collapsed in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The people are dying from contaminated water. Mr. President, how can you abandon the American people? This bill is going to provide FEMA assistance to keep giving so they can have it. It is going to give $16 billion to the senior citizens in my district, who have paid their flood insurance, who are desperate to get their houses repaired, to get the mold out after being impacted by Hurricane Harvey. Yes, I woke up this morning to the outrage of the fires and people dying in California. That is what is in this bill. I can’t imagine that a President would make this comment of walking away, but I am here to fight for those who have been impacted by Hurricane Harvey. We are still suffering. Senior citizens are out of their homes. We have been evicting people in public housing. We need community development block grants. The Army Corps of Engineers is greatly needed. The funding that we ask for is not in here, block grants is not in here, and as well the restoration that we need. We will fight. I will not turn my back on Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands and vote ‘‘no’’. I will vote ‘‘yes’’—— The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman is out of order. Ms. JACKSON LEE. And help Americans, but Hurricane Harvey has to be in the next bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman is no longer recognized. Ms. JACKSON LEE. * * * The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to heed the gavel. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Ms. PLASKETT ), who I believe just returned. Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN and Ranking Member LOWEY for bringing more disaster relief legislation to the floor today. I am pleased to see muchneeded support for ongoing disaster response efforts in the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and other hurricaneaffected areas, including direct assistance to families, debris removal operations, and emergency protective measures carried out by FEMA, and additional activities of numerous other Federal agencies that are on the ground working around the clock to help us to recover and rebuild. I cannot thank enough all of our Federal and local personnel helping us through this. I have been on the ground after Irma, after Maria, and just recently, and I tell you, their support is invaluable. I am particularly pleased to see the subdivision of $5 billion for Disaster Direct Loan Program to assist local governments and with measures taking into account the unique aid and flexibility needed for the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. Multiple loans will be available based on different types of losses and unanticipated spending needs, and waivers of amount limits are also helpful. Additional loans to pay for local matching requirements is an important support. However, I am deeply concerned about the important relief that was left out of this bill and the administration’s disaster relief request last week. This does not incorporate the medium and longterm assistance that played a clear critical role in the recovery following previous disasters like Katrina and Sandy, and the Virgin Islands cannot afford to wait for this to be a higher priority of the Federal Government. The package does not include community development and social service block grant funding, Economic Development Administration funds, supplemental housing assistance, nor additional funds for repair of our water infrastructure, ports, community facilities, airports, roads, parks, wetlands, and fisheries. Damage sustained in all of these areas has been catastrophic, and waiting around until another end of the year for auxiliary funding for these pressing needs is not acceptable. Perhaps most concerning is the lack of Medicaid program assistance to the territory. Even before two consecutive Category 5 hurricanes that decimated our hospitals and medical infrastructure, the Virgin Islands was forced to operate a Medicaid program that is capped in an amount that has no relationship to local needs, and our rate of Federal matching funds, our FMAP, is limited to an arbitrarily low 55 percent Federal to 45 percent local contribution. b1300 Thousands of our citizens go without adequate care due to this treatment every year, in addition to the impacts on our providers and hospitals due to uncompensated care, but after these backtoback storms, there is no revenue being generated in the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico at this time. Our tourismrelated economy is gone. We will miss this entire year, at the very least. With our public health and social welfare needs, we are in dire need of supplemental Medicaid support, including a temporary 100 percent Federal contribution, just like what was provided to Americans living in Louisiana and Texas following Katrina. I was pleased to see Ranking Member PALLONE ’s proposal to provide this 100 percent temporary Federal share with a substantial plusup to our allotment so that the American citizens—yes, American citizens—in the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico can have the benefit of Medicaid in this time of greatest need. This has not been a part of this package. Virgin Islanders cannot wait until Christmas for a Medicaid program. We need it now. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. MAXINE WATERS ), the ranking member of the Committee on Financial Services. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, in the wake of the destruction that this historic hurricane season has wrought on Texas, Florida, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Gulf Coast, I am very pleased that, in addition to the emergency relief funds for wildfires that are burning on both ends of California, the bill also includes liquidity and emergency nutritional assistance for Puerto Rico, where they are facing particularly difficult challenges in their recovery efforts. This bill also provides for partial debt forgiveness of $16 billion for the National Flood Insurance Program. I am encouraged to see that the administration finally understands what we have been saying for a long time: we need to forgive the debt of the NFIP, which FEMA has repeatedly stated it will never be able to repay. Following the losses that will be incurred as a result of the recent hurricanes, the NFIP needs debt forgiveness more than ever. But let’s be clear. The partial debt forgiveness will leave the NFIP with a crushing level of debt. Although this is a step in the right direction, we should forgive all of the debt that the NFIP has accrued from catastrophic storms like Katrina and Sandy instead of burdening the NFIP policyholders with hundreds of millions of dollars in interest payments every year. 
Before this hurricane season, NFIP policyholders were already paying more in interest than the entire NFIP spends on salaries and expenses or funding mitigation or paying for flood maps. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. LEE), a senior member of the Appropriations Committee. Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank our ranking member for yielding time to me and for her tireless leadership. Mr. Speaker, as a Representative from northern California, let me just say that my thoughts and prayers are with our neighbors in the North Bay. I remember the Oakland Hills. I represent Oakland and Berkeley, California; and just as many helped us then, we will help our neighbors now. I am deeply grateful to our firefighters and our first responders who have been working around the clock to extinguish these fires. Mr. Speaker, I also rise in strong support of this emergency supplemental. Our neighbors in the North Bay, the Gulf Coast, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Texas, they need our help, and they need it now. Communities are devastated, and many are still without power and water. This is a lifeand death situation for so many. Make no mistake, the recovery process is just beginning, and we cannot forget our Caribbean neighbors who are also suffering. Mr. Speaker, the supplemental is a good first step. It is a good first step in a very long process, but we must provide more longterm assistance to help communities rebuild and to help them recover very quickly, and we must leave no one behind. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be here with my partner, our chairman, Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN . I know that he understands, as we all do, this is not a Republican or Democratic issue. This is our responsibility, to face the tremendous challenge that we see: people are suffering, schools are closed, more than threequarters of the island does not have any energy, no clean water, need for food, need for basic services. I am very pleased to work with the chairman of the committee, Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN , and I know that we will both be going to the island of Puerto Rico to actually see firsthand what has to be done, and it is clear it has to be done now. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. SMUCKER ). Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I had the opportunity to travel to Puerto Rico this past Saturday with a bipartisan group of legislators. We traveled there with Resident Commissioner GONZA´LEZCOLO´N, who has been an absolutely outstanding advocate for Puerto Rico during this difficult time. I have a few takeaways from that: One, it was a sobering experience to see how widespread the devastation is on the island. Every single aspect of the island of Puerto Rico was affected. Secondly, the full commitment of the Department of Defense, of FEMA, of every Federal Government agency and the effort to recover that is being conducted in conjunction with the Governor and folks on the ground in Puerto Rico is great to see. It is an effective initial recovery effort that has saved and has sustained lives. Millions of meals and millions of bottles of water have been distributed. A third takeaway is this will require a sustained active and effective effort. I want to thank the chairman for introducing this bill today, which is absolutely necessary to bring back the economy on the island of Puerto Rico. The top priority now is to rebuild the grid, which is absolutely essential to getting the economy in Puerto Rico moving. That is why we need this aid package. It is an important step along the long road to recovery for our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico, as well as for all of those impacted by hurricanes in the South and those out West battling wildfires. One thing I saw as well: the American people come to the assistance of other citizens in need, and that is true whether it is in Houston, Florida, or in Puerto Rico. Again, I would like to thank the chair for introducing this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to associate my remarks with the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. SMUCKER ) as well as with my colleague from New York (Mrs. LOWEY ). On our committee, we try to get the work of the Nation done, and at this point in history we have had some incredible tragedies and natural disasters. As a group, as this House, we must act quickly to ensure that the Federal Government fulfills its duty to millions of Americans in need. Whether they are from Texas or whether they are from Florida or whether they are from Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands, they are all citizens. Whether they are from the West, who have been fighting these deadly fires, they deserve our support. This will be the second installment of emergency funding. There will be others. I know people are concerned that not every State’s needs are met, but this is a good step in the right direction, and I urge all my colleagues to support this legislation so we can get this money out the door as quickly as possible. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise to stand with the hundreds of thousands of Texas families victimized by Hurricane Harvey, and urge our state and federal officials to use available resources to help our fellow Americans in their time of need. With nearly fourandahalf feet of rain and 130 mile per hour winds, Hurricane Harvey is the largest and most expensive natural disaster to hit Texas in living memory. At least 270,000 homes and residences were damaged in our state. Most tragically, over 75 innocent people lost their lives as a result of Harvey, most of them in Harris County. Later today the U.S. House of Representatives will be voting on a $36.5 billion disaster supplemental bill to sustain relief and recovery efforts in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. This is not a perfect bill. I would have strongly preferred Congress provide dedicated funds to rebuild Houston and the Texas Gulf Coast, especially dedicated funding towards our region’s flood control infrastructure and immediate housing needs for hurricane victims. However, this supplemental will sustain the current recovery efforts till the damages caused by these devastating hurricanes can be fully assessed. Today’s supplemental is on top of $15 billion in emergency funding Congress passed last month in the immediate aftermath of Harvey. The bipartisan Texas Congressional Delegation is committed to securing the substantial federal funds Houston and the Texas Gulf Coast need to rebuild and be prepared for the next big storm before the holiday season. Our local officials, in particular the Governor of Texas and the state legislature, have the opportunity right now to act and rampup rebuilding efforts through our state’s Economic Stabilization Fund. Popularly known as Texas’s ‘‘rainy day fund,’’ the ESF currently has over $10 billion available for emergencies. There can be no question that the destruction caused by Harvey and the immediate needs of tens of thousands of Texans are an emergency and are the reason why our state has been investing in a rainy day fund in the first place. Harris County Judge Ed Emmett and Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner have already called on Governor Greg Abbott to use his authority to tap the rainy day fund and help Texans in need and rebuild our infrastructure. I join Judge Emmett and Mayor Turner in calling on the governor to immediately authorize emergency funding through our rainy day fund and help rebuild Houston and Harris County. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. FRELING HUYSEN ) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, H. Res. 569. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Iowa (Mr. BLUM) and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. CUMMINGS ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Iowa. 
Mr. BLUM. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on S. 585, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Iowa? There was no objection. Mr. BLUM. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in support of S. 585, the Dr. Chris Kirkpatrick Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017. This bill addresses problems that were exposed in the tragic case of whistleblower retaliation at the Department of Veterans Affairs. Dr. Chris Kirkpatrick was a doctor employed on a probationary basis by 
Veterans Affairs, who committed suicide hours after he was fired for questioning overmedication of the veterans he cared for. This bill would, for the first time, create minimum disciplinary standards to require that managers who retaliate against whistleblowers are punished. First offenders would receive at least 3 days of suspension, and repeat offenders would face mandatory termination. The Kirkpatrick Act also adds whistleblower protections to Federal employees hired on a probationary basis, like Dr. Kirkpatrick. Agencies will be required to grant priority to requests for transfer from probationary period whistleblowers. The bill would create a number of other whistleblower protections, many of which are overdue. For example, accessing the medical file of a whistleblower for the purpose of retaliation would be declared a prohibited personnel action. The Department of Veterans Affairs would also be required to devise a plan to prevent that sort of unauthorized medical file access. The bill also requires apparent suicides by whistleblowers to be referred to the Office of Special Counsel for further investigation. Agencies would be required to initiate training programs for supervisors and information disclosures for employees regarding whistleblower protection. The Senate passed this bill by voice vote earlier this year, and passage through the House would send the bill to the President’s desk for signature and enactment. I urge my colleagues to support this bill to honor the memory of Dr. Chris Kirkpatrick and to protect future whistleblowers. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, as the ranking member of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, the committee with oversight jurisdiction over Federal workers and agencies, I am one of the staunchest supporters of whistleblower protections in the Congress. I strongly support enhancing protections for the brave men and women who put their careers on the line to speak out against waste, fraud, and abuse. I fully support the intent of S. 585 to protect whistleblowers who face investigations in retaliation for their disclosures. But I am disappointed that the Republican leadership chose not to consider this measure under regular order. House Republicans rushed this legislation directly to the floor, bypassing any consideration by the Oversight Committee or the Veterans’ Affairs Committee, which have jurisdiction over the bill. It is especially disappointing that my committee was not given the opportunity to address constitutional and privacy concerns raised by the Trump administration’s Office of Personnel Management about the bill. That is what I said: the Trump administration’s concerns about it. It is even more disheartening that the Rules Committee issued a closed rule for this bill. They blocked all three germane amendments that I submitted, including an amendment to fix the problems identified by the OPM. The measure before us today would change the procedures for disciplining Federal supervisors who retaliate against employees who blow the whistle. It would require agency heads to impose suspensions of at least 3 days for a first offense, and termination for a second offense whenever an agency head, administrative law judge, the Merit Systems Protection Board, a Federal judge, or an inspector general finds that a supervisor retaliated against an employee who blew the whistle. It also would reduce the length of the notice requirement for proposed disciplinary action from 30 days to 14 days. It would eliminate the option to hold a hearing if a supervisor contests a proposed disciplinary action. It would change the current burden of proof for demonstrating retaliation from a preponderance of the evidence to require agency heads to impose disciplinary action in any case in which a supervisor does not furnish evidence or if the head of the agency determines that such evidence is not sufficient to reverse the proposed action. The bill also would require an agency head, when an employee may have committed suicide, to refer any information to the Office of Special Counsel indicating that the employee had blown the whistle and that the agency took personnel action against the employee. The OPM has questioned whether some of the provisions in the bill would withstand constitutional scrutiny if challenged in court, and I agree with the OPM on that issue. For example, the OPM explained that the bill’s requirement to propose minimum penalties of 3 days’ suspension for the first offense and termination for second offenses could violate due process protections. These protections require agencies to notify employees of factors they will consider regarding proposed penalties for findings of wrongdoing and to provide employees with meaningful opportunities to respond. The United States Supreme Court and Federal Circuit Courts have ruled that Federal employees are entitled to these protections. After all, they are Americans. But according to the OPM, the bill would eliminate agency consideration of many of the 12 factors that were set force by the Merit Systems Protection Board in Douglas v. Veterans Administration in 1981. The Board uses these socalled Douglas factors to assess the reasonableness of penalties, and agency officials who propose or decide adverse actions against employees must concurrently consider these factors. Concerns have also been raised that by reducing the current requirement for 30 days’ notice of adverse action to 14 days, lowering the existing burden of proof, and eliminating the option for hearings, the bill could be challenged on the basis that it does not give supervisors sufficiently meaningful opportunities to respond to accusations of retaliation. In addition, although the intent of the bill is to enhance protections for whistleblowers, there is some concern that it would be misused to harm whistleblowers. For example, an agency head could utilize the bill’s abbreviated disciplinary processes in bad faith to retaliate against supervisors who blow the whistle on highlevel waste, fraud, or abuse. Lastly, the provision requiring agency heads to refer information to the Office of Special Counsel regarding employees who may have committed suicide raises important privacy questions. The bill does not include any provision requiring agencies to obtain permission from family members before sharing information about an employee’s death. It is unfortunate that the House has failed to take the opportunity to fix these flaws in this measure. The second amendment that I presented would have protected the privacy interests of employees who commit suicide by requiring written permission from their next of kin before agency heads disclose the details about the death. And another amendment that I submitted would have made corrections in the underlying bill to ensure that managers who violate whistleblower rights will be held accountable, while safeguarding due process rights. Finally, the third amendment was the text of my bipartisan bill, H.R. 702, the Federal Employee AntiDiscrimination Act of 2017, which passed the House by a voice vote under suspension of the rules earlier in this Congress, and also passed the House by a vote of 403–0 in the last Congress. This amendment would have expanded the protections for employees who suffer retaliation and discrimination. It also would have prohibited the use of nondisclosure agreements to prevent employees from disclosing waste, fraud, or abuse to Congress, to the Office of Special Counsel, and inspector generals. I expect the bill, as it now stands, to engender substantial litigation that may have to be addressed by the courts. It would, indeed, be unfortunate if that litigation resulted in overturning disciplinary action against an employee who retaliated against a whistleblower, when we could have acted today to address the constitutional concerns. As I said before the Rules Committee, sometimes I think we can get so caught up in our partisan battles, that even when we come with good suggestions as to how to make a piece of legislation better and more effective and certainly come within the bounds 
of the Constitution, we are blinded by what we see; and that is this battle between Republicans and Democrats, Mr. Speaker, and we don’t come up, sometimes with the very best product. But even with all that, because I am so concerned about whistleblowers, I plan to vote for the bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BLUM. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. KIND). Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Dr. Chris Kirkpatrick Whistleblower Protection Act, which will enhance whistleblower protections for employees at the VA and lead to better care for our Nation’s veterans. This bill is named in honor of Dr. Chris Kirkpatrick, a Wisconsinite, who tragically took his own life after being fired from the Tomah VA Medical Center in my congressional district in Tomah, Wisconsin. Dr. Kirkpatrick was a clinical psychologist who specialized in treating some of the toughest and most pressing issues our veterans face today: PTSD, substance abuse, and chronic pain. During his time at Tomah, Dr. Kirkpatrick noticed a disturbing trend of overprescribing of opioids to patients. b1330 Dr. Kirkpatrick had the courage to blow the whistle to his superiors about what he rightly saw as dangerous pain management practices at the time. Sadly, the overprescribing issues that Dr. Kirkpatrick tried to warn about continued to occur at Tomah VA. In 2015, a Wisconsin veteran named Jason Simcakoski tragically lost his life at the facility due to the dangerous pain management practices at the Tomah VA. Last year, I worked with the Simcakoski family to pass the bipartisan Jason Simcakoski PROMISE Act to improve pain management practices at the VA so that no other veterans and their families have to go through what the Simcakoski family had to. Although Dr. Kirkpatrick is no longer with us today, his dedication to serving veterans and his courage to stand up for what was right is why we are here today. This act will ensure that no one is retaliated against for coming forward with concerns about waste, fraud, abuse, and malpractice at the VA. The bill offers a number of new protections for whistleblowers and will help ensure that supervisors found guilty of retaliation are held responsible for their actions. Dr. Kirkpatrick was dedicated to improving lives and serving our Nation’s veterans. The bill before us today will honor the memory of Dr. Kirkpatrick by helping to make sure no one has to go through what he did. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation. Mr. BLUM. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DEFAZIO), the ranking member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and one who has been a staunch supporter of whistleblowers. Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I would agree with many of the gentleman’s concerns and comments regarding the lack of a real legislative process here. The bill could be better. But nonetheless, like the ranking member, I will be supporting the legislation despite those concerns because it is absolutely urgent. I have a totally dysfunctional management at the VA hospital in Roseburg, Oregon. A number of years ago, a whistleblower came to me and said that substandard care was being provided. We asked the Office of Inspector General to look into it. They whitewashed it, and then it came out in the Senate testimony that the Office of Special Counsel had found that this doctor had been penalized as a whistleblower because he was pointing to substandard care. I asked for another investigation and ultimately found, yes, indeed, substandard care was being provided by the head surgeon. He was suspended from his duties but is still the head surgeon. Now he has run another very accomplished doctor, under very dubious circumstances, out of my Eugene clinic. This is a surgeon who served 29 years, honorably, in the military, 10 years at my regional hospital with rave reviews, and, after 30 days at my new VA clinic in Eugene, was dismissed in the most unusual way with no allegations put forward. Mr. Speaker, again, it seems that we are having issues here when the quality is substandard that this one person is able to basically just get rid of the folks who are raising concerns about the care of veterans. Again, this shouldn’t happen. Mr. Speaker, I include in the record two letters regarding the dismissed doctor. 
OCTOBER 17, 2017. DEARMR. DEFAZIO: I am a contracted physician in the emergency department at the Roseburg VA. I have been working at this facility since 2010. During that time I have truly enjoyed providing care for the veterans. However, I have significant concerns regarding the administration and inefficiencies in healthcare, in the VA system. Unfortunately, it seems that advancement of careers and the fluffing of numbers supersede patient care. Despite the build up of these concerns over the years, I have recently became aware of an action that compels me to go beyond the normal chain of command. One of the surgeons working at the Eugene campus—still under the Roseburg administration—was fired recently under very concerning circumstances. Dr. Scott Russi was working at the Eugene VA for less than 1 month when he was pushed out and fired. I know Dr. Russi from the private sector. In addition to working at the Roseburg VA, I have worked for the last ten years at Sacred Heart RiverBend—a trauma, stroke, and cardiac center—and one of the largest hospitals in the state. I worked alongside Dr. Russi for many years at RiverBend and I found him to be not only extremely competent and hardworking, but always very professional. I was sad to see him leave RiverBend, but I was encouraged that he would be working in the VA system as I felt he would significantly improve the quality of care for the veterans. I find it very disheartening that a group of administrative physicians, who rarely practice medicine, are able to strike down such a promising figure simply because they seem to have felt threatened by him. I know there are many people who are upset by this firing and who have concerns about this system in general. I have tried many times to discuss my concerns with people in the administration and have been met with, at best, excuses and, at worst, threats. It is clear to me as somewhat of an outsider and observer (as I am not actually a VA employee) that physicians who are dedicated to patient care and most skilled are threatening to the administration. These physicians are often ostracized and pushed out—and when they can’t be pushed out, false rumors are spread about them. I have considered stepping away from the VA system due to these continuing frustrations. It is disheartening to see these veterans treated with such carelessness. However, I feel that someone has to stay and actually care for them, but, if I stay, I also want to try to make the system a better place for them. For many, this is their only health care. I wish this was as exaggerated as it may sound, but unfortunately this is only a small piece of a huge problem. If you are interested in more details, I am more than happy to discuss this further. In general, I keep my head down and do what I think is best, but this presents itself as a moment when speaking out is necessary and right. Thank you, CHARLOTTE RANSOM , MD. 
CONGRESSMAN DEFAZIO: I am writing to ask for your help. I am a surgeon and a veteran having attended the Usafa and graduating in 1984, completing medical school on Hpsp scholarship and spending the next 29 years on active duty. I deployed four times as a combat surgeon and once as a hospital commander, my last deployment in 2012 was as the Dccs of Craig Joint Theater Hospital, Bagram Ab, Afghanistan. I retired in October of 2013 and settled in Oregon as a trauma surgeon eventually becoming the Trauma Medical Director at Riverbend. I was the oncall surgeon the tragic day Ucc suffered the active shooter event. I recently left my civilian practice to serve our Veterans, for reasons I think you would understand; I have seen the care my comrades have been given and found it wanting, and serving my Vets is therapeutic for my Ptsd and the sorrow I carry for not being able to save more soldiers. I am the new surgeon at the Va Eugene Hcc and have been working there parttime since January of this year and full time since 23 July. Today I was handed a summary suspension of clinical privileges as a surgeon by the parent Va, Roseburg and Dr. Dinesh Ranjan the chief of surgery. I have been denied the opportunity to defend my reputation, denied the opportunity to stand before my peers, and denied any opportunity to see the allegations. And tonight, I have spoken with two Va physicians (Dr. Lisa Brandenburger and Dr. Philo Calhoun) whose lives were dedicated to serving Veterans but were irreparably damaged by Dr. Ranjan. I am now being targeted by Dr. Ranjan because he recruited me with the promise of a salary of $385,000, I signed a contract for that 
amount but I am being paid $280,000. Because I expressed to the Eugene Hcc administrator I felt I was misled about the salary, Dr. Ranjan has gone after my clinical privileges, had them summarily dismissed and placed me at risk of being reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (Npdb). I have been suspended from patient contact for 30 days for an investigation. If the investigation finds me deficient, I will be reported to the Npdb. If the investigation extends beyond 30 days, I will be reported to the Npdb. If I am fired or quit my job, I will be reported to the Npdb. If I am reported to the Npdb I will never work again as a surgeon. I know it all sounds unbelievable, I think it is unbelievable as I try and wrap my head around the events of these last few days. I ask you not to send a congressional inquiry to Mr. Paxton, as that would make my life worse. What I thought would be my dream job, now has become a nightmare. Respectfully, SCOTT RUSSI. 
Mr. D EFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, since this has come out, I have had dozens of calls from nurses and doctors and other workers in the VA system in my region—in Eugene, Springfield, and southern Oregon, down to Roseburg, at those two facilities—because of this mismanagement. They say that the care is not up to standards, just like this particular physician was not providing modern care when he did colonoscopies. We need—vitally need—this legislation and the strongest protection for whistleblowers. This isn’t about protecting bad managers. It is about promoting qualified and keeping qualified employees, which we are having a hard time doing in my area. It is about providing the best care to our veterans, and that isn’t going to happen if people can be intimidated or just shown the door when they raise concerns. Mr. BLUM. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from New Hampshire (Ms. KUSTER ). Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member CUMMINGS for yielding me time to speak about this important legislation to protect whistleblowers. Mr. Speaker, I share the concerns that were brought up yesterday in the Rules Committee and today on the floor about the procedure for bringing this bill to the floor without full House committee process. However, I will support the bill because it is so important. The Dr. Chris Kirkpatrick Whistleblower Protection Act will provide protection for employees at the Department of Veterans Affairs who blow the whistle on wrongdoing in the agency. As the ranking member of the House Veterans’ Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, I know full well that whistleblowers are vital to the VA to protect the health and wellbeing of the men and women who have so bravely served our country. Although we have numerous protections currently in place for whistleblowers, those who are committed to silencing them still manage to find ways to retaliate, which we saw with tragic consequences at the Phoenix VA Health Care System and in Dr. Kirkpatrick’s case. In addition to serving on the House Veterans Affairs’ Committee, my role as the founder and cochair of the Bipartisan Heroin Task Force makes VA’s retaliation against another VA doctor, Dr. Kirkpatrick, an especially troublesome tragedy. When he tried to raise the alarm over concerns that another VA doctor was overprescribing opioids that may have led to patient deaths, he was aware that doing so could be harmful to his own position at the Tomah VA Medical Center. Dr. Kirkpatrick’s action was laudable. Veterans have been acutely impacted by the opioid epidemic, and his efforts to reduce prescription rates for veterans is not only a good example for VA physicians, but for all physicians in the U.S. today. Title II of this bill puts in place a number of requirements for the VA to protect VA employees from several retaliatory measures. It requires the Secretary to put in place a plan to prevent unauthorized access to medical records of VA employees, along with outreach to ensure that VA employees are aware of mental health services available to them. These and other improvements in title II will not only help prevent the type of retaliation that Dr. Kirkpatrick suffered, they will improve care for veterans to also help make the VA a better place to work. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support this bill, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. Mr. BLUM. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. As I close, I take the opportunity to reiterate that I strongly support the objectives of S. 585. If there is anything that we agree on in the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, it is that we must protect whistleblowers. Many of the investigations that we have conducted have been as a result of somebody who saw something and said something. Like Dr. Kirkpatrick, I am sure, in most of those instances, it was very difficult for them because they, on the one hand, wanted to improve a situation or address a problem, but at the same time, they knew that it was possible that they, themselves, might be harmed and their families might be harmed. So they make a very, very difficult choice, a very difficult choice. I am horrified that Dr. Kirkpatrick was so agonized by the treatment he endured at the Veterans Administration that he saw no options for himself. In other words, Mr. Speaker, he saw no way out. I worry that there are civil servants today who are enduring that same agony. But we say to them that we will protect you with all we have got, and that is why I appreciate Senator JOHNSON ’s work on S. 585, and I share his commitment to protecting whistleblowers. For that reason, as I said earlier, I will vote in favor of this legislation. That said, I wish that the Republican leadership had taken the opportunities that my amendments provided to improve this bill. These issues of equal protection are nothing to play with because we begin to chip away and chip away and chip away at employees’ rights, and the next you know, those rights begin to disappear. Those are the kind of rights that are a part and the fabric of this thing we call a democracy. I think we have to be very, very, very careful. It is going to be interesting to see what the courts have to say about this legislation. My amendments would have addressed the constitutional concerns raised by OPM—and I emphasize OPM. This was not the Obama OPM. This was the Trump OPM. My amendments would also have protected the privacy of employees who take their own lives. My amendments would have added to the underlying bill additional protections for employees who suffer retaliation or discrimination, protections that the House has already approved. I believe this is a missed opportunity and it is sad. I truly hope that future litigation does not undo the advances that this bill seeks to make in the protections provided for the courageous men and women willing to blow the whistle on wrongdoing. In this day and age, we need the whistleblower more now than we have ever needed them. Mr. Speaker, I urge the Members to support this bill to protect some of the boldest, most courageous people in our Nation, the whistleblowers. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BLUM. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 585 the Dr. Chris Kirkpatrick Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017. As Chairman of the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, protecting whistleblowers at VA is of paramount concern to ensure that we provide high quality healthcare and benefits to our nation’s veterans. This bill authored by Senator JOHNSON of Wisconsin was named in honor of Dr. Christopher Kirkpatrick, a former VA doctor who served our veterans at the Tomah, WI medical center. Many of us know that the Tomah VA medical center has been a facility plagued with the overprescribing of opioids to our veterans. Dr. Kirkpatrick was a brave patriot who blew the whistle on these over prescriptions and the harm that was being done to veterans, however, instead of commending him for coming forward, VA fired him on trumped up charges, which ultimately led to him taking his own life. In my opinion, the corrosive culture within this facility and VA’s actions toward Dr. Kirkpatrick left a chilling effect not only in Tomah, but across the Department. I believe that these actions made whistleblowers feel questioned and worried that they would be punished instead of being lauded and encouraged to come forward. 
It is because of brave whistleblowers like Dr. Kirkpatrick that my Committee has been able to expose issues and scandals across the VA. It is because of whistleblowers that we were able to uncover the manipulation of wait times at the Phoenix Medical Center; the falsifying of records in the Philadelphia Regional Office; the fact that a VA employee participated in an armed robbery in Puerto Rico and stayed on the job following their arrest; and many more egregious behaviors at the Department that put veterans in harm’s way. I have confidence that Secretary Shulkin is committed to protecting whistleblowers, so that we never again lose another talented doctor, like Dr. Kirkpatrick. The best way to help him in this mission is to send a clear message to all VA employees, at every level in the Department, and within every level of management, that there are stiff penalties for those who retaliate against the men and women who are brave enough to come forward and protect veterans. S. 585 builds off of our work this Congress that started with the passage of the bill I championed, the VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017, which provides the Secretary of Veterans Affairs the tools he needs to hold poor employees accountable. I am pleased that the bill before us today would make needed changes to our outdated civil service laws for all Federal Government employees, which have become so archaic and complex that they tend to put the rights of retaliators above the rights of whistleblowers. The bill before us would also provide needed reforms to information regarding VA employees who die by suicide, additional penalties for accessing a veteran’s medical record, and other needed provisions to ensure that we put the needs of whistleblowers and veterans first. I appreciate Senator JOHNSON and Representative DUFFY for their work on this important bill and I encourage all of my colleagues to support its passage. Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Speaker, today, Congress will have an opportunity to vote on legislation that will bolster protections for whistleblowing patriots, while vastly improving care for veterans at the VA. The Dr. Chris Kirkpatrick Whistleblower Protection Act is the product of hundreds of hours of Congressional hearings, meetings with stakeholders, and hard work by dozens of lawmakers here in Washington, to make sure that the tragic abuse that Dr. Kirkpatrick faced will never happen again. As some of you may know, Dr. Chris Kirkpatrick was a clinical psychologist at the VA in Tomah, WI. He was a veteran, a graduate of Northwestern University, and a caring individual who dedicated his career to providing innovative treatments for veterans suffering from PTSD. Most notably, he created a yoga program to help vets at the VA in Chicago. He was known to be very wellliked by the patients he served. In 2009, Dr. Kirkpatrick expressed concerns that his patients were being heavily overmedicated. It became so bad, he said, that he was unable to properly do his job. He wanted to do what was right for veterans, and as a veteran himself, he couldn’t stand to see how careless some of the VA staff were being with high levels of dangerous medications. Unfortunately, instead of looking into Dr. Kirkpatrick’s claims, the facility’s chief of staff told him to mind his own business, and to instead focus on his own work. Shortly thereafter, Dr. Kirkpatrick was called to a disciplinary meeting and given a written reprimand. This type of retaliation went on for months. Then, in July, Dr. Kirkpatrick complained again that a dangerous veteran had not been properly discharged, despite recommendations from a treatment team. A week after making the complaint, Dr. Kirkpatrick was fired from the VA. He was devastated. He begged for an opportunity to stay, and expressed concerns that he had been given too many complex cases, and that the emotional toll was too high. Again, his concerns were ignored. That night, Dr. Kirkpatrick wrote a note to his girlfriend in Chicago, another to the kennel he wanted to take care of his dog, and one final note for the mailman. It read: ‘‘Please call 911—tell them to go to red barn building.’’ He had taken his own life. He was 38 years old. Dr. Kirkpatrick’s death was the product of a broken system—a system that encourages retaliation against whistleblowers, while ignoring the underlying causes of their concerns. If Dr. Kirkpatrick’s death wasn’t tragic enough, a subsequent investigation at the VA found that a patient had died from ‘‘mixed drug toxicity’’, and that Dr. Kirkpatrick’s concerns were completely warranted. Not only did whistleblower retaliation cost Dr. Kirkpatrick his life, it cost the life of a patient as well. That’s why I urge you all to vote yes on the Dr. Chris Kirkpatrick Whistleblower Protection Act. A yes vote means that VA personnel will no longer be able to access a whistleblower’s medical records as means of discrediting them, which a separate investigation found happens far too often. A yes vote means that federal agencies have to notify the Office of Special Counsel when a suicide takes place. A yes means clear disciplinary actions for supervisors who retaliate against whistleblowers, training for supervisors on how to properly respond, and a requirement that employees are made aware of the mental health services at their disposal. A yes vote also means keeping upholding normal burdens of proof to strengthen protections for employees. This legislation calls for the Inspector General, Office of Special Counsel, or a Merit Systems Protection Board Administrative Judge to ‘‘determine’’ that a supervisor has committed a prohibited personnel action, meaning through the normal preponderance of the evidence for any other disciplinary action under Chapter 75 of title 5. This does not mean some arbitrary process for some bureaucrat to create later on. I want to be clear: this legislation strengthens protections for patriots—for those who are trying to do the right thing. For those who care about veterans and their safety. And for folks like Dr. Kirkpatrick, so that no one ever has to go through what he went through. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 562, the previous question is ordered on the bill. The question is on the third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be read a third time, and was read the third time. MOTION TO RECOMMIT  
Mr. O’HALLERAN. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill? Mr. O’HALLERAN. Mr. Speaker, I am opposed in its current form. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to recommit. The Clerk read as follows: 
Mr. O’Halleran moves to recommit the bill S. 585 to the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform with instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith with the following amendment: At the end of title I the bill, add the following new section: 
SEC. ll. DISCLOSURE OF VIOLATIONS RELATING TO AIR TRANSPORTATION. 
This Act, and any amendments made by this Act, shall apply to any employee who makes a protected disclosure of information relating to a violation by the head of an agency, or other political appointee, of any law, rule, or regulation concerning travel, including the improper use of air transportation. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Arizona is recognized for 5 minutes in support of his motion. Mr. O’HALLERAN. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended. Mr. Speaker, increasing accountability and transparency across our government is a shared principle we can all agree on among this body. Whether at the VA or other Federal agencies, the American people deserve to know that Federal officials from the top down are being held to the standards we expect of them. We owe it to our veterans, to our seniors, and to the hardworking American taxpayers to ensure that their tax dollars are utilized appropriately and efficiently, as intended. Waste, fraud, and abuse, have no place at our agencies, and those who help uncover it deserve our admiration and our protection. I am proud that we are coming together to increase protections for whistleblowers of Federal agencies, a long overdue effort. But, Mr. Speaker, in light of recent reports and events that have revealed a disturbing pattern of improper use of tax dollars on air travel by senior Federal officials, I believe we must go further. The reports of Cabinet officials abusing the rules for air travel that applied to them are not isolated. Not one, not two, not three, but at least four Cabinet officials are facing scrutiny for irregular and irresponsible use of agency resources for official and nonofficial air travel. In light of Secretary Price’s recent resignation, it is clear that Congress must conduct greater oversight. b1345 That is why I am offering this final amendment on the underlying bill. 
My amendment simply extends whistleblower protections that are created under the bill to Federal employees who disclose information about travel, including improper use of aircraft. Not only would this make clear to agencies that any violation of laws, rules, or regulations concerning travel or government aircraft is unacceptable, it will also ensure those who come forward to expose any wrongdoing will have appropriate protection from retaliation. Regardless of party, those who serve the American public must be held to the highest ethical standards. Our ability to hold government officials accountable to taxpayers is a hallmark of our democracy, and we must work to uphold that principle. The resources invested to agencies to fulfill their missions of serving Americans should not be abused or frivolously flaunted for personal gain or convenience. This is not about Republicans or Democrats. We must come together to stand up for accountability and transparency. The moment we begin treating disregard for the rules by our elected and appointed officials as partisan politics, we risk ceding the very values that make our democracy great and unique in the world. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting my commonsense amendment on behalf of American taxpayers, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BLUM. Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the motion to recommit. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Iowa is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. BLUM. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I oppose the motion to recommit. This bill addresses critical flaws in how the Federal Government addresses whistleblower retaliation. The consequences for whistleblower retaliation are very real. There is a chilling effect of whistleblower reports or unjust termination. In some cases, like that of Dr. Kirkpatrick in the Department of Veterans Affairs, the consequences are literally life and death. We have the opportunity to send this bill to the President for a signature today and fix this now. Why wait? And at what cost to Federal employees, veterans, and taxpayers? I support the gentleman from Maryland’s effort to pass this provision which I previously cosponsored myself, but let’s not let one good bill get in the way of another. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose the motion to recommit and support the underlying bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to recommit. There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. O’HALLERAN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. 
RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess for a period of less than 15 minutes. Accordingly (at 1 o’clock and 48 minutes p.m.), the House stood in recess. 
b1355 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky) at 1 o’clock and 55 minutes p.m. 
MOTION TO INSTRUCT CONFEREES ON H.R. 2810, NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018 Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the Speaker’s table the bill (H.R. 2810) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2018 for military activities of the Department of Defense, for military construction, and for defense activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes, with the Senate amendment thereto, disagree to the Senate amendment, and request a conference with the Senate thereon. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to instruct conferees at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion. The Clerk read as follows: 
Mr. Langevin moves that the managers on the part of the House at the conference on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the Senate amendment to the bill H.R. 2810 be instructed as follows: (1) To disagree with subsection (c) of section 336 of the Senate amendment. (2) To recede from section 1064 of the House bill. (3) To disagree with section 1087 of the Senate amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 7 of rule XXII, the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. LANGEVIN ) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORNBERRY ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Rhode Island. Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the Army has a surplus of pistols. The M–1911 A–1, a .45caliber pistol—the Armed Forces standard issue sidearm for more than 50 years— was replaced in the 1980s by a newer model. Since then the Army has accumulated stores of surplus M–1911 pistols which are housed at taxpayer expense in Alabama. There is no national security reason to keep these pistols. The Army stopped issuing them 30 years ago, yet the Army has been prevented from disposing of them due to parochial interests tied to the Civilian Marksmanship Program, or CMP. The CMP’s proponents basically want to transfer the pistols to a private corporation so that it can sell them. Do we want this to happen? We have the opportunity in this year’s NDAA to stop this transfer of tens of thousands of M–1911 A–1 pistols which constitutes a multimilliondollar government giveaway. It is also important to note that this would make our streets more dangerous at a time when gun violence is all too common. The CMP was established in 1903— just to put this in historical context— following the SpanishAmerican War when American militiamen demonstrated distressingly poor marksmanship. At that time, our Nation needed a better trained and organized militia, and the CMP helped the government build a broader base of able citizensoldiers. Now, the program was an important component of our national defense back then. But today, Mr. Speaker, over a century later, we have a professional military and many rifle clubs, and the CMP is, quite frankly, no longer needed. Congress clearly understood this when it privatized the CMP in 1996. Now, as an initial capital investment at a time when earmarks were still common, Congress provided the newly chartered corporation with a stock of rifles, ammunition, and other spare parts. The CMP could sell the surplus equipment—mostly M1 Garand rifles— in order to fund its activities until it became selfsufficient. b1400 However, it was never Congress’ intent to equip the CMP with handguns, or it would have provided the corporation with surplus M–1911–A1 .45caliber pistols at that time. Now, more than two decades later, the CMP is running out of rifles to sell. The reality is that it is in dire financial straits as, more than 20 years later, the program is still reliant on rifle sales to support its activities. So, Mr. Speaker, it is clearly not the taxpayers’ responsibility to bail out the CMP. To do so would be an unprecedented government handout at a time when earmarks have been banned for years. 
So what makes this program so special? There is nothing. Beyond this, it would flood our streets with handguns—the guns that are most often used by criminals. I believe this would be extremely dangerous when, more than 2 years ago, the first attempt was made to effectuate this earmark, I heard the argument that storing surplus pistols, as the Army is now doing, is a waste of government funds. Well, I agree. However, a handout is not the answer. There is no national security reason to put these guns on our streets. In fact, an increase in the number of handguns will only result potentially in more violence. So, Mr. Speaker, we should allow the Army to dispose of these pistols by melting them down, as it plans to do with other surplus arms. Senate language in the NDAA exempts M–1911–A1 pistols from Army disposal, but I urge my colleagues to support the motion to instruct the conferees to reject this exemption. There is no reason to store these pistols. There is no reason to flood our streets with them. There is no reason to give an earmark, again, to a private corporation. They should be melted down and repurchased for other military uses, which is exactly what this motion supports. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise against the motion to instruct. I believe this is the first motion to instruct that the House has voted on so far this year and this Congress, so not all Members may not realize that, as the House and the Senate are about to go to conference committee to work out differences in the House and Senate versions of whatever bill they are focused on, procedurally it is possible to have a motion to instruct conferees, such as the gentleman from Rhode Island has offered. That motion is not binding on the conferees, but it is an attempt to have a vote on an issue that a Member or group of Members think is important or that they can make a point upon. The subject of this motion to instruct is the disposal of excess weapons, as the gentleman from Rhode Island mentioned. I would just say, Mr. Speaker, I know of no evidence that—as the government has over the years disposed of these weapons, there is no evidence that any of them have been improperly used. They must be disposed of fully consistent with the law, and that includes background checks and the rest, and the proceeds support safety programs, which I would suspect that all of us think is a worthwhile endeavor. I would also say, Mr. Speaker, the House has regularly expressed its opinion and its will with amendment votes both on the floor and in committee over the years. We have voted on this program a number of times and it has consistently been the will of the House that this program should continue. As a matter of fact, in this year’s bill, we had a vote in committee and the amendment to provide for this program was adopted. So, to me, Mr. Speaker, the most important point to make is this: the bill before us is one that helps this Congress fulfill the first responsibilities of the Federal Government, and that is to defend our citizens. It also provides the support that the men and women who serve our Nation in the military must have if they are to carry out the missions to which they are assigned. That is the purpose of this bill, that is the focus of this bill: to defend the country and to support our troops. That will continue to be the focus as the House and Senate move into conference. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I certainly have great respect for the chairman and his leadership of the Armed Services Committee. No one questions his commitment to defending the Nation in support of our military, but we don’t need to support earmarks to a private corporation. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. CARBAJAL ). Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak against provisions in the House and the Senate National Defense Authorization Act that would allow the transfer of all surplus pistols to the Civilian Marksmanship Program—or CMP—for sale to the public. Allowing the transfer of this large volume of guns for sale to the public moves the CMP into the retail gun market and away from its statutorily mandated functions. This is a program meant to instruct citizens in marksmanship and promote safety in the use of firearms, not to deal firearms. The Army has opposed such provisions in the past, and I am here to oppose any NDAA provisions that would allow the transfer of any surplus Army firearms to the CMP. I join my colleague, Mr. LANGEVIN , in calling for all surplus firearms to be melted down and not distributed to the public. There are over 300 million guns in America, nearly one for every citizen. We have lost way too many lives to gun violence. The Department of Defense should not participate in freely distributing their guns onto our streets. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. ROGERS). Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, the Civilian Marksmanship Program is an organization that was established initially by this Congress because we needed institutions to help people better understand gun safety and how to handle weapons. It has fulfilled a vital mission. Fortunately, in recent years, we have been able to not have to fund it anymore by being able to selffund through the refurbishment and sale of surplus weapons. It has been their mission for a century. These 1911s are surplus pistols that were used up until the early nineties by our military. Since that time, statutorily, they were made available to law enforcement and allied countries. As you might imagine, most law enforcement and allied countries would rather have new, modern weapons, rather than surplus. So we have approximately 100,000 of these weapons in storage at the Anniston Army Depot in my district. It costs us in the neighborhood of $50,000 or $60,000 a year in direct cost to store these weapons. What the Armed Services Committee and this Congress in preceding NDAAs has repeatedly done has been to instruct the Department of the Army to start turning those over to the Civilian Marksmanship Program at 10,000 a year until the full 100,000 has been eliminated from our storage. The CMP—the Civilian Marksmanship Program—takes those weapons as they get them, completely refurbishes them, and then sells them to collectors. These are not weapons that wind up on the streets. They generally cost between $800 and $1,000, and they are sold to collectors. To be able to buy one, you have to go through the same background check as any other buyer. But not just anybody can buy these. You have to either be in law enforcement, the military, or an active member of a gun club. These are not a danger to the public. In fact, this whole process of taking this money, the CMP then sells the weapons and it goes into their trust fund to allow them to continue to train Americans in gun safety, is a vital mission that we should be supporting. This Congress has repeatedly supported it over the years. It is my hope that the full body will reject this motion by my friend and colleague, Mr. LANGEVIN . It has been defeated repeatedly in the Armed Services Committee, and I hope it will be defeated again today. Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I would just mention many wonderful organizations around the country that would love to have earmarks, but we don’t do earmarks anymore. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. ROSEN ). Ms. ROSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to a provision in the NDAA authorizing the transfer of nearly 100,000 surplus militarygrade firearms to the Civilian Marksmanship Program for sale to the public. This multimilliondollar government handout to a private corporation is bad policy. It places more militarygrade 
weapons on our streets and in our communities. The horrific violence on October 1 in Las Vegas, the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history, has forever altered the lives of hundreds of thousands of families related to those 22,000 victims that were there the day of the shooting. It is now more urgent than ever that we take meaningful action on passing gun safety measures. That should be our priority, yet here we are taking a step backwards. Instead of bringing legislation on the floor to ban the manufacture of bump stocks that allow semiautomatic rifles to fire hundreds of rounds per minute, instead of being on the floor to ban the sale of highcapacity magazines used to inflict widespread carnage, or instead of being on the floor to expand background checks to all commercial gun sales so that felons and the seriously mentally ill and terrorists cannot obtain access to dangerous weapons, we are here debating a provision that increases a number of military weapons on our streets. I know we can uphold the Second Amendment while taking reasonable steps to reduce the toll of gun violence inflicted on our communities. Putting nearly 100,000 more militarygrade firearms designed for Army use into our neighborhoods is not a reasonable step in the right direction. According to its text, the provision included in this bill mandates the immediate transfer of an unlimited number of guns to the Civilian Marksmanship Program for sale to the public. This program was originally created to instruct Americans in marksmanship, promote firearms safety, and conduct friendly shooting competitions in controlled environments. The NDAA provision we are speaking of today would turn this program into a mass firearms retailer, with the new mission to sell as many militarygrade weapons to the public as possible. It defies logic and common sense. Gun violence has become a public crisis. So I urge my colleagues to join together and work across the aisle to decrease the scope and devastation caused by tragic mass shootings. No community across America should be forced to experience the grief and trauma that my community and others like mine have gone through in these past few years. I ask all Members of Congress to support the Democratic motion to instruct conferees to remove this dangerous provision from the NDAA. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, Congress intended for the CMP to become selfsufficient after it was privatized in 1996. It was never meant to be the recipient of another multimilliondollar government handout years later, especially not a handout of tens of thousands of pistols which then would be used immediately for sale to the public to fund its operations. Again, perhaps one could argue that, when earmarks were around, they needed this to fund their operations. Again, there was a time when earmarks were in existence. Earmarks are no longer regular order. They don’t exist anymore. They were done away with several years ago. Mr. Speaker, I think it is clear that I don’t hold with the need for the CMP to receive Federal support. On another note, I don’t often see eye to eye with the NRA, but I must agree with the statement on the NRA’s website that the Association is ‘‘the premier firearms education organization in the world.’’ b1415 Well, the NRA does not receive Federal support from its education programs, which are widely accessible, and in our professional military, the need for marksmanship training for national security purposes has evaporated. Even if we truly think the CMP is deserving of a government subsidy, Congress should do so through the appropriations process, not through a provision that is, quite frankly, again, an earmark. As my colleagues so well know, earmarks were banned in the 112th Congress, yet the provisions at issue in the Housepassed NDAA would transfer millions of dollars, ostensibly, in government property to a corporation that is in the congressional district of the measure’s chief advocate. And while I have deep respect for my colleague, the government shouldn’t be engaged in this type of practice. The government has occasionally transferred surplus property to nonprofit corporations for education or other purposes; however, it has never done so with the intent that the property be immediately sold, with the proceeds going to the corporation’s bottom line. So if that isn’t an earmark, Mr. Speaker, I don’t know what is. It is blatant subversion of congressional order, and it would set, I believe, a very dangerous precedent. I hope that my colleagues would join me in upholding the rules of the House and support the motion to instruct. Mr. Speaker, I would also like to highlight the danger of this transfer, potentially, to public safety. Injecting tens of thousands of new pistols onto our streets by providing them to the CMP, I believe, could be disastrous, as handguns are regularly used in crime. Now, in 2013, of the 6,498 homicides committed by a firearm for which the type of weapon was known, 89 percent were handgun related—89 percent. Only 4 percent were carried out using a rifle, the type of firearm the CMP has traditionally sold. The qualities that made the M1911A1 .45caliber pistol a fun sidearm is the fact that it is easily concealed, extremely reliable, and packs quite a punch, all qualities that make it prized also among criminals. In fact, the Department of Justice has tracked 1,768 M1911A1s over the last decade due to their involvement in criminal activity. In a time when mass shootings have become all too common and 93 Americans are killed with guns every day, the last thing we need is more guns on our streets. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, again, the bill before us, overall, is a fine mark. I was proud to support it in committee, overall, because it provides for our national defense. It supports key programs of the Department of Defense to make sure our warfighters have every advantage possible. We never want to send our warfighters into a fair fight, and this bill, overall, goes a long way toward ensuring for our national defense and provides great support for our men and women in uniform. Unfortunately, this CMP issue has been an unnecessary distraction. It is something I don’t believe belongs in the bill. I believe that and, again, I made the point that we have done away with earmarks, and so we shouldn’t be using an earmark and subverting congressional authority and will through the regular order process, through the appropriations process, to help to fund a private organization. Again, there are many, I am sure, meritorious organizations around the country that would love to have an earmark, but we don’t do them anymore, and we shouldn’t be doing a sidestep here to give a private organization such an earmark. As I said, I have highlighted again the potential for guns to fall into the wrong hands. And although the owners of the weapons may be of good character and those who purchased the guns, to fund, again, the operations of the CMP, a private organization, even if they have them in their home, if there is criminal activity that takes place, whether it is an act of violence or if the home is broken into and the weapon is stolen, which happens every day in America that a lawabiding citizen has a weapon that gets in the wrong hands, that weapon is then used in the crime. The more weapons out there, the more likely something like that could potentially happen. This is what we are trying to prevent. We want to do this in a responsible way. Again, we want to make sure that the guns don’t just wind up out in our streets, and we want to make sure that they are melted down like other surplus equipment. The Army surely does not need to store them any longer. We want to get rid of them. We want the Army to be able to do that, but they should be able to do what they do with other surplus equipment, and that is melt it down, 
perhaps use that melted down material for making other weapons that the Army does need that are relevant at this time. Mr. Speaker, I would urge my colleagues to oppose the language in the current NDAA. We should work together and support my motion to instruct so that, as we go to conference, we have clear direction from the House as to what the House believes we should do and not allow these weapons out in our communities. We shouldn’t be supporting earmarks. As I said, I know that the Senate provision does in fact have a provision there that would allow these weapons to be melted down, and that is the way that we should go. I believe that we have an opportunity to make that statement right here. Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. SMITH), the ranking member of the full House Armed Services Committee. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I just really want to support Mr. LANGEVIN for his leadership on this issue, something that we brought up in committee, and a program that really should be just discontinued, and I think the motion to instruct is perfectly appropriate. It was a program that was originally created, and the reason that we were selling back firearms to the public from the U.S. military, the program was literally created because we were worried that there wouldn’t be enough people in our country that knew how to fire a weapon if we should need to draft them into a war. That is why the program was created. Obviously, for a whole bunch of reasons, that is no longer applicable. We have an all volunteer military. They are trained to shoot. They know how to shoot. We don’t need to train random folks with weapons from the military. Also, originally, the program was simply aimed at rifles; and now they have thrown in, I think it is, around 100,000 pistols that they want to sell back to the public, in general. And this company makes money, the taxpayers don’t, and we put 100,000 more weapons out on the streets. I think if there is one thing we should be able to agree on is that there is more than enough firepower out there amongst the public. We should not be taking military weapons and selling them back out into the public, and this motion, this amendment that Mr. LANGEVIN first brought up has a very simple solution. We will hold onto those weapons; we will melt them down. I think that is the appropriate response. We do not need to sell more firearms out there into the public. I think the gentleman from Rhode Island has done an outstanding job showing leadership on this issue. I urge us to adopt this motion to instruct, and I urge the conference committee to adopt this as part of the final National Defense Authorization Act that we ultimately will pass. Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time I have left. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. WEBER of Texas). The gentleman from Rhode Island has 11
1⁄2minutes remaining. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers other than myself, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Ranking Member SMITH for speaking on behalf of this motion to instruct. I deeply appreciate his leadership on the Armed Services Committee and his years of service, as I do, again, have deep respect for Chairman THORNBERRY and his leadership as chairman of the Armed Services Committee. Case in point, the NDAA this year, and as has been the case in past years, has been truly a bipartisan effort, and it’s one of the reasons I truly enjoy serving in the Armed Services Committee is because of the bipartisan cooperation that is demonstrated when it comes to protecting our country, when it comes to providing for our national defense, especially supporting our men and women in uniform. It is a bipartisan effort. It is unfortunate that in this one particular case we have this difference of opinion. We are, again, a program that was initially intended to train marksmen years ago when we didn’t have a professional military. Maybe it had merit and the organization was supported, but we have a professional military now, great marksmanship programs and training programs, as well as private organizations that do this. But it doesn’t require or need a government subsidy, and so it wouldn’t be appropriate in this case any further to continue to support this private organization, the CMP program with, ostensibly, a earmark. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. DAVIS). Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, today, we are considering a National Defense Authorization Act measure that would transfer thousands of military weapons to a civilian nonprofit, the Civilian Marksmanship Program. These guns will then make their way into the public for purchase. The Army has recommended against this proposal. One of their concerns, not a surprise, is public safety. For us to go against the recommendations of our own military on this matter is, frankly, absurd. Every single day, our country—our country—experiences horrific gun violence, and the last thing we should be doing is going against the advice of our military and putting more guns onto American streets. Those who are in support of the measure claim that transferring these weapons to the Civilian Marksmanship Program will save the government the cost of storing these guns, but the amount of money to be saved to store some weapons is really negligible, and that small cost is nothing compared to the potential cost to human life by unleashing these handguns for the public to purchase. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to employ common sense here. Listen to the advice of our Army and support the motion to instruct. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from California for her comments and support of the motion to instruct. I also want to commend her and thank her for her leadership on the Armed Services Committee. Mr. Speaker, just to once again reiterate, a priority of the overall NDAA that we worked on in a bipartisan, collaborative way, this one sticking point is this provision in the NDAA that, again, amounts to an earmark, and it could potentially put tens of thousands of additional weapons on our streets that could wind up in the wrong hands. It is an unnecessary step. b1430 Again, when the CMP was first created, it had a legitimate purpose. That purpose is no longer needed, per se, for the military in terms of marksmanship training. There are other organizations out there that do that, but we also have the professional military. Mr. Speaker, in closing, the provisions in the Housepassed NDAA would give a multimilliondollar handout in the form of .45caliber pistols to the Civilian Marksmanship Program. It is an unnecessary and unwise use of taxpayer property that would potentially make our streets less safe. My motion will instruct our House conferees to reject this earmark and allow the Army to melt down and repurpose its surplus firearms, as it does with other firearms or surplus equipment. Congress needs to find solutions to the endemic gun violence that is plaguing our Nation right now. We saw, it seems, time after time, multiple incidents where firearms get into the wrong hands and are misused, causing loss of life and sometimes, unfortunately, sadly, in significant numbers, just as we saw, as Ms. ROSEN mentioned, with the terrible shooting in Las Vegas: 58 people lost their lives and hundreds more were injured. It was a terrible tragedy for Nevada, for those who lost their lives, and for those who were injured; and, really, it was a tragedy once again that has plagued and affected our country. It has to stop. We should not be adding to the problem by injecting tens of thousands of handguns onto our streets. Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will support the motion to instruct, and I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, first, I want to express my appreciation to the gentleman from Rhode Island. As he said, we make every effort to ensure that the support for the men and women who serve in the military is on a bipartisan basis. The gentleman from Rhode Island is a key leader on a number of those issues, whether it is cyber, directed energy, and a host of others. I appreciate all of the Members on both sides of the aisle who have spoken. That bipartisan support is what helped lead us to pass the House version of this bill by the biggest majority in 8 years. That does not mean we agree on everything, obviously, but when it comes to supporting the military, their interests are first, and I think we need to keep it that way. The subject of this motion to instruct is a longrunning program designed to support safety programs. While we have had votes on this on the floor and in committee over the years, it has never been a particularly controversial program, even though the gentleman from Rhode Island has consistently been against it from the start. But the point is that in both the House and the Senate bills this year, there are provisions dealing with these programs. We come to some resolution every year, and for 55 straight years the conference report has gotten signed into law. I would like to correct one point, Mr. Speaker. I do not believe that the Army is opposed to this program. As a matter of fact, both Mr. ROGERS and I have talked to the Army about this, and they have not expressed in any sense that they are opposed to it. They were waiting to see what direction they are given, and they are happy to go implement that. Mr. Speaker, in recent weeks, our country has been buffeted by a number of tragedies: hurricanes; of course, wildfires going on now in the West. And the horrible, horrific murders in Las Vegas are much on our minds, as are the victims and the whole communities. It is important to take time and to learn what that investigation yields so that we can, hopefully, prevent it from happening in the future. I just want to point out that there is nothing, whether these provisions stay or go, that is going to have any effect on an event like we just saw in Las Vegas. As a matter of fact, in the history of this program, I know of no single instance where one of these weapons that has been disposed of for gun safety programs has been used improperly. As a matter of fact, most of these weapons go up on a mantle somewhere. They are collectors items. So it would be inappropriate, in my opinion, to try to tie that horrible tragedy in Las Vegas, or others, to these particular programs. That leads me to the last point I would like to make, Mr. Speaker, and it is similar to the first. On a bipartisan basis, this House and, indeed, this Congress, come together to support the men and women who risk their lives to defend us. The world is getting more dangerous, and, unfortunately—the fault of both parties in both the executive and legislative branches of government—we cut our military too much. We are seeing the effects of that through declining readiness, through increasing accidents, and a whole variety of things where the fruits of that neglect is becoming more apparent. But I think it is crucial, as we begin to rebuild and repair our military, that we not let other agendas, other issues, impair our ability to do so. I am concerned, for example, that some Republicans say: Oh, yeah, I will increase funding for defense, as long as you can cut that money in other parts of the budget. I am concerned when Democrats say: Oh, I am for increasing defense, as long as you increase other parts of the budget. I am concerned when anybody brings any other agenda, any other issue, that impedes our ability to support the men and women who serve our Nation. We ought to do our best to support them on the basis of those issues alone and let other debates, whatever they may be, stand on their own as well. As I mentioned, Mr. Speaker, motions to instruct are, of course, nonbinding. I think, in this case, the better vote is to vote ‘‘no.’’ There are provisions dealing with this in both the House and the Senate bill. I hope that we can come to a reasonable conclusion on these provisions and the whole bill. But the goal is to defend the country and to support the men and women who serve. We can never be distracted from that goal. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired. Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to instruct. There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to instruct. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered.

ADJOURNMENT FROM THURSDAY, OCTOBER 12, 2017, TO MONDAY, OCTOBER 16, 2017 Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 10 a.m. on Monday next. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New Jersey? There was no objection. 
HONORING BRIAN M CQUEEN (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Brian McQueen, a constituent and a dear friend from the 22nd District who has dedicated his life to public service. For 34 years, Brian worked in the Whitesboro Central School District—as a teacher for 19 years and as a principal thereafter. Brian also took his compassion for our community to the Whitesboro Volunteer Fire Department, where he served as fire chief from 1999 to 2002. He currently serves as a lieutenant and safety officer, in addition to serving on the board of directors of the Firemen’s Association of the State of New York. In 2013, Brian was diagnosed with B cell nonHodgkin lymphoma. Brian joined members of the Barneveld Fire Department to found the Believe 271, a foundation to assist volunteer firefighters and EMTs who are battling cancer and lifethreatening diseases. Since that day, Believe 271 has provided financial and emotional support to firefighters and their families throughout Oneida and Herkimer Counties. With increased exposure to smoke and toxins, firefighters are at a much higher risk of contracting cancer. Brian’s tireless advocacy is a testament to his dedication and his compassion for all volunteer firefighters who risk their lives to keep our communities safe, and it is an honor to recognize my friend and a great community partner, Brian McQueen, today. 
REAUTHORIZING CHIP FUNDING (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, in New Jersey, nearly 231,000 children rely on the Children’s Health Insurance Program. CHIP gets them to the doctor. CHIP gets them to the hospital. CHIP saves their lives. But last month, Republican Members of Congress made a choice to put on another repealandreplace dog and pony show and let CHIP expire. Mr. Speaker, what do my Republican colleagues have against needy children? Who thought it would be a good idea to put 9 million children’s health at risk for political gains? So much for compassionate conservatism. Mr. Speaker, CHIP is vital to the Nation’s future. Along with Medicaid, CHIP has cut the rate of lowincome, uninsured children nationally by half— from 14 percent to 7 percent. But if Congress doesn’t immediately reauthorize longterm CHIP funding, children will not get to see their doctors. They won’t have access to hospitals, and some may die. f 
TAX REFORM (Mr. MITCHELL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MITCHELL. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of our framework for tax reform to put American workers and businesses first. I come from Michigan, and the last time our tax system was updated, Steve Yzerman was the captain of the Detroit Red Wings. Hockeytown is rebuilding, and it is about time our Tax Code was rebuilt. We have the opportunity to reform and reduce taxes for American workers and the small businesses that create jobs for those workers. America’s nearly 30 million small businesses are the engine of our economy, employing nearly 60 million workers, half of the United States workforce. But our current Tax Code is a monstrosity. When combined with State and local taxes, small businesses pay up to 50 percent of their income to the government. Polling indicates that small and midsize businesses would use their tax savings to invest in their businesses: opening new locations, upgrading equipment, and increasing hiring and wages. Tax reform is about rewarding work and prosperity for all Americans. Let’s get on with that work. 
DACA (Mr. TAKANO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, Delila is a graduate student at the University of California, Riverside, who exemplifies the American spirit. As a young woman, she worked two and three jobs to support her family and help her father, who was their sole provider. Three years ago, when her father suffered a stroke, Delila stepped up and kept the family afloat while he recovered. She went on to take a fulltime position as a sexual assault advocate in our community. Delila says that job allowed her to help those who live in fear and live without hope. This year, she will graduate with a master’s degree, and there is no question that she is destined to accomplish great things. The only question is where she will accomplish them. Delila is a DREAMer, and her future in this country depends on whether we pass the Dream Act. Once again, I am asking my colleagues to do the right thing. Pass the Dream Act so people like Delila can continue to make our communities proud. f 
THE HOLY CITY OF JERUSALEM (Mr. GAETZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. GAETZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today to support our friend and ally, Israel, and to stand for the obvious proposition that the people of Israel and the Jewish people have an ancient connection to the city of Jerusalem. This connection has been forged through millennia of shared faith and shared history, yet the U.N. is actually trying to rewrite history: They condemn Israel and call it an occupying power in Jerusalem; They prevent Israeli scientists from excavating, even though past findings have been significant to Christians, Muslims, and Jews alike; They have been silent when Israel’s culture has been attacked, including the desecration and burning of holy sites. Each year brings new horrors from the U.N. Their cruelty and attempts to erase history and their antiSemitism cannot be tolerated any longer. Today I am introducing a resolution reaffirming the connection of the Jewish people to the city of Jerusalem and condemning UNESCO’s attempts to punish and delegitimize Israel. I encourage my colleagues to show solidarity with Israel, to support the President’s removal of the United States from UNESCO, and to support this resolution I have proposed. 
CLEAN POWER PLAN (Mr. MCNERNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MCNERNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Clean Power Plan. This rule was intended to combat and mitigate the effects of climate change and create firstever limits to carbon pollution from U.S. power plants. As we deal with the devastation created by some of the strongest hurricanes in recorded history and the wildfires that are raging through Western States, we can’t stand idly by while 
this administration eliminates the Clean Power Plan, condemning future generations to scarce resources, harsher climates, and economic uncertainty. Extreme weather has cost the U.S. economy at least $240 billion over the past 10 years. Climate change increases the frequency and severity of extreme weather. Shouldn’t we focus on hardening and securing our infrastructure and making it more resilient to climate change? The Clean Power Plan would also reduce plant pollutants that cause asthma attacks and respiratory illnesses, and it is projected to prevent thousands of premature deaths, tens of thousands of asthma attacks, and provide at least $20 billion in total health benefits. The denial of science by this administration is alarming and dangerous. I urge my colleagues to stand up for clean energy and our environment and take positive action to address climate change. 
b1600 HURRICANE RELIEF BAILOUT (Mr. ROTHFUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. ROTHFUS. Madam Speaker, buried in today’s disaster supplemental spending bill is a $16 billion taxpayer bailout of the National Flood Insurance Program. That is nearly half the cost of this bill. This bailout does not come with a single reform that would put the program on the path to sustainability. This taxpayer bailout maintains a program that has resulted in taxpayer subsidized development and reconstruction of homes that repeatedly flood. Madam Speaker, why are we not reforming this program that puts residents and first responders in harm’s way? How much more debt are we willing to let this program pile onto the next generation? Americans in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands need help, and I would have liked to vote for the relief portion of today’s legislation, but the multibilliondollar taxpayer bailout of an unreformed program made the bill unacceptable. I urge my colleagues to reconsider the path we are on. We could have had a bill that not only provided relief to hurricane victims, but would have provided relief for taxpayers and the next generation as well, but we did not. We will get another chance for fiscal sanity in December, when we reconsider the additional disaster funding and funding for the rest of 2018. Let’s hope we make better progress at that time. 
TAX REFORM (Mr. GOTTHEIMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Madam Speaker, I rise today because I came to Washington to cut taxes for the residents of north Jersey. Our taxes are simply too high. This morning, at The Heritage Foundation, the Speaker claimed that the rest of the country is propping up New Jersey. That is backwards. Currently, New Jersey pays in so that States like Wisconsin can cash out. New Jersey is already a grand subsidizer of other States. We are one of the top 3 percent taxpaying districts in the entire country and at the bottom in what we get back. We need to change that. New Jersey only gets back 33 cents for every dollar we send to Washington. New Jersey residents get $3,076 less, as this shows, than what they pay in. West Virginia, for example, gets $4.23 back for every dollar it sends in. New Jersey is not America’s piggybank. Our one saving grace has been the State and local property tax deduction: the ability to deduct those higher State, local, and property taxes before we have to send in our tax checks every April. It allows us to avoid double taxation. Eliminating these State and local tax deductions will cost New Jersey an average of a $3,500 tax increase per resident. Property values will go down more than 10 percent. So I am fighting to remove this tax hike provision from the tax reform bill that can hurt our businesses and our citizens. f 
PROUD OF VIRGINIA’S ASSISTANCE TO DISASTERS (Mr. TAYLOR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, today, Congress approved the second tranche of emergency funding for those affected by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, and the wildfires in the Western United States. I would like to take a second and shine a light on Virginians who have stepped forward to help our fellow Americans impacted by these natural disasters. Just the other day, I pulled up to a restaurant in Virginia Beach, where there was a steady line of vehicles coming in the parking lot to drop off goods and essential items. Hundreds came together to give money and items for the people of Puerto Rico. From Hampton Roads to Richmond, to Roanoke, Virginia rose to the occasion. We had soldiers and sailors and coastguardsmen and civilians deploy forward to help in Florida, Texas, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. We had National Guardsmen, Spanish speakers, FEMA workers, EMS units, helicopters, drones, boats, and medical supplies, and much more. We should all be very proud of Virginia’s vast efforts, their leadership, and their compassion. Virginia has never been afraid to lead. f 
REOPENING OF PFEIFFER CANYON BRIDGE (Mr. PANETTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I am proud to rise today to recognize the reopening of the Pfeiffer Canyon Bridge in Big Sur, California. After 4 years of drought, my district on the central coast of California finally got the rain it needed, but a little too much. As a result, this year there were many largescale landslides, including this one, as we see here to my right, which knocked out the pilings of the Pfeiffer Canyon Bridge, causing this bridge to fail. This left a community of people isolated and numerous businesses without revenue for at least 8 months. But over that same amount of time, the people of Big Sur, the people and government of Monterey County, the engineers and construction crews, and the California Department of Transportation demonstrated a lot of grit, guts, determination, and dedication. They listened to each other and came together to fix this bridge. Tomorrow I will be able to attend the opening of this bridge. We will be able to show our pride for the record pace of construction, of government working together to get things done, the businesses that struggled but remained open in Big Sur during this time, and, most importantly, we will show our pride in the people of Big Sur and the communities on the central coast of California. 
UNIFIED SPAIN (Mr. FRANCIS ROONEY of Florida asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. FRANCIS ROONEY of Florida. Madam Speaker, I rise today as a member of the Spain Caucus to discuss why a unified Spain is both legally, culturally, and economically justified, and how it best serves United States foreign policy interests. First, the illegal Catalan independence referendum was held in violation of the Spanish constitution and in defiance of the federal government. Catalunya, as an autonomous region within Spain, enjoys many rights and privileges under the Spanish constitution, but selfdetermination is clearly not one of them. The historical and cultural ties between Spain and Catalunya are strong. Spain and Catalunya have a shared history, being united since the reign of Ferdinand and Isabel over 500 years ago, and later, under the governance of the Kingdom of Aragon, similar to how 
it is a part of the Kingdom of Spain today. Because of this history, Catalunya has a pluralistic society, with a mix of Spaniards and Catalans, and where both cultures’ languages are regularly spoken. Lastly, the deep economic ties Catalunya shares with Spain are evidence that Spain should be united. Catalunya relies heavily on Madrid for its financial sector, infrastructure, and its social security deficit. A united Spain is a friend of the United States. A strong, united Spain has been a reliable ally in fighting the spread of Islamic extremism. Our relationship with Spain is invaluable to our foreign policy interests, and we need to speak out on behalf of a unified Spain. 
HONORING 50TH COMPANY, INFANTRY OFFICER CANDIDATE SCHOOL CLASS OC 24–69 (Mr. BEYER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor a special group worthy of our recognition for the sacrifices they have made for our country. This month, the surviving members of the 50th Company, Infantry Officer Candidate School’s Class OC 24–69 will have their first reunion at Fort Benning, 48 years after pinning on the gold bars of second lieutenants. The men in the 50th Company came from 42 different States, representing all walks of life and backgrounds. They accepted the risks and volunteered to become Army officers at the height of the Vietnam war. After graduation, over half received orders to Vietnam. Two classmates made the ultimate sacrifice: James Du Pont and Thomas Edgren. Many others earned the Purple Heart. At the reunion in Fort Benning, these men will renew the bonds forged 48 years ago. Please join me in pausing to reflect on their sacrifices and extending them our thanks. 
CONGRATULATING ELIZABETH DENT (Mr. ADERHOLT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. ADERHOLT. Madam Speaker, today I rise to recognize the tremendous work of Elizabeth Dent, who has been an invaluable part of the staff of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture for the past 3 years. Elizabeth came to work with the subcommittee I chair after working several years with a former appropriator, Congressman Jack Kingston. Elizabeth has been a valuable member of the subcommittee team. She is diligent, dedicated, and keen to details, something that is very important to the appropriations work. She is always eager to volunteer and lend a hand to accomplish whatever tasks may be needed in assisting in the agricultural community. She has become an integral part of the team, and she will be greatly missed on our subcommittee. Elizabeth will be leaving the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture to work for the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Committee. I thank her for her outstanding work. The Senate Appropriations Committee is very fortunate to have her work on the staff. We wish her all the very best, and we look forward to working with her in her new capacity. f 
ACA BIRTH CONTROL MANDATE (Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Speaker, I rise today in defense of every woman’s access to healthcare and right to make her own personal healthcare decisions in private consultation with her physician and her family. Last week, President Trump issued a shameful executive order that will allow employers to deny women insurance coverage for contraception. This rolls back progress under the Affordable Care Act that required insurance companies to cover birth control without a copay. This is outrageous. Employers have no role dictating what healthcare women can and cannot have. That is a decision between a woman and her doctor. Nearly 9 in 10 women will use birth control at some point in their lives. This order is a direct attack on their healthcare. President Trump tried to sneak this change through, announcing it on a Friday afternoon before a long weekend. Well, we noticed and so did millions of other women that this order will adversely impact. We are paying attention and we are not about to stop speaking out and working to protect women’s access to healthcare. 
FALLEN TTU OFFICER FLOYD EAST, JR. (Mr. ARRINGTON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a fallen hero, Officer Floyd East, Jr. Officer East was a police officer for the Texas Tech University Police Department. On Monday, October 9, Officer East completed his final patrol to protect and serve. Officer East has been described by friends as someone you could rely on and someone who was always there to help or just listen. No doubt, he represented the very best of the values of Texas Tech. His loss reminds us that policemen and women put their lives at risk every day. He left behind a loving wife, Carmen, who generously allowed him to dedicate his life to keeping us safe. To his children, Ana and Monica: Our prayers are with you. Scripture tells us that ‘‘there’s no greater love than for a man to lay down his life for his friends.’’ That was God’s greatest gift to this world and that was your dad’s greatest gift. Our Red Raider family is behind you, and we will never forget Floyd and how he held the thin blue line. God bless your family. f 
ALDO’S STORY (Mr. SCHRADER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SCHRADER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to share the story of Aldo Solano of Woodburn, Oregon. Aldo was only 6 years old when his family first immigrated to the United States from Colima, Mexico. Economic distress, corruption, and a lack of opportunities pushed his parents to leave everything behind and head to the Willamette Valley. They wanted a different life for Aldo and his siblings, one where they could go to school and pursue their dreams. Aldo has done just that. At Woodburn High School, he served as vice president of his class. While earning good grades, he participated in sports and volunteer opportunities like 4–H Latino Summer Camp, encouraging young people to enter the STEM field. After graduating, Aldo became a DACA recipient. Through DACA, he has been able to work for the Latino Health Coalition, where he worked to pass Cover All Kids, a State law to ensure access to healthcare for every child in Oregon. This winter, he will begin working towards a public health degree at Portland State University. Without DACA, none of this would have been possible for Aldo. Young people across the country are relying on us. We need to pass a clean Dream Act that will recognize Aldo and over 800,000 DREAMers as equal members of our community. 
AMERICAN PHARMACISTS MONTH (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the month of October 2017 as American Pharmacists Month. During this month, I would like to recognize all pharmacists across America to ensure that Americans have access to important and often lifesaving medications. As the only pharmacist currently serving in Congress, I am proud to recognize the work that pharmacists are doing to promote a healthy America. Every day, pharmacists provide vaccines for a number of illnesses and 
carefully counsel patients on prescriptions and overthecounter medications to help heal sickness and reduce pain. Pharmacists are also considered one of the top two most trusted professions in America. During October, as well as throughout the year, I encourage everyone to visit your pharmacist, ask questions about your prescriptions, receive advice about preventative care, and get to know the person who provides your medicine and works to keep you healthy. Thank you, fellow pharmacists, for all that you do. Please know that your work is appreciated and you are an important part of keeping our Nation healthy. 
GUN SAFETY LEGISLATION (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, we are now a few days after the most violent and largest massacre in modern American history in Las Vegas, Nevada. Many that you encounter has a story, amazingly, about who was there during that week. They obviously were not at that site, but they may have been in Las Vegas for work or otherwise. It will be on the minds of Americans for a long time. Just this past Monday, I stood with Sheriff Acevedo, my chief of police, my sheriff, my constable; mothers who have lost loved ones and children; and a woman who had been abused and her significant other carried around a heavy weapon to scare her, threaten her, and abuse her. Why we can’t have gun safety regulation, I don’t know, but I believe after Sandy Hook and after Pulse nightclub, we must pass real gun safety legislation. We must ban assault weapons, ban the bump stocks. We must have universal background checks. Madam Speaker, it is a shame that we cannot save lives. We need gun safety now, not money in your pockets. 
b1615 OVERCOMING PROBLEMS WITH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT (Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I want to commend President Trump’s decision this week with executive orders to do some of the work we have been unable to do so far in the House and the Senate, helping people overcome the problems with the ACA, the Affordable Care Act. One of the measures he put forth was association health plans to allow employers’ employees to form health plans that suit them—indeed, to associate with their type of business, their type of industry on a small scale in their neighborhoods. It makes perfect sense, if you want to give people more choices. Also, shortterm, limitedduration health insurance plans, which allow people to have, if they are in between jobs, instead of limiting it to just 3 months, perhaps just a little longer. In the interim, while they are in between jobs, they have choices that they could afford with the elements in the plan they would like. Finally, health reimbursement arrangements, which make it where employees—if they want to provide benefits to their—employers to their employees, that they can reimburse for more issues in their plan, such as helping them pay for their premiums, if that is how the employee wishes to have that. Flexibility is what we need; choices are what we need; and then Congress needs to be able to accomplish something in the Senate so we can bring it back and give this to the American people. f 
RESPONSE TO THE REPUBLICAN TAX PLAN The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. TENNEY ). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from California (Mr. KHANNA ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. 
Mr. KHANNA. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. KHANNA. Madam Speaker, before my colleagues in the Congressional Progressive Caucus and I begin our discussion about the response to the Republican tax plan, I wish to take a moment to express our sympathy for the people of northern California who are facing devastating and destructive wildfires. I represent a Silicon Valley district where hundreds of our neighbors to our north and south remain missing. Tens of thousands are suffering at this very moment from the destruction of more than 150,000 acres and counting, as well as an increasing number of family homes and businesses. It seems that our Nation has been struck by one national tragedy after another. Our prayers are with the California residents, and I know that everyone in this body is committed to their relief. I also, on a personal note, want to recognize Liz Bartolomeo, who has been my communications director and worked very hard with the Congressional Progressive Caucus. She is going on to work for Democracy Alliance. I wish her very well in her next steps, and I thank her for her service to our office and to the Congressional Progressive Caucus. The purpose of this hour is to discuss the Republican economic plan, and I have distinguished colleagues of mine who will be joining us. I just want to, at the outset, articulate the basic difference in philosophy. The President and the Republicans believe that to grow our economy, to create jobs, the way to achieve that is by giving tax cuts to corporations, giving tax cuts to the investors in stock, giving tax cuts to the executives who already get large compensation packages; and that if we do that, if we cut corporate tax rates at a time where corporations are making record profits, if we give more tax breaks to those who are investing in our stock market, if we give more tax breaks to those who get dividend checks, then somehow, magically, people making 30 grand or 40 grand will see their wages go up, that somehow we are going to get many more jobs in places across this country. And the question is why would we believe that? Why would we think the trickledown economics, which has failed time and again, is going to help? Does someone really believe, in my district, who is a construction worker or a nurse or a teacher, that lowering the corporate tax rate is going to do anything to put more money in their pocket, that it is going to do anything for a nurse who is struggling to get an apartment and pay rent to be able to afford that rent, or that it is going to do anything for people in Youngstown, Ohio, to be able to send their kids to school or get vocational training or get a college education? The difference is very simple. Our belief is, if you want to raise wages—if you want to give more pay to average Americans, just go raise wages. Provide the tax credit to those making under $75,000. For onethird of the cost of the Republican tax plan, which is geared towards corporations and the investor class, we could give every single American, who is making under $75,000, a 20 percent pay raise. I believe that is bottomup economics, and that is actually what is going to grow the economy. It is not a matter of just the economics. It is a matter of common sense. Think about it. Who do you think is going to create more jobs in the United States? Someone worth 5 million bucks who gets tax money back and is going to invest in stocks? Or is that money going to create jobs in the United States? Or could that money be spent anywhere in the world, sheltered anywhere in the world? As opposed to if you give that money to someone making $50,000, $60,000, they are going to spend that money in their local community; they are going to buy more groceries; they are going to buy more things for their house; they are going to get more education; that money is 
going to go into the local economy, and it is going to actually create jobs. That is what is going to grow the economy. That is our only shot of getting 3 percent economic growth if we invest in actual workers, the people doing the work. By the way, they haven’t gotten a raise for the past 40 years. Since 1979, wages in this country have stagnated, and we heard the same thing: just cut the taxes on the top and the wages will go up. But the wages haven’t gone up. Guess who promised to help, finally, those forgotten Americans? Guess who promised to help them? President Donald Trump. That was his whole campaign: The stock market is doing great, but you are being left behind. The coasts are doing great, but you have been left behind. And I am going to come to the White House and I am not going to give the keys to the Wall Street bankers. I am going to actually worry about raising wages. His biggest disappointment as President is that he went back on the promise that he made to ordinary Americans, and we know that he can do it if he wants to. All he has to do is tell his Wall Street advisers: No, no more tax breaks for Wall Street. I want the tax credits going to Main Street, and I can do that at a third of the cost of the plan that you are selling to me and the American people. This is the debate in this country, supplyside economics that believes the greatness of America is with the investor class and the CEO class and the elite class, or bottomup economics that our party and the Progressive Caucus is putting forward that believes the greatness in America is with the people who actually do the work, who work 40, 50 hours, who go on the assembly lines and work in factories, who work overnight as nurses taking care of folks, who are doing the education as teachers. Who do we believe is really contributing to the economy? Who do we believe is really driving America’s economic growth? The Democrats believe it is ordinary workers across this country, that that is the greatness that drives the American economy, and the Republican tax plan believes it is the investor class. It is a very clear difference, and our commitment is not just one towards fairness but also one about investing in people who are going to create jobs and create innovation in this country. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN ), my distinguished colleague, who is not just a constitutional law professor and a leading thinker on issues of juris prudence but has also been a leader with the Congressional Progressive Caucus in helping us craft an economic policy that is really for ordinary Americans and not for just the very wealthy. Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman KHANNA for his leadership in putting this together. Madam Speaker, I want to invoke a great Republican member of this body who went on to become President of the United States, Abraham Lincoln, who spoke of ‘‘government of the people, by the people, for the people.’’ The tax plan that has been presented to us by the GOP in the 21st century is government of the 1 percent, by the 1 percent, and for the 1 percent. It was written by a billionaire Cabinet of a billionaire President for the richest 1 percent of taxpayers in the country. The same policy experts whose healthcare plan was to throw 30 million Americans off their health insurance and reduce women’s access to complete reproductive services now have a tax plan to sell America. But read the fine print first. In fact, you don’t even need to read the fine print. You just have to look at the headlines. Under this plan, 80 percent of the total tax cut will end up going to the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans who earn more than $900,000 a year. Let me repeat that: 80 percent of the money that will be saved in this tax cut will go to Americans earning $900,000 a year. That is astounding. In the meantime, tens of millions of middle class families making between $50,000 and $150,000 a year will pay higher taxes than they were paying before. And check this out. The very wealthiest sliver of Americans, those who make at least $5 million a year, and, on average, $16 million a year, would get an average tax cut of over $1 million. That is a $1 million tax cut for millionaires. The slogan for this plan should be: The Trump tax cut, because the rich just aren’t rich enough and everybody else is doing just fine. Madam Speaker, if you know anyone who makes $16 million a year, please ask them to write me and tell me what they are going to do with their extra $1 million. Maybe they will send it to a Swiss bank account or to the Bahamas; maybe they will run for Congress; maybe they will invest it in Australia where a lot of the superrich are apparently now buying property in order to have a getaway plan from the escalating crises of climate change in North America. b1630 So the billionaires make out like bandits. What about the rest of us? How much will this plan cost us? Well, the bipartisan Committee for Responsible Federal Budget’s initial analysis shows that the GOP plan would add $2.2 trillion to deficits over the next decade. This is the result of cutting taxes for the wealthy by a staggering $5.8 trillion and then adding new tax revenue of only $3.6 trillion, so we are going to be adding $2.2 trillion in deficits. What about the deficit hawks? They are an endangered species, as Congresswoman P ELOSI says now. Actually, they have mutated into a completely new species. We don’t have deficit hawks anymore. We have deficit ostriches. They are willing to squawk and strut and kick dust like hawks when there is a Democrat in the White House, but when a budgetbusting, deficitballooning, debtdeepening Republican occupies the White House and proposes inflating the deficit and the debt to unprecedented levels with the most breathtaking fiscal recklessness anyone has ever seen, they become deficit chicken hawks and transmogrify into deficit doves, and then finally turn into fast scurrying deficit ostriches and run away from everything they have been saying for years about the necessity to reduce the deficit, they simply bury their heads deep in the sand and let the debt and the deficits climb up all around them. Speaker PAUL RYAN, when he was campaigning with Mitt Romney, said the national debt is threatening jobs today, it is threatening our prosperity today. Senate Majority Leader MITCH MCCONNELL , while calling for changes to Social Security and Medicare in 2013, told supporters only one thing can save this country, and that is to get a handle on the deficit and debt issue. Well, that was then, this is now, as they say. Now the GOP leaders are twisting arms to vote for a tax plan that will blow up the deficit and drive our children and our grandchildren’s generations deeply into debt. What happened to all of the fine speeches we heard about how we owe it to our kids not to engage in deficit spending? What happened to all the magnificent oratory about how the national debt is a moral crisis? Can any of the Members of Congress, who built their careers on the principle of deficit reduction and ending the debt, explain why it is responsible today to add more than $2 trillion to our national deficit? We await an answer, Madam Speaker. Why are they doing this to America? Why are they proposing it? Who wins with this assault on the common good? Well, let’s see. Donald Trump and his family certainly do. The only President who ever bragged that he would be able to make money by running for President is showing what a good job he is actually doing at achieving his objective. A New York Times analysis shows that Trump and his family could save more than $1 billion under this plan. That is right, the President and his family could save more than $1 billion under the tax proposal that has been sent to us in Congress. Of course, it is impossible to know precisely how much would be saved because President Trump, despite his campaign promise to release his tax returns, if elected, still refuses to release his tax returns, which constitutes not only a radical breach of faith with the people, but a radical break from past practices of other Presidents for the last half century, who have opened up their tax records for the rest of us to see. But let’s see what we can do based on information we know. This proposal 
would eliminate the estate tax, which would generate massive tax savings for President Trump and his family. If his assets, reportedly valued at $2.86 billion, were transferred after his death under today’s rules, his estate would be taxed at around the 40 percent level, still leaving his heirs with more than $1 billion. Repealing the Federal estate tax, which they propose to do, would save his family $1.1 billion, at least, in estate tax costs. Why would we do this? The Founders of our country were passionately opposed to hereditary wealth, just like they were passionately opposed to hereditary government. They thought it was dangerous to have the intergenerational transmission of wealth and great fortunes like that. They said that it would cause idleness and irresponsibility in the heirs to great wealth, and they would be able to convert their wealth not just into bigger estates, bigger land purchases, bigger houses, but actually in the public offices. They had a very profound democratic critique of that kind of intergenerational wealth inequality, because, at a certain point, you have bought enough houses, you have bought enough jets, and now you want a governorship, you want the Presidency, you want a Senate seat. In a democracy, we need to have much reduced levels of inequality that are being proposed under this idea of abolishing the estate tax. They also are proposing to abolish the alternative minimum tax, which is the only reason that President Trump paid any taxes in the one year over the last two decades that we know he paid taxes in, in 2005. Remember, somebody mysteriously leaked information about that year to the Rachel Maddow show, and it turned out that the President paid taxes because of the alternative minimum tax which says that you can’t push a good joke too far, you can only use all of your deductions and allowances, and so on, up to a certain point. If you are at a certain place, in terms of your wealth, you have got to pay something. Well, The New York Times now estimates that the GOP tax plan to repeal the alternative minimum tax would save the President at least $31.3 million. He would not have had to pay in that one year that we know where he paid taxes, and we don’t know about the rest because he has refused to release it. And let’s just look at one more provision, which would change the treatment of passthrough business income. According to The New York Times, President Trump could save as much as $6.2 million on business income and $9.8 million on income from real estate and other kinds of partnerships under changes to the taxation of pass through income. Now, look, Madam Speaker, nobody likes paying taxes, nobody loves it, especially when we know that there are billions of dollars being wasted, for example, at the Department of Defense in boondoggles, fraud, and abuse taking place, according to a hearing that we had just this session in the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. So people don’t love the experience. But just as Oliver Wendell Holmes said, that he didn’t mind paying his taxes because he understood that they were the price of civilization. It is what we all put in, in order to have roads and highways and airports and schools and universities. That is what it means to be a citizen. People don’t mind, as long as there is a basic sense in the public that everybody is participating and we are not getting ripped off. And I am terrified that if they succeed in barreling this plan through Congress, that it is going to spread more cynicism and more disenchantment and more negativity about the tax system and about the government, and we can’t afford it. Because of the escalating crises of climate change, which are all around us, our people are suffering. We have millions of people in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands tonight who have no access to power, no access to electricity or clean water. We have people in Florida and Texas and Mississippi and Louisiana who are still recovering from the last hurricanes. We have Californians, many of whom have died already, who are struggling against the forest fires out of control. Now is a point when we need a tax system that brings our people together, that says that wealthier people can pay more because they are wealthy, but everybody is going to pay their share, and we are all going to participate together. That is the tax system we should be looking for, a tax system where we get rid of all of the special interest inflected deductions and allowances and loopholes and ripoffs that are built into the system, where it is simplified. In the European countries, you can pay your taxes in about 10 or 15 minutes, and you don’t have to go to the multibilliondollar tax preparation industry, or go find a law firm to do it. We can simplify our taxes if we decide to get rid of all of the special interest loopholes. And wealthy people can pay more because they get more out of being part of this society, and they use more of the infrastructure of the country, instead of paying less than everybody else, instead of trying to rip off the system by paying nothing. Madam Speaker, now is the time when we need the wisest and most principled leadership to get us through the accumulating crises of the time. This tax plan is totally irresponsible. I hope that it will be withdrawn and we can work together across the aisle on a bipartisan plan that will represent the best values of government of the people, by the people, for the people. Madam Speaker, I thank my distinguished colleague from California for allowing me this opportunity. Mr. KHANNA. Madam Speaker, I thank Representative RASKIN for his thoughtful points and comments on the President’s tax policy. I have a few other points before we conclude. The President has said that we can’t afford foreign aid given our deficits, but the President thinks that the average American doesn’t know math. Mr. President, the average American can do math. The deficit is $20 trillion. Our foreign aid every year is no more than $30 billion to $40 billion. Your proposal would increase the deficit between $200 billion to $500 billion. So this red herring that somehow foreign aid is responsible for the deficit is just false. What is responsible for the deficit is the massive tax cuts that you are proposing that would add, according to conservative economists, between $2 trillion to $5 trillion more to our deficit, and it is all to finance the corporate interests, all to finance the investor class. We have, on the Democratic side, on the progressive side, proposed an alternative, and that alternative is based on the view that we need to encourage job creation and raise wages for mainstream America, that we need to invest in the people actually doing the work. It is based on the thinking of people who used to be Republicans and people like Jack Kemp, who said: Let us invest in areas that don’t have jobs and economic growth and have heavy investment for training on the technologies of the future. That used to be the thinking on the other side of the aisle. We used to have differences, but there used to be creativity and a sense of what is actually going to invest in people to grow the economy. And now, under this President, it is just a mantra of tax cuts for the very wealthy, tax cuts for the people who need it least, tax cuts for corporations, no sense of actually investing in new industries, investing in the training and skills of the 21st century, investing in bringing capital to places that need them. I hope and believe that as people in good faith will look at the two contrasting proposals, one that says tax cuts for corporations, the other that says let’s invest in American workers, let’s invest in American communities, that they will conclude that the way to actually raise wages, the way to actually create jobs, the way to actually grow our economy is by bottomup economics by investing in the American workers and in those Americans who are part of the middle class. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. 
b1645 ISSUES OF THE DAY The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. G OHMERT ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, it has been an interesting number of days here this week. We continue to have hearings and fight for good legislation, and we continue to hear from people back home that we simply must at least work on our promises to repeal ObamaCare and bring their health insurance into a realm that is affordable. They realize they were lied to. They will never get the insurance they liked back. They would like to try to get their doctors back. One of the interesting things about the design of the devious architect of ObamaCare is the guy who bragged later: Yeah, we knew you couldn’t keep your insurance, you couldn’t keep your doctor, but we had to say that to sell it. They actually incentivized the handful of remaining insurance companies not to put the best cancer healthcare providers in their network. ObamaCare actually incentivizes insurance companies not putting the best heart healthcare providers or, in fact, any chronic, expensive disease that the insurance companies, because of the design of ObamaCare—and I think it was intentional—basically were penalized if they put the very best cancer treaters, heart treaters in their network. So there actually are indications that insurance companies, they could see what the administration was encouraging them to do. For example, I had read that MD Anderson was not in those networks as a cancer provider. Some would argue it is the best cancer treatment facility. That certainly can be debated. I think it still comes down to the effort to get to the point where government is completely in charge of every American’s healthcare. ObamaCare was a good start, but obviously if you design a system so that the insurance companies, they just get down to a handful of monopolies and they are having record years, and that same bill even allows those insurance companies to get what are called bailouts after they have had record profits, well, most people are going to end up hating the insurance companies. And we have seen that. What would happen, of course, is eventually people get so outraged with premiums going up, whether it is 10 percent or 70 percent—I have heard of it being doubled, being tripled since the last 7 years. I have heard all kinds of horror stories from people in east Texas. Around other places I have visited, it is the same thing happening. They can’t afford their policy, yet they can’t afford to pay an extra tax for not having a policy that the government says they have to have; and yet if they pay for their policy, the deductible is so high, they are still not going to get any benefit out of it. So it is easy to see, when you start looking at the way in which ObamaCare was created, the rules in place for it, the day would come when people got so outraged at how expensive their health insurance was that they would scream: Look, I just can’t stand it anymore. I never wanted the government to be in charge of my personal life, but anything’s got to be better than the current system. Just let the government take it over. Then, there you are, government controlling everybody’s body, everybody’s personal life. Of course, we have got this Consumer Financial Protection Bureau out there created during the Obama years by the Democrats. We were not helpful in that. We thought, sure, we want to help people who are being taken advantage of by unscrupulous lenders, but we don’t need a Bureau to monitor everybody’s debit and credit card transactions. There were those who argued: Yeah, but this way, they can monitor and they can tell if somebody’s being taken advantage of. There was a time, as a felony judge in Texas, that, if someone wanted your bank records, under the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution, we are supposed to be protected from unreasonable searches and seizures, and that includes anyone’s bank records. So people would come to me as a judge, they would have affidavits, and they hoped that would prove under oath probable cause that a crime had been committed and that this person committed it, and if so, I could sign the warrant that allowed them to go get bank records. We used to care about the Fourth Amendment. I know my friends across the aisle, our Democratic friends, they cared greatly, because I have heard over and over in Judiciary Committee arguments about the protections against unreasonable searches, and yet they set up a Bureau that violates that, says: Just give us all your information. Well, sure, if somebody is being taken advantage of by an unscrupulous lender, then the remedy is they go complain to the appropriate government law enforcement or the SEC, whoever it is, and then they come to a judge like I was, get the warrant, get the records, and then make the determination if there is probable cause. We just lost so much of our privacy. Several years ago, we said, well, since ObamaCare is going to allow the mass gathering of people’s medical records and our Democratic friends set up this consumer protection racket here in Washington, we could conceivably have a day—and if we don’t do something about ObamaCare and the CFPB, then it is closer than I imagined—when you get your mail, Madam Speaker, and you see: Oh, I have got a letter from the government here. And you open it, and it says: We noticed, when you were at Brookshire’s grocery store the other day, that you bought a pound of bacon; and we also noticed, from your healthcare records, that your cholesterol rate is at this certain level, and so, therefore, since we control your healthcare now and we monitor your debit and credit purchases, here is the deal: you are either going to join a health club and start working out once a week and stop buying bacon, or we are going to have to raise the amount you pay in each month. I mean, this is where it goes when you have the Orwellian Big Brother that was advanced more through ObamaCare than anything that has ever occurred in U.S. history. It has got to be repealed. I want to applaud and thank President Trump for taking steps today through executive order. He shouldn’t have had to do that. I am very, very grateful he did. God bless him for doing it. But we should have already taken care of that stuff. That is our job. What do we do here in the House? It was contentious. The first bill was a disaster, but we got it to where it actually was going to bring premiums down for the middle class in America. It was going to make their premiums cheaper. It was going to make their deductibles lower. Then we had people in the Senate who got elected on the promise of repealing ObamaCare that voted ‘‘no.’’ We still have to do something. I loved seeing the President’s interview with our good friend, Sean Hannity, last night. I love this about President Trump. I think it is why he got elected. When Sean asked him about, basically, is this over, he gets this smile and says: No. We are not giving up, not giving up. The truth is we cannot give up. People are counting on us. They don’t know what to do. There are smallbusiness employers like the one in Tyler who told me that a few years ago he was paying $50,000 for his employees’ health insurance. He has the same number of employees, and this year it is $153,000, and he is going to have to start letting people go or drop their insurance. It just cannot continue. People are already taking losses. It can’t continue. Well, with the proper President in place, and here in Congress we have taken some steps to ameliorate some of the damage to jobs in America, things seem to be turning around some. But we actually have to keep our promise, and I think we do that by putting a lot more heat on the Senate as the House body, House Republicans. We have got to put pressure on the Senate. Like the President said, this fight cannot be over. Normally, I have been told since my freshman term, you can’t do big things in an election year. But I am beginning to wonder, if America makes it clear to the Republicans in the Senate that you either will keep your promise on ObamaCare, you will keep your promise on tax reform or you will not be back in the Senate, then I think we could buck tradition in this place. The idea was that we were told back in 2006, in January: Okay. Well, we didn’t keep any of our promises last 
year as the Republican majority, but now, you veterans know we are into an evennumbered year. That means it is an election year, so we can’t do any of those big things, because everybody knows you just can’t do big things in an election year or you might lose. Well, it would have been a lot better if we had already done those things, if we had repealed ObamaCare and put a system in place that was affordable, that gave people the healthcare they needed and with actual insurance and encouraged, instead of spending $700, $800, $900, sending it to the insurance company, how about putting $700, $800 in your own medical health savings account you control, debitcard coded where it can only be spent on healthcare, whether it is crutches, medicine, doctor visits, hospital stays, whatever, and you could have a high deductible. We could have a day where $700 goes to your account, $200 goes for catastrophic coverage. That is the kind of thing that we should have been pushing for and gone to, but, instead, we are pouring that money into health insurance companies. Just in case, Madam Speaker, there are those who are already wondering, ‘‘Maybe we should just let the government take over everything; that has got to be better,’’ I heard on the news again today another horror story. Just when you thought the VA was being cleaned up, here comes another horror story. Some doctor at the VA was allowed to do 80someodd surgeries that were unnecessary, inappropriate, or terribly done, even surgeries not even needed at all, on the wrong person, but it had been covered up for some time. Well, when the government is in charge of your healthcare, you can’t expect any more than the lowest common denominator in the government. I am very, very grateful we do have some good doctors, some good nurses in the VA, but I have also talked to good doctors and nurses in the VA who are so frustrated with such an albatross of a system. b1700 Why not just let people—if you want to go to the VA clinic, here is your card, you go. We thought we were doing a good thing, and I think it was a step in the right direction when we were going to allow veterans to go to a civilian clinic, hospital, healthcare provider if there was not one within a minimum number of miles. I believe it was 40, but I have heard horror stories about how people have been jerked around and not been allowed to utilize the program as it was designed. Here, again, we come back to what you get when the government is in charge. We have got to do that. Stuart Varney was asking today again about tax reform. We promised it. We have got to deliver on that. These rumors I hear emanating from people at the Senate side of this building that: Yeah, well, the House can do the reform. They did their ObamaCare repeal and we didn’t pass that, so maybe we won’t do their tax reform package like we are working on. It takes a lot of work to pass a major reform like we did on ObamaCare. It takes even more work, perhaps, to do a significant tax reform package where it becomes simplified, people pay less tax, the economy explodes. You would think it would be a nobrainer, but apparently there are too many people up here with no brains and it is not getting done. We do have to do that. We promised we would. We have got to do it for the sake of the economy that will make people’s lives so much better. But in the meantime, if we are going to be an effective Congress, we have got to make sure that we maintain proper systems in place that we can do our business without inappropriate outside influence, whether it is coming from Russia or Pakistan. Wherever it is coming from, we need to know and we need to protect ourselves. That is why this Taxed Enough Already Caucus meeting we had, we invited people in the tradition of my friend Tim Huelskamp, the former chair of that caucus from Kansas. Just a great guy, a great American. It was great to talk to him recently. Tim started with this caucus having representatives of outside groups with important information we should share coming in and having Members of Congress come in and share information, figure out how we can help get the Nation’s business done. We have been concerned about articles we continue to read, especially by Luke Rosiak of The Daily Caller. No one has done more investigation on the issue of the Awan family cohorts that were working here on Capitol Hill for House Members. They happened to be Democratic House Members. I think the same thing could happen where one Republican could say, ‘‘Oh, these folks are great,’’ and before you know it, you have dozens of people having the same IT computer workers working part time. People are allowed to do that, hire somebody part time so it doesn’t overwhelm your budget. Others can hire them part time, but under no circumstances can anybody working on the Hill make more than around $160,000. We found out this week from the lead investigator, oh, not law enforcement, oh, no. FBI, apparently they are not getting anything done, and I will explain why in a moment. But as he has gone around and investigated and asked witnesses questions that have direct information about what is going on, Luke Rosiak would also ask: Has anyone from the FBI talked to you, or has any law enforcement talked to you? He said 80 percent of the time the answer is no. No one from the FBI has talked to me. No one from any law enforcement has talked to me. Staggering. I hear rumors that there are people from the FBI telling the Department of Justice: Yeah, we have looked into it. There is nothing there. Yeah, just the way the FBI looked into the notice from Russia that the Tsarnaev older brother had been radicalized. What do they do? I know because I have asked Director Mueller after he had run off thousands of years of our best experienced FBI agents, done more damage to the FBI than anybody since Hoover. He has got plenty of young aggressive people without enough experience to call him out when he was making mistakes, as he made many. They send out an FBI agent to talk to the older Tsarnaev after the second notice from Russian agents that this guy has been radicalized. He is going to be a threat. But because Director Mueller—now Special Counsel Mueller, who is hiring lawyers and investigators right and left—built up a beautiful, comfortable nest for himself, that same Mueller, as Director of the FBI, had the FBI training materials on radical Islamists purged of anything that might offend radical Islamists. Yes, he was more concerned about the little lunches and dinners he had with CAIR—or the Council of AmericanIslamic Relations—than he was about people being killed in Boston, because if he had, he would have made sure that the Tsarnaev brothers were properly investigated after they got two headsup. If they had bothered to look, they would have seen where the older Tsarnaev went and would have known he went to a hotbed of radicalism. They would have known to investigate: What has he been reading? What scriptures from the Koran has he been reading? What has he talked about? Is he doing more memorization? What is his appearance looking like now? Who is he hanging out with? But no. Because he was too concerned about what he called the outreach program to Islamic Americans, he didn’t want to offend anybody. He was more worried about offending somebody than saving the lives and limbs of Bostonians. He created a massive problem at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and now we are turning special counsel over to this man? We heard from Mr. Comey himself that he talked to Mueller even before his testimony before Congress. We heard from he himself that he leaked information that was clearly FBI information that should not have been leaked. So there is a question of did he commit a crime, or did he just commit a breach of FBI ethics? What action should be taken? Oh, no. We have got FBI Director Mueller on the case, and if you go back and look at the Washingtonian back in 2013, they did a big expose on how wonderful Mr. Comey was; and they point 
out in there that, gee, basically if the whole world were on fire, Comey knew there would be one person that would still be standing with him there to protect him, Mr. Mueller; the same guy that is protecting him instead of investigating the leaks that have come from the FBI that appear to have gone through the exact same person through whom he leaked what he admitted. But, no, we have got Mueller, the same man who is going to be there through thick and thin to protect Comey; he is the one investigating. If Jeff Sessions as Attorney General cannot investigate Mr. Comey and his violations, potential breaches of the law, then we need another special counsel, and it sure ain’t going to come from Mr. Rosenstein, that is for sure. We need a special counsel. I think the Attorney General could do it, but I am not sure the extent to which he has recused himself. But this has to be investigated. Unfortunately, because of the damage done to the FBI, I still have questions arise on things they investigate because I know the damage that Mueller did to their training materials, to their ability. As one of our intelligence agents explained, we have blinded ourselves of the ability to see our enemies. But don’t worry, the guy that was the biggest blinder is now the special counsel growing his little bureaucracy. And I am sure, knowing how vengeful he is, when he hears what I have had to say, then he probably will open an investigation on me. That is just how vengeful this man has been. But the truth is the truth. He damaged the FBI, running off thousands of years of experienced people. He purged the training materials that would have—and Michele Bachmann and I went through these, and another Congressman from Georgia went through some, and there were some things, sure; cartoon stuff, sure; take them out, fine. But there were some things in there very clearly that every FBI agent needs to know to help them spot a radical Islamist, and Mueller blinded them of the opportunity to do that. I will never forget, at one of our hearings, after it was so clear that he was more concerned about offending CAIR than he was of protecting Boston, and he was so defensive, I said: You didn’t even go to the mosque where Tsarnaev went to see if he had been radicalized. After fumbling around, I finally got him to tell me how he thought that was wrong, and he said: We did go to the mosque. And I didn’t hear it at first. Unfortunately, I didn’t hear it until I had it played on the video. He said: We did go to that mosque in our outreach program. Oh, the outreach program. Yeah, you didn’t go to investigate Tsarnaev to find out if he had been radicalized by asking questions in the mosque where he worshipped to find out if he was now acting like a radical. And there are clear indications. That is why we don’t have to worry about most Muslims, but you sure need to know what you are looking for. For those that want to call people like me an Islamophobe, well, it is another lie. But there are plenty of lies around Washington. I have got enough Muslim friends in the Middle East and Afghanistan and other countries. They know they don’t want radicals. I am so proud of the President of Egypt, el Sisi, a man who would stand before imams and tell them: We have got to get our religion back from the radicals. That is a courageous great man. We owe him a lot of help. So what do we have here on Capitol Hill? We had guys that apparently never had a background search. And as we found out from the investigator for The Daily Caller, there were actually three or more months of the year when Imran Awan would be in Pakistan doing his job, supposedly making sure Capitol Hill computers were secured. We find out that there was suspicion when they saw this Imran Awan clan. His wife got involved. As we heard, when they would get up to the maximum amount one person could make on Capitol Hill, they would add another family member, and then they would get up to $160,000; add another family member, get them up; add another family member. And apparently all of these people didn’t work. b1715 The people that had a lot of experience working at McDonalds probably didn’t have that much experience on computers, but he was still making $160,000 or so a year and, we find out— I had no idea, just this week found out—they were able to gain $6 million to $7 million from the House of Representatives’ budget. And we find out, gee, one of them, had gotten $100,000 from an individual with known ties to Hezbollah, and we don’t know for what reason, but clearly never came to Capitol Hill. He was put on the payroll of the U.S. House of Representatives, the guy that was owed $100,000 with ties to Hezbollah, and made over $200,000 or so before he was taken off the payroll. That is a good way to pay back a loan, isn’t it? So we had Imran Awan; Hina Alvi, his wife; Abid Awan; Jamal Awan; Rao Abbas; and possibly a couple of others we found out—just incredible that this kind of thing could happen. But the suspicion grew when he was supposed to be working on the computer system of Congressman, now attorney general in California, Becerra. No indication Becerra knew anything was wrong, but people here on the Hill watching this saw there have been 5,700 accesses to his computer system and 5,400, at least, were not from people who should have been getting into his computer system. Then we find out, actually, he downloaded other Members of Congress’ servers completely onto Becerra’s server, and, actually, he had 2 terabytes of information that he said was for their child’s homework—a little child’s homework taking 2 terabytes. But we also know, apparently, from what came out this week, he was downloading dozens of Members’ computers onto one server so that anybody he wanted to could access any of that information. Now, there is no indication that classified information was revealed through the access to all these computer systems by people who were not hired by that Member of Congress. But we also know—I mean, General Petraeus, I read somewhere that it was actually a calendar that he gave to the lady who was to do a book, that he was having an affair with, that had some stuff that was considered classified. Well, on every Member’s computer system, you get their calendar, you get all their email, you get all their appointments, things that are going on in the office, you get reactions to people who come in over different bills, you get reaction to different things that have been learned in the intelligence community. There are all kinds of things that people would pay a lot of money for. Then we find out, you had a bankruptcy in the Awan history, you had domestic violence in the history, and now we find out this week, newly reported, that his wife is now upset. We can maybe get some answers now that she is upset because, now, she has found out that not only was he being corrupt to the banks here in the United States and on Capitol Hill, but he also, without his wife’s knowledge, married another lady. So that may help bring his first wife around to giving us more information about just how bad things got. But the report was, this week, investigators with the IG’s office here on Capitol Hill have been quietly tracking the five IT workers—that is, the Awan group—their digital footprints for months. They were alarmed by what they saw. The employees, the Awans, appeared to be accessing congressional servers without authorization, an indication that they ‘‘could be reading and/or removing information,’’ according to the documents distributed at the previously unreported private briefings. So I know that there are people who have reported here on Capitol Hill, well, it is being looked into, but there is no evidence of crime. Really? Because we have also learned that there may have been hundreds of vouchers filed falsely for, say, an $800 iPad. But if you say that it is under $500, then it doesn’t go in the inventory, and it is easier to steal and sell, for example, hypothetically, in Pakistan, where there are reports that he sent technological systems and sold them to make extra money. We know that he was not truthful and honest in his financial disclosures. 
That can be a crime. But just one voucher where you claim something only cost $490 and the server system cost $310 when you know that item actually cost $800 and should go into the inventory, that could be a crime. It appears that happened countless times, but we need to be trying to count anyway. We know that there were many pieces of computer equipment found at his home after FBI agents said his wife appeared to be fleeing, to not come back, even though she had a trip back. We don’t know what representations have been made to get her to come back, but we know that the tenants who leased the house where they fled from had been threatened by Imran Awan’s lawyer for allowing law enforcement to have access to that computer equipment that was there at his house. Hard drives appeared to be destroyed so they could not be properly investigated. We got a report that one of the group appeared to be home most of the time and was not here in Washington, D.C. But what a great gig, when you can make $160,000 a year for servicing computer equipment. And it appears all of these five, six, seven people in this group didn’t have competence to do computer or IT work, yet they were sure making a good living doing it. But for those who continue to say ‘‘we just don’t think there is much there,’’ all that should tell you is the report by Luke Rosiak, of all the witnesses to this whole sordid matter, only about 20 percent of them have ever been interviewed by FBI or law enforcement. It tells you somebody around here in this town, this Hill, somebody does not want to get to the bottom of this. If law enforcement wants to get to the bottom of this, they will get to the bottom of it. Kind of like Benghazi, if we really wanted to get to the bottom of it, we would do like Judicial Watch and be relentless till we got to the bottom of it. We haven’t gotten there yet. So, Mr. Speaker, there is a lot that needs to be investigated, a lot that needs to be done. We need—somebody, sounds like, needs to be investigating Mr. Mueller, but certainly needs to be investigating the various leaks that appear to have come from Mr. Comey through the same sources as the one he admitted. That has got to be investigated. And Mueller can’t do it and, apparently, the current Attorney General can’t. We have got to have somebody appointed to get to the bottom of what was happening at the DOJ during last year when an election was going on. We need to have an investigation to thoroughly get into this matter of having a U.N.—our representative to the U.N. is unmasking American information. We were assured that kind of thing would not happen if we would just reauthorize that program: Oh, no, no. If there are Americans who happen to be incidentally picked up by the monitors, the wiretap, by listening in on conversations, look, if there is an American, we mask the name. You can’t just get that. You are protected. It is minimized. Well, we find out that wasn’t true, that anybody that wants to go skipping and looking into any political opponents can do that if you are corrupt enough. And if you are corrupt enough and you have corrupted other people, then it won’t be investigated. Maybe there are things other people around here don’t want found out, but it is time we cleaned up the mess that has been left here, we clean up the wiretapping capability. It is coming up for reauthorization here. It has got to be done before the end of December, and I still need a lot of answers before I could even consider doing that. In the meantime, Mr. Speaker, we have got to help the American people by keeping our promises. I yield back the balance of my time. 
HUMAN RIGHTS IN PAKISTAN AND SINDH The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. ARRINGTON ). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. SHERMAN ) for 30 minutes. Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank you for yielding me 30 minutes, more than enough time to deliver three separate speeches that I have prepared for presentation. The first two are informed, or two of these speeches are informed. The first and the third are informed by my 20 years of experience on the Foreign Affairs Committee, and the second speech I will deliver is informed by 40 years as a CPA in the world of taxation. Mr. Speaker, I am the ranking member on the Asia and the Pacific Subcommittee and the founder of the Sindh Caucus. In those two roles, I have focused on human rights and the rule of law in Pakistan, and particularly in its perhaps largest province, Sindh, comprising most of southern Pakistan. We have dedicated ourselves in the Sindh Caucus to efforts to preserve the culture and the language of the Sindhi people, and particularly their dedication to religious tolerance. Unfortunately, the human rights picture in Pakistan and in Sindh are not good. I would like to say a few words about the disappearance of Punhal Sario, the leader of the Voice for Missing Persons of Sindh movement, and about the very serious problem of disappearances in Sindh in southern Pakistan. Just this past summer, Punhal Sario led a march between Sindh’s two major cities, Hyderabad to Karachi, demanding accountability for Sindhi activists who have been abducted by Pakistani security forces or simply disappeared. Where is Punhal now? It appears that he, too, has fallen victim to the very serious forces that he marched against. b1730 Punhal’s case is hardly an isolated one. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan reported that over 700 people disappeared, were kidnapped, and never heard of again in Pakistan in the year 2016 alone. In the past year, the United Nations Human Rights Committee, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and the State Department’s own Report on Human Rights have all noted serious concerns about extrajudicial and targeted killings and disappearances in Pakistan and, particularly, in Sindh. Elements of the government or military see an opportunity to simply make their opponents disappear. Here are a few particulars. In 2016, Amnesty International reported that the Pakistani security forces had, and these are their words, ‘‘committed human rights violations with almost total impunity.’’ While Human Rights Watch observed that, ‘‘law enforcement and security agencies remained unaccountable for human rights violations.’’ The State Department itself noted in Pakistan, ‘‘the most serious human rights problems were extrajudicial and targeted killings disappearances, torture, the lack of the rule of law.’’ Two years ago, in 2015, Sindhi leader Dr. Anwar Laghari was brutally murdered in Pakistan. Days before his death, he had sent a memorandum to President Barack Obama about human rights violations by the Pakistani military and its ISI, the InterServices Intelligence, agency, an important part of the Pakistani military. I attended a memorial service for Dr. Laghari here in Washington and have come to know of his work for human rights for the Sindhi people of southern Pakistan. The Pakistani Government has not been responsive to numerous inquiries into the reason for Dr. Laghari’s death and for why his perpetrators have not been brought to justice. Two months ago, on August 18, I sent a letter to the Acting Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs and the U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan expressing strong concerns about human rights violations of the Pakistani Government in Sindh. Six of my House colleagues—three Democrats and three Republicans—joined me in that effort. There are other human rights concerns in Pakistan that I should also bring to the attention of this House. The people of Sindh face religious extremist attacks. ISIS, for example, claimed responsibility for an attack on a Sufi shrine in Sindh that killed 80 people. Yet the government has not acted to protect religious minorities and, in general, has not acted to protect the people of Sindh from Islamic extremism. In addition, in Sindh, there are forced conversions of Sindhi girls belonging to minority communities. 
While the numbers are unclear, reports suggest that every year perhaps 1,000 girls and young women in Pakistan, including many in Sindh, are forcibly converted upon a marriage, not of their choice, to Muslim men. The Pakistani Government has not done enough to stop this practice, and reform measures have been circumvented and not enforced. Human rights abuses of this type cannot go unanswered. Activists disappear under suspicious circumstances. It is our obligation to speak out and demand accountability. These disappearances and other violations of human rights should be a major topic of conversation in all bilateral discussions between our government and the government in Islamabad. 
Mr. SHERMAN. Now, Mr. Speaker I would like to move on to a second speech, one dealing with the tax proposal of the Trump administration. The provisions I would like to focus on chiefly are those involving taking away the deductions, the itemized deductions that so many Americans take to reduce their tax liability. Now, these deductions are eliminated on the theory that, oh, they just go to the wealthy, and, for those purposes, they define the wealthy as the wealthiest 30 percent or so of the American people—say a family with an income of $100,000 or $150,000. We are told that is the same thing as increasing taxes on the top onetenth of 1 percent, say a family with an income of $1 million or $2 million a year. There is a difference in the ability to pay of those two typical families, typifying their income brackets. The fact is, that taxing hardworking families with incomes of $100,000 or $150,000, in order to provide reduced tax rates for those with incomes of $1 million or $2 million, makes our tax system more regressive. You cannot put the entire top 30 percent in one category for these income calculations. That is why, and that is only one reason why, I oppose the elimination of the home mortgage deduction. Another reason that I oppose it is elimination of the home mortgage deduction and reduction for local property taxes will probably decrease the value of homes by 20 percent, is the best estimate I have seen. Well, if you lose 20 percent of the value of your home, you may very well lose all of the equity in your home. How is that going to affect the economy? How is that going to affect the ability of homeowners to go and spend money in their communities and support the economy of their communities? What does it do to the Federal budget when we are responsible through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for underwriting home mortgages? We know that if you wipe out the equity of many homeowners in their homes, this can lead to defaults and cost the Federal Government perhaps more than we give up by having a home mortgage deduction. Another element to keep in mind is that the entire idea of an income tax is that we tax people based on their ability to pay. If you are in a State with high income taxes, high property taxes, that diminishes your ability to pay. If you make a certain salary and money is taken out by your State government before you ever see it, your ability to pay is only on that net paycheck. It is simply wrong to take away the deduction for State and local taxes. But make no mistake about it, the purpose of removing that deduction is not just to hurt the top 30, or 40 percent, or 50 percent of the American people who itemize their deductions, it is designed to punish those who are dependent on State and local government. All the conservative theorists say: If we can just eliminate the deduction for State and local taxes, we will cut the size of State and local governments. We will create a political atmosphere in which they slash money for local schools, slash money for local health programs for the poor, slash money for police. Who will be hurt from those cuts? Not just the top 30 percent or 50 percent, but everyone in America, most particularly, the poor. Finally, I want to focus on the medical deduction. They take away the medical deduction in this program, this proposal of the Trump administration. Now, keep in mind that we already have severe limits on deducting medical expenses. You can deduct medical expenses only if they exceed 10 percent of your family’s income. So medical expenses are itemized and deducted only by those families including someone with very significant health costs. Now, we have worked hard in this House to make sure that people have health insurance. But even with health insurance, there are copays; there are deductibles. These can be absorbed in a family budget where no one has a particular strong medical need. But what if there is some member of the family who needs experimental treatments that are not covered, therapies that are not covered? Under the present system, at least they get to deduct these extraordinary—not the first 10 percent of AGI, of adjusted gross income—but when they start spending outofpocket costs in excess of 10 percent income, they can take a tax deduction—a tax deduction taken away in the Trump tax proposal. I speak not just as someone who spent a lot of time as a tax expert who headed the second largest tax agency in the country, but as the father of a child with special needs. What does this tax proposal mean for such a family? Well, first, there is a cut in Federal revenue under this proposal of between $150 billion and $200 billion a year. Deficit hawks will demand that these revenue cuts be matched by cuts to Federal spending. What does that do to the $13 billion the Federal Government dedicates to the implementation of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, IDEA, also known as special education? And what do these cuts in our Federal expenditures mean to the $293 million that are spent by the National Institutes of Health on research designed to prevent and treat autism and attentiondeficit/hyperactivity disorder, ADHD? So the first impact on a family with special needs is a slashing of the money the Federal Government spends for special education and medical research. But second, I talked about those out ofpocket medical expenses. Parents with specialneeds children know that health insurance pays only a portion of what is needed, or perhaps none of what is needed, for behavioral therapy, speech therapy, occupational therapy, physical therapy, developmental pediatricians, neuropsychological services, et cetera. Medical insurance will pay nothing toward anything branded an experimental treatment, and, of course, medical insurance does not cover special schools required to meet the needs of some specialneeds children. Under current law, a special school designed to meet those with a physical or mental handicap are considered medical expenses. All of these tax deductions are taken away from a family whose ability to pay is diminished by the costs of providing these therapies to a specialneeds child. In addition, right now, the tax law provides a personal exemption of $4,050 for each dependent child. The Trump administration proposal takes that away. It does say, in some vague language, that there will be a child tax credit to compensate parents who are losing the personal exemption. But this credit will be limited to children 16 years of age and younger. So what about parents supporting children in their teenage years, and older? Remember, some specialneeds children will need parental support for a lifetime. Those parents lose the exemption and are ineligible for this credit available only to parents of younger children. But perhaps parents of children with special needs should support the Trump tax program. While it will tremendously increase their taxes, while it will cut Federal expenditures on special education and on health research and medical research, parents of children with special needs can take solace in knowing that this plan will reduce taxes for the Trump family by over $1 billion in estate taxes and by tens of millions of dollars in income tax. Perhaps we should tell parents of specialneeds children that they should stop worrying so much about their children and start worrying about Donald Trump’s children. If they did, they would support the Trump tax proposal. 
Mr. SHERMAN. Finally, Mr. Speaker, I would like to address the issue of 
Iran and the nuclear deal, nuclear control deal that we signed with Iran. First, a little background. In 1997, I said at the Foreign Affairs Committee that Iran and its nuclear program were the number one threat to American national security. b1745 For the last 20 years, I have supported every effort to impose sanctions on the Iranian regime. When the Iran nuclear deal was finalized and published, I was the first of either party to come to this floor and say that Congress should not vote to endorse that deal. But the question before us now is: Should we renounce the deal? Now, it would be one thing if Iran decides that we are so tough on them on other issues that they choose to renounce the deal, but that is not the issue before us today. The issue before us today is whether America should renounce the deal, and the resounding and clear answer is that is not something we should do at this time. Now, I will give you an example. Let’s say you bought a flawed automobile. In some jurisdictions, you take back the automobile and you get back your money. But what opponents— what some are proposing now is that we renounce the deal. Imagine you are in a jurisdiction where you have to take back the car and the dealer keeps your money, too. Taking back the car doesn’t look like such a good idea anymore. Now, like a flawed automobile, the Iran nuclear deal is liable to not be working next decade. But that doesn’t mean you take back the car and the dealer keeps the money. What happens if we renounce the deal? Iran keeps the money. We unfroze very roughly $100 billion of their money. If we renounce the deal, they keep the money. We delivered over $1 billion in currency on big pallets. If we renounce the deal, Iran keeps the money. If we renounce the deal, Iran is liberated from all of the restrictions that it agreed to on its nuclear program. I opposed the deal because the restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program in the deal were temporary. I believe we need to extend and enforce those limitations on their nuclear program. If you listen to the Prime Minister of Israel, Bibi Netanyahu, he has identified the fact that we have not been able to extend and make permanent the limitations on Iran’s nuclear program as the chief flaw in the deal and the chief thing to correct to turn it into a better deal. But if we renounce the deal, we don’t extend and enforce the limitations on Iran’s nuclear program, we end and eliminate immediately the restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program. I cannot think of a worse result. Now, there are two mechanisms that we could use as a nation to renounce the deal, give Iran all the benefits, and liberate them from all their obligations. The first of these is on our mind now because it could be triggered on October 15. That is the day on which the President could, in effect, decertify this deal under the Iran Nuclear Review Act. I hope that, if he does that, the press will not overplay it, because a decertification does nothing more than focus Congress’ attention on whether we want to reinstitute the exact sanctions that were waived as part of the nuclear deal. A decertification does nothing more than focus our attention and, over in the Senate, provide for a reinstitution of the old sanctions. Now, I don’t think that Congress would be stupid enough to do that because, as I have explained, if we renounce the deal, Iran keeps the benefits and is liberated from its obligations. But the President should not decertify the deal and focus the world’s attention on whether America will stand with the deal at this time. The second way that America could renounce the deal will occur next January because the basic element of the deal—the basic thing Iran got from the United States—was an agreement that the President would, every 4 months to 6 months, it depends on the exact statute, waive particular identified sanctions. As it happens, the existing waivers all expire in the middle of next January. If the President were to fail to issue those waivers, that would be an American renunciation of the deal. So it does not meet our national security objectives to renounce the deal. What meets our national security objectives is to impose tough sanctions on Iran, draft those sanctions carefully, and explain them to the world not as a renunciation of the deal, but as appropriate sanctions given Iran’s nonnuclear, outsidethedeal, wrongful behavior. Now, the question is: Can we have sanctions on Iran and continue to force them to abide by the deal? The answer is clearly yes. In July of 2015, Secretary Kerry came before our committee, and I raised this very issue: If we adopt the deal, can we impose sanctions on the Central Bank of Iran to deter terrorism? Or would that violate this agreement? I specifically asked: Are Congress and the United States free under the agreement to adopt new sanctions legislation that will remain in force as long as Iran holds American hostages or supports the murderous Assad regime? Secretary Kerry’s answers were clear. He stated: We are free to adopt additional sanctions as long as they are not a phony excuse for just taking the whole pot of past ones and putting them back. So we can and should impose new sanctions on Iran to the extent justified by Iran’s behavior outside the area of nuclear research and uranium enrichment. Look at that as an opportunity because you could make a list of every sanction any one of us here on this floor has thought of. And add in the creativity of the United States Senate and make a list of every sanction we could impose, I assure you that those sanctions and more are justified by the nonnuclear evil committed by the regime in Tehran. Iran is more responsible than Russia for the hundreds of thousands of deaths in Syria. The lifeline of Assad’s murderous regime is a lifeline to the aid, money, weapons, thugs, and training that Iran has provided—hundreds of thousands of deaths, an immoral responsibility of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Turn to Yemen, where tens of thousands of people have died because of Iran. Look at worldwide terrorism, and Iran is the number one state sponsor of terrorism year after year, according to our State Department. Look at the treatment by Iran of its own people, the murders by the state of anyone they identify as being part of the LGBT community, the murders by the state of women—it is usually women— accused of adultery. The evil that comes from the Islamic Republic far exceeds the ability of this House to identify sanction points. That is why the proper policy for the United States is to impose the maximum sanctions and to explain to the world that this is not a phony renunciation of the nuclear deal, but it is the appropriate response to Iran’s actions that are outside of the nuclear deal. If we do that, we will have substantial support from Europe, Asia, and elsewhere first for demanding that Iran continue to be subject to all the nuclear limitations and inspections that they agreed to under the deal and which continue to be enforced well in the next decade. What we shall do next decade, well, I will come back here and give another speech next decade. But at least many years deep in the next decade, this deal provides us with valuable limitations and valuable inspections of the Iran nuclear program, and Europe will insist that those be adhered to. Second, Europe may join us in the sanctions when we sanction Iran for its actions in Syria, its actions to its own people, its actions in Yemen. One more I should add, and that is Iran’s violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions by testing and developing missiles and exporting weapons. So if we stick with the deal and we sanction Iran, they may choose—if those sanctions are as effective as I think they can be—to walk away from the deal. But if they do, we will have the whole world with us enforcing sanctions against Iran. Now, there is one part of the policy I put forward that may not meet the psychological needs of the President of the United States, for he has shown an uncontrollable personal need to pour disgusting liquids on anything associated with President Obama. Maybe it 
meets his psychological needs to say he is renouncing the nuclear deal. But the fact is we don’t have to renounce the nuclear deal and liberate Iran from its obligations in order to impose the toughest imaginable sanctions on this regime that is doing so much evil. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
THE RIGHT OF SELF DETERMINATION The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. ROHRABACHER ) for 30 minutes. Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, let me just note I believe that our President is doing a terrific job. I think that the last Presidents of the United States have left us an incredibly dangerous situation, and this President is trying to deal with it with strength and purpose, and, yes, being a forceful leader. For example, during the Clinton administration, we provided $4 billion to $5 billion to North Korea, the same way the last administration tried to provide funds for Iran. What do we have now? A crisis with possible nuclear weapons and missiles in North Korea. That is called kicking the can down the road. They sure kicked it down to us, and now the people want to kick the can down the road with the Iranians. No, let’s not do that again and leave future generations to face the music that we left them. Our President wants to make sure that Iran does not become a nuclear power as long as it is controlled by radical, fanatic mullahs who don’t even represent their own people. In fact, if Iran was more peaceful and actually more democratic, then we wouldn’t have to worry about that because they wouldn’t want to have a wasteful program of nuclear weapons. Those are the type of issues we face today. We face a lot of uncertainties at home and abroad, and it behooves us to look for explanations for the shifts in power, the dangers, and the influence that are taking place in the world today. Europe, along with the United States, for five decades, seemed to be the center of world order and progress. NATO, the European Union, and the common market all seemed to be the epitome of sophisticated and proper governance needed to offset humankind’s destructive and combative inclinations. World Wars I and II had undercut, if not destroyed, the expansion of classical liberalism that was in the process of retiring royalist and imperialist domination of the world, which, of course, is where the world was at the turn and the beginning of the 20th century as classical liberalism began to replace imperialism and monarchy. Yes, the two World Wars that we experienced were traumas that still impact our lives. The Treaty of Versailles that ended World War I was the last gasp of European colonialism. b1800 Maps drawn at that international gathering brought on World War II. Some of those other lines that they drew on that map plague us to this day. Those national borders mandated by the Versailles Treaty made the world temporarily tranquil. Maybe we just heard about that a few moments ago, how we have got to overcome the tragedy right now, like we did in Korea, by not having confrontations with those people who were engaged in hostile activity. Yes, the Treaty of Versailles gave the world temporary tranquility, but doomed following generations to instability and conflict. Such future challenges were left to the League of Nations. When that failed, the baton was passed to the United Nations. Humanity, obviously, hoped that global government, in one form or the other, would solve everything. The EU, the common market, NATO, and other multinational bureaucracies would demonstrate how nationstates can cooperate and achieve a collective peace, freedom, and prosperity. Well, just as things changed dramatically after the 19th century turned into the 20th century, and it became a different world, so, too, is our world changing. We must make sure that we have turned from the 20th century into the 21st. The 20th century was dominated by the wars and by the defeat of the Soviet Union. Yet we are plagued with conflicts and upheavals that can be traced back to border and sovereign decisions made long ago by people who are now dead, not only from the 20th century, but, as I said, from the end of World War I. Many of the confrontations between various nationalities that we face today could be solved and the greatest threats of violence, insurrection, and war itself could be defused if our world would again recognize the right of self determination. It seems to have been forgotten that the United States was not only founded on the principles of liberty and independence, but also of the right of people to demand their rights, and, yes, that right of independence. They had a right to declare their independence. This was the revolutionary idea that people have a right to select their government. This was the revolutionary idea that gave our Founding Fathers and Mothers the moral high ground to free themselves from the British Empire. Without this, they probably would not have won, if it were just a battle between powermongers. No. This was what the fundamental beliefs were: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, but also the right of people to declare themselves free and independent to create a country based on shared beliefs and shared ideals and values. This is what we hope—those shared values and beliefs in liberty and justice—are the things that unite us today. That is what united had our Founding Fathers and Mothers and that is what made us a nation. After all, we don’t have one race or one religion or one ethnic group to identify us as being Americans and create that unity. But that said, there are many other countries of the world whose nationalism and patriotism are based on the fact that they have an identity with other people that share their cultural and racial identities. This is what unites them as a people. They are ethnically the same, they are culturally the same, and they have the same type of national and racial roots in their past. Yes, this is what most countries are like. That is what defines a nationality. Recognizing that people of similar values and culture do not want to live in the subjugation of others has been ignored and/or rejected by the powers that be throughout the world. So we live in a world where this idea of just recognizing that people want to be like people with similar people. For example, you have differences between Catholics and Protestants in many areas of the world. Yes, they like to have people who maybe speak their same language and have the same culture, enjoy the same music. There is nothing wrong with people identifying others as being part of their national family. We should promote that as a positive, rather than as a negative. We should encourage people to work together. There are many, for example, Jewish charities, which is wonderful that Jewish people now, because they have gone through a certain amount of oppression throughout the world, take care of each other in Jewish charities. We have that. We have Catholic schools and different things. Yes, it is meant because people do share certain values that they can work together on. That is a good thing. However, the idea that people like that might want to be in their own country, which is what our Founding Fathers said, because it was only shared values, it wasn’t specific that we wanted freedom of religion for all people. Well, today the world is threatened by people who want to be independent of domination of others who don’t share their same values and their nationality. The reason why it is being rejected is basically by the power brokers throughout the world because it threatens those in power with losing authority over people who don’t want to live under their domination. That is what selfdetermination is all about: letting people decide their own fate. If a majority of people in an area want to be independent of a country, that is what they should be, according to our Declaration of Independence. And this is something that brings a 
more peaceful world, rather than trying to have subjugation of one people by another. There has been a major cause of conflict in the world today when people don’t recognize that, yes, there are others who feel that they are being oppressed by being forced under the jurisdiction of a particular government. They would like to have their own independence. This, of course, has been especially true where people, since the end of the Cold War, have started looking at their own selfidentification. When the right of selfdetermination is recognized, disputes are usually settled peacefully, as happened when, for example, after the fall of communism, the Czechs and the Slovaks, who had one country before, under the Treaty of Versailles, Czechoslovakia became the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic. Well, that is fine. It is a good thing that they were able to separate. Now they can be friends. But when they were one country, if the Czechs and Slovaks felt like they were being oppressed, they weren’t satisfied. It was a good thing to permit them right off the bat: If you don’t want to be part of the country with us, yes, you can be a separate country. Otherwise, there would have been turmoil at one level or another. We also saw a peaceful solution in countries like Slovenia. Yugoslavia was breaking up, Tito was dead, the Cold War was over, and guess what. Slovenia and a bunch of other republics within Yugoslavia wanted to be independent, and they were able to do it. Well, perhaps they were able to do it because the Serbs had already launched attacks on the Croatians and the Kosovars and other people in Yugoslavia that now was splitting apart because these people wanted to be independent and free, but the Serbs attacked them. They didn’t attack Slovenia, because I think by that time they realized that they could not succeed going to war with all of these various groups. Had the Kosovars and the Croatians been free to go and separate and become independent countries—as Croatia is today, and as the Kosovars would like to be, and as we are trying to help them to be—that would have been better for Serbia. It would have been better for everybody. There would have probably been by now an agreement for some kind of free trade zone. Instead, when the Serbs used force to keep those people under its jurisdiction, we had violence throughout the Balkans that has lasted for several decades. That is a tragedy. We should be working today in the Balkans. Let me just note that the Serbs today are an example of people who are reaching out, for example, to the Kosovars and others to try to find peaceful solutions and trying to come to some agreements that will make peace more likely. But, again, if you would have had people who were under their thumb, nobody would be talking to them because they would be afraid of them. No. People who treat other people as equals and have rights as people in the world, they are more likely to reach understandings that are of mutual cooperation that will bring peace to the world. I am not trying to say you have to submit yourself to some other group of people. The former Soviet Union, Ukraine, and other of the socalled Soviet republics were actually permitted at the end of the Cold War to, basically, peacefully establish their own independence. I know it is not as simple as that, but it happened in a peaceful way in which thousands of lives were not lost trying to force groups of people who do not want to be under Moscow’s control. Those people, whether Ukraine or elsewhere in the Baltics or the Balkans, had the right—and also in Central Asia—and people were permitted to have, basically, an independent government free from being only suppressed by Moscow and have to follow its orders. That happened relatively peacefully. Had that not happened, there probably would be conflict throughout that part of the world today. There certainly would have been, as communism faltered in Russia itself. So it took a lot of prodding for us to make sure that the Russians in the Soviet Union, in Moscow, understood that they could not keep people under their thumb. It was the Cold War. Thank God, we ended the Cold War peacefully, because that was the great gift that Ronald Reagan gave to us. I am very proud to have served with Ronald Reagan for 7 years in the White House as a senior speechwriter to the President for 7
1⁄2years, as well as being a Special Assistant to the President and very involved with his efforts to try to move peace in the world. A lot of it was peace by recognizing people’s right to independence. Look back, for example—Ronald Reagan was an Irish American—at the needless violence that the British perpetrated and what happened in Ireland because the British insisted that the Irish be kept under British rule for so long, when it was clear that the Irish people wanted to be independent of Great Britain. Look at what happened, in contrast, in Singapore and Malaysia, where the British just peacefully permitted those countries that were basically under the domination—they were part of Great Britain and the British Empire—to leave and establish their independence peacefully. Then Malaysia and Singapore separated from Great Britain, and then separated from each other, peacefully. But in any one of these cases, if somebody demanded that these people stay in this particular status within this particular government, there would have been a lot more violence. When selfdetermination is respected, peace is more likely. When a people are subjugated to the orders of a government in a country they don’t want to be part of, violence is more likely. How easy is that? Special interests and power elites throughout the world are not so inclined to this obvious reason. Why? Because it is not in their interest to let people just go when they have them right there under their control. So let’s look at a few examples where selfdetermination has manifest itself in conflict. Today, one of the greatest conflict areas of the world is the Middle East. Again, many of the conflicts that we have seen, if not a majority, can be traced right back to the Treaty of Versailles, right back to World War I, and the decisions of colonialists and imperialists and royalists to draw borders in the Middle East, just as they did in Africa and elsewhere, which made no sense. Yes, we ended up separating whole nations. For example, one nation of people that we are aware of today are the Kurds. The Kurds were separated into various countries in the Treaty of Versailles by these British and French colonialists. And we are supposed to just abide by their decision of what the borders should be today, 100 years later? No, I don’t think so. b1815 The Kurds, of course, were not living just subjugating themselves to what they had been dictated. No, the Kurds have been our greatest ally in the fight against radical Islamic terrorism, and what they are doing today and what they just voted on recently was they had a vote to determine if their people wanted selfdetermination and wanted to be an independent country from Iraq. Yes, that was a good thing, and we should recognize that. They won overwhelmingly, and we should look at the map of—we should say a map of the Middle East needs to be changed so you can have a Kurdistan that flows all the way from Turkey and Iraq and Iran and Syria. There are more, for example, Kurds in Iran than there are in Iraq. In Turkey, there are more Kurds, and, of course, in Syria. This should be a modern country. Why are we letting this turmoil go on when our greatest allies are looking for their own selfdetermination and these other countries are becoming or are already our enemies? Yes, it will behoove the United States to support the independence of Kurdistan and all the Kurds. We should support in bringing together these Kurdish people as a nation, because that is what they are. They are a nation without a state. Let them have their country. There has been so much bloodshed in trying to repress the Kurds from the Iranians, from the mullah regime, but also the Shah before him. The Kurds were oppressed by Saddam Hussein, 
and right now, what we have is a repression of people even in Iran where the mullah regime is oppressing not only the rest of its people, not only the other people who make up Iran, but the Kurds, in particular. Look at what is going on with the Baloch, for example. Now, a small group—there are groups of people. There is an area in Iran where the vast majority of people are of the Baloch extraction. They would like their independence. They deserve their right to selfdetermination, and they are not suffering from the oppression of Iran. By the way, if we are going to try to deal with Iran, let’s not ratchet up our military and threaten to attack them that way. Let’s ratchet up our support for people like the Kurds and the Baloch and the Azaris and other people who live in Iran who don’t like the oppression of the mullahs, and we can even be supportive of the Persian people who hate the mullah regime. These are not our enemies in Iran. It is the mullah regime, the fanatics that would drop a bomb on us and not even think twice because they think they are doing God’s work. They are the enemy. So we need to be supporting, for example, the Baloch, when I talk about in Iran. The Baloch are also persecuted, mainly persecuted by the Pakistanis who have them under their thumb, and they murder people constantly. They pick these young people up and they murder them, and then they drop their bodies in little villages just to show people what is going to happen to them if they try to resist Pakistani authority. This is the history of Pakistan. Right now they are doing it to the Baloch, to the Sindhis, to the Singhs, you name it. You have got just a group of people—except for, of course, the Punjabis and then others, the Pashtuns who control that Government in Pakistan. Well, remember what happened before. We have seen it before. When the people of Bangladesh wanted to be a little independent of the Pakistani Government, have some way to, you know, control their own lives and control their own government, they were brutally repressed by the Pakistani Government, and that is what led to, basically, the uprising of the people in Bangladesh when they freed themselves. Remember, that same type of oppression is continuing not only on the Baloch, but, for example, the populations that came over from India, after India and Pakistan split. A lot of them went to Karachi. Those people in Karachi now, there are people who want to have Karachi—it is like a Singapore of that part of the world, an independent. That is what they want to do because they have a right of selfdetermination. They don’t want to be subjugated by this corrupt, militaristic, proterrorist Government in Pakistan. We should be siding with people like that who want their independence and believe in these same values that we believe in. Another example of that, of course, is what we see in Spain today. Today, of course, now there are groups of people who live in Catalonia. Catalonia is a province with a long history in Spain. People identify themselves as Catalonians. Yes, Spanish, but also Catalonians. They should have a right to vote on whether or not they want to remain part of Spain, whether or not they give up their sovereignty to a central government in Madrid or do they want to have a government of Catalonia that they can have their own government, and yes, their own sovereignty. Well, the Spanish overreaction to the efforts of the Catalonians just to have a poll—basically it was a vote on independence, but it was—you know, basically it had to be recognized for it to have effect. But instead of letting them do this and just saying, ‘‘Well, it has no legal effect,’’ instead, the Spanish Government came down with brute force and conducted violence, as you would think violence coming from terrorists would exert on a group of people in Spain. It was their own government that was exercising violence and force and intimidation against the people of Catalonia. Now, of course, the people of Catalonia are united because they know the brutality and subjugation of what is going on with Madrid. Now, the British knew how to do it. Unlike Madrid and Spain, the British permitted their people in Scotland to have a vote, and that was a wonderful thing. The Scots had their vote, there was no interference, and if they didn’t want to be part of Great Britain, they didn’t have to be, and that was a wonderful example to the world of how you should do this. Now, the Scots decided to stay part of England, part of Great Britain. That is fine, but they had their chance. The people in Spain weren’t given that chance. No, instead their government came down and beat them up when they tried to go to the polls. And let’s say also, the British seemed also to be demonstrating, they believe, in selfdetermination. They are exiting—they are taking the Brexit issue of whether or not you should have Britain as part of the EU and the common market. That vote that they allowed their people to decide, it wasn’t decided by an elite. The Brexit vote let all the people of Britain decide whether or not they were going to be basically part of a subjugated people in Europe or whether they were going to be an independent force and a nation, which is their history as a people of Great Britain. I am proud that they permitted Scotland to vote, and I am also proud that they voted not to subjugate themselves to the EU and to the common market, et cetera. We need to make sure that we stay true to our principles and have a vision about what this world will be. If you are just looking at things of what we can do every day, Ronald Reagan succeeded because he had a vision of a peaceful world based on those individual rights and those concepts of freedom and democracy that were at the heart of the American experience, but also an America that encompassed people from all over the world. Reagan had a vision, and it wasn’t to get into a war with the Soviet Union and destroy communism. Reagan’s vision was let’s have—yes, we have to have strength in our military in order to defeat this enemy of Soviet communism, because it was threatening the world peace. It was taking over countries and overthrowing governments and replacing them with atheist dictatorships. Reagan knew we had to stop that. Just like today, our primary enemy today is no longer the Soviet Union because Reagan helped eliminate the Soviet Union, the communist threat. The threat today is radical Islamic terrorists who will murder our people and are murdering people all over the world and murdering people in their own countries in order to terrorize them into submission. Well, the bottom line is, Ronald Reagan’s vision succeeded with Russia because, at that time, it was the Soviet Union, and now we have a Russia that we have so much more potential. Now, there are a lot of flaws. There are a lot of flaws in the Russian Government, and there are things that we have to make sure that we are taking care of and standing firm on, but, by and large, we have to understand that they, today, are being attacked and murdered by radical Islamic terrorists as well. They know that, and they know the dangers that we face because they face a common danger. We need to work to build a new alliance because what is happening is, Islam is making such inroads into the stupidity of our western European allies that the western Europe that we know—here again, time is going on, 19th century into the 20th century. Now we are in the 21st century. The 21st century will see that Europe becomes a whole different place than what it has been for the last 150 or 200 years. There will be Islamic countries in Europe, and they will be, then, either part of or they will not fight against a radical Islamic terrorist threat that today threatens the peace of the world just as the Soviet Union did that 10 years, or I should say, 10 decades ago. So with that, we need a vision, and one vision that we should have is, number one, a vision of selfdetermination that we all agree on. Number two, let’s make sure that we ally ourselves in a positive way with people who are not going to be weakened by the onslaught of Islam. I would suggest that America will be a more peaceful place and our country will be more secure and the world will be more peaceful and secure if we establish a new relationship in which we are 
watching out for each other with four countries. The United States, of course; the other one is India, and I will soon be going to India. In fact, I will be going to India tomorrow. And number three, Japan; and number four, Russia. Now, there is some work that needs to be done to make a coalition like that real, but a coalition of those countries working together, not mandated that we have to do this and we have to subjugate ourselves to decisions of what the four say, but, instead, seeking out cooperation with those countries where there is mutual benefit to do, we can make this a better world. We can secure our prosperity and secure the peace of our own country and the security of our own country. So with a vision and with a recognition of fundamental things like the right of selfdetermination and the right of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness that our Founding Fathers talked about, and limited government where they said government only derives its just powers from the consent of the governed, let us champion these values and these ideals. Let us have a vision for the future, as Ronald Reagan did, and we can make this a more peaceful world as we side with people all over the world who want to control their own destiny by having their own nation rather than being subjected to someone else. Mr. Speaker, with that, I yield back the balance of my time.

Had I been present, I would have voted: June 15, 2017 Yea on Roll Call No. 308 June 20, 2017 Yea on Roll Call No. 309 Yea on Roll Call No. 310 June 21, 2017 Yea on Roll Call No. 311 Yea on Roll Call No. 312 Yea on Roll Call No. 313 Nay on Roll Call No. 314 Yea on Roll Call No. 315 June 22, 2017 Yea on Roll Call No. 316 Yea on Roll Call No. 317 Nay on Roll Call No. 318 Yea on Roll Call No. 319 June 23, 2017 Yea on Roll Call No. 320 Yea on Roll Call No. 321 Yea on Roll Call No. 322 June 26, 2017 Yea on Roll Call No. 323 Yea on Roll Call No. 324 June 27, 2017 Yea on Roll Call No. 325 Yea on Roll Call No. 326 Yea on Roll Call No. 327 Yea on Roll Call No. 328 Yea on Roll Call No. 329 Yea on Roll Call No. 330 June 28, 2017 Yea on Roll Call No. 331 Yea on Roll Call No. 332 Yea on Roll Call No. 333 Yea on Roll Call No. 334 Yea on Roll Call No. 335 Nay on Roll Call No. 336 Yea on Roll Call No. 337 Yea on Roll Call No. 338 June 29, 2017 Yea on Roll Call No. 339 Yea on Roll Call No. 340 Nay on Roll Call No. 341 Yea on Roll Call No. 342 Nay on Roll Call No. 343 Yea on Roll Call No. 344 July 11, 2017 Yea on Roll Call No. 345 Yea on Roll Call No. 346 July 12, 2017 Yea on Roll Call No. 347 Yea on Roll Call No. 348 Yea on Roll Call No. 349 Nay on Roll Call No. 350 Nay on Roll Call No. 351 Yea on Roll Call No. 352 July 13, 2017 Nay on Roll Call No. 353 Yea on Roll Call No. 354 Yea on Roll Call No. 355 Yea on Roll Call No. 356 Nay on Roll Call No. 357 Nay on Roll Call No. 358 Nay on Roll Call No. 359 Nay on Roll Call No. 360 Nay on Roll Call No. 361 Yea on Roll Call No. 362 Nay on Roll Call No. 363 Nay on Roll Call No. 364 Nay on Roll Call No. 365 Yea on Roll Call No. 366 Yea on Roll Call No. 367 Yea on Roll Call No. 368 Yea on Roll Call No. 369 Yea on Roll Call No. 370 Nay on Roll Call No. 371 July 14, 2017 Yea on Roll Call No. 372 Yea on Roll Call No. 373 Yea on Roll Call No. 374 Yea on Roll Call No. 375 Yea on Roll Call No. 376 Nay on Roll Call No. 377 Yea on Roll Call No. 378 July 17, 2017 Yea on Roll Call No. 379 Yea on Roll Call No. 380 Yea on Roll Call No. 381 July 18, 2017 Yea on Roll Call No. 382 Yea on Roll Call No. 383 Yea on Roll Call No. 384 Nay on Roll Call No. 385 Nay on Roll Call No. 386 Nay on Roll Call No. 387 Nay on Roll Call No. 388 Nay on Roll Call No. 389 Nay on Roll Call No. 390 Yea on Roll Call No. 391 July 19, 2017 Yea on Roll Call No. 392 Yea on Roll Call No. 393 Yea on Roll Call No. 394 Nay on Roll Call No. 395 Nay on Roll Call No. 396 Nay on Roll Call No. 397 Yea on Roll Call No. 398 Nay on Roll Call No. 399 Nay on Roll Call No. 400 Nay on Roll Call No. 401 Yea on Roll Call No. 402 July 20, 2017 Yea on Roll Call No. 403 Nay on Roll Call No. 404 Nay on Roll Call No. 405 Yea on Roll Call No. 406 July 24, 2017 Yea on Roll Call No. 407 Yea on Roll Call No. 408 Yea on Roll Call No. 409 July 25, 2017 Yea on Roll Call No. 410 Yea on Roll Call No. 411 Yea on Roll Call No. 412 Yea on Roll Call No. 413 July 26, 2017 Yea on Roll Call No. 414 Yea on Roll Call No. 415 Nay on Roll Call No. 416 Nay on Roll Call No. 417 Nay on Roll Call No. 418 Yea on Roll Call No. 419 Nay on Roll Call No. 420 Nay on Roll Call No. 421 Nay on Roll Call No. 422 Nay on Roll Call No. 423 Nay on Roll Call No. 424 Yea on Roll Call No. 425 July 27, 2017 Yea on Roll Call No. 426 Yea on Roll Call No. 427 Yea on Roll Call No. 428 Yea on Roll Call No. 429 Nay on Roll Call No. 430 Nay on Roll Call No. 431 Nay on Roll Call No. 432 Nay on Roll Call No. 433 Nay on Roll Call No. 434 Yea on Roll Call No. 435 July 28, 2017 Yea on Roll Call No. 436 Yea on Roll Call No. 437 Yea on Roll Call No. 438 September 5, 2017 Yea on Roll Call No. 439 Yea on Roll Call No. 440 September 6, 2017 Yea on Roll Call No. 441 Yea on Roll Call No. 442 Yea on Roll Call No. 443 Yea on Roll Call No. 444 Yea on Roll Call No. 445 Yea on Roll Call No. 446 Yea on Roll Call No. 447 Nay on Roll Call No. 448 Yea on Roll Call No. 449 Nay on Roll Call No. 450 Yea on Roll Call No. 451 Yea on Roll Call No. 452 Yea on Roll Call No. 453 Yea on Roll Call No. 454 Yea on Roll Call No. 455 Yea on Roll Call No. 456 September 7, 2017 Yea on Roll Call No. 457 Yea on Roll Call No. 458 Nay on Roll Call No. 459 Nay on Roll Call No. 460 Nay on Roll Call No. 461 Yea on Roll Call No. 462 Yea on Roll Call No. 463 Yea on Roll Call No. 464 Nay on Roll Call No. 465 Nay on Roll Call No. 466 Yea on Roll Call No. 467 Yea on Roll Call No. 468 Yea on Roll Call No. 469 Yea on Roll Call No. 470 Nay on Roll Call No. 471 Yea on Roll Call No. 472 Nay on Roll Call No. 473 Yea on Roll Call No. 474 Nay on Roll Call No. 475 Nay on Roll Call No. 476 Nay on Roll Call No. 477 Yea on Roll Call No. 478 Yea on Roll Call No. 479 September 8, 2017 Yea on Roll Call No. 480

Mr. GONZALEZ of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Mr. Stephen Conquest, who is celebrating his 50th Birthday. Defying all odds, Mr. Conquest has outlived the life expectancy given to him by doctors, who estimated that he would not make it past his teenage years. Born with Down Syndrome, a genetic anomaly that leads to developmental delays, the likelihood of Mr. Conquest developing life threatening conditions was higher than most. Mr. Conquest went on to join the Boy Scouts, receiving the Order of the Arrow; became an active member of the Future Farmers of America; won state gold medals in the 100 meter dash and long jump in the Special Olympics; and has been an invaluable employee at The McAllen Monitor since 1990. Among his many accomplishments, Mr. Conquest is also a valued friend, coworker, and son. I am proud to represent constituents like Mr. Conquest, who set the example for how life should truly be lived. Mr. Speaker, I again offer my congratulations to Mr. Conquest and his family. His perseverance, compassion, and versatility to leading a full life is exemplary and has not gone unnoticed. He has made the South Texas community a better place, and it is my honor to acknowledge him today. f 
Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Driscoll’s, a company based in California’s 20th Congressional District as the Second Harvest Food Bank of Santa Cruz County’s 2017 Food Donor of the Year. The company, made up of dedicated independent growers, has been donating their fresh berries to the Second Harvest Food Bank in Watsonville for over two decades. In 2016 alone, Driscoll’s donated nearly one thousand tons of berries. Because of Driscoll’s efforts, many food insecure families on the central coast of California now have access to the vitaminrich and highly nutritious berries and can make them a part of a healthy diet. The Driscoll and Reiter families, the founders of Driscoll’s, have been producing berries in the Pajaro Valley since 1904. Officially founded in 1950 as Driscoll Strawberry Associates, Inc., the company originally sold only fresh California strawberries. Their creation of the first patented strawberry variety in 1958 made Driscoll’s the national berry of choice by extending the crop’s growing season and allowing berries to be shipped long distances. Today, they have expanded their operations from just strawberries to include raspberries, blueberries, and blackberries. Driscoll’s innovative work, along with the contributions from many other farmers and ranchers of the Central Coast, has contributed to my district’s reputation as an agricultural powerhouse. Driscoll’s has always been committed to giving back to the local communities that have given them so much. Through their Berry Donation Program, Driscoll’s works to make sure families throughout their community have access to berries during local growing seasons. The company also supports a variety of food banks and related organizations such as the California Association of Food Banks and Ag Against Hunger. Driscoll’s culture of philanthropy is not limited solely to their senior leadership, but extends to their employees who are closely involved in the company’s efforts to support their communities. Together, Driscoll’s and their employees have donated over 5 million pounds of berries to the Second Harvest Food Bank. As the representative of the 20th Congressional District, I commend Driscoll’s for working to ensure that families on the Central Coast have access to the fresh and nutritious berries grown in their own backyard. We are lucky that they call the 20th Congressional District home. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues in the House join me in congratulating Driscoll’s on their 2017 Food Donor of the Year award. f 
HONORING DR. TED CHRISTOPHER ON HIS INAUGURATION TO PRESIDENT OF THE PENNSYLVANIA MEDICAL SOCIETY 
Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor one of our nation’s most dedicated advocates for doctors and patients, Dr. Ted Christopher of Pennsylvania’s 13th Congressional District, who is to be sworn in on October 14, 2017 as the 168th President of the Pennsylvania Medical Society. As a leader in emergency medicine, Dr. Christopher is the epitome of a physician who goes above and beyond—who uses his or her talents to not only serve individual patients, but also the practice of medicine as a whole. Not only has he been a trustee of the Pennsylvania Medical Society since 2011, but he has also served as president of the Association of Academic Chairs of Emergency Medicine, the Pennsylvania Chapter of the American College of Emergency Physicians, and the Philadelphia County Medical Society. Dr. Christopher’s invaluable contributions to the field of emergency medicine are displayed through his robust academic research. As Professor and Chairman of the Department of Emergency Medicine at the Sidney Kimmel Medical College at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia, he has long been a leader in his field and an inspiring mentor to countless students. I am confident that Dr. Christopher will bring his extraordinary skills and experience to this new position to the benefit of all advocates of bestpractices in medical care, and represent Pennsylvania’s doctors with honor and distinction. On behalf of Pennsylvania’s 13th Congressional District, I wish him my utmost congratulations and all the best for his coming term. 
TRIBUTE TO HONOR THE SILICON VALLEY COMMUNITY FOUNDATION ON THE OCCASION OF ITS TENTH YEAR ANNIVERSARY 
Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today alongside my colleagues, Congresswoman ZOELOFGREN and Congressman J IMMY PANETTA to honor the Silicon Valley Community Foundation (SVCF) as it celebrates its Tenth Year Anniversary. The Peninsula Community Foundation and Community Foundation Silicon Valley merged in 2007 to increase their impact by creating SVCF. Under the superb leadership of CEO Dr. Emmett D. Carson, SVCF has grown to become the world’s largest community foundation with more than $8 billion in assets. SVCF has been able to do this by engaging, empowering, and collaborating with families, individuals, and corporate donors to generate positive impacts and by supporting organizations within and beyond county lines and national borders. SVCF has become a comprehensive center for philanthropy and over the last decade has continued to advocate in pursuit of public policy issues and strategic initiatives in support of those in need. It also serves as a key leader and partner to nonprofit groups and institutions who work to advance ideas and direct resources strategically toward the pressing local needs of the community. SVCF has awarded $4.3 billion in grants since 2007, and the strong support that it has from the community and donors has enabled it to award $2.3 billion to local charities in nine Bay Area counties, with an additional $245 million awarded to other California charities. In their effort to assist students in their higher education and careers SVCF also awarded close to 400 scholarships totaling $1.7 million to students in high school, community college and university programs during the 2014 to 2015 school year. SVCF exemplifies its values of collaboration; diversity; inclusiveness; innovation; integrity; public accountability; respect; and responsiveness. It is fitting and proper that we recognize the tremendous impact of philanthropy, and the spirit of generosity and community service that SVCF has had in the Bay Area. Mr. Speaker, I ask the entire House of Representatives to join my colleagues and me in expressing our collective gratitude to the trailblazing Silicon Valley Community Foundation for its extraordinary contributions to charities and nonprofit organizations throughout our state and nation. We offer our congratulations on the occasion of its decade of philanthropic work and accomplishments in each of our Congressional Districts. IN RECOGNITION OF MRS. SHARON RESCH AND HER LIFELONG COMMITMENT TO THE FINE ARTS, COMMUNITY PHILANTHROPY, AND WORLDWIDE HUMANITARIAN EFFORTS HON. MIKE GALLAGHER 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mrs. Sharon Resch of Green Bay for her ongoing commitment to community philanthropy, worldwide humanitarian efforts, and the fine arts. Mrs. Resch has achieved this by being a dedicated supporter of the University of WisconsinGreen Bay’s mission and a vital resource and partner to its students. Mrs. Resch has helped transform the University of WisconsinGreen Bay through her leadership in bringing the American International Czech and Slovak Voice Competition to campus on a semiannual basis. Mrs. Resch has also founded the Sharon J. Resch Endowed Scholarship for Fine Arts, which is reserved for students who graduate from the nonprofit Fine Arts Institute and continue their music studies at the University of Wisconsin Green Bay. Mrs. Resch’s efforts are not limited to the University of WisconsinGreen Bay. Her generosity can be seen all across northeastern Wisconsin, with contributions to the Resch Center, Miracle League of Green Bay, and Resch Aquatic Center at Fisk Park. Mr. Speaker, I urge all members of this body to join me in commending Mrs. Resch for her continued commitment to the betterment of our communities both at home and abroad. 
IN HONOR OF BISHOP CLIFFORD M. JOHNSON, JR.’S 48TH ANNIVERSARY AS PASTOR OF MOUNT PLEASANT CHURCH AND MINISTRIES 
Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor a great American and a visionary leader—Bishop Clifford M. Johnson, Jr. This month, Bishop Johnson celebrates his 48th anniversary as Pastor of Mount Pleasant Church and Ministries, which is located in my Congressional District in Baltimore, Maryland. For nearly half a century, Bishop Johnson has used his Godgiven talents and abilities to uplift the people of his church and those in the surrounding community. As a passionate Bible scholar and avid reader, Bishop Johnson was drawn to studying the Word of God at a young age. A native of Baltimore, he graduated from Kenwood High School in Baltimore County and pursued additional studies at the Baltimore College of Commerce and the Community College of Baltimore. Bishop Johnson earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Pastoral Theology from the Washington Bible College and Capital Seminary. In 1975, he received an Honorary Doctor of Divinity degree from the Virginia Seminary and College of Lynchburg, Virginia. Under Bishop Johnson’s dynamic leadership, Mount Pleasant Church and Ministries has grown to serve a congregation of 8,000 people. He turned a deteriorating shopping center into a thriving 17acre campus with several ministries that reach beyond the walls of the church to bring resources and support to neighbors in need. Those ministries include: Kingdom Men Bible Class, the Prison Ministry, the Adult Learning Center, the Word of Life Ministry for children, the Evangelism Ministry, the Food and Banquet Ministry, and the Lampstand Christian Bookstore. Because of Bishop Johnson’s deep belief in the power of education to change the trajectory of the lives of young people, he established the Mount Pleasant Christian School. The school serves children from Kindergarten through grade five, and everyone involved with the school—from teachers, to parents and support staff—has committed to the mission of ‘‘awakening the genius in every child.’’ Bishop Johnson’s influence runs deep through the City of Baltimore. He is highly regarded by elected officials, business and civic leaders, and the people of the community. I witnessed this influence firsthand during the city’s unrest following the killing of Freddie Gray. Bishop Johnson was one of the first pastors to join with me and other spiritual leaders to help bring calm to the streets of Baltimore. Bishop Johnson then helped to devise a longterm plan to heal the shattered relationship between police and the communities they serve and protect. His genuine connection to the people of the community helped us assess and respond to their real needs. Bishop Johnson has such a powerful ministry because he relates the Word of God to people’s everyday lives. He has made an impact throughout the world by ministering in Canada, Israel, Sweden, France and Africa. He recently earned the distinction of being the first African American to preach and evangelize in Cuba. A loving family man, Bishop Johnson has been married to Dorothy Johnson for more than 50 years. They have five children and thirteen grandchildren. I am honored to pay tribute to Bishop Clifford M. Johnson, Jr. for his 48 years of pastoring Mount Pleasant Church and Ministries. He is a noble American who continues to serve his church, his community, and his country with distinction, and I thank him for his ministry. 
CELEBRATING THE REUNION OF THE 50TH COMPANY, INFANTRY OFFICER CANDIDATE SCHOOL CLASS OC 24–69 
Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a special group of Americans who are worthy of our recognition for the sacrifices they made for our country. In October of this year, the surviving members of the 50th Company, Infantry Officer Candidate Schools Class OC 24–69 will have their first reunion at Fort Benning, Georgia, 48 
years after pinning on the gold bars of Second Lieutenants. It was a time when the United States was still deeply mired in the Vietnam war. The young men who made up the 50th Company came from 42 of our 50 states and represented all walk of life and ethnic heritages. Almost all of them had recently graduated from college, and were of an age at which most of their contemporaries were starting their careers, not facing military service and the rigors of war and sacrifice. They were fully aware that the Vietnam war did not receive the near universal support that the country had offered the servicemen and women of World War II, in whose shadow they had grown up. The feelings of these men toward the war in Southeast Asia were as varied as those of their countrymen. Nevertheless, they accepted the risks inherent in their decision to become Army officers. Despite their varied backgrounds and their support for, or opposition to, the Vietnam war, they shared more important traits—a love of the United States of America, an abiding belief in democracy, and a devotion to duty no matter the consequences. They had all volunteered for the OCS. Within a year of graduation, over half would receive orders for Vietnam. Two classmates made the ultimate sacrifice for our country— James DuPont from North Canton, Ohio and Thomas Edgren from Libertyville, Illinois. Many others were awarded the Purple Heart. They all, no matter where they served, made sacrifices as previous generations who had served in the armed forces had sacrificed—separation from families, missed holidays, arduous and often dangerous work, and sometimes miserable living conditions. And sadly, for these men of the Vietnam era, their sacrifices were often met upon their return with indifference and even open hostility from a seemingly ungrateful country. Some of these men made the military a career. But most were classic ‘‘citizen soldiers’’ who returned to civilian life once they had served. They raised families and became successful lawyers, doctors, ministers, teachers, government workers, farmers, and business men. Over the years, most of the men of the 50th Company put their time in the service behind them. They lost contact with each other as other life issues took precedence. But through the efforts of a few determined classmates, plans were laid for this fall’s reunion. They will gather again at Fort Benning, another generation of Americans who laid down their plowshares to pick up rifles, only to beat them back into plowshares when duty was honorably done. At the reunion, these old comradesinarms will renew the bonds that were forged 48 years ago through the long marches in the brutal Georgia heat, the early morning runs in combat boots and rain, the countless pushups, and the brotherhood of blood and sweat of hard Army training. Now they will share their pride in having served. I ask my colleagues to join me in pausing to reflect on the sacrifices made by these men and the millions of others they represent, and to extend to them our personal thanks and the thanks of our country. ST. OMER FOUNDATION 
Mr. FRANCIS ROONEY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the St. Omer Foundation as it commemorates a great American family, the Carrolls, who played a tremendous role in securing our constitutional freedoms, and the founding of our country. Prior to the American Revolution, and before the freedom of religion was enshrined in the United States Constitution, Catholic families sent their children to France for an education. Many of these students attended an Englishspeaking, Jesuitrun university in St. Omer, France. Notable among these children were the sons of the distinguished Carroll family, who owned much of Maryland, including the future site of the United States Capitol. Charles, Daniel, and John Carroll all studied at the Jesuit University in St. Omer before returning to the colonies to play significant roles in the American Revolution. In St. Omer, the Carrolls learned the values that helped inspire their participation in the fight for independence from the British Empire. Charles Carroll signed the Declaration of Independence, Daniel Carroll was involved in the ratification of the Articles of Confederation and the United States Constitution, and John Carroll became the first Catholic Archbishop of the United States, founded Georgetown University, and established the first Catholic seminary in our country. During the French Revolution, the Jesuit University in St. Omer was disbanded, many of its buildings were destroyed, and the memory of the Americans who studied in France began to fade. Recently, the people of St. Omer, alongside many friends in the United States, sought to refresh this memory, and remind Americans and Frenchmen alike that the American Revolution took some of its impetus from a Jesuit university in the North of France. Together, they restored the handsome Jesuit chapel where the Carrolls attended mass as students in the 18th century. On October 15, Archbishop Lori of Baltimore will cut the ribbon on this newly renovated chapel and kick off a weekend of celebration and dialogue surrounding the Carroll family and their contribution to our great nation. I thank the St. Omer Foundation for its contributions to help preserve the legacy of heroes of the American Revolution. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Jim McLoughlin, an outspoken advocate for working families for over forty years. The San Antonio Redevelopment Plan’s twelve story tower located in the heart of downtown San Jose, constructed in 1975 and 1976 thanks in large part to his efforts, will be renamed in Jim’s honor. Jim first joined Local 428 of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union (then the Retail Clerks International Association) in 1937 as a clerk at Piggly Wiggly. A quick learner and a natural leader, he was elected to lead Local 428 that same year. His leadership continued for the next fortythree years, during which time Jim expressed solidarity for his brethren in labor throughout the world by serving as a trade union delegate to labor organizations in China, Argentina, Israel, Iceland and Sweden. Jim dedicated his life to organizing and civic engagement. He was a member of the Committee on Political Education and the AFL–CIO for over forty years. He participated on various state task forces, including Governor Pat Brown’s Committee on Automation and Employment in 1958, the Industrial Commission Mercantile Wage Board in 1972 and the California Attorney General’s Volunteer Advisory Council in 1973. Serving as Vice President among the 1.5 million members in the California Labor Federation from 1972 to 1980, Jim made a substantial impact for a generation of working families in California. Committed to social justice, Jim became a lifetime member of the NAACP in 1955 and was a delegate to the Labor Assembly for Peace in Vietnam in 1967. He served on the Santa Clara County Democratic Central Committee for over twenty years and acted as a McGovern delegate on behalf of Northern California Labor at the Democratic National Convention in 1972. Jim advocated for ‘‘guaranteed employment rights, wages, and benefits which match the cost of living to enable workers to be a force and active contributors in the communities.’’ His worldview that the treatment of workers is critical to the wellbeing of the community remains as relevant now as it was in Jim’s time. I am proud to have been Jim’s friend, and thankful for the many ways in which Jim advocated for workers in California and throughout the world. f 
Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Mr. Herman Roberts who is to be inducted into the Chicago Blues Hall of Fame this Sunday, October 15, 2017. Born in Beggs, Oklahoma in 1924, Herman Roberts and his family moved to Chicago when he was 12. He entered the workforce a few years later working for a cab company washing cars. At the age of 15, he was given the responsibility of driving those cabs and by 1944, he became owner of his own business, the Roberts Cab Company. Mr. Speaker, like many young men of the era Mr. Roberts fulfilled his patriotic duty by serving in the army during World War II. After returning from war, his ambition drove him to innovation when, as he recalls, in 1947, he became the first to install twoway radios in his cabs. Mr. Roberts has been a longtime resident of the Southside of Chicago and a pioneer in Chicago’s entertainment industry. He was one of the first club owners in Chicago to provide a nonsegregated venue for Black entertainers and in 1960, he expanded his enterprise to include motels. 
His success as a club owner is evidenced by the headliners he booked: Nat ‘‘King’’ Cole, Sammy Davis, Jr., Count Basie, Lionel Hampton, R&B acts like the Treniers, Brook Benton, Sam Cooke, and Jackie Wilson, and jazz diva Dinah Washington. While Mr. Roberts focused primarily on black acts, he would make exceptions for people like Tony Bennett and Gene Krupa. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Roberts’ pioneering spirit wasn’t limited to the musical sphere. In fact, he was the first entertainment business owner to give the famed Dick Gregory a chance when he hired him as a latenight emcee at the Herman Roberts Show Lounge in Chicago in 1958. In the political realm, his motel served as the original meeting place for another pioneer when he hosted Chicago Mayor Harold Washington’s initial campaign. In short, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Roberts’ venues served as the epicenter for Chicago’s Black civil society and he served as the Godfather of Chicago’s Black entertainment industry. Finally, after decades of hard work, Mr. Roberts retired in 1992 and still, today, maintains his home on Chicago’s Southside. Mr. Speaker, clearly Mr. Roberts is an accomplished individual and we, in Chicago, are proud to call him one of our own. I am delighted to congratulate my longtime friend and supporter, Mr. Herman Roberts, on this important achievement. On behalf of all my constituents in the 1st Congressional District of Illinois, I extend my heartfelt congratulations. 
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Waukegan to College (W2C) Program for its recent selection as an exemplary organization for promoting Latino success in higher education by Excelencia in Education. This is a true honor, and the staff, volunteers, students, and families of Waukegan to College should be very proud. Waukegan to College demonstrates how community support, resources, and encouragement can help students achieve their dreams of attending and graduating college. Through services such as tutoring, mentoring, college and scholarship application coaching, and advising sessions that include parents, Waukegan to College equips students with the tools they need to succeed not just in higher education, but in life. This prestigious award is a testament to their commitment to the youth of Waukegan. The time, effort and energy that they invest in this program do not go unnoticed—and sets a national example of the impact that a communitybased organization can make. I congratulate the team at Waukegan to College on this impressive accomplishment, and thank them for all they do to make a difference in the lives of our youth. HONORING TERESA P. PEREZ HON. VICENTE GONZALEZ 
Mr. GONZALEZ of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Weslaco, Texas native, Mrs. Teresa P. Perez, who is celebrating her 80th birthday. Born on October 14, 1937, she has been a pillar in the community. Mrs. Perez has resided in Weslaco since 1938 and been a lifelong member of St. Joan of Arc Catholic Church. Mrs. Perez has held many successful roles throughout her life but none more important than those to her family as a daughter, sister, mother and grandmother. Mr. Speaker, I again offer my congratulations to Mrs. Perez and her family: Cindy, Tommy, Louie, Rose, Arturo, Terry Ruben, Mike, Andrew, Cathy, Danny, and all 20 of her beloved grandchildren. Mrs. Perez and her family have made South Texas a better place, and it is my honor to acknowledge her today and wish her a very happy birthday. 
Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Reverend Samuel E. Gaskins, Sr. for his tireless dedication to improving the lives of residents in my district. Born in Lake City, South Carolina in 1937, Rev. Gaskins enlisted in the United States Army at the age of fifteen. By the age of seventeen he was promoted to Staff Sergeant and later a Chief Petty Warrant Officer, a testament to his innate leadership skills. After twenty four years of military service, including two tours as a chaplain in Vietnam, Rev. Gaskins settled in Seaside, California where he continued serving the public. In the late 1990s, the United States Army donated the former Fort Ord’s Army chapel to Rev. Gaskins. Through tireless work, he restored and converted the building into the Christian Memorial Tabernacle’s chapel still in use to this day. Rev. Gaskins’ efforts to improve the lives of his fellow citizens extend far past the walls of his church. Rev. Gaskins has founded numerous organizations and initiatives aimed at helping those in our community who are most in need. One such program is a new homeless ministry named ‘‘The Stepping Stone Outreach Program.’’ Rev. Gaskins’ five year program aims to provide housing and education for over 500 people in need. I commend Rev. Gaskins for his dedication to caring for those in my district who need help the most. Apart from his work to care for the less fortunate, Rev. Gaskins has worked to foster solidarity and strong relationships among communities in my district. One such initiative is ‘‘One Great Fellowship,’’ which he created in conjunction with Jason Harbert of the Carmel Presbyterian Church. One Great Fellowship aims to promote racial harmony between communities on the Monterey Peninsula. The program, which involves multiple Peninsula churches, has held several interracial and interdenominational services per year which regularly drew hundreds of people. Rev. Gaskins has proven himself to be a natural leader in service to his country and community. His life’s work adds up to nothing short of transforming the lives of the residents of the Central Coast. We are lucky to have someone as selfless and dedicated as Rev. Gaskins call the 20th district home. Mr. Speaker, I invite my colleagues to join me in recognizing Rev. Samuel E. Gaskins, Sr. for his many accomplishments and contributions to the betterment of his community, country, and fellow man. f 
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the career of Dr. Jerome Jackson, professor of Criminology at California State University, Fresno. Dr. Jackson has had a remarkable career, spanning over 30 years. He is a renowned criminologist, author and lecturer known for his work for various civil rights causes. Dr. Jerome Jackson was born in Texas before relocating to California. He earned his Bachelors in Arts in Political Science from Southern University in Baton Rouge Louisiana, a Master’s in Public Administration from Texas Southern University and a Doctor of Philosophy in Criminal Justice from Sam Houston State University. Currently, Dr. Jackson is the first and only African American born in the state of Texas to graduate from the distinguished Ph.D. program at Sam Houston State University. He also holds a Masters in Theological Studies and Doctorate in Theological Studies from the Faith Seminary in Tacoma, Washington. Currently, Dr. Jackson is a tenured Full Professor of Criminology at California State University, Fresno. During his tenure at Fresno State he took on a number of roles. This includes serving as the president of the Black Faculty and Staff Association and chairing the Martin Luther King Monument Statute Committee, helping to raise over $75,000.00. His work has been well recognized and he has received a number of honors throughout his career. This includes the Provost’s Award for Excellence in Teaching in 1998. His outstanding work has also been recognized by the cities of Fresno and Clovis. Mr. Speaker, it with great pleasure that I ask you to join me in celebrating the career of Dr. Jerome E. Jackson. I wish Dr. Jackson and his family continued success and happiness going forward. 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join my hometown in celebration of ZF, one of the top automotive suppliers in the world. For thirty years, this company has been a part of our Hall County, and I commend the city of Gainesville for establishing September 23 as ‘‘ZF Day.’’ When ZF opened its first North American production facility on Palmour Drive back in 1987, no one could predict the impact that this company would have on our community in northeast Georgia. What began as one location and a few jobs quickly grew to more than 50 locations and 31,900 jobs across North America. Hall County alone is now home to four production facilities and over 1,000 employees representing ZF. The Greater Hall County Chamber of Commerce played a significant role in bringing this company to Georgia and helping them achieve success. I want to thank them for all of their hard work. Mr. Speaker, I take pride in the number of international companies, like ZF, that have chosen to invest in my home state over the last several decades. These companies have provided many neighbors with careers and the means to pursue their dreams. I wish the company well as it continues to expand and create more opportunities for hardworking men and women. 
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to residents of California’s 42nd Congressional District who were tragically killed during the massacre at the Route 91 Harvest country music festival in Las Vegas, Nevada on Sunday, October 1, 2017. Thomas Day, Jr. was born and raised in my hometown of Corona, California. After graduating from Corona High School, Tom attended Riverside Community College and later went to work for Portrait Construction, a home building company founded by his father, Tom Sr. Those who worked with Tom knew him as someone who was easy to talk to and get along with. The Day family has been active in our community for many years, making a number of important contributions to nonprofit organizations. Attending concerts and music festivals with his children was a winwin for Tom because it allowed him to do two things he loved at one time—listen to music and spend time with his family. Tom was attending the Route 91 Harvest country music festival with his children when he was senselessly taken from us. Rocio Guillen grew up in Anaheim, California and attended Katella High School, where she ran track and cross country. Most recently, she worked as an assistant manager at a California Pizza Kitchen. Rocio was a tireless worker both at her job and at home caring for her children. She was blessed with four children: 18yearold Marcus, 13yearold Christopher, 1yearold Sofia and 1monthold Austin. Marcus recently described Rocio as ‘‘an amazing mother. She worked so many hours at work and would come back and take care of all of us.’’ Rocio’s fiance ´, Chris Jaksha, attended the Route 91 Harvest country music festival with her and comforted her in those terrifying final moments of her life. Pati Mestas lived in Menifee, California and was a graduate of Garey High in Pomona. While she previously helped manage the deli at a Corona gas station, Pati recently stopped working to spend more time with her three children, eight grandchildren and one great grandchild. Pati loved going to country music concerts and having a good time with her friends. Her son Brandon wrote, ‘‘She left this world surrounded by friends, singing and dancing with thousands of people. If I had to write the script myself, I could not have done a better job.’’ Christopher Roybal proudly served his country in the U.S. Navy as a dog handler, completing multiple tours in Afghanistan. After leaving the Navy, Chris returned home to Corona, California, and managed Crunch Fitness gyms. According to family and friends, Chris loved to sing and enjoyed all genres of music—they say he was a karaoke king. Chris is survived by his wife Dixie Roybal, his mother Debby Allen, father Samuel Roybal brothers Jacob, Jayson and Nicholas, and sisters Nina and Jillian. We are eternally grateful for Chris’ service to our nation. Our hearts ache for all of those whose lives were cut short and forever impacted by the evil acts of that evening. We pray that their loved ones, colleagues and friends find comfort in the memories shared with those we have lost. We also pray for the speedy recovery of all of the wounded. As a country we must stand together in the wake of this horrific event and demonstrate that the love, decency and compassion inside all of us is far stronger than any evil act. 
Ms. ROYBALALLARD. Mr. Speaker, I, along with Representative SA´NCHEZ , rise today to recognize the City of Bellflower on its 60th anniversary. We hope our colleagues will join us in paying tribute to the city and its residents. The City of Bellflower was incorporated in 1957 after a measure to do so was endorsed by most of the civic organizations in town and supported by the local newspaper. Several of the supporting groups that played a critical role at the time still exist today, including the Bellflower Chamber of Commerce, Kiwanis Club, Masonic Temple, and Bellflower Woman’s Club. At the time of incorporation, Bellflower was already a 51yearold community, fully matured in all areas but that of city government. Over the years, Bellflower has become a vibrant city with an innovative approach to enhancing services and generating revenues to support its growing community. There has been a long tradition of implementing programs that uphold the mission of the city, which is ‘‘to protect and enrich the quality of life, to make Bellflower an excellent place to live, work, and play.’’ Bellflower places a high value on programs that attract new businesses, provide recreation activities and community services, preserve the environment, and protect the safety of city residents. Through fiscal conservatism and the establishment of a redevelopment strategy, the city continues to grow and expand by attracting new businesses, improving business facades, and upgrading infrastructure. Since 2011, as a result of these strategies, Bellflower has seen more than $60 million of direct investment into its community. This includes the construction of Auto Zone, Biomat USA, and Kaiser Permanente offices, as well as unique restaurants like Golden Corral and Fronk’s. More recently, the city has placed a high priority on economic development and the revitalization of its downtown area. The new Bellflower Events Center and Los Angeles County Fire Museum will open in midNovember, and they are destined to become centerpieces of the resurgence and redevelopment of the city. The Events Center will provide an elegant indoor and outdoor venue for small groups, gatherings and larger parties, while the Fire Museum will house a tremendous display of Los Angeles County Fire Department history. The city is also excited to welcome SteelCraft, with its rapidly growing reputation as a unique dining and social experience, into Downtown Bellflower. A lease was recently approved by Bellflower’s City Council for SteelCraft to develop its third shipping container retail park on a 15,000 square foot city owned lot located on Bellflower Boulevard and Oak Street. SteelCraft will perfectly complement Bellflower’s unique retail stores and delicious homegrown restaurants. Capital improvements have also been at the top of Bellflower’s priorities. With the completion of the Bellflower Boulevard Pedestrian Enhancement Project in July of 2016, Bellflower’s streets, sidewalks, and crosswalks have undergone immense improvements, adding to the beautification and safety of its downtown area. We hope our colleagues will join us in sending their best wishes and congratulations to the City of Bellflower on its 60th anniversary. Let us salute its optimistic spirit, and its commitment to embracing the future through smart investments, innovation, and creativity. 
HONORING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE MORRISTOWN & MORRIS TOWNSHIP PUBLIC LIBRARY’S WILLIS WING 
Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Morristown & Morris Township Public Library’s Willis Wing, located in Morristown, New Jersey on the occasion of its 100th Anniversary. 
Library services have been available in Morristown since 1792. The first circulating library consisted of 97 members and 96 books. The Morristown Library Association was formed in 1812 and by the middle of the 19th century the library had grown to several thousand volumes. From 1875 to 1914 the Library was housed on South Street in the Morristown Library and Lyceum, an organization that officially incorporated in 1866. Its collection grew from 8,000 books to over 30,000 when the building, and almost everything in it, was destroyed by fire in 1914. A temporary library was soon opened in the old YMCA building on South Street. With money from both insurance and the sale of the land on which the Library and Lyceum stood, the property at the corner of Miller Road and South Street was purchased with the intention of building a new library building. In 1916, Grinnell Willis, a retired textile merchant who lived in Morristown since 1889, approached the Library Trustees and offered to pay the entire cost of a new fireproof building. The new Library would be built in ‘‘grateful remembrance of the love and affection bestowed on his late wife by her friends and neighbors in Morristown.’’ The day after Mr. Willis made his offer, an Act of Incorporation for the Morristown Library was filed. Its objective was ‘‘to establish and maintain a free public library and reading rooms, to establish and maintain an art gallery and museum for the encouragement of arts and science, to establish and maintain a collection of books and documents of historic interest and to advance the literary and educational interests of the community.’’ On December 13, 1917 the Library, with 8,000 volumes and a staff of four was opened to the public. In 1929, with the collection now totaling 43,500 volumes, Mr. Willis funded the cost of an addition to the original 1917 building. This addition, which opened in 1930, contained the Children’s Wing. Grinnell Willis died shortly after the new wing was completed. In his will he left the library an endowment of $200,000. The Library continued to grow and serve its public as an association library until 1966 when the residents of Morristown and Morris Township united in the support, maintenance, and control of a joint free public library. In 1987 the cornerstone was laid for an addition to the Library largely financed by Edythe and Dean Dowling, which became the Dowling Wing. In addition to the generosity of the Dowlings, many members of the community contributed to this addition which doubled the size of the Library. In 2006, the latest addition of the Library was completed. Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and our colleagues join me in congratulating the Morristown & Morris Township Public Library’s Willis Wing, on the occasion of its Centennial Anniversary. 
CONGRATULATING THE TAI LOOK MERCHANTS’ ASSOCIATION ON THEIR CENTENNIAL ANNIVERSARY GALA 
Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to congratulate the Tai Look Merchants’ Association on their Centennial Anniversary Gala. I thank you for your commitment to bettering the community of Chinatown and the community of New York City as a whole. The Tai Look Merchants’ Association was established on 1917 in Hong Kong but expanded to New York less than a decade later, and has been a part of our community ever since. For a century the Tai Look Merchants’ Association has contributed to the community through the mission, ‘‘for the love of the Country and Motherland.’’ Under the leadership of Teddy Mui and representing over a hundred members and small businesses, Tai Look Merchants’ Association has shown the good that can be done when people work together, from raising money for victims of the Sichuan Earthquake and Hurricane Katrina to holding local MidAutumn Festival celebrations for Chinatown’s seniors. As they celebrate 100 years of tremendous work, I am confident the Tai Look Merchants’ Association will continue to build on its history of service and find many more years of success. f 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Representative CASTRO for calling for this special order to discuss the ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya people from Burma. It’s a heartbreaking humanitarian disaster and daybyday the situation continues to deteriorate. Just today, Bangladesh Border Guards are reporting that more than 11,000 Rohingya refugees entered Bangladesh from Burma. These refugees are the result of the unprecedented level of violence in Burma’s Rakhine State. Because of this bloody conflict, more than half a million Rohingya—60 percent of whom are children—have fled as refugees across the border into Bangladesh. This is the swiftest exodus of any population since the 1994 Rwanda genocide and Serbia’s 1999 ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. The Burmese military has claimed that this brutal crackdown is the response to a clash that took place on August 25th, in which border security forces faced off against Rohingya insurgents reportedly using knives, small arms, and small explosives. But this isn’t a legitimate counterinsurgency or counterterrorism operation. The Burmese military and border security forces have specifically targeted Rohingya using medieval tactics: slash and burn, rape, indiscriminate killing. Twentyone square kilometers of villages systematically burned to the ground. As I see it, the only person in Burma who could put an end to the violence, clear the way for humanitarian aid, and allow for a full accounting of what has occurred is Min Aung Hlaing, Commander in Chief of the Burmese military. Unfortunately, the intentions of the military are clear: to remove the Rohingya people from Burma. Welcoming these refugees, thankfully, is the Government of Bangladesh, which is now hosting nearly a million Rohingya refugees. And while Bangladesh opens its doors, I consider it an embarrassment that the United States is closing ours. The Trump Administration has lowered our yearly cap on refugees from all over the world to 45,000 per year— the smallest number ever. As this crisis grew worse, Bangladesh took in that many people every four days. This policy harms American leadership in the world. It undermines our ability to speak credibly about refugees, human rights, or living up to basic international humanitarian principles. It diminishes our standing in a part of the world where China is only too happy to fill the void. The United States has allocated $38 million to assist with the crisis. That number seems grossly inadequate considering the scale of the humanitarian nightmare now facing the Government of Bangladesh and the Rohingya who have found refuge there. We need to do more, and that starts by shining a light on this tragedy. So I’m grateful to Mr. CASTRO , I’m grateful to all my colleagues who are putting this issue front and center. I hope that the Administration will give this crisis the focus and resources needed. This is a situation that calls for American leadership, and I’ll keep making the case in Congress that we can and must do more. 
IN APPRECIATION OF REGINA MILLEDGEBROWN AND HER SERVICE TO THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE 
Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, as the Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee, I join with my colleague, Representative SHEILA  JACKSON LEE, Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations, in expressing our appreciation for Regina MilledgeBrown’s service to the Committee. Regina has enjoyed a distinguished career in service to our Nation. Regina is an employee of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF), who joined us on detail at the beginning of this year. An attomey who graduated from the University of Georgia School of Law, Regina has worked for over fifteen years at ATF in various capacities. In her detail to the Committee, her experience with law enforcement and firearms issues has been an invaluable assistance to the Members and staff of the Committee. Regina has worked on a variety of important issues as the Committee has pursued its legislative and oversight agenda during 2017. In addition to her work on firearmsrelated issues, Regina has worked on issues such as hate crimes prevention, forensics, DNA identification, law enforcement grants, the protection of law enforcement officers, operation of federal prisons, reauthorization of the United States Secret Service, protecting the victims of trafficking, and preventing violence against women. In these and other legislative issues, Regina has displayed a high degree of professionalism and personal commitment, providing Members of the Committee and staff with wise counsel. 
In all of this, Regina has demonstrated magnanimity, energy, and enthusiasm, which has helped all of us immensely. We thank Regina for her selfless service to the Committee and our country, and wish her the very best as she returns to the ATF at the end of her detail. All of her colleagues here will miss her dearly and continue to value her friendship into the future. 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, America was deeply saddened by Friday’s tragic accident at Fort Jackson Army Base that claimed the lives of two brave soldiers and injured six others. Fort Jackson is a crown jewel of the Midlands of South Carolina. Established in 1917, Fort Jackson is the Army’s largest training center, where my three sons and I have trained. Maj. Gen. Pete Johnson is commanding with compassion and professionalism. We are grateful for the sacrifices of every soldier whose service brings them to Fort Jackson, and we consider each of them part of the Midlands family. Today, I would like to honor the memory of those soldiers: Pvt. Ethan Shrader, from Prospect, TN, and Pvt. Timothy Ashcraft, from Cincinnati, OH. They will never be forgotten. The following soldiers are still recovering from injuries: Pvt. Emmett Foreman, from Daleville, AL. Pvt. Hannah New, from Cartersville, GA. Pvt. Benjamin Key, from Livingston, TN. Pvt. Alan Kryszak, from Clarksville, TN. Pvt. Cardre Jackson Jr., from Laurel, MD. Pvt. James Foster, from Macon, GA. As the father of four sons who have served with the military, I would ask that everyone pray for those families who are grieving and for the speedy recovery of those who were injured. I know the opportunities for recruits to have fulfilling and meaningful lives through military service protecting American families. In conclusion, God Bless our Troops, and we will never forget September 11th in the Global War on Terrorism. 
Mr. YODER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the formation of the Unified Government of Wyandotte County and Kansas City, Kansas, and recognize the community and people who helped make the consolidation possible. In 1997, the governments of Kansas City, Kansas and Wyandotte County opted to consolidate into one entity in the effort to help the city and county become a prosperous community in Kansas. That vision and foresight led to 20 years of growth and prosperity in the area. I’ve witnessed firsthand some great successes of Wyandotte County in the last 20 years—rebuilding neighborhoods, diversifying the local economy and expanding the tax base. The consolidation has led to a better quality of life for residents, and a booming tourism industry for the state. The Kansas Speedway really led the way out west and Sporting KG’s Children’s Mercy Park stands out as one of the best, state of the art soccer stadiums across the country and the world. Mr. Speaker, the Unified Government should be proud of their successes on this 20th anniversary. I’m honored to represent this county in Congress and to be a part of their enriched community. Thank you to the local leaders and residents who came together to make this vision a reality. f 
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Special Agent Daniel ‘‘Danny’’ Ruiz for his outstanding work as Resident Agent in Charge (RAC) at the Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), a directorate within the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE). Special Agent Ruiz serves as RAC in the Fresno, California office. Special Agent Ruiz began serving as the Resident Agent in Charge at HSI Fresno on November 1, 2015 and was responsible for fulfilling the mission of HSI in Tulare, Merced, Madera, Mariposa, Fresno and Kings Counties. In his capacity as the Resident Agent in Charge at Fresno HSI, Danny is always available to discuss and work together on issues of concern with me and my staff. Danny has been a U.S. Government employee since 1994. Before his Fresno HSI assignment, Danny served in multiple capacities and positions in Newark, New Jersey; San Juan, Puerto Rico; Jacksonville, Florida; Dallas, Texas, and two separate tours in Washington, D.C. Danny holds a Bachelor of Arts Degree from Saint Peter’s University, Jersey City, New Jersey with a Major in Political Science and Minor in Criminal Justice. It is with great pleasure that I applaud and congratulate Daniel Ruiz for his many years of tireless work on behalf of the United States Government and to our local community. His ongoing dedication to public service is extremely commendable. I ask my colleagues to join me today in recognizing the commitment, dedication and success of Daniel ‘‘Danny’’ Ruiz, and wish him well as he embarks on new endeavors in his role with HSI Florida. INTRODUCTION OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION EMPLOYMENT AND TRANSPARENCY ACT HON. ANDRE´CARSON 
Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce the Higher Education Employment and Transparency Act. This important legislation would help ensure that students are adequately informed of their choices as they navigate the process of applying to college. While a college degree is as valuable as ever, the choices facing students as they attempt to choose the right school remain daunting. While most students cite employment as a prime motivator for college attendance, they nevertheless are often inadequately informed about the employment outcomes at various institutions of higher education and for various fields. Navigating the college application process is hard enough. While in some cases data on employment and earnings information does exist, in too many cases it is unclear or not easily accessible to prospective students. Making this information more transparent— and pointing prospective students in the right direction—would go a long way in ensuring that students are making the best choices tailored to their individual needs. The Higher Education Employment and Transparency Act seeks to tackle these challenges. This bill represents one piece ofthe puzzle to ensure data on higher education outcomes is presented in a manner that is clear, transparent, standardized, and above all easily accessible to prospective students. Without requiring the collection of new data, the bill would give students better access to higher quality information about the schools they are considering. The legislation would make a number of key changes: First, it would expand on current requirements for Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs) to disseminate certain information to prospective and enrolled students, through appropriate publications, mailings, and electronic media. The Higher Education Employment and Transparency Act would update this requirement to include disaggregated earnings and employment information, and require the use of data from more reliable sources. Second, it would expand and improve the College Navigator, which is already a useful tool presenting a variety ofinformation about IHEs. The Higher Education Employment and Transparency Act would require additional information to be included on this site, in addition to what is currently required: a link to a page with that same, higherquality information that IHEs are newly required to disclose; a link to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Occupational Outlook Handbook website, which includes regional data on starting salaries in all major occupations; and, a link to a website that provides information about former students’ employment and earnings information, based on highquality federal or state data. Last, under this legislation, IREs would also be required to provide prominent links on their own websites to each of these new pieces of information. 
While disagreements exist regarding potential longerterm changes to our higher education data regime, this bill is a key step that would improve students’ access to data that already exists. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. 
Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to an initiative launched to raise community funds and to rebuild parks—Midnight Circus in the Parks. The program is presented in part by the Chicago Park District’s Night Out in the Parks, which brings over 1,000 cultural events to neighborhood parks each year. The program is in its 5th year and the Night Out in the Parks series has brought more than 1,000 events to neighborhood parks throughout the City of Chicago, making community parks safe havens and hubs of cultural activity. Jeff Jenkins, founder and executive director of Midnight Circus in the Parks, envisioned a perfect opportunity to bring his circus to the community and raise money for park improvements. Midnight Circus tours Chicago parks every year bringing over 15,000 people together in their park to celebrate and make a difference. This venture is a true family collaboration; Jeffs wife, Julie, is the artistic director; their son, Maxwell, is an acrobat and musician in the show, and their daughter, Samantha, does the trapeze. Their rescued pit bull also performs. Every year, they add new and incredible artists. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the Jenkins Family for launching Midnight Circus in the Parks, and the Chicago Park District for having the vision to bring a circus to the Chicago communities and for all their countless hours of volunteer efforts. 
IN RECOGNITION OF LT. KEN HOBBS FOR BEING NAMED YPSILANTI’S 2017 FIREFIGHTER OF THE YEAR 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Lieutenant Ken Hobbs for being named 2017 Firefighter of the Year by the Washtenaw 100 Honors’ Board of Membership. He has distinguished himself through his outstanding public service and advocacy on behalf of the Ypsilanti Fire Department and community. Since joining the Ypsilanti Fire Department in 1986, Lt. Hobbs has worked tirelessly to protect Ypsilanti residents and promote a positive relationship between the department and city at large. The City of Ypsilanti Fire Department is a fulltime department that provides prevention and protective fire services to Ypsilanti and the Eastern Michigan University campus, and Lt. Hobbs is well regarded by the more than 40,000 constituents served by the department. Throughout his career, he has made it a priority to give back to the community he serves by holding community fire prevention and education workshops and attending various fundraisers throughout the year. In addition to being recognized as Washtenaw 100 Honors’ Firefighter of the Year, Lt. Hobbs has served as President of the Ypsilanti Firefighters Union for many years and has received widespread acclaim for promoting unity between the union and fire department. Additionally, he has played a key role in securing grants for the department through the Department of Homeland Security, which has allowed for increased firefighting staff and muchneeded equipment. Their success in securing federal grants over the years speaks to the quality of their applications and the great work being done by Lt. Hobbs and his fellow firefighters. Lt. Hobbs has also been instrumental in fostering greater diversity at the department and advocated for hiring a female firefighter with a 2014 Department of Homeland Security grant. His dedication and efforts on behalf of the city of Ypsilanti are worthy of commendation, and I know that Lt. Hobbs will continue his diligent work on behalf of the area residents in the coming years. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Lt. Ken Hobbs for being named Ypsilanti’s Firefighter of the Year. His advocacy and service on behalf of the citizens and firefighters of our community are worthy of public acclaim. f 
IN RECOGNITION OF JEFF CARROLL’S 20 YEARS OF SERVICE ON MY STAFF 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, it is my great privilege to honor my longtime Chief of Staff and the current Staff Director for the Energy & Commerce Committee Democrats, Jeff Carroll, on 20 outstanding years serving on my staff. My office, the Energy & Commerce Committee, the Congress, and the entire state of New Jersey have benefited enormously from Jeff’s steady leadership, strategic guidance, and commitment to achieving meaningful progress. Jeff is known on both sides of the aisle and on both sides of the Capitol for his candor, negotiating skills, and boisterous laugh. He is a diehard fan of the Mets, Giants, Bruce Springsteen, and the vaunted pork roll. He’s a Jersey guy, through and through. A native of Lyndhurst, N.J., Jeff joined my office as an Executive Assistant in 1997 after graduating from George Washington University and briefly serving as a Staff Assistant to Senator Robert Torricelli. Within six years, he became my Chief of Staff, serving with distinction the people New Jersey’s Sixth Congressional District for 12 years. In 2015, when I was elected the Ranking Member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, Jeff became the Democratic Staff Director. Jeff has been by my side through my greatest trials and achievements in office, relentlessly pushing forward and always holding himself and my staff to the highest standards. He is my most trusted advisor, and I thank him for his unwavering commitment and immeasurable contributions over the years. I also want to acknowledge the support provided to Jeff by his wife Shannon, daughter Lizzie and son Ryan, who share this dedicated husband and father with the House. Mr. Speaker, the American people have benefited from Jeff Carroll’s 20 years here in the House. I look forward to our continued work together in the future. f 
HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF MOTHER GENEVA GREEN RUSSELL 
Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mrs. Geneva Green Russell of Boynton Beach, Florida, who passed away at the age of 100 on May 6, 2017. Georgiaborn and Florida educated, Mother Russell received her primary education in Delray Beach public schools. Mother Russell spiritual life began at the young age of twelve. She was one of the charter members of the then, newly established Church of God in Boynton Beach and served over the years in numerous capacities, including church secretary, musician, and the Women’s Ministries President. On June 21, 1936, Mother Russell married Bishop Milton Russell of Abacoa, Bahamas, and alongside him ministered to the needs of her church, family, and community. She was also a passionate philanthropist, serving as past president of the Parent Teacher Association and distinct member of the Senior Citizens Community Help Club. During this time, she provided medical transportation for sick and elderly citizens and amongst her friends and neighbors, became the ‘‘Designated Driver’’ for her group known as the ‘‘Golden Girls.’’ Mother Russell led her family by example as a strong Christian loving mother, and endlessly server of her community. Fond memories of her will forever remain with her seven children: Milton Jr., Jean, Joyce, Marjorie, Bernard, Evelyn and Stanley; fifteen grandchildren, twentyone greatgrandchildren, and twelve greatgreatgrandchildren, along with many relatives and friends. Mr. Speaker, Mrs. Geneva Green Russell will be remembered by the many people she touched in her 100 years of life. She was truly a shining star of the Boynton Beach community. I am so pleased to honor her life and legacy. She will be dearly missed. 
Mr. HURD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 100th Anniversary of Fort Stockton Independent School District, a premiere public school district dedicated to the education of students in West Texas. 
Fort Stockton Independent School District was approved in the 35th state legislature on May 17, 1917. It is now home to five public schools and over 2,500 students, teachers, and staff. Over the past twoandahalf years, I have visited Fort Stockton Independent School District on numerous occasions. In fact, I was able to participate in the Coin Toss at a Panther football game this month. Today I applaud the graduates and countless faculty and staff members who have helped spread the knowledge, skills, and values they learned at Fort Stockton Independent School District with Texas, the United States, and the entire world. The positive impact of this public school system resonates across Texas’ 23rd Congressional District. 
INTRODUCTION OF THE HORSE TRANSPORTATION SAFETY ACT OF 2017 
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Horse Transportation Safety Act, a bill I introduced earlier today along with my esteemed colleague, Rep. JONES from North Carolina, to ensure the humane and safe transportation of horses. The Horse Transportation Safety Act seeks to end the exploitation of a regulatory loophole designed to ban the transport of horses in doubledeck trailers, whereby drivers have an incentive to inhumanely transport horses to assembly points, then reload them into single level trailers just outside their final destination. The practice is dangerous and inhumane not only to the horses, it poses a threat to the travelling public. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, ‘‘doubledeck trailers do not provide adequate headroom for equines, with the possible exception of foals and yearlings. We do not believe that trailers that have two or more permanent levels that are not collapsible can be adequately altered to accommodate adult equines, especially tall equines.’’ The legislation is strongly supported by agricultural interests and animal protection groups alike. Among the organizations endorsing the bill are the Humane Society of the United States, the Animal Welfare Institute, the National Black Farmers Association, and Return to Freedom Wild Horse Conservation. Moreover, in 2010 the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure unanimously adopted this bipartisan legislation. This is common sense legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support the swift passage of the Horse Transportation Safety Act. 
Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and congratulate the Harriet Tubman Press on the occasion of its first publication. The Harriet Tubman Press, an imprint of Tsehai Publishers, is an important new publishing platform based in Los Angeles, California. It is named after one of the great icons of American history, and it is one of the only imprints in the country dedicated to providing a platform for the voices of today’s African American scholars and writers. The Harriet Tubman Press is housed in the Marymount Institute for Faith, Culture, and the Arts at Loyola Marymount University, which is one of the centers of higher learning in my congressional district—the 43rd District in California. The first publication of the Harriet Tubman Press will be Voices from Leimert Park Redux, a diverse collection of poetry that beautifully captures the heartbeat of the Leimert Park community. For decades, this Los Angeles neighborhood has been a thriving beacon of AfricanAmerican activism, culture, and the arts. At a time when gentrification and displacement threaten neighborhoods across Southern California, the preservation of AfricanAmerican cultural heritage in Leimert Park could not be more important. I congratulate Loyola Marymount University, Tsehai Publishing, the Harriet Tubman Press, and all the members of the South Central Los Angeles community that worked so hard to make this first publication possible. Your dedication and fortitude is necessary to the preservation of the AfricanAmerican voice. I’d like to further thank the artists, authors, and poets who stand up and propel that voice into our country’s consciousness. Your voices are the only currency that can never be taken from you. May the first publication of the Harriet Tubman Press signal the birth of a new force devoted to propelling, celebrating, and highlighting AfricanAmerican culture through literature. f 
Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Ruby’s Place on the celebration of its 45th anniversary, to take place on Thursday, October 19. Ruby’s Place is a nonprofit organization founded in 1972 in Hayward, California. It was a pioneer in California in recognizing the need to provide shelter to victims of domestic violence. Ruby’s Place today provides services and shelter to homeless individuals and families, with a focus on helping victims of domestic violence and human trafficking. These services include a 24hour crisis hotline, case management, mental health treatment, and children’s programming. As this shows, Ruby’s Place helps people both in their time of immediate need and provides assistance so they can get back on their feet. Just as one example, during the 2015–2016 fiscal year, the counselors at Ruby’s Place answered over 4,500 calls on its crisis hotline and provided 724 individual counseling sessions. One hundred seventy of these sessions were with children who have been affected by domestic violence. I had the honor of recognizing Ruby’s Place on the House Floor in October 2013, in support of Domestic Violence Awareness Month. I am committed to continuing to fight domestic violence and working with organizations on the front lines, like Ruby’s Place. Over an amazing 45 years, about 6,000 adults and children have benefitted directly from Ruby’s Place. I am incredibly grateful for its commitment to securing stable housing and supportive services for those in need, and I am honored to represent it in Congress. Our community is better and stronger for its tireless efforts. I want to congratulate Ruby’s Place on stabilizing the lives of individuals and families in the Bay Area for the last 45 years, and I wish it continued success in the future. f 
HONORING THE HALL COUNTY REACT PROGRAM AND THE NEW WELDING SHOP 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the grand opening of the Hall County Correction Institute’s welding shop—a new addition to Hall County’s Re entry Accountability Court Transition program—which will equip inmates with skills that they can take with them as they reenter society. Since 2014, the local accountability court program has assisted offenders by providing vocational resources that can help deter recidivism and restore these individuals as productive members of the community. By allowing program participants to obtain state certifications in welding, the program will help people who will soon be released to find job security upon their departure. Criminal justice reform is a priority for northeast Georgia as it is for me in Washington, which is why I introduced the Prison Reform and Redemption Act to help lower recidivism rates among federal prisoners through vocational training and other evidencebased programs. Mr. Speaker, every person has value, and efforts like the Hall County Correction Institute’s welding shop recognize and seek to magnify that value and potential. Investing in all of our neighbors—even those who have broken the law—can pave the way for stronger, safer communities for every man, woman, and child. I thank Sheriff Couch and the Hall County Sheriff’s Department for their commitment to improving the lives of inmates, and look forward to seeing the impact that the welding initiative will make on northeast Georgia. 
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, family reunions are a great way of staying connected, strengthening bonds and recognizing heritage. 
As a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, I take this opportunity to commend and congratulate the Cardoza Family on the occasion of their 100th Anniversary and Family Reunion which was held at the Bird Ranch in Gustine, California on Saturday, September 9, 2017. There is nothing quite like a family reunion. Family from far and wide gather and share in the joy of fellowship, love and precious memories that reunions generate. Therefore, I commend and congratulate them and pray that they had a wonderful weekend. The Cardoza family story begins in the early 20th century. In approximately 1915–1916, Manuel S. Cardoza, an orphan, emigrated from the island of Terceira, Azores, Portugal. He was sponsored by his uncle, Joe S. Cardoza, and arrived to the San Joaquin Valley to work on his dairy farm. Manuel worked for room, board and a cow as his compensation. Their implied agreement was that as soon as Manuel had a string (15) of dairy cows he would go out on his own as a dairy farmer. He quickly accomplished his goal. At approximately the same time, Manuel Coelho emigrated from the island of Terceira, Azores, Portugal. His name has never appeared on any ship roster, but it is rumored that he was a stowaway destined for Stratford, California in the San Joaquin Valley. By 1916, Manuel had earned enough money to send for his family. Shortly thereafter, his wife, Rose, her daughters Lucy, Lucille, Olympia, and Margaret, and sons, John and Manuel, boarded the Cornucopia and sailed for the United States. Shortly after, Manuel S. Cardoza met Lucy Coelho, they married and started a dairy farm in partnership with another Azorean immigrant. The two were blessed with three sons and 5 daughters, whose descendants are here today. Through hard work, tenacity and faith, they survived World Wars and the Great Depression. They always managed to have enough to eat, clothes on their backs, and a roof over their heads. The first generation consisted of dairymen; a butcher; an HVAC specialist; and a grocer. The occupations of the second generation consist of a wine specialist; a graphic artist; a doctor; a nurse; a teacher; an accountant; HVAC specialists; a real estate appraiser; a real estate broker; a politician; a cattleman; an office manager; CEO and a medical supplies specialist. The third generation includes marketing professionals; lawyers; accountants; teachers; financial advisors; construction managers; a pharmacist; tech professionals; an environmental consultant; and a software engineer. What the next generation will achieve only time will tell. Mr. Speaker it with great pleasure that I congratulate the Cardoza family on the occasion of their 100th anniversary and family reunion. The Cardoza family truly embodies the American dream. They are one of hundreds of thousands of Portuguese that came and settled in California to seek the opportunities that our state has given to immigrants past and immigrants present. I ask that you join me in wishing them continued success and prosperity. DAVID DREIER RECEIVES ORDER OF THE AZTEC EAGLE AWARD 
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a friend, former colleague, and leader in promoting international cooperation and understanding, who was recently recognized by a key U.S. ally for his outstanding work. Last month, David Dreier received the Order of the Aztec Eagle, the highest honor bestowed to a foreign national by the Government of Mexico. Those of us who served with Representative Dreier know him as the former chairman of the House Rules Committee, as a faithful representative of his Southern California district for more than three decades, and as a forceful champion of democracy, free trade, and the rule of law. An avowed ‘‘Reagan Republican,’’ Dreier was instrumental in crafting many of our nation’s trade policies, including the North American Free Trade Agreement. What some may not realize is that Representative Dreier was also a leader in cultivating closer ties and cooperation between the United States Congress and its partner legislatures around the world. Through our work on the House Democracy Partnership (HDP)— which he served as the founding chairman and I as chairman during the years of Democratic leadership—we had the opportunity to work together to advance the cause of parliamentary democracy, traveling widely and memorably to parliaments from Peru to Pakistan and hosting dozens of delegations of visiting legislators and staff in Washington. During these engagements, Representative Dreier was a consummate diplomat and a skilled mentor, navigating sometimesdifficult bilateral issues but also the practical questions of how parliamentary institutions could be more effective. Our work together epitomized the maxim that partisanship should end at the water’s edge—a spirit that persists today under the leadership of current HDP chairman PETER  ROSKAM . While our work with HDP focused on less developed democracies, Representative Dreier always had a special interest in—and fondness for—the parliamentary democracy on our southern border, Mexico. He was an active member of the U.S.Mexico Binational Commission, a leader of the U.S.Mexico Interparliamentary Group, a cochair of the U.S.Mexico Congressional Caucus, and a frequent participant in congressional delegations to Mexico. During our work with HDP, he often invoked Mexico as an example of democratic development and spoke fondly of his work as an election observer in the country. It is fitting that Representative Dreier has been acknowledged for this work by receiving the Order of the Aztec Eagle, joining leaders such as President Eisenhower, Nelson Mandela, and Queen Elizabeth II as well as cultural icons such as Walt Disney, Pla ´cido Domingo, and Bono. I know I speak for many in extending him my warmest congratulation, and in wishing him well in his continued post congressional service. SCIENCE COMMITTEE COS JENNIFER Y. BROWN TO RETIRE HON. LAMAR SMITH 
Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow is Jennifer Young Brown’s last day as Chief of Staff of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee. For more than 28 years she has helped me represent the residents of the 21st District of Texas and, more recently, helped the Science Committee enact numerous policies that benefit the American people. Jennifer started working in my personal office after she graduated from the University of Colorado. She has held five different positions, including Chief of Staff. For several years, she served as COS both in the personal office and on the Science Committee, a rare double COS, before becoming the fulltime Science Committee Chief of Staff in 2016. Her talents and skills are many. She has mastered the difficult art of multitasking—no one does it better. Jennifer is simply a remarkable woman. She manages to balance well the demands of husband, children, school activities, Science Committee work, and friends, almost 200 of whom attended a reception for her yesterday. If Jennifer is going to leave us, at least it is for a worthy cause—Texas Tech University. Over the years Texas Tech has supplied our office with impressive interns and graduates and even made me an honorary alumnus. Jobs may end but friendships continue. Jennifer and her family—husband Barry, son Leighton, and daughter Gipson—will always be special friends and I know I will continue to see them often. So Jennifer, I thank you for all you have done for me. Her family is fortunate to have her as a role model. And I am fortunate to have had her influence on my life for over 28 years. As I’ve learned to say, ‘‘Go Raiders.’’ 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Vice Mayor Diane Glasser of Tamarac, Florida, who passed away Tuesday, October 10, 2017 at the age of 89. Diane was a woman who wore many hats in her time. She served as a Commissioner and Vice Mayor on the Tamarac City Commission, as Broward County’s State Committeewoman to the Florida Democratic Party, and as a delegate to six consecutive Democratic National Conventions. In an era when western Broward County was synonymous with massive developments of senior condos, Diane became a nationally known political powerhouse through her ability to bring the wardstyle organization from her native Brooklyn to the 5,000unit 55plus community known as Kings Point in Tamarac. If you were a candidate or elected representative planning to set foot in Kings Point, 
you did so only with Diane’s blessing. She was an indomitable civic force in our community and built a getoutthevote operation in the condos that brought thousands of seniors to the polls for each and every election. If Diane stumbled on a wrong, she was determined to make it right. She was a passionate advocate for the underserved, a defender of civil rights and someone who helped make Broward County a kinder, more compassionate community. She was a problemsolver and a leader, and brought people along where she saw a chance to make a positive impact on the lives of others. Her passing brings with it the end of an era in South Florida politics. Diane is survived by her two sons, Craig and Lloyd Glasser, and one granddaughter, Dara. 
Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD the following Proclamation: Whereas, Temple Beth El was founded in 1939 as Madison, Wisconsin’s first and only Reform Jewish congregation; and Whereas, Rabbi Jonathan Biatch has been the spiritual leader supporting the vision and mission of Temple Beth El since 2004; and Whereas, boys celebrate Bar Mitzvah when turning 13; and Whereas the Temple Beth El community proclaims Rabbi Jonathan Biatch a ‘‘Bar Mitzvah’’ celebrating his 13th year of service, Now, therefore, I congratulate Rabbi Jonathan Biatch on his 13 years of leadership at Temple Beth El. 
CONGRATULATING MAJOR GENERAL MIYAKO SCHANELY ON HER PROMOTION TO COMMANDING GENERAL OF THE 416TH THEATER ENGINEER COMMAND 
Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Major General Miyako Schanely on her assignment as the Commanding General of the 416th Theater Engineer Command. MG Schanely will lead the 416th Theater Engineer Command in conducting theater level engineer operations supporting a joint force, and execute unified land operations while providing a training and ready combat capable force to support mission requirements. MG Schanely has had a long history of serving her country. Since she received her commission as a Second Lieutenant in 1986, she has served in both active and reserve units of the U.S. Army for over 31 years. MG Schanely is a graduate of the Army War College and holds several civilian master degrees. Previously assigned as the Commander of the 102nd Training Division, MG Schanely has become the first female Japanese American to become commander of the Theater Engineer Command as a twostar and is ready to take on the challenges associated with this rapidly evolving role. On behalf of the 21st District of New York, I would like to congratulate MG Schanely on her welldeserved promotion, and wish her luck in her new role. I want to thank MG Schanely for her service to our country and for the sacrifices she will make in the years to come. f 
Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to Breast Cancer including one of the rarest, but most lethal forms, Inflammatory Breast Cancer, or IBC. One in eight women in the United States are diagnosed with Breast Cancer every year, and too many women die because of late diagnosis. Any opportunity to raise awareness is an opportunity to save lives. October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Although IBC is not the most common form of breast cancer, it is one of the most aggressive. It is critical that we recognize the severity of IBC and the importance of education and prevention efforts. IBC is not commonly known as it accounts for only 1 to 5 percent of all breast cancer cases. However, it is one of the most aggressive and deadliest forms of the disease. This form of cancer does not display the early symptoms ordinarily looked for by medical professionals. Since it is one of the rarest forms of Breast Cancer, many nursing and medical programs do not train students on IBC screening, leading to misdiagnosis and increased fatalities. The patients who start to show symptoms of this disease tend to be correctly diagnosed at stage 3, leaving little to no time to seek treatment. The courage of women battling Breast Cancer and IBC should not go unnoticed and they deserve our continued support for continued research efforts to seek for prevention and treatment for this deadly disease. 
Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, unfortunately on October 10, 2017, I missed Roll Call vote no. 558 and Roll Call vote no. 559 both under Suspension of the Rules due to familyrelated medical reasons. Had I been present, I would have voted ‘‘yes’’ on both. TRIBUTE TO BILL HENDERSON HON. JOE COURTNEY 
Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize Mr. William Henderson of East Lyme, upon his retirement, for his outstanding 47year career with the Connecticut Union of Telephone Workers/CWA and a lifetime of service to his community, country, and family. Mr. Henderson has dedicated himself to the Connecticut Union of Telephone Workers/ CWA as a steward and eventually as CWA Local 1298 president. Throughout his distinguished career, Bill has fought for justice and an even playing field in the workplace for men, women, and minorities. As a member of the CWA’s Family Care Committee, he has worked diligently to assist employees in balancing work and family life. Additionally, Bill has served his local communities of Waterford and East Lyme in countless roles, including as a member of the East Lyme Board of Education and the Waterford Board of Selectman, and as chairman of the Waterford Democratic Town Committee. He has coached little league, basketball, and lacrosse, and taught Sunday school. He is currently a deacon at Flanders Baptist Church and a justice of the peace. Bill has served not only his local community but also his country in the submarine force as a Navy sonar technician, achieving the rank of Second Class Petty Officer. He is the loving husband of Brenda and a father to four children and six grandchildren. On a personal note, Bill was a tireless supporter of mine in every campaign I’ve run— even when it wasn’t so easy during my first two races as a challenger. I will be forever grateful to him for his loyalty, amazing energy, and friendship over the years. Please join me in congratulating Mr. Henderson on an impressive career of service with the Connecticut Union of Telephone Workers and Communications Workers of America. We thank him for his unrelenting dedication to his community and wish him a wonderful retirement. 
Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Speaker, I was not present for roll call votes 560 through 563 because I was traveling to Pennsylvania with President Trump. Had I been present, I would have voted YEA on roll call No. 560, YEA on roll call No. 561, YEA on roll call No. 562, and YEA on roll call No. 563. 
Ms. BARRAGA´N. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because nearly 9 million children are in danger of losing health insurance. The Children’s Health Insurance Program has reduced the uninsured rate among children from 14 percent in 1997 to 5 percent, today. Nearly 30,000 children from my state, California, stand to lose their healthcare coverage this winter because of Congress’s failure to reauthorize this vital program. Healthcare is a human right, and working class families need affordable doctors for their kids. This is especially true for Latinos. More than half of Latino children have Medicaid or CHIP coverage. Congress must act immediately to pass a fiveyear extension for CHIP funding. Every day we delay, we give families another reason to worry—that their son or daughter will fall sick and they won’t be able to afford a doctor. That ongoing care for a chronically ill child will become too expensive. That hospitals will close their doors to them. It’s time to stop playing politics and get to work on a bipartisan reauthorization for CHIP. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Diane Glasser, a committed public servant in South Florida who passed away on October 10th at 89 years of age. Diane served for over 40 years as an activist, Broward School Board member, City Commissioner, and Vice Mayor of the City of Tamarac. From her childhood and career in Brooklyn to her many years in South Florida, her passion for activism made an impact on everyone she met. She was never shy about urging others to fulfill their civic duty by voting, even when she wasn’t on the ballot. And she was always encouraging of my efforts, working with me on many initiatives to strengthen the community. In addition to holding elected office, Diane served on several boards, including the Senior Advisory Task Force and the Broward Human Rights Board. She selflessly used her voice to advocate for those whose voices she felt weren’t adequately heard. Diane also had unique experiences representing the State of Florida as a delegate to the past six Democratic National Conventions and as an elector in the 1996 and 2000 Electoral Colleges. Our community has lost a leader whose service will always be appreciated and remembered. I am honored to have called Diane Glasser my friend. HONORING THE CAREER OF LOU PARDINI HON. JIM COSTA 
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the legendary career of Mr. Lou Pardini. Lou is a Grammy nominated keyboardist, vocalist, composer and Fresno, California native. For the last 8 years he has been a member of the legendary rock band Chicago. Lou has successfully worked alongside various high profile musicians throughout his career. He is a distinguished composer that has base fans all over the world. Lou Pardini was born in Omaha, Nebraska and raised in Fresno. He attended local schools including my alma mater San Joaquin Memorial High School. Lou would go on to attend Fresno City College and California State University, Fresno. Eventually he enrolled at the renowned Berklee School of Music in Boston to follow in his favorite musician’s footsteps. Lou met and married the love of his life Betsey and the two would eventually move to Los Angeles, where Lou could fully pursue his music career. Lou’s natural talent was apparent early on in his childhood. He could easily perform songs on the piano by ear. His parents took notice and enrolled him in private guitar and piano lessons when he was just five years old. As he grew older his taste in music progressed. Among his favorite artists were Stevie Wonder, Donny Hathaway, Marvin Gaye, Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, and Black Sabbath. Lou is a remarkable multitalented artist. He is known for his work with Stevie Wonder, The Doobie Brothers, The Temptations, Elton John, Smokey Robinson, Earth, Wind and Fire, Patti Austin, Larry Carlton and many more. He has worked with artists in Rock/Pop, R&B, Jazz, Blues and Gospel genres. Lou’s biggest break came when his song ‘‘Just To See Her’’ was recorded by the legendary Smokey Robinson. The song won Smokey his first and only Grammy for ‘‘Best Rhythm and Blues Vocal’’. Lou has also recorded two solo albums which are fan favorites to this day. In 2009, he got a call that would truly change his life. Following the departure of longtime member Bill Champlin, Lou was asked to join Chicago on a permanent basis. This was the culmination of a career marked by hard work and a true passion for his craft. He continues to build his fan base around the world. As a member of Chicago, Lou tours the world, drawing sellout crowds wherever they go. On April 8, 2016, Chicago was inducted into the 31st Rock and Roll Hall of Fame cementing their place in history. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I ask that you to join me in celebrating the career of Lou Pardini as he makes his homecoming to the city of Fresno. We are honored to have Chicago performing today at the Big Fresno Fair. I ask you to join me in wishing Lou and his family continued success and prosperity. HONORING THE LIFE OF LESTER MANDELL HON. STEPHANIE N. MURPHY 
Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life of Lester Mandell, who transformed countless communities in central Florida though his work as a builder and transformed countless lives through his generosity as a philanthropist. Lester passed away recently at the age of 96, leaving behind a large and loving family, but his legacy will live on. Born in a hardscrabble Brooklyn neighborhood, and a veteran of World War II, Lester did not graduate from college. However, neither his lack of formal education nor the anti Semitism he frequently faced could stop Lester from achieving his professional goals, because they were no match for his talent, tenacity and toughness. Lester’s life was a quintessentially American story of success earned though hard, disciplined, joyful work. As one of Lester’s grandsons said about his grandfather: ‘‘He believed that, if you did things the right way, you would get the right result.’’ This is the essence of character. Lester was a master builder, in both the literal and figurative sense. The homes, neighborhoods, and public parks he developed throughout central Florida over the course of many decades are his most visible legacy. Lester also built bonds of a more intangible nature. He donated generously to many causes he cared about, from scholarships for innercity children to support for the Jewish community he loved so much. Lester often donated anonymously and rarely spoke about his donations, even to his own family. As his grandson recounts, Lester was a serious man who did serious work, but he did not take himself too seriously. He had a sense of humor and lightheartedness that disarmed friend and stranger alike. Lester’s greatest legacy, of course, is his family. He leaves behind his wife and partner for life, Sonia. They were married for 70 years. Sonia and Lester had four children, eight grandchildren, and five greatgrandchildren. I know they miss Lester. But I hope their loss is eased by the knowledge that Lester was a great man and, even more importantly, a good man. 
PAYING TRIBUTE TO LOCAL SOUTH FLORIDA ARTIST, XAVIER CORTADA 
Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to a constituent and local South Florida artist, Xavier Cortada, and congratulate him on his inaugural art exhibit titled ‘‘Florida Is’’ at the Hibiscus Gallery at Pinecrest Gardens. Throughout the years, Xavier’s passion has been to generate awareness for our environment and global climate change through his art work. His work is included at my alma mater, Florida International University, where he serves as ArtistinResidence. 
His current exhibit ‘‘Florida Is’’ truly allows viewers to immerse themselves in the beauty of Florida’s natural beauty. His exhibition will be available until November 15th at Pinecrest Gardens where visitors will have the opportunity to connect with his incredible art while walking around the garden. Mr. Speaker, I would once again like to congratulate Xavier Cortada and invite my fellow colleagues to celebrate our nation’s artists and their endeavor to change the world through the power of art. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, as we heard yesterday in testimony from General Wald, the Iran deal ‘‘places Iran on a trajectory to become as intractable a challenge as North Korea is today—and very possibly worse.’’ The general noted that ‘‘while Pyongyang’s relentless pursuit of nuclear weapons has only deepened its isolation and driven it toward bankruptcy, the JCPOA is doing the opposite for Iran.’’ It was clear from the beginning that this deal was deeply flawed. It was clear that it was based on a fundamentally misguided premise: that Iran’s manifest desire for a nuclear weapon could be considered separate from its development of a delivery capacity for that weapon or from the rest of Iran’s violent campaign for regional hegemony. It should be selfevident that a nuclear warhead without a delivery vehicle is not going very far very fast. Iran’s ballistic missile program is inseparable from its desire to impose nuclear blackmail on the U.S., Israel, and other regional allies. Iran also exports its extremist revolution through proliferation of conventional weapons to terrorist proxies. The deal gave Iran an infusion of an estimated $115 billion dollars in unfrozen assets—and as John Kerry said in an interview that was carried by CNN, we don’t know where that money is going and it will probably wind up in the terrorists’ hands— not to mention other financial sweeteners like the $1.7 billion in small bills. As we heard yesterday, this money has helped Iran extend its malign influence to an unprecedented extent across the region—in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, and Yemen. I’d like to thank Chairman ROYCE for his leadership on Iran these past several years, of which yesterday’s hearing was but one example. Today we are considering one key measure, the Chairman’s H.R. 1698, the Iran Ballistic Missiles and International Sanctions Enforcement Act, which enjoys broad support in the House with 320 cosponsors. This bill expands sanctions against organizations and individuals that facilitate Iran’s ballistic missile program as well as its trade in conventional weapons. This bill is critical to our national security and that of our allies in the region, especially our good friend and ally Israel. It’s time we start turning the tide back against Iran to guarantee that it never realizes its genocidal designs on the Jewish State or the other freedomloving peoples of the region. We help do that by passing H.R. 1698 out of committee. It is a bill I have cosponsored and I strongly support. I also strongly support the Taiwan Travel Act (H.R. 535) and commend Chairman CHABOT for introducing this legislation, of which I am a cosponsor. The Communist Party leadership in China has tried to isolate democratic Taiwan, pressuring countries to break diplomatic relations and bullying the UN and multilateral agencies, such as the World Health Organization and INTERPOL, to exclude Taiwan from membership. These actions have created needless blind spots in global antiterrorism cooperation and hampered coordination on key global health issues. Just this March, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) confirmed the first human fatality from the H7N9 avian flu in Taiwan. This is a pressing global concern, as we know that SARS virus spread from Mainland China and Taiwan in past. The U.S. and Taiwan are cooperating in containing H7N9 virus, as we did 14 years ago to contain SARS. As such, China’s actions to exclude Taiwan from the WHO and other international bodies is dangerous and unacceptable. Taiwan should be allowed to join the WHO. It is not only an interest of Taiwan, it is in the interest of global public health. Restrictions on the travel of Taiwanese officials to the U.S. and on highlevel U.S. officials to Taiwan are selfimposed rules intended to placate Mainland China. In the current strategic climate, these rules are now counterproductive and the policy should be changed. We should be expanding cooperation with Taiwan on a number of fronts, particularly now that Communist China has stepped up efforts to isolate and bully democratic Taiwan. If China persists in its efforts to exclude Taiwan from international bodies like Interpol and WHO and the International Civilian Aviation Organization, the U.S. should be sending cabinet level officials from HHS, Transportation, and the Justice Department to consult with Taiwanese officials—and to host their counterparts here in Washington. Such meetings will advance and protect American interests. Under Xi Jinping’s leadership, China has become more repressive domestically, more protectionist in its trade policies, and more assertive globally. As documented by the CongressionalExecutive Commission on China (CECC), which I cochair with Senator MARCO  RUBIO, China’s domestic repression is the fuel for its international aggression, threatening American jobs and security, including in the South China Sea, in the Taiwan Straits, and in Hong Kong, where the ‘‘one country, two system’’ model is fast eroding. China has also imprisoned Taiwanese citizen and democracy advocate Lee Mingche, whose wife Lee Chingyu, sat in this very room in July at a hearing I chaired and asked the international community to work for her husband’s release. China will never be happy with U.S.Taiwan policy or the Taiwan Relations Act. Communist China will never be placated by our selfimposed restrictions on travel and consultations. We should not try. As China squeezes Taiwan’s international space and openly threatens it militarily, the U.S. must have more direct consultations with democratic Taiwan, not less. HONORING EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE AND THE LEGACY OF CAPTAIN CHARLES E. YEAGER HON. KEVIN McCARTHY 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an integral component of California’s 23rd Congressional District and the U.S. Air Force—Edwards Air Force Base—and the life and legacy of Captain Charles E. Yeager, who played an essential role in achieving a critical milestone in U.S. aviation history. This year, the United States Air Force observes its 70th birthday. Edwards Air Force Base, the second largest base in the Air Force, has long played an important role in the success and development of this branch and its weaponry. From the 412th Test Wing to the NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center, Edwards has always been a leader in developing and testing new technology to ensure that our warfighters operate with the most advanced weapons systems and platforms. Coincidentally, the Air Force also celebrates the 70th anniversary of the very first supersonic flight, which occurred at Edwards Air Force Base, this year. Captain Charles E. Yeager became the fastest man in the sky on October 14, 1947, when he flew faster than the speed of sound in the rocketpowered Bell X–1, high above Edwards and over Southern California’s famed Mojave Desert. Captain Yeager paved the way for a new era of air and space travel on that day and ushered in the development and eventual practical use of the XPlane, an advancement that has greatly benefited NASA and the U.S. Air Force. I want to recognize Captain Yeager’s fearlessness and desire for adventure, which was pivotal in advancing American aviation. Throughout its history, Edwards Air Force Base has always remained on the forefront of various scientific initiatives and discoveries. After Captain Yeager broke the sound barrier, pilots at Edwards were eventually able to fly at more than six times the speed of sound. Additionally, and among many other accomplishments, the very first space shuttle mission landed at Edwards on April 12, 1981. As we celebrate the Air Force’s 70th year, it is important to take a moment to recognize the rich legacy and history of installations like Edwards, which, having been established in 1933, predates the creation of the Air Force itself. Prior to the establishment of the United States Air Force in 1947, Edwards was the Muroc Army Airfield. I am reminded of Edwards Air Force Base every time I get the opportunity to visit the Smithsonian’s Air and Space museum here in Washington, D.C. The very Bell X–1, in which Captain Yeager broke the sound barrier, is displayed in the main hall on the first floor of the museum. It serves as a reminder of the critical importance that Edwards has played to advance the greater mission of the Air Force. I am incredibly grateful for the many men and women who have served and currently serve at Edwards Air Force Base. Their creativity, dedication, and sacrifice reflects the same spirit that Captain Charles Yeager exemplified 70 years ago. Edwards plays an important role in California’s 23rd Congressional District, and this is due to my constituents who 
work tirelessly to innovate and to further its mission. I wish Edwards, and the United States Air Force, many more years of innovation and success. 
Ms. ROYBALALLARD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate All Peoples Community Center, a communitybased organization in my 40th Congressional District, on the celebration of its 75th Anniversary. The center was originally founded as All Peoples Christian Center in the 1920s, in the historic area of South Los Angeles. During World War II, the center was vacated due to the tragic relocation of its Japanese American members to internment camps. In 1942, Pastor Dan Genung and his wife Frances moved from Chicago to Los Angeles with the primary goal of establishing a church, and founded the All Peoples Christian Church. Pastor Genung was hired to minister to the remaining Japanese American families and other community members who were African American, Latino, Armenian, and Chinese, and this multicultural community made an impact on Pastor Genung’s vision to turn the church into a ‘‘house of prayer for all peoples.’’ Over time, Pastor Genung saw the need to minister to not only the spiritual needs of the people in the community, but to their social needs as well. In the early history of the church, the minister served both as the pastor to the church and the executive director of the community center. Until 1964, the church and center worked as a single entity, which allowed both of them to pursue their separate but united goals. Over its 75year history, All Peoples has survived numerous changes in demography and culture while continuing to serve thousands of clients. The center is—and has always been—a safe haven, a beacon of hope and help, and a problem solving resource for the community of South Los Angeles. In the 1960s, All Peoples responded to the civil rights movement by opening its doors to social activists for dialogue and discussion. Cesar Chavez and farm workers were hosted onsite during their campaign to defend immigrants’ rights. During the 1965 Watts Riots, All Peoples remained open and distributed food to community members due to local markets being burned to the ground or closed. As the community transitioned from African American to Latino in the 1970s, the center responded to its new neighbors by hiring staff who were bicultural, and who spoke both English and Spanish. In addition, multicultural activities were held at All Peoples to build a sense of community that was inclusive of the changing demographics in South Los Angeles. All Peoples has become, and continues to be, one of Los Angeles’ most senior and trusted placebased community organizations. It helps diverse, economically challenged residents measurably improve and transform their own lives by providing a comprehensive range of vital services, leadership, and handson care. Through hard work, perseverance, and dedication to the community, Saundra Bryant has been the Executive Director of All Peoples for the past 34 years. Her first experience with All Peoples was as a twoyearold in the center’s day care facility. She continued to participate in the center’s programs throughout her adolescence, and served as a summer employee during college. Her commitment and passion for her community is demonstrated by her lifelong tenure of serving others. In 2016, All Peoples was designated by the City of Los Angeles Housing and Community Investment Department to operate as the new FamilySource Center for the Southeast area of Los Angeles. The center’s philosophy has an emphasis on education as the tool for successful community building. Thus, all of its programs have an educational component that integrates entire families and individuals. All Peoples is also committed to providing employment opportunities and leadership development to all community members. All Peoples offers its neighbors a comprehensive afterschool program, parenting and women’s leadership classes, community microfarming, financial literacy and health education workshops, case management, food distribution, a VITA Center, and the Retired and Senior Volunteer Program (RSVP). It also offers YouthSource, FamilySource, and WorkSource services that provide training to new employees, and retraining to those whose traditional skills have become obsolete; immigration services, which provide residency establishment, legal services, and education about basic rights and obligations; English as a Second Language classes; domestic violence support groups and counseling; and extended day care. All Peoples Community Center is proudly celebrating its 75th Anniversary of continuous service to the community, and will hold its annual gala on October 19, 2017. The 75th Anniversary gala will feature awards for three special honorees. First, actress, model, and recording star Meredith O’Connor will receive the Inspiration Award for her strong public advocacy on bullying and domestic violence issues. Ms. O’Connor is also a Celebrity Youth Ambassador for United Nations Project 50/50. The Dan B. Genung Visionary Leadership Award will be given to Anne Tremblay, Director of the Los Angeles Mayor’s Office Gang Reduction and Youth Development Program. The Joe Ide Spirit of Community Award will be given to Ricardo Mendoza, Associate Vice President for Community Outreach and Business Development for Lee Andrews Group, a public relations firm. I hope my colleagues will join me in sending best wishes and congratulations to All Peoples Community Center on its 75th Anniversary. The center has played a vital role in providing services to families in South Los Angeles over the past 75 years. I wish All Peoples Community Center continued success as it continues to enhance and empower our communities. TRIBUTE TO THOMAS DAY, JR. HON. KEN CALVERT 
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to Thomas Day, Jr., who was tragically killed during the massacre at the Route 91 Harvest country music festival in Las Vegas, Nevada on Sunday, October 1, 2017. Tom was born and raised in my hometown of Corona, California. He will be greatly missed. After graduating from Corona High School, Tom attended Riverside Community College and later went to work for the home building company, Portrait Construction, that was founded by his father. Those who worked with Tom knew him as someone who was easy to talk to and get along with. Tom Sr., Tom Jr. and the entire Day family have been active members of the Corona community for many years and made a number of contributions to many organizations in and around the city. Tom Jr. had many passions in life. He loved sports and rooting for the Los Angeles Angels and Pittsburgh Steelers. He especially loved playing and coaching baseball. Attending concerts and music festivals with his children was a winwin for Tom because it allowed him to do two things he loved at one time—listen to music and spend time with his family. Tom was attending the Route 91 Harvest country music festival with his children when he was senselessly taken from us, along with so many others. Our hearts ache for all of those whose lives were cut short and forever impacted by the evil acts of that evening. I had the distinct privilege of knowing Tom and the Day family for many years, and there are simply no words that soften the heartbreaking loss of Tom’s kind and caring soul. I extend my heartfelt condolences to his daughters Whitney, Candice and Kelsey, his son Nolan, the extended Day family, as well as his friends and colleagues. Although Tom may be gone, I know that the joy and happiness he brought to those around him will endure. 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Lumpkin County’s Deputy Coroner Frank Goss. Recently, the Georgia Coroner’s Association awarded him the title of Deputy Coroner of the Year—a hardearned honor given to only one nominee each year. When Deputy Coroner Goss first assumed leadership in the Lumpkin County Coroner’s office, he had a difficult job ahead of him. Fortunately for my friends in Lumpkin County, he wasn’t afraid to rise to the occasion—to put in the extra hours, to make the tough decisions, and to offer support to families as they grieve the loss of a loved one. Deputy Goss’s empathy for his community, along with his professional experience, made him the obvious choice for Deputy Coroner of the Year. 
Mr. Speaker, adversity cultivates strength in leadership—as exemplified by Deputy Goss. I thank him for his service to our friends and neighbors back home, and applaud him for his new title and the continued impact that he will make on northeast Georgia. 
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate Arte Ame´ricas on the occasion of their 30th anniversary. Arte Ame´ricas is the largest Latino Cultural Arts Center in the San Joaquin Valley, located in the heart of my district in downtown Fresno, California. Since its creation 30 years ago, Arte Ame´ricas has made a significant impact on the Valley by making the arts accessible to the local community. Beginning in rented space in downtown Fresno in 1987, Arte Ame´ricas has developed into a significant center on Van Ness Avenue, housing the Valley’s Latino arts culture. Arte Ame´ricas serves the important role of both preserving Latino culture and introducing it to the Valley. The museum not only showcases Arts in Mexico, Latin America, the Southwest, and California, but an array of cultures from throughout the Central Valley. Arte Ame ´ricas has become a hub of activity for the Latino and arts communities, frequently hosting receptions, meetings and special presentations. They frequently collaborate with local groups furthering their mission ‘‘To make Central California a flourishing place for Latino arts.’’ Over the years Arte Ame´ricas has been fortunate to have the support of a truly dedicated and vibrant staff, board members, and devoted volunteers. Their hard work has been the key to their years of successful events, installations and exhibits. Over the years poets, musicians, playwrights, novelists, sculptors, writers, dancers, and painters both local and from across the world have been featured at Arte Ame´ricas. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in commemorating Arte Ame´ricas’ 30th anniversary. I look forward to the opportunity to continue to work together to further the arts in the Central Valley. Once again, congratulations on this special milestone.
