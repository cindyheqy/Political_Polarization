Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about the challenges that we face, not only in my constituency as it relates to California agriculture, but a host of other issues as well. We are in the process of trying to reauthorize the farm bill, something we do every 4 years. It used to be—and we hope it will continue this year—one of the more bipartisan efforts we are engaged in. I represent not only the heartland of the San Joaquin Valley, but thirdgeneration farmer. Last week—as I do every weekend when I go home—I was walking the rows of the almond trees on my ranch outside of Fresno, California. They are beautiful. They are in full bloom this time of year. There is not a time, though, in the year, in the San Joaquin Valley, where the incredible bounty of the 300 crops that we grow are not on display because they are always out there. The blossoms in the spring grow into the almonds, walnuts, and pistachios until late summer. Tomatoes are harvested in August and September, followed by cotton in October and November. The dairymen and dairy processors work every day because those cows have to be milked every day year round to produce the finest quality milk, cheese, and butter. As I walked through my orchard, I remembered the countless stories and insights by my fellow California farmers, ranchers, dairymen and women shared with me over the past year, and I think about my father, who farmed all of his life, and my grandfather. In anticipation of the 2018 farm bill, I have held round tables and listening sessions, attended agriculture townhalls, and met with our farmers and farm workers, who, every day, work so hard to put those food products on America’s dinner table. I have done this to hear firsthand the concerns and priorities of our local producers, farm workers, and nutrition organizations regarding our Nation’s food supply. I have also had numerous meetings with key agriculture and trade officials, including Agriculture Secretary Perdue, who has been out to California a number of times. And as we in Congress move together with farm bill negotiations, we must maintain strong support for the cultivation and production of fresh fruits and vegetables, which are the foundation of a healthy diet. California produces over half of the Nation’s fruits and vegetables. It is truly amazing. Three hundred crops. We must also make sure that we do not abandon our Nation’s most vulnerable through inhumane cuts to the nutrition programs that provide a steady source of food to our Nation’s food supply. We are talking about our safety net, we are talking about the SNAP program, and we are talking about Women, Infants, and Children. This has been part of the glue on a bipartisan basis that has kept Democrats and Republicans together in the reauthorization of the farm bill. But we must have a safety net for those who are most unfortunate in our society. We should work to expand foreign markets for our products and to incentivize sound conservation practices and research. Research is very important to ensure the sustainability. Sustainability is critical—and continued growth of American agriculture. We have the opportunity with the farm bill to address the crippling agriculture labor crisis afflicting our farms, and it must be addressed as we look at a broken immigration system that not only impacts our Dreamers— the DACA program—but a reliable supply of farm labor. These are all among the issues that we must address to ensure that our Nation’s food supply is reliable, because, guess what, it is a national security issue. People don’t look at it that way. People go into the grocery store and they think: Well, what is the problem; grocery stores have all the food in the world. They go to the restaurants, and they have all the food that you need. But the food doesn’t go to the grocery store or to those restaurants without it being grown by America’s men 
and women who labor—less than 3 percent of the Nation’s population—to produce the finest, highest quality, greatest yield, most nutritious food anywhere in the world, every night on America’s dinner table. That is why we must come together— Democrats and Republicans—to improve our Nation’s food supply by passing a strong, bipartisan farm bill. 
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act, otherwise known as VAWRA. Protecting the Violence Against Women Act is one of our top priorities in the Victims’ Rights Caucus, a bipartisan House caucus that Congressman TEDPOEand I organized some 10 years ago. b1015 The law seeks to both prevent violence in our communities and provides services to survivors of violence, in part, by encouraging collaboration among local law enforcement, traditional personnel, and the private sector organizations, NGOs. In my district, these organizations collaborate, and they have been vital in helping survivors of violence. We must have numerous organizations working tirelessly together to support the victims of crime. In my district, they include the Marjaree Mason Center, Central California Legal Services, Choice Women Empowerment, Centro La Familia, and Valley Crisis Center. This is critical to end violence not only in our valley, but in our Nation, and that is why we must come together to end this violence, to ensure that the survivors have access to services for essential recovery. We cannot stop, and we must end this horrendous violence once and for all. That is why we must support the Violence Against Women Act. 
CONGRATULATING THE CITY OF ALTON, ILLINOIS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST) for 5 minutes. Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the city of Alton, Illinois. Alton was selected from hundreds of cities nationwide to be featured on the reality TV show ‘‘Small Business Revolution—Main Street.’’ The city will also receive a $500,000 investment for its small businesses. Alton has a rich history. It is home to historic buildings, and has a deep manufacturing heritage. It was the site of one of the LincolnDouglas debates, a route on the Underground Railroad, and home to blues musician Miles Davis and history’s tallest man, 8foot 11inch Robert Wadlow. These days, Alton is undergoing a small business revolution, from a self pour craft beer taproom to a post office converted into a small business hub. And new businesses are popping up all over. It is an exciting time for the Alton community, and they can’t wait to show the Nation southern Illinois’ spirit of innovation. RECOGNIZING THE DETERMINATION OF ROWDY  
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the determination of a young man from my hometown of Murphysboro, Illinois. Rowdy Loyd has cerebral palsy and a nerve disorder, but that has not stopped him from trying out for the Murphysboro Red Devils basketball team year after year. While he hasn’t made the official roster, he serves as team manager. Going to every game all through his high school career, and every practice, Rowdy had a constant presence with the team, coaches, and our community. Last month, Rowdy finally got the chance to see game time. Rowdy scored 10 points on the night, including a buzzerbeating 3point shot. In Rowdy’s own words: 
I got a whole lot of school behind my back, and my family. I’ve got a lot of people that support me. So it was awesome to know that they all came to the game to watch me play. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today, if I could, to take a moment. I would like to read a part of a particular proverb, Proverbs 31:10–31: 
An excellent wife, who can find? She is more precious than jewels. The heart of her husband trusts in her, and he will have no lack of gain. She does him good and not harm in all the days of her life. She seeks wool and flax and works with willing hands. She is like merchant ships; she brings her food from afar. She rises while it is yet night and provides food for her household and portions for her maidens. She considers a field and buys it, and from the fruit of her hands she plants the vineyards. She dresses herself with strength and makes her arms strong. She perceives that the merchandise is profitable, and her lamp does not go out at night. She puts her hands to the distaff and her hands to the spindle. She opens her hand to the poor and reaches out her hands to the needy. She is not afraid of snow, for all her household is clothed with scarlet. She makes bed coverings for herself. Her clothing is fine linen and purple. Her husband is known in the gates when he sits among the elders of the land. She makes linen garments and sells them. She delivers sash to the merchants. Strength and dignity are her clothing, and she laughs at time to come. She opens her mouth in wisdom, and the teaching of kindness is on her tongue. She looks well to the ways of her household and does not eat the bread of idleness. Her children rise up and call her blessed. Her husband also, and he praises her: Many women have done excellently, but you surpass them all. Charm is deceitful and beauty is vain, but a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised. Give her the fruit of her hands, and let her works praise her in the gates. Mr. Speaker, many may ask why I would read such a Scripture this day on the floor. Well, because 38 years ago, tomorrow, I married a beautiful young woman who has grown to become the very woman described in this Scripture. She is very beautiful and very charming, but most of all, she is virtuous. With that, I want to wish her an early happy anniversary. I love you, Tracy. 
IN DEFENSE OF DREAMERS AND THOSE WHO BROUGHT THEM HERE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. ALGREEN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor for me to rise today in defense of Dreamers and those who brought them here. I rise in defense of them, Mr. Speaker, because, quite frankly, there was a desire for persons to come here. There was a desire for them to come and to work, and to work at wages that some considered subpar, a desire for them to work under conditions that were not the best. There was a desire for them to come, and they came. I rise in defense of them because, Mr. Speaker, we are complicit in this behavior. We were complicit because we knew they were coming, and we wanted them to come. I rise in defense of them because I don’t believe that a country as great as the United States of America can ask young people to accept a pathway to citizenship but not give it to the people who brought them here: their parents, in most cases, but, in a good many cases, other persons who cared for them. To ask these young people to sell out their parents, to borrow a term that we use, is more than a great nation should ask of young people; to say to them, ‘‘You can stay, but your parents may have to go,’’ what kind of country are we if we demand this of young people who came with people whom we wanted to come, who have done us no harm, who have worked hard in our kitchens, who have worked hard cleaning our homes, who have worked hard tending our fields, who worked hard bringing in the fruits of the labor that they brought to this country? What kind of country says, ‘‘You are going to go back,’’ after many years of being here, and send the young people back to places of which they know very little? Mr. Jose Escobar is a case in point. He was sent back to San Salvador. He hadn’t been there in many, many years. He came here around 15 years of age. Mr. Speaker, now is the time for this country to take the affirmative action to correct what will be an injustice if we pursue the path that the President would have us pursue. Now is the time 
for us to make sure that every person is receiving the kind of liberty and justice for all that we extol in the Pledge of Allegiance. Now is the time for us to make sure that all of these young people are given the opportunity to succeed on their merits or fail on their demerits in the country that they know as home. Mr. Speaker, we are a great country. A great country does not do what the President is proposing, and I will not stand with the President on this. I stand and defend the Dreamers and the people who brought them here: in most cases, their parents. This is what a great nation ought to do. I know that there may be people who differ, but when you are standing on right, you don’t worry about those who differ. This is the right thing for the United States of America to do. 
CONGRATULATING SCHRACK FARMS ON ITS 2018 INNOVATIVE DAIRY FARMER OF THE YEAR AWARD The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON ) for 5 minutes. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Schrack Farm Resources of Loganton, Pennsylvania, for being named the 2018 Innovative Dairy Farmer of the Year. The national award celebrates U.S. dairy producers that apply creativity, excellence, and forward thinking to achieve greater onfarm productivity and improved milk marketing. The award is presented annually by the International Dairy Foods Association and Dairy Herd Management magazine. Mr. Speaker, Schrack Farm Resources has a rich history in Clinton County. Located in the heart of farm country, Schrack Farms is operated by Jim and Lisa Harbach and Kevin Schrack. Lisa and Kevin are siblings. They run the farm with the help of their children and grandchildren, who now represent the 11thgeneration farmers of the land. Yes, that is right; Schrack Farm Resources has been in operation since 1773, 3 years before the Declaration of Independence was even issued. They have 22 fulltime employees and some parttime help as well. The owners said it is teamwork that makes it possible for them to receive this award. It is especially meaningful to see a Pennsylvania farm with such a long history of good stewardship being named the leading innovator, nationwide, for dairy farming. Today, Schrack Farms is managing an 1,100 head dairy herd while advocating for notill farming and maintaining soil health and promoting awareness of the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Its farming practices truly focus on conservation. Schrack Farms also was an early adopter of renewable energy technology and installed one of the first methane digesters in Pennsylvania. Now the farm generates revenue by selling power back to the grid and reduces electricity costs for the farm. Schrack Farms is a model operation that is at the forefront of modernday farming practices. Their operation effectively demonstrates that investment in environmentally friendly practices can lower costs, provide new revenue streams, and offer greater efficiencies on the farm. They also educate local legislators and the general public about their operation’s positive economic and environmental benefits. Jim Harbach said the farm’s practices and beliefs go well beyond the borders of farming. Family members and farm staff are involved in associations and organizations that promote dairy farming and its environmental impacts. He has traveled across the country speaking about the practices that they use right there in Loganton, Pennsylvania. Schrack Farms accepted the award earlier this year at Dairy Forum 2018 in Palm Desert, California. Pennsylvania’s Secretary of Agriculture Russell Redding nominated the farm for the award, and I was pleased to add supporting comments to the nomination. Mr. Speaker, I am most proud of Schrack Farms and the entire family for being a leader in dairy farming not only in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, but nationwide. I wholeheartedly congratulate Jim, Lisa, Kevin, and their families and employees on this outstanding achievement. 
COMMEMORATING 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF POLAND’S REEMERGENCE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR ) for 5 minutes. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleague, Representative JACKIE WALORSKI , as co chairs of the Polish Caucus. This year, we commemorate the 100th anniversary of Poland’s reemergence as a European nation in 1918. As grateful Polish Americans, we join together on a bipartisan basis to acknowledge this historic achievement of freedom’s advance. The reality is history has been brutal to Poland. In the late 1700s, Poland was erased from the map of Europe for 123 years by three adjacent predatory empires because it passed a constitution inspired by ours, which included a separation of powers. Poland became the first nation in Europe to abolish serfdom by the Polaniec Manifesto on May 7, 1794. Then, in 1918, following World War I, with the support of President Woodrow Wilson, Poland was restored to the map of Europe and resumed its torturous climb to freedom. b1030 But then, in 1939, World War II began. As Poland was invaded, first by Nazi Germany, and then 3 weeks later by Communist Russia, Poland suffered an unimaginable loss of 20 percent of its population that perished during World War II, the most of any nation in that war. Of the 14 million civilians killed by Nazi Germany and Communist Russia, over 6 million were killed in Poland; 3 million Jews and 3 million Christians, as well as Roma and Sinti, the disabled, homosexuals, and other innocents. Poland never surrendered. There never was a collaborationist Polish Government. Establishing a free government in exile, Polish armies fought on every front in Europe, including alongside American soldiers at Normandy. Despite the Nazi and Soviet campaign to wipe out Poland’s most educated and accomplished and, indeed, Poland’s history, Poland resisted at home with the largest underground resistance movement in Europe. Poland never surrendered, nor did it ever surrender to Nazi nor Communist, murderous ideology. At Katyn, Communist Russia, with bullets to the back of their heads, killed over 12,000 Polish leaders from its military, civil society, their educational community, and their religious leadership. 1945 brought allied liberation to a wartorn Europe, but not to Poland, which fell under the Soviet yoke, repressed, and blocked from its own identity, indeed, even denied a true representation of its wartime history of heroism, tragedy, and terror. But in 1989, after 43 years of increasing resistance to occupation inside Poland, its fierce love of liberty spilled over into successful resistance and massive electoral victory won by Solidarnosc, the labor movement that yielded ultimate liberty for Poland. This was the first wave of major popular and antiCommunist opposition across the Soviet bloc that resulted in the Berlin Wall’s collapse in 1989, the wall that divided liberty from tyranny and, ultimately, communism’s demise. Poland has accomplished much in the generation of freedom that followed. She has achieved a steady economic growth in each year since its return to freedom, the most robust of any nation in Europe. Yet, the millions of souls who perished in Poland across every faith, confession, and ethnic origin, most remain unknown to history. Our globe is still weighed down with the collective sense of unresolved grief and the lack of historical truth that humanity must address. For the millions who perished, this anniversary year of Poland’s rebirth should be an occasion to uplift that historical truth to heal, not divide. As we speak, vicious Russian aggression aims to destabilize Europe and our precious transatlantic and NATO alliance, essential to liberty. Free nations, including Poland and her critics, should 
use this moment to recommit to liberty and rule of law, setting aside language and gestures that inflame divisions across Europe. Now is a time for unity, not division. Now is a time for restraint, not antagonism. Now is the time for reasoned dialogue, not media taunts. And let me commend the PolishIsraeli Reconciliation Commission for its reasoned progress and recent statement. Now is the time for diplomatic excellence and military readiness, not provocative gestures, legislative or otherwise. Now is the time for robust archival restoration so the full truth of millions who perished can be known and recorded forever. Now is the time to strengthen freedom’s umbrella, not weaken it. May I extend all congratulations and blessings to Poland on its 100th anniversary of reborn nationhood. 
CELEBRATING THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF KEVIN LEZYNSKI The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK ) for 5 minutes. Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, recently, I was fortunate to meet an impressive young man, Kevin Lezynski, and celebrate with him as he earned the rank of Eagle Scout. Kevin, of Harleysville, Pennsylvania, is a senior at Souderton Area High School. He is involved in the community as a member of the Unified Special Olympics and the regular Special Olympics, where he competes in soccer, swimming, bocce, baseball, and track and field. He is the manager of the school lacrosse team; he is involved in this year’s musical; and he was voted homecoming king. As an Eagle Scout in Troop 91, Kevin earned 36 merit badges and led a group of 38 others in building a gazebo on the high school grounds in just 2 days. Students and teachers now use the space to learn and socialize. Kevin is a shining example of commitment to community service and what you can accomplish when you put your mind toward a goal. Congratulations, Kevin, on earning this welldeserved rank of Eagle Scout. 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Christine Gunsiorowski, Alli Curro, and Kim McCleary for their work in the community combating type 1 diabetes. After all three women had a child diagnosed with diabetes in 2014, they began raising money to find a cure. In 2016, they took their efforts even further, starting the Type One Parent Project Foundation focused on providing support and guidance for families in my district in Bucks and Montgomery Counties, as well as raising general awareness about type 1 diabetes. This year, this organization will continue to expand its efforts, increasing the number and range of speakers at their meetings, creating a mentoring program where older kids can mentor younger children about the effects of type 1 diabetes. They will, in the coming months, award several scholarships to local families so that kids can attend the American Diabetes Association’s Camp Freedom, a weeklong overnight camp for kids with diabetes. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Christine, Alli, and Kim for all the work they are doing to keep kids safe and help kids in our community and educate our community about children facing this challenge. f 
DEMOCRATS HAVE A BETTER PLAN The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York (Mr. JEFFRIES ) for 5 minutes. Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, the reckless, regressive, and reprehensible Republican budget cuts funding for Social Security, cuts Medicare, cuts Medicaid. The Republican budget cuts funding for Meals on Wheels, cuts funding for school violence prevention programs. It even cuts funding for the Special Olympics. Who does that? The Republican budget seeks to balance itself on the backs of working families, middle class folks, senior citizens, the poor, the sick, the afflicted, veterans, rural America, and the safety of our children. It is an abdication of responsibility. It is a dereliction of duty. It is a stunning act of legislative malpractice. The reckless Republican budget is a raw deal for the American people. Democrats have a better deal focused on better jobs, better wages, and a better future for the American people. Democrats have a better deal focused on higher pay, lower costs, and providing the American people with the tools to succeed in a 21st century economy. Democrats have a better deal focused on improving the quality of life of everyday Americans. 
b1200 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker at noon. 
PRAYER The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: Eternal God, we give You thanks for giving us another day. The Prophet Isaiah, in the first chapter, begins his message with these words: ‘‘Hear, O heavens, and listen, O Earth, for the Lord speaks.’’ All the heavens and all the Earth cannot grasp or contain Your Word, O Lord. Once spoken and unleashed upon the world, Your Word catapults imaginings to their heights and penetrates everything to its depths. May our hearing turn to listening and our listening make us so attentive that it leads to new understanding and new ways of acting. Your Word provokes Isaiah to cry out to the people: If only we were free enough to be raised up by its power or strong enough to be embraced by its full passion. Then we, like Isaiah, would be able to hear in our broadcasted news the voice of violence coming from our own children, and we would lament as a nation searching for prophetic vision until we and our ways of acting change. We pray for this vision now, and may all that is done this day in the people’s House be for Your greater honor and glory. Amen. f 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DEUTCH ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. DEUTCH led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
MOMENT OF SILENCE HONORING THOSE KILLED OR WOUNDED IN SERVICE TO OUR COUNTRY The SPEAKER. The Chair asks that the House now observe a moment of silence in honor of those who have been killed or wounded in service to our country and all those who serve and their families. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, 60 years ago, Willie O’Ree broke the color barrier in professional hockey, all while overcoming racial slurs, doubt, and blindness in his right eye. Often referred to as the Jackie Robinson of hockey, Willie has been a trusted champion for diversity, a proponent of inclusion, and an inspiration for so many young players both off and on the ice. Each February, we celebrate Black History Month as well as Hockey is for Everyone Month, and no one embodies both of those tributes as profoundly as living legend Willie O’Ree. He is as humble as he is inspiring, often reminding fans that he only played in the NHL for 45 games, and while that may be true, he changed the game forever. There are few players worthier of being inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, and it is long overdue that Willie’s name be added to that list. As the Hockey Hall of Fame continues to accept and review nominee submissions before the March 15 deadline, I want to remind everyone of the countless ways Willie strengthened and supported this sport. I thank him for his continued efforts to increase access for all people of all backgrounds to get out on the ice and play the greatest game. 
UNLOCKING MONTANA’S PUBLIC LANDS TO INCREASE PUBLIC ACCESS (Mr. GIANFORTE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to draw attention to Washington inactivity that has locked up hundreds of thousands of acres of Montana public lands. In the 1970s, Congress designated over 1 million acres of Montana as wilderness study areas. The U.S. Forest Service and BLM were charged with determining whether to include them in the National Wilderness Preservation System. By the early 1980s, the Forest Service and BLM had made their recommendations, but Congress did not act. Now, nearly 40 years later, Congress still hasn’t acted, and those study areas are still locked up. Mr. Speaker, last week I introduced the Unlocking Public Lands Act and the Protect Public Use of Public Lands Act. These bills will release nearly 700,000 acres of lands found to be not suitable for wilderness designation and return them to Forest Service and BLM management. County commissioners, State legislators, and impacted communities support this overdue action. Congress is about 40 years late in unlocking Montana’s public lands and increasing public access to them. It is time to finish the job. f 
THE NATION WILL NOT FORGET PARKLAND (Mr. DEUTCH asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, it has been just 20 days since the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida; but when you spend those days going to funerals and memorial services and vigils, and when you spend those days meeting with grieving parents who don’t know what life is without their loved one, and when you spend those days demanding that this House take action, it feels a lot longer. Life moves on, new headlines fight to push our pain aside. One Parkland student, starting her first full week back at Marjory Stoneman Douglas since the shooting, said this on Twitter: ‘‘There are no media trucks in sight. Don’t forget about Parkland.’’ Mr. Speaker, the fight is not over. Mr. Speaker, this Congress cannot and will not just move on from this tragedy. The Nation will not forget Parkland, because this time, we join with the Marjory Stoneman Douglas students in declaring: ‘‘Never again.’’ 
RECOGNIZING OUR NORTH COUNTRY OLYMPIANS (Ms. STEFANIK asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the hard work and dedication of our north country Olympians, who made history at the 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang. The United States women’s bobsled team, trained in Lake Placid in my district, finished strong with an incredible silver medal win. We are also incredibly excited for Saranac Lake’s very own Chris Mazdzer, who made Olympic history this year, taking home Team USA’s first ever medal in men’s singles luge. Chris trained tirelessly at the Olympic Training Center in Lake Placid, and I know he has inspired the next generation of New York21 athletes from across our region. Mr. Speaker, the north country has been buzzing with excitement since the Winter Games began, and seeing Chris on the podium was an incredible moment for us all. Congratulations to Chris and to all our Olympians, who showed the world just what the north country has to offer. f 
GREAT LAKES WEEK (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, this week is Great Lakes Week. As a Michigander, I am proud of the fact that Republicans and Democrats in Congress continue to work together to highlight the importance of our shared water resources and to protect the Great Lakes. The Great Lakes generate billions of dollars in economic activity and provide drinking water to 40 million people. We have to do everything we can to protect them from harm. Unfortunately, President Trump recently unveiled his proposed budget, which cuts funding to the Great Lakes by 90 percent. An important restoration initiative that has succeeded and has had bipartisan support, the President nearly eliminates. Protecting our Great Lakes has never been a partisan issue. Democrats and Republicans have come together before to restore funding cuts that were proposed by President Trump. I am confident that we will come together again. This Great Lakes Week, as every week, I stand up for the Great Lakes and those who depend upon them. They are a critical water resource that must be protected. 
RECOGNIZING ALBERTO CARVALHO (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Alberto Carvalho, the superintendent of Miami Dade County Public Schools, the Nation’s fourth largest school system, with more than 500,000 students. 
For the past decade, Alberto has worked tirelessly on behalf of students and educators throughout my congressional district. His efforts have propelled MiamiDade public schools into a position of national prominence, and it is now one of the Nation’s highest performing urban school systems. Recently, Mr. Carvalho was offered the opportunity of a lifetime to run the largest school system in the country, and that is chancellor of New York City schools, but he showed his dedication and commitment to south Florida’s students and teachers when he decided to stay in MiamiDade. As a former Florida certified teacher, I am so glad that he is staying to continue leading MiamiDade County Public Schools. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of our grateful community and countless individuals who have been positively impacted by Alberto Carvalho’s unwavering dedication, I want to say: Thank you, ‘‘friend,’’ ‘‘amigo.’’ Please stay. 
WE SHOULD NOT ROLL BACK FLIGHT SAFETY LAWS (Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, 9 years ago, Continental Flight 3407 crashed in western New York, killing all aboard and one on the ground. The National Transportation Safety Board found that the cause of the crash was pilot error and poor training. Prior to the enactment of flight safety laws, there were two levels of safety: one more stringent for the commercial carriers that we are all familiar with, and one considerably less stringent for the ones that we are less aware of. There were two levels of safety. Now there is only one because of the courageous work of the families of the survivors who came to Congress and helped Congress enact very strict safety regulations. We have not had a commercial crash that ended up in fatalities since that time. It is important that we not roll back these safety standards, as they are based on the National Transportation Safety Board’s findings and the work of this Congress. 
LIMIT SCOPE OF SPECIAL COUNSEL (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the special counsel investigation has pushed way beyond its authorized purpose. Recent reports indicate that individuals have been questioned about President Trump’s business activities prior to his entering the 2016 campaign. The private interests of Trump family members also are being probed. These lines of investigation clearly violate the scope of the special counsel, which is limited to: ‘‘. . . any links and/or coordination between the Russian Government and individuals associated with the campaign . . .’’ In the interest of justice, the investigation must be limited. The Deputy Attorney General should do so immediately to ensure a fair process. A rogue investigation should not be allowed to continue. f 
b1215 FLORIDA HOUSE PASSES GUN SAFETY BILL (Ms. NORTON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, MARCO  RUBIO’s Florida State Senate got shocked enough by the Parkland shooting to pass a token gun safety bill. The Florida House has yet to act. Whatever Florida does, RUBIO’s token gun bill in Washington is belied by his pending bill to eliminate virtually all of the District of Columbia’s gun safety laws. Worse, RUBIO has put his D.C. bill in the Congress to raise his NRA rating for the last two Congresses. It did raise his NRA rating from B plus to A. I have managed to save D.C.’s gun safety laws, but RUBIO’s shamefully token responses in the Senate to the Parkland tragedy will be seen as one more act of hypocrisy until he stops meddling in the District of Columbia’s affairs and withdraws his D.C. gun bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. GIANFORTE ). Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward Members of the Senate. 
THE ALAMO—MARCH 6, 1836 (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, in the early morning hours it was cold, damp, and dark in the old, beatup Spanish mission. It was the Alamo. It was March 6, 1836. It was a battle for Texas independence. The volunteers were from most of the States and several foreign countries, including Mexico. The small band of 186 Texians and Tejanos, led by defiant Colonel William Barrett Travis, had already repelled two attempts by Dictator Santa Anna and his army of thousands to take the garrison. But on this morning, after a fierce battle, the enemy overwhelmed the volunteers and killed them all. Survivors were murdered. However, Travis wrote in a letter on March 3 that ‘‘a victory by the enemy will cost Santa Anna more than defeat.’’ He was right. The enemy losses were staggering. The Alamo volunteers gave General Sam Houston time to organize another army. So, on April 21, Houston and his troops vanquished and routed the enemy and secured Texas independence. Then Texas was a republic for 9 years. Independence was successful because the valiant, relentless Alamo defenders believed death was preferable to tyranny. Today we honor their sacrifice on the altar of liberty. And that is just the way it is. f 
TRADE AND TARIFFS (Mr. LAHOOD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAHOOD. Mr. Speaker, last week I was invited to the White House to meet with President Trump and his advisers to discuss trade and the renegotiation of NAFTA. My district is the eighth largest agriculture district in the country. For districts like mine, free trade is crucial to ensuring that there are new markets for our farmers and manufacturing to sell their products and goods. That is why I urged the President to maintain and strengthen our existing trade agreements, including NAFTA, not withdraw or create new barriers to free trade. The American economy is currently booming, thanks to onceinalifetime tax reform, with disposable income seeing its highest jump since 2015. We should be working to build upon this success, not instituting protectionist tariffs that could start a trade war. In the end, the cost of tariffs are passed on to consumers and act like a new form of taxation, which could undo much of the gains we have seen since tax reform. I urge the President and his team to reconsider the blanket tariffs discussed last week, and instead focus on fighting specific unfair trade practices that put American businesses at a disadvantage. 
THE UNHRC MUST STOP UNFAIRLY TARGETING ISRAEL (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, Israel is America’s treasured ally in the Middle East, and we must stand up for our friends when they are being treated unfairly. Recently, we have seen the United Nations targeting Israel with six antiIsrael resolutions passed in the last year alone. This is hypocritical discrimination. That is why I introduced House Resolution 728, which recognizes that the United Nations Human Rights Council wastes U.S. taxpayers’ money by targeting Israel and reiterates that they 
need to stop the shameful, prejudicial behavior toward Israel. Even U.N. SecretaryGeneral Ban Kimoon has expressed disappointment with the Human Rights Council singling out Israel, given the multitude of other human rights violations occurring around the world. I was grateful for the opportunity to have attended the AIPAC Policy Conference this weekend, where I participated in a panel discussion on the threat to Israel from Gaza. There I highlighted the broad security concerns Israel is facing, such as the Hamas tunnels, and discussed ways in which the United States can assist to address the threats of kidnapping and murder, such as the murder of Taylor Force. In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. Americans appreciate Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a world statesman, for his visit to Congress today. 
RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF SNAPa IN THE LIVES OF STUDENTS (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, this afternoon I will meet with leaders from the School Nutrition Association of Pennsylvania, commonly known as SNAPa, which is a statewide organization of school nutrition professionals. SNAPa works to advance quality child nutrition programs through education and advocacy. Organized in 1955, SNAPa is an allvolunteer board of directors elected by its membership, which currently stands at more than 2,300 individuals. As chairman of the Agriculture Subcommittee on Nutrition and a senior member on the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, I know the essential services that SNAPa works to provide. Students throughout the Commonwealth receive highquality, lowcost meals thanks to SNAPa. Mr. Speaker, it is important to remember that, for some students, the only meal they may receive may be at school. This organization works to keep our children healthy and ensure that they have healthy food options through the school meal programs. I look forward to speaking with Travis Folmar, a food services director from State College. I sincerely thank SNAPa for advancing the availability, quality, and acceptance of school nutrition programs as an essential part of education in Pennsylvania for more than 60 years. 
SUPPORTING THE COMPREHENSIVE REGULATORY REVIEW ACT (Mr. ARRINGTON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Comprehensive Regulatory Review Act. As a former regulator at the FDIC, I can tell you that the road to a really bad economy is paved with seemingly good regulations. Regulations like the ones that came out of DoddFrank were intended to protect the consumer, but ended up creating more burden, more complexity, more cost, and fewer choices. By the way, it destroys relationship banking in rural America and districts I represent. The best way to protect consumers and weed out the badacting businesses is a healthy market with robust competition, transparency, and more choices for the consumer. The last 8 years gave us an administrative state in place of the freest and greatest economy in the world. We inherited trillions of dollars in regulatory costs, millions of hours in paperwork, and an economy that has grinded to a near halt. Let’s continue to rein in the unnecessary regulations. Let’s get this economy growing again, and let’s make America great again. f 
HONORING CALIFORNIA FIREFIGHTERS (Mr. CARBAJAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, last December, the Thomas fire raged through Ventura and Santa Barbara Counties, eventually becoming the largest wildfire in California’s history. Our heroic firefighters left their families behind during the holiday season to fight tirelessly on the front lines, saving homes, businesses, and lives. A few short weeks later, our first responders were called back into action when heavy rains brought debris flows that tragically claimed the lives of 23 people in Montecito. As residents were evacuating, these brave firefighters ran towards the disaster without a second thought, pulling people out of the mud and debris for days afterward. I would like to thank all our first responders who so bravely answered the call of duty in these difficult conditions. Mr. Speaker, with us here today are firefighters from IAFF Local 2046, CAL FIRE Local 2881, and the Ventura County Professional Firefighters Association, and the California Professional Firefighters. I thank them all for their unparalleled level of service to keep our loved ones on the central coast safe. Thank you for your service. 
A MESSAGE TO THE MILITARY RETIREES OF ALABAMA’S SECOND DISTRICT (Mrs. ROBY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Mrs. ROBY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share the news that I recently received that Alabama’s Second District has the 13th largest population of military retirees in the Nation. It goes without saying that this is significant. At the end of last year, there were more than 16,000 military retirees living in Alabama’s Second District. But, Mr. Speaker, while I am glad that these retired servicemembers chose us, we are truly honored to have them. As their neighbors, it is our job to make sure that they feel at home, welcome, and, most of all, appreciated. Mr. Speaker, to the 16,000 retired military personnel who call Alabama’s Second District home, I join our State and community in thanking them for their service to our country. We thank them for sacrificing on our behalf. Now let us care for them. That starts with making sure that our veterans are receiving the care that they were promised when they signed up to put their lives on the line for this Nation. If you are a veteran who needs any kind of casework assistance with the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Social Security Administration, or other Federal agency, please contact my office now. Do not put this off. My staff and I work for you. We are grateful for you. As the Representative from Alabama’s Second District, I am here to fight for you. f 
COMPREHENSIVE REGULATORY REVIEW ACT Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 747, I call up the bill (H.R. 4607) to amend the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996 to ensure that Federal financial regulators perform a comprehensive review of regulations to identify outdated or otherwise unnecessary regulatory requirements imposed on covered persons, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. ARRINGTON ). Pursuant to House Resolution 747, an amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 115–61, modified by the amendment printed in part B of House Report 115–582, is adopted, and the bill, as amended, is considered read. The text of the bill, as amended, is as follows: 
H.R. 4607 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Comprehensive Regulatory Review Act’’. 
Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to submit extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, before proceeding to the bill before us in the House, not unlike yourself, I am a proud Texan—in my case, a fifthgeneration Texan. In listening very carefully to the gentleman from Texas, Judge POE, I do wish to remind all my colleagues that it was this day in 1836 that brave men in Texas took on the minions of tyranny at the Alamo. And although they lost that battle, they inspired their nation at the time, Texas, that would later become part of our Nation. So, on this day that is special to all Texans, it should be special to all Americans. We remember the cradle of liberty. Remember the Alamo. God bless Texas. b1230 Mr. Speaker, otherwise, I rise also, today, in support of H.R. 4607, which is a very important piece of legislation brought to us by a very hardworking member of the Financial Services Committee, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. LOUDERMILK ). It is a bill that helps address the burden of unnecessary, duplicative, and outdated regulations that too often have imposed cost on our community financial institutions that ultimately make credit more expensive and less available to our constituents. It passed out of our committee with a very strong bipartisan vote of 38–17, and I congratulate him for his bill. Specifically, Mr. Speaker, this bill requires that all of the prudential financial regulators that now include the CFPB and the NCUA, the National Credit Union Administration—it ensures that all of our financial regulators, not just some, but all, will participate in the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act, known as EGRPRA, a law that dates back to the Clinton era, and this ensures that our agencies review all rules that are prescribed by themselves that impact our insured financial institutions. The purpose of this review, again, is to reduce regulation that is proven overly burdensome, duplicative, or outdated, while maintaining our safety and soundness standards. And, again, Mr. Speaker, all this is is a review. It ensures a review. Additionally, H.R. 4607 will require that these agencies meet every 7 years for a comprehensive regulatory evaluation, as opposed to the current 10year standard. This is especially important. I salute the gentleman from Georgia for his leadership, because we have seen our financial sector of the economy suffer under the weight, the load, the burden of regulation, particularly because six of the seven heaviest regulatory years occurred under the last administration; so we need a more thorough review of these regulations. And requiring our Federal agencies to simply review their actions in a transparent manner on a more frequent basis, it is simple; it is fair; it is straightforward; it is wise. Mr. Speaker, a healthy financial system that provides equal opportunity to all Americans to achieve financial independence can only exist if we have smart regulation. And the explosive growth of regulation, following the enactment of DoddFrank, has made it significantly harder for our community banks and credit unions to serve their customers and members. And, in fact, the complexity and cost of this regulatory burden has forced many of them out of business or has forced them to cut back services to their customers and members, and it is one of the reasons why, on average, we continue to lose one community bank or credit union a day, or every other day, in America. This should not be happening. Ultimately, Mr. Speaker, it is not the banks and credit unions we are so concerned about. It is their customers. It is customers like Missouri mom, Michele, who explained to us how frustrating it has been for her 20yearold daughter, with a fulltime job, to get a loan to buy her first car. And, again, her daughter has a firsttime job. And as Michele explained to us: ‘‘It’s a catch22. You need credit to get credit, but no one will give you the credit to begin with. I would like to see our young adults be able to build the credit they need so they can have a decent future.’’ Mr. Speaker, it is for people like Michele and her daughter that we need this regulatory review. It is why we need the bill from the gentleman from Georgia. These are the people we are trying to help. Like Anne in Wisconsin, who was trying to get a loan to remodel her attached garage when her son was born, and she said: ‘‘My husband and I have very high credit scores, and we have equity in our home, but because my husband has a seasonal job and finds other employment in the winter, the many banks we contacted rejected our loan request. They base that on our annual income only on the job he was currently in and said it was part of the new regulation.’’ 
Well, of course it is, Mr. Speaker. That is why they need to be reviewed. It is people like Anne in Wisconsin we need to help. Or Dan, a Navy veteran from Illinois, who actually had to close down—close down the small auto finance company he started with his wife 25 years ago, and he had to close it down because of new Federal regulation. He explains: ‘‘Large companies can afford a separate legal department to deal with these issues and the myriad of new regulations. A small business like ours cannot. We had to make a decision. It was just not worth the risk to continue operations in this antibusiness environment.’’ So, Mr. Speaker, it is people like Michele, it is people like Anne, it is people like Dan who deserve the opportunity to have credit for their homes, their autos, their small businesses, and so we must ensure that all of our Federal regulators—all of our Federal financial regulators take a thorough comprehensive review of their regulatory burden so that we can continue to support the people who need credit. H.R. 4607, again, has garnered strong bipartisan support. It is practical; it is common sense; and I urge all of my colleagues to adopt it. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 4607, the socalled Comprehensive Regulatory Review Act. So instead of advancing legislation that improves our financial regulatory framework, the Republican majority is pushing yet another bill that is a giveaway to Wall Street and predatory lenders. Let’s be clear. This bill is intended to dismantle rules considered inconvenient by the financial services industry. If this bill were enacted, financial services regulators would be forced to spend more time and resources on backwardlooking reviews and deregulating the financial services industry rather than strengthening protections for consumers and the economy. Allow me to explain. The Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act, or EGRPRA, currently requires the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and the OCC to conduct a review of the regulations that they have issued in order to identify outdated or otherwise unnecessary regulatory requirements imposed on insured depository institutions. The banking regulators conduct this review every 10 years, but until now, this review has been a relatively balanced, careful assessment that the banking regulators have done twice in the last two decades, and the regulators have taken this process seriously. The last review took about 3 years to complete. It involved field hearings and public engagement. The final review included many balanced and thoughtful recommendations to improve rules. Many of these would provide relief for community banks and credit unions but in a way that also maintains safeguards for consumers and protects the interests of the public and the broader economy. Unfortunately, H.R. 4607, this bill, would make three major mistakes in changing the current review process. First, this bill actually requires regulators to change regulations so that they are less costly and burdensome for ‘‘covered persons.’’ Well, who are these covered persons? Are they the millions of consumers who were harmed by Wells Fargo’s scheme to open fraudulent accounts without their knowledge? Were they? No. Are they the many consumers who learned just a few days ago that Citigroup violated the law by charging them too much interest on their credit cards? No, no. Are these covered persons in this bill the Latino or AfricanAmerican families who were discriminated against by JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and so many other banks steering them into more costly mortgages when they qualified for more affordable loans? No, not at all. Are they—the ones who are being protected—are they seniors or servicemembers who fall prey to payday lenders that trap them in a cycle of debt? No. Are they college graduates who are harassed by debt collectors for their student loan debt? No. Under this bill, Mr. Speaker, covered persons are defined as ‘‘any person that engages in offering or providing a consumer financial product or service; and any affiliate of’’—such—‘‘person . . . if such affiliate acts as a service provider to such person.’’ You know what that means? You know who these socalled covered persons in this bill are who they are talking about? That means Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America, payday lenders, mortgage brokers, debt collectors, and thousands of other financial companies. All of these companies would get easier rules that limit their costs and burdens without appropriately considering the impact they are going to have on their customers. And this bill does nothing, absolutely nothing, to strengthen protections for consumers where there might be deficiencies or gaps in our regulatory framework. Second, unlike the other banking regulators, which are tasked with ensuring the safety and soundness of the financial services sector, the Consumer Bureau’s unique mission is the protection of consumers and of ensuring that the consumer marketplace operates in a fair, transparent, and competitive manner. Although it may make sense for the banking agencies to periodically review their prudential rules, with a focus on their regulated entities, the Consumer Bureau should be making sure that its rules are appropriately protecting consumers and the interests of the public, not the big financial corporations. In addition, the Consumer Bureau is already subject to unique accountability and oversight measures that the other financial regulators are not. These special checks and balances include the requirement that the Consumer Bureau have small business review panels as a part of its rulemaking process and the ability of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, that is, FSOC, to repeal any of its final rules. And the Consumer Bureau is already required to review all of the significant rules within 5 years of the time they go into effect, but in a balanced—balanced—manner. The third problem with H.R. 4607 is that it would make it harder for the regulators to do their jobs. The bill would require a comprehensive review of all banking and consumer protection regulations once every 7 years instead of every decade. If regulators take these reviews as seriously as their previous reviews, as I believe they would, then that would mean they would be tied up spending nearly half of each 7 year cycle doing regulatory reviews instead of supervising their regulated entities and enforcing the law. This bill would impose an unbalanced review process on regulators that favors industries’ wishes—favors industries’ wishes over consumers and the economy. The methodology in this bill promotes deregulation. That is what this is all about. This is a bill about deregulation instead of creating a robust process to identify gaps or deficiencies in oversight that harm consumers, undermine the safety and soundness of our financial system, or jeopardize the country’s financial stability. So I cannot support a bill that forces the Consumer Bureau to weaken rules for Wall Street and payday lenders. I am talking about the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 4607. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. b1245 Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. LOUDERMILK ), a very hardworking member of the Financial Services Committee and the author of H.R. 4607. Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from the Republic of Texas, Chairman HENSARLING , for giving me this time to move away some of the hyperbole that you may hear today and speak about the truth of what this really simple and commonsense measure really does. Mr. Speaker, the Comprehensive Regulatory Review Act is a bill that I introduced simply to reduce the burden that outdated and unnecessary Federal regulations place on our small banks and lending institutions across the landscape of America. 
I would like to start by thanking some of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who have worked tirelessly to make this a strong, bipartisan piece of legislation. I appreciate the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. GOTTHEIMER ) for negotiating reasonable changes to this bill and for being an original cosponsor. I also appreciate Mr. DUFFY and Ms. SINEMA and the others who have reached across the aisle to cosponsor this important piece of legislation. To fully understand this bill, Mr. Speaker, we have to go back to 1996, when Congress gave the financial regulatory agencies a useful tool by passing the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act, or, as you have heard today, more commonly known as EGRPRA. This law directed the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve, and the FDIC to review their regulations once every 10 years to identify those regulations that may be outdated, unnecessary, or overly burdensome. After that, the regulators were to send a report to Congress and eliminate any regulations they determined were unnecessary. This law has been somewhat useful, and it was a good idea back in 1996 because, after all, who would be opposed to eliminating rules that even regulators thought were unnecessary? But too often, EGRPRA has been viewed as merely a checkthebox exercise by the agencies and the financial sector. Now that we have two EGRPRA reports, a 2007 and a 2017, it is obvious that EGRPRA could have been more effective and produced more useful recommendations to policymakers. In retrospect, we also realize we need more direct action from the regulators to clean up outdated and unnecessary rules. That is why it is important for Congress to revisit EGRPRA, as this bill does. My bill contains several reforms to the EGRPRA review process that will breathe new life into this law, this tool for the regulators, and make sure it is not simply a checkthebox exercise. This bill will require more frequent regulatory reviews by moving the review cycle from once a decade to once every 7 years. It will expand EGRPRA to include all regulated financial institutions instead of only depositoryinsured institutions. It will codify the National Credit Union Administration into EGRPRA, since the agency participated in the latest review voluntarily. The bill will also add the controversial Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, CFPB, to the EGRPRA review process. This provision is especially important because, before DoddFrank, consumer financial laws were implemented by the three banking agencies; but when DoddFrank was enacted, the CFPB was given the responsibility for enforcing consumer financial laws. Since the CFPB is exempt from EGRPRA, these laws and regulations are no longer being comprehensively reviewed. DoddFrank requires the CFPB to review its regulations every 5 years after they are enacted, but this leaves out rules which are considered nonsignificant. It also excludes rules that were adopted before the CFPB was created. Also, the CFBP’s regulatory reviews are under a single, 5year lookback period. We must ensure that each regulatory agency is comprehensively reviewing its rules, and on a regular basis. This bill is not duplicative because it requires CFPB to use its findings from its existing regulatory reviews in its EGRPRA reports so the CFPB does not waste time on rules it has already reviewed. And, most importantly, Mr. Speaker, this bill will require the agencies to tailor rules that they find to be unnecessary based on the size and risk profile of the bank or the credit union. Mr. Speaker, I would like to repeat that last point because it is so important. This bill does not require the agencies to cut regulations with a broad brush, as it has been presented so far, nor does it cut regulations on the payday lending industry, as some have argued. It simply states the rules will be adjusted based on a company’s risk if the regulators determine that to be appropriate. The bill ensures that if the financial regulators—the regulators—determine that a regulation is important to consumer protection for safety and soundness, the agency will still have every right to leave that regulation completely intact. This bill is not just about eliminating unnecessary regulations; it is about good government and cleaning up unnecessary red tape that inevitably hurts the consumer. Mr. Speaker, the Treasury Secretary came to our committee for a hearing last month, and I asked him about this very issue. He simply said: 
Rules and regulations need to be constantly looked at as markets continually change. 
I’m not sure why the CFPB was exempted from EGRPRA, so I agree with the change. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill passed out of committee with a strong bipartisan vote of more than twothirds of the committee members, and I urge my colleagues to join us in support of this bill. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I knew that my friends on the opposite side of the aisle would basically refer to small banks. This is what is normally done when we see deregulatory efforts being made. They talk about how they are trying to help small and community banks, and they fail to talk about the major financial institutions that I have talked about in my presentation that are the beneficiaries, also, of this deregulatory effort that is being put forth. When I take a look at the existing law now and the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act, I see that their mission is to conduct a review of their regulations to identify outdated or otherwise unnecessary regulatory requirements imposed on insured depository institutions. This deregulatory bill that we have before us goes a lot further. As I said, it is about deregulation, and it is about reducing cost and liability risk. This does not benefit our consumers at all. Again, what we would do in the passage of this bill is simply open up opportunities for the big banks and financial institutions to get rid of the kind of oversight, the kind of laws that we have worked so hard for because it is inconvenient for them or it interferes with their bottom line in some way. So I do not want our Members to be tricked or fooled to think, number one, this is simply about further getting rid of paperwork or that this is about supporting the small banks. This is about new ways by which to deregulate so that the big banks that are now found to be defrauding, found to be discriminating, found to be doing things like Wells Fargo has done, this is about deregulation that will further enhance their ability to do the kinds of things that we claim to be so opposed to and that harm our consumers. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that they are now including by way of H.R. 4607 should be looked at very carefully. First of all, my friends on the opposite side of the aisle hate the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. They want to get rid of it. They have tried, time and time again, to undermine it in so many ways. The President has sent Mr. Mulvaney over there, who is supposed to be over at the Office of Management and Budget, to basically destroy it. Mr. Speaker, we cannot allow the Members of Congress to be tricked or fooled that somehow this is helpful that they are bringing in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. What they want to do is tie the hands of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and basically change their mission from protection for consumers to deregulation for the biggest banks in America. Why do we have the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau? That is the centerpiece of the DoddFrank reform legislation that we worked so hard on. Are we forgetting about what happened in 2008? Are with forgetting about the recession that was caused by the big banks who had been involved with all of these exotic products and ways by which they were enticing wouldbe homeowners to try and get mortgages? We can’t forget about all of that. We have to know that not only did we have a recession, we were headed for a depression. DoddFrank reform has gone a long way toward eliminating some of the bad practices that were in place that got us into that situation in the first place. 
Now, little by little, my friends on the opposite side of the aisle keep trying to creep in with new ways that they can support these big banks and financial institutions and deregulate and let them get in the position again where they are tricking our consumers, where they are coming up with these exotic products that caused our consumers to eventually get into foreclosure, and that would allow the big banks again, like Wells Fargo, to come up with all of these tricks that they use in order to enhance their bottom line. I think we are smarter than this, and I don’t think that we are going to go for this legislation that is just another way to open the doors to deregulate. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT ), who is the chairman of the Small Business Committee. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4607, the Comprehensive Regulatory Review Act. I want to thank Chairman HENSARLING and the entire Financial Services Committee for their continued critical work on financial regulations. As chairman of the House Small Business Committee, I consistently hear from Main Street businesses, small businesses from all over the country, that overregulation is preventing business expansion and job growth. Just last week, I chaired a hearing on a recent report by the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office that explored whether financial regulations were adversely impacting community banks and credit unions. One of the major takeaways from that report was that we need to improve the tools available to financial regulators to reduce those burdens. Because small businesses most often rely on conventional bank borrowing to finance their development, any additional red tape that reduces access to capital can be a monumental problem for the Nation’s smallest firms. The bill that we have before us today, which would reform the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996, is a move in the right direction. Making sure all financial regulators have a comprehensive process in place to review regulations will strengthen our financial sector and make it more possible for America’s small businesses to have access to the capital that they need to grow and expand and create more jobs for more Americans. Mr. Speaker, I therefore urge my colleagues to support the commonsense reforms that are in H.R. 4607, and I urge them to support this legislation. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. TIPTON ), who is vice chairman of the Financial Services Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for this time to be able to speak to an important piece of legislation. In my home State of Colorado, we have a tale of two economies. The urban areas have realized economic recovery since 2008, while the more rural communities have been slower to find sustained economic growth. Essential to these areas and their ability to be able to recover, a topic that I speak frequently on, is access to credit. As Treasury’s report to the President in June of 2017 notes: Regulations on capital, liquidity, and leverage requirements, as well as regulatory parameters that guide loan underwriting, have undermined the ability of financial institutions to deliver attractively priced credit in sufficient quantity to meet the needs of the economy. b1300 In other words, our community financial institutions have lost access to the tools that they need to be able to help their communities recover as they have struggled to comply with regulations intended for the largest institutions. Mr. Speaker, it is our local communities, our small businesses, our firsttime home buyers, and our working families who suffer the consequences from these regulations. Mr. Speaker, let me give you one example of what unbridled regulation does and how it impacts families trying to be able to live that American Dream. I have an example of a credit union in my home State of Colorado that had to stop offering home equity lines of credit to its members because the cost of keeping the forms in compliance with Federal regulation exceeded the income generated by the program. In other words, regulation priced this credit union out of a critical market and at a time when the rural environment the credit union serves needed access to credit most. Fortunately, Mr. LOUDERMILK ’s legislation being considered here today will take important steps to require regulators to consider the institution’s size and risk profile as they evaluate the necessity and effectiveness of regulatory rulemaking under the selfreview mandated to them by the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act. Importantly, Mr. LOUDERMILK ’s legislation will also expand the EGRPRA process to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the National Credit Union Administration, encouraging the tailoring of regulations across the regulatory spectrum. This legislation takes steps to encourage regulators to allow small institutions adequate leeway to exercise reasonably constructed consumer lending regimes to make sure consumers have the broadest array of choices and that institutions can appropriately navigate the compliance landscape. Mr. Speaker, by requiring regulators to more frequently review and tailor regulations, this bill will help put Main Street back on the path to prosperity and help to end the tale of two economies in Colorado and throughout the Nation. Making these adjustments will help community banks and credit unions once again be able to meet the needs of their neighbors and encourage our businesses to be able to grow. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. EMMER ), who is yet another hardworking member of the House Financial Services Committee. Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, the House Financial Services Committee has been working hard for consumers, local banks, credit unions, and American entrepreneurs during the 115th Congress. Today, we continue our work with H.R. 4607, the Comprehensive Regulatory Review Act. Introduced by my colleague from Georgia, Representative BARRY  LOUDERMILK , this bill brings accountability and modernization to the current regulatory review process for banks, credit unions, and financial institutions across the country. Currently, the regulatory audit conducted by our Federal financial regulators happens just once every decade, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the National Credit Union Administration are not technically a part of that review. It has been 21 years since we evaluated possible changes to this antiquated and inefficient system. That is why we need Representative LOUDERMILK ’s Comprehensive Regulatory Review Act to ensure the regulations we have in place are working to do what they are supposed to do: protect consumers. This legislation is made even more urgent given that unchecked and inefficient regulations are working against the very consumers our regulatory regime was designed to help. Take, for example, the fact that the United States lost nearly 12,000 of its federally insured banks between 1984 and 2016, making it harder for small business entrepreneurs and families to access the credit and capital they need to create new opportunities and grow. These banks struggled under the weight of new regulations, either to disappear completely or to be swallowed up by the big banks that are able to absorb the heavy cost of compliance. For those banks that are able to survive, significant tradeoffs are required. In Rockford, Minnesota, for instance, instead of adding another lender to their team, one small community bank needed to hire a fulltime compliance officer simply to keep up with the regulatory onslaught from Washington. 
That same bank is spending over $100,000 each year on compliance costs instead of using that money in ways that would benefit the local community. Minnesota’s credit unions have also been hit hard by unchecked and outdated regulation. One study found that credit unions in my State of Minnesota have incurred $102 million in costs directly related to the increased regulations created by the DoddFrank Act. Worse still, one in every four Minnesota credit union employees spends their time solely on regulatory compliance. Mr. Speaker, we have a duty to stand up for these struggling financial institutions and, more importantly, the consumers whose communities are hurting without them. We can do that today. Representative LOUDERMILK ’s legislation sailed through committee in January receiving support from both sides of the aisle because Republicans and Democrats know that H.R. 4607 takes necessary and important steps to ease the regulatory burdens which challenge community financial institutions in each and every congressional district. I appreciate the hard work of the bill’s sponsor and the chairman of the committee to bring this legislation to the floor today, and I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on the Comprehensive Regulatory Review Act. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. GOTTHEIMER ), who is a Democratic member of the Financial Services Committee. Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Mr. Speaker, I first want to thank Congressman LOUDERMILK for working together on the Comprehensive Regulatory Review Act. Congressman LOUDERMILK has been a true partner who has been tireless in pursuing smart regulatory reform policies and in finding solutions for the people he serves. We both want to get something done for the people we represent. I also want to thank Congresswoman SINEMA for her help and support in leading this legislation. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support the bipartisan Comprehensive Regulatory Review Act. America’s economic engine has been under pressure for some time now from unnecessarily burdensome and outdated regulations building up on the books of our regulators. It costs us in economic growth. And while there are clear times where smart guardrails are necessary, there are others when it actually holds back smart growth for our country and for our families. We need a smarter, more efficient government. It is time to relieve these unnecessary burdens and spur business job growth and access to credit in New Jersey’s Fifth District and across the country while protecting consumers and our economy. This bipartisan regulatory relief bill does just that. It updates and expands regulators’ mandatory review of financial institutions while protecting consumers. It also requires the review be performed every 7 years rather than every 10. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from New Jersey an additional 30 seconds. Mr. GOTTHEIMER: It requires regulators to consider tailoring regulations when appropriate. In short, the Comprehensive Regulatory Review Act will cut bureaucratic red tape and help our economy thrive without putting consumers at risk. There should be nothing partisan about helping entrepreneurs and businesses of all sizes grow, create jobs, and expand the economy. With this measure, Democrats and Republicans join together to ensure outdated, unnecessary, and burdensome regulations are eliminated or reformed to better fit the needs of individual financial institutions, which ultimately saves Americans money, helps consumers and families grow—and businesses, too—and it protects, always, American consumers. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. I continue to reserve the balance of my time, Mr. Speaker. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. BUDD). Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Georgia for leading on this issue. I rise today in strong support of his bipartisan bill, the Comprehensive Regulatory Review Act. It strikes me as common sense that Federal regulators should review their regulations and rules on a consistent basis. They should also seek comment from the people whom these rules actually affect. Mr. LOUDERMILK ’s bill helps accomplish this goal by requiring the CFPB and National Credit Union Administration do so every 7 years. Mr. Speaker, since the implementation of DoddFrank, community banks and credit unions have had a more difficult time serving their customers. The red tape and additional burden brought on by DoddFrank has increased costs for the consumer and reduced their choices in the market for financial products. One agency in particular that is guilty for this additional burden is the CFPB, which has finalized over 60 rules since their creation. Many of their rules are duplicative and unnecessary. I think, at the very least, they should review and study how their regulations are affecting real folks in the real world. I hear from financial institutions back home how the CFPB has done nothing but harm their community bank or their credit union. They are being overwhelmed by the volume and complexity of regulations, and that is just not okay. Harmonization is the goal of this bill, and that should not be partisan or even controversial. We simply want less people buried in paperwork and more people starting businesses through their local financial institution. This bill is supported by folks across the political spectrum, and I am excited about the good it will do for our financial institutions back home and consumers in my district. I want to again thank Mr. LOUDERMILK for introducing this important piece of legislation that will ensure our financial system is functioning efficiently for hardworking Americans. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. LUETKEMEYER ), who is a real leader on our committee for commonsense regulation and the chairman of our Financial Services Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit. Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman HENSARLING for all his great work and leadership on our Financial Services Committee and also thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. LOUDERMILK ) for crafting a commonsense, bipartisan bill that requires the Federal financial regulators and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to conduct a comprehensive review of all the regulations promulgated with the intent of identifying those that are outdated or duplicative. Across the Nation, financial companies continue to suffer as a result of the burdensome regulations. What my friends on the other side of the aisle don’t always recognize is the impact that has on the ability of those companies to serve their customers. Take cybersecurity as an example. Financial firms of all sizes are forced to adhere to an overlapping regulatory regime that is focused on fighting yesterday’s war. I spoke with a major bank just last week that has cybersecurity examinations from the Federal Reserve, the Comptroller of the Currency, the FDIC, the Treasury Department, and multiple State banking agencies; and that doesn’t include the foreign entities that regulate the international businesses of this bank. Each agency has a slightly different exam process and requires slightly different information. This type of regime doesn’t protect companies from cybersecurity threats. The lack of coordination means this institution spends more time reacting to the regulators than it does protecting its customers. Or look at the antiquated regime surrounding examination and enforcement of the Bank Secrecy Act and anti money laundering laws. What was originally intended to be a reasonable process that fostered collaboration between financial institutions and law enforcement to root out bad actors and 
illicit financing has become so onerous that banks are choosing to drop customers or close entire books of businesses just to avoid compliance burdens. Processes like these do very little to help consumers or the integrity of the financial system. Every time I speak to a bank or credit union in Missouri, I ask what one rule or regulation they find to be the most burdensome or they would like to see changed. The answer is always the same: It isn’t just one. It is the weight of all the rules combined that is restricting credit and the availability of financial services in our communities. We have to make a change, Mr. Speaker. Mr. LOUDERMILK ’s legislation would institute a more thoughtful approach to regulations that will not only offer regulatory relief, but also foster a more responsible and stable financial marketplace. As the gentleman from Georgia has said in the past, this bill isn’t just about regulatory relief; it is about good government. This should not be a partisan exercise. I hope every Member of this body stands for responsible government and joins me in supporting H.R. 4607 today. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am prepared to close. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, before I proceed with my closing, I would just like to make a few comments about some of the information that was shared with us by Members on the opposite side of the aisle. I want to remind them that these poor little banks that you are talking about, which include all of the big banks in America, made record profits in 2016—more than $170 billion—and they are going to make billions more from that tax bill, that tax scam giveaway to Wall Street. Lending is up 75 percent since 2010. So when my friends on the opposite side of the aisle continue to talk about how the banks are suffering, I don’t know who they are talking about. As a matter of fact, the real bipartisanship of this committee is about community banks, and Democrats have led and will continue to lead on every way and everything that we can do for community banks. b1315 Mr. Speaker, I notice that when my friends on the opposite side of the aisle come in with deregulation, they frame it in such a way that you would think that it is all about community banks, when, in fact, they always attach anything they do for community banks to the biggest banks in America. So, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4607 demonstrates just how much my colleagues on the other side of the aisle value the interests of Wall Street over families and consumers on Main Street. This bill would direct the banking, credit union, and consumer protection regulators to loosen their rules to benefit bad actors on Wall Street. The bill doesn’t even allow regulators to consider how to improve safeguards to better protect consumers. It is absurd that we are here today discussing yet another bill that leads to massive deregulation and seeks to tip the scales in favor of the financial industry. The interests of the public are what we should be focused on. This bill is yet another piece of the harmful and reckless Republican agenda. Only a few months ago, Republicans jammed their tax scam legislation through this Chamber. They added $1.8 trillion to the Federal debt in order to line the pockets of Wall Street and other megacorporations with billions in tax cuts, leaving families on Main Street and generations of their children just to pick up the tab. Democrats rejected that terrible piece of legislation and should now reject H.R. 4607 as well. Americans for Financial Reform, a coalition of more than 200 consumer civil rights, investor, retiree, community, labor, faithbased, and business groups said that H.R. 4607, ‘‘contains no consideration of the public benefits that are the justification for creating the regulations in the first place, and which regulators should be seeking to preserve. Any mandate to tailor regulations must include consideration of public benefits, rather than being a onesided directive to reduce business costs.’’ I agree. For Members who are concerned with maintaining strong protections, I would highlight that Trump’s OMB Director, Mick Mulvaney, has been illegally installed as Acting Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and is working every day to dial back the important work of the Consumer Bureau from within. Congress should not be giving Mr. Mulvaney, or anyone the President eventually appoints and is confirmed to serve as the next Director of the Consumer Bureau, a green light to gut consumer protections and reduce the Consumer Bureau’s ability to hold bad actors accountable. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 4607, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I listened very carefully to my friend on the other side of the aisle. Again, her comments were very heavy on thematics, very heavy on extraneous material. Unfortunately, it was a little light on the facts of H.R. 4607. The text of the bill is 3
1⁄2pages long; so it doesn’t take very long to read. But I remind all of my colleagues that this is common sense. In and of itself, this bill changes no rules. All it does is tell our regulators that every 7 years, why don’t you look at what you have done and publish a report. If you want to change any rule, you have to go through the formal rulemaking process to repropose a rule, to get public comment. So, again, in and of itself, it changes no rules. I almost want to ask my friend on the other side of the aisle: What is she scared of? What is so wrong with simply looking at the rules that have been promulgated to see if they are actually working? Are they helping our constituents? Are they making economic opportunity more available for all? What is so odd is, the original EGRPRA legislation that dates back to the Clinton era was overwhelmingly supported on both sides of the aisle. So what the gentleman from Georgia is doing in H.R. 4607 is simply saying all financial regulators, including the National Credit Union Administration and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which really didn’t even exist in the Clinton era, ought to do the same thing. They are saying, instead of doing it every 10 years, let’s do it every 7 years. Just take a look and report. That is all it is. It is a selfreporting requirement, which I think, Mr. Speaker, is why this has already been supported overwhelmingly on a bipartisan basis in the House Financial Services Committee. So with all of the various scare tactics and horror stories that we have heard from the other side of the aisle on a mere reporting requirement, again, I ask, Mr. Speaker: What are they scared of? What we are ultimately trying to do here is make sure that the regulatory burden is not such that it harms the very people I spoke about earlier in my opening comments: that it doesn’t hurt Dan, a Navy veteran from Illinois who, because of the regulatory burden, was forced to shut down his small business; that it doesn’t hurt Anne in Wisconsin, who is just trying to get a loan to remodel her garage; that it doesn’t hurt Michele and her daughter in Missouri. Her daughter was just simply seeking a car loan to buy her first car. These are the people whom we are trying to help. And by the way, all banks—small, medium, and large—are lending to businesses and to consumers, and we want them to do that in a robust but responsible way. So, from time to time, let’s look at the regulations and ensure that they are still helping us achieve equal financial opportunity for all so that our constituents can achieve their share of the American Dream, that they can achieve financial independence. This received strong, bipartisan support, Madam Speaker, in the House Financial Services Committee. It ought to receive strong, bipartisan support on the House floor. Madam Speaker, I urge all Members to vote for and adopt H.R. 4607, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. ROBY). All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 747, the previous question is ordered on the bill, as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. 
Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Madam Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentlewoman opposed to the bill? Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Madam Speaker, I am opposed. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to recommit. The Clerk read as follows: 
Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts moves to recommit the bill H.R. 4607 to the Committee on Financial Services with instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith with the following amendment: Page 3, line 21, strike ‘‘otherwise determined’’ and insert ‘‘such action is at the request of and for the personal gain of the President, his or her immediate family members, or senior Executive Branch officials who are required to file annual financial disclosure forms, or is otherwise determined inappropriate’’. 
Mr. LEUTKEMEYER. Madam Speaker, I reserve a point of order on the motion to recommit. The SPEAKER pro tempore. A point of order is reserved. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from Massachusetts is recognized for 5 minutes in support of her motion. Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Madam Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended. My amendment is a commonsense measure that protects the American people from corruption and conflicts of interest. My amendment simply states that before taking any action to eliminate or change a regulation, regulators must disclose any communications from the White House or the President’s family advocating for the action and whether the President, his family, or any senior administration officials would benefit financially from such action. The American people need to have confidence that their government is working in the best interest of the people and not to enrich a President and his family and wealthy friends. Every day, the news is filled with stories that raise this very question. Does the Trump family benefit when the EPA loosens environmental safeguards on construction projects? Does Jared Kushner’s deeply indebted family business receive favorable treatment when he advocates for certain policies? Do the President’s sons get special permits from foreign governments when the President changes policies towards those countries? Who in the administration gets richer when our coasts are opened up to oil drilling, when tariffs are levied on steel, or when predatory lenders are allowed to prey on college students? President Trump has rejected the norm that all modernday Presidents have followed. His refusal to release his tax returns or to remove himself from his family business necessitates codifying the norms and practices of previous Presidents into law in this disclosure. Congress must do its job and provide a necessary check on a President who has shown contempt for his basic duty to put Americans first. All of these policies affect American families. They affect the taxes we pay, the air we breathe, and whether our kids can afford to go to college. We deserve to know if these decisions are being made to enrich a President and if they are being made at the taxpayers’ expense. This simple act of disclosure will allow the American people to judge for themselves who this administration is really looking out for. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speaker, I withdraw my reservation of a point of order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The reservation of the point of order is withdrawn. Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speaker, I claim the time in opposition. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Missouri is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this matter today. It is kind of interesting that we have before us an amendment that basically is something that deals with a financial services bill, something that deals with a financial services issue, yet we had the EPA and a whole bunch of other agencies brought into the discussion here, which has nothing to do with what we are trying to talk about here today. The amendment talks about the President or his immediate family members. How is it possible that, unless those family members have the authority to make the request, they even should be considered? This is sort of pulling things out of the air here that make no sense to me. This is a very simple bill that we have where all we are looking at trying to do is take the EGRPRA law that says that, every 10 years, all the rules and regulations are reviewed. All we are doing is putting two agencies back into this group of agencies that are under review, one that was not even in existence at the time of the bill’s passage back in the nineties, the CFPB; and the other one that needs to be included is the National Credit Union. All we are doing is taking that 10year review down to 7. Why is this controversial? We are taking an agency that was not even included in this originally and putting it under the purview of this bill so that there can be a review of the rules and regulations. Is there lack of transparency on the other side? Do we no longer want to be concerned about what is going on? Do we no longer want to know that the rules and regulations are appropriately adjudicated here by these agencies? I think that is the wrong way to go. I think that we need to have more transparency. Reducing from 10 years down to 7 gives us an opportunity to have a more constant review of these things to make sure that the bureaucratic folks in the executive branch of the government don’t run away with what should be, in my view, the authority of the Congress. b1330 Madam Speaker, I think that the motion to recommit is way out of line here, and I don’t think we need to waste any more time on it. Madam Speaker, I ask folks to decline the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to recommit. There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it. Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2226) to amend the Truth in Lending Act to provide a safe harbor from certain requirements related to qualified mortgages for residential mortgage loans held on an originating depository institution’s portfolio, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2226 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Portfolio Lending and Mortgage Access Act’’. 
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Kentucky? There was no objection. Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, H.R. 2226, the Portfolio Lending and Mortgage Access Act, represents a very simple solution to a significant policy challenge facing our economy: how to expand access to mortgage credit without replicating the accumulation of excess risk in the mortgagebacked securities market like we witnessed in the runup to the 2008 financial crisis. My legislation achieves both goals by extending the qualified mortgage legal safe harbor to small creditors, banks, and credit unions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or less, that originate and hold residential mortgage loans in portfolio, rather than selling or securitizing them, allowing those lenders to satisfy DoddFrank’s abilitytorepay rule. Such a policy would actually incentivize private sector risk retention—a goal of the DoddFrank Act itself—and mark a return to relationship lending in which a bank or credit union can tailor products to a consumer’s needs and credit risk, without running afoul of onesizefitsall government requirements. Under CFPB regulations, only governmentdefined qualified mortgages enjoy a presumption that a lender has satisfied the DoddFrank law’s abilitytorepay requirements. Small banks and credit unions have been disproportionately impacted by these rules, given their reliance upon residential mortgage lending and greater involvement in small dollar or balloon loans that run afoul of current QM regulations. It is no surprise that Harvard researchers have found that, since DoddFrank’s passage, community banks have lost market share at a rate double that experienced between 2006 and 2010, a period including the entirety of the financial crisis. It is also not a surprise that many small community financial institutions have testified in front of the House Financial Services Committee and to many of my colleagues that they have simply left the mortgage business altogether because of the difficulties associated with the QM rule as currently constructed. Indeed, a third of the National Association of Realtors survey respondents reported being unable to close mortgages due to a requirement of the qualified mortgage rule. Residential mortgages were the product or service most often identified by surveyed banks as a candidate for discontinuation as a result of DoddFrank. A recent study by the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University documents the falling share of bank participation in mortgage originations. Everyone agrees, especially after the 2008 financial crisis, that a borrower should be required to show a demonstrable ability to repay. The only question is: Who is in the best position to make that determination—a community banker with a professional and, perhaps, even a personal relationship with the borrower who has full view of that borrower’s character, creditworthiness, financial situation, and who is willing to assume 100 percent of the downside risk of default; or is it an unaccountable, unelected bureaucrat in Washington, D.C., who literally knows absolutely nothing about that borrower? By bearing 100 percent of the risk, financial institutions have every incentive to make sure that a borrower can afford to repay a loan. Banks and credit unions would have more than just skin in the game. Under this legislation, their interests would align perfectly with that of a borrower. As one witness in front of our committee testified: ‘‘A financial institution that retains a loan’s credit and interestrate risk has a keen interest in engaging in thorough, sound underwriting to determine the borrower’s ability to repay. Allowing a financial institution to make a customerspecific lending decision on a loan it intends to hold in its portfolio can be a more effective way of protecting consumers than regulatory attempts to micromanage mortgage terms with inflexible standards.’’ No less than Barney Frank, former chairman of the committee, endorsed this concept in a hearing before this committee, saying he ‘‘would like the main safeguard against bad loans to be risk retention, because that leaves the decision in the hands of whoever is making the loan,’’ the CFPB also, itself, acknowledged this key point in its own rulemaking, where it recognized that portfolio lenders ‘‘have strong incentives to carefully consider whether a consumer will be able to repay a portfolio loan at least in part because the small creditor retains the risk of default.’’ This legislation also presents a viable alternative to the ‘‘originate to distribute’’ mortgage lending model that contributed to the subprime mortgage meltdown and bubble in residential real estate and taxpayer bailouts. The 
result is expanded access to mortgage credit without additional risk to the financial system or to the taxpayer. In fact, this is particularly important for young families and firsttime home buyers, who tend to have difficulty meeting the abilitytorepay requirements due to circumstances, such as significant student loan debt, but who are otherwise creditworthy. I have been working on this legislation for 5 years now, and I am happy to announce that, this year, we had a bipartisan breakthrough. That is because, at the committee markup, I offered an amendment that limited the scope of this bill to financial institutions with less than $10 billion in assets. And my distinguished colleague, Representative CAPUANO , offered a technical amendment that enhanced the legislation by clarifying a few key provisions. I am pleased to report that, because of those two amendments, the Portfolio Lending and Mortgage Access Act passed with unanimous support in the committee and is now on the floor today for consideration. I want to thank Chairman HENSARLING , Ranking Member W ATERS , Representative CAPUANO , the Kentucky Bankers Association, the Kentucky Credit Union League, the American Bankers Association, the Independent Community Bankers of America, the Credit Union National Association, the National Association of Federal Credit Unions, the National Association of Home Builders, and the United States Chamber of Commerce for their hard work on this important legislation. If passed by the House, it is my hope that the Portfolio Lending and Mortgage Access Act moves quickly through the Senate. Eleven of our Democratic colleagues in the upper Chamber support this exact language, which is in Chairman CRAPO ’s community financial institution relief bill. Together, Republicans and Democrats can deliver on the regulatory relief that many of us in this body have promised to our constituents that will enable more of them to buy the home of their dreams. Madam Speaker, I invite all of my colleagues to vote for this important prohomeownership legislation that perfectly aligns lender and borrower interests to the benefit of America. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. KILDEE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for his persistence in offering this legislation. As he said, in committee, we had a successful markup where we were able to unanimously support this legislation. It is important legislation. We don’t agree on everything. One doesn’t have to go very far. Back in committee, right now, where we have a rather contentious markup on a budget using estimates, as I said in that meeting: When we do agree, we should come together. Representative BARR and I have talked about this issue for quite some time, and I am really pleased to see it move forward. Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2226, the Portfolio Lending and Mortgage Access Act, which would allow certain mortgages that are originated and retained in portfolio by a bank with less than $10 billion in total assets to be considered as qualified mortgages. In the leadup to the financial crisis, there were a number of mortgage lenders that did not do their due diligence in underwriting mortgages. We saw a number of exotic products being offered to individuals and families premised on a continually rising housing market. These included ‘‘no doc’’ loans where the lender did not document or verify a borrower’s income. There were real consequences for those sorts of loans. Many of these borrowers never really had any hope of paying back those loans. As those mortgages went into default, the foreclosures helped lead to a financial crisis that devastated the U.S. economy, and millions of families were stripped from their single source of wealth: the equity in their home. In the wake of that crisis, Congress passed the DoddFrank Act and required lenders to assess a consumer’s ability to repay their mortgage loans. We also provided statutory penalties for mortgage lenders that did not follow these new underwriting standards. Congress also directed the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to enact regulations to create a safe harbor for creditors, where it would be presumed that the creditor evaluated the borrower’s ability to repay. In 2013, under the direction of former Director Cordray, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau released its abilitytorepay and qualified mortgage rule. This rule defined how lenders could take advantage of that safe harbor. Qualified mortgages, commonly referred to as QM loans, are a special category of loans that have strong underwriting standards and certain nonpredatory loan features that help make them more likely that borrowers will be able to afford their mortgages. So if a lender originates a QM loan, it means that the lender met certain requirements, and it is assumed that the lender followed the abilitytorepay rule as drafted by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. This also allows the lender to be shielded from certain types of liability associated with originating bad loans. I and my colleagues were pleased that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau tailored the rule to ensure that lenders who serve rural and underserved communities have flexibility in serving their customers. While that was a very good first step, Congress has pushed to expand this tailoring to include even more community banks and credit unions, consistent with safe and sound operations. H.R. 2226, as amended in the committee, provides this targeted and, I think, reasonable relief. As Representative BARR and I have indicated, there are additional refinements to the bill that I would have still liked to have seen adopted, such as additional guardrails on the types of products offered. I am glad, however, and as Mr. BARRindicated, the leadership of the committee, the majority, agreed to crucial language offered by Mr. CAPUANO to improve the bill. As amended, lenders are required to continually hold these loans in portfolio, and not only consider and document, but verify a borrower’s income information. Congress should not be in the business of allowing lenders to underwrite and offer mortgage loans that borrowers have no ability to repay. I am supportive of this bill for that reason, but also because I believe it will help in areas of the country that have weaker housing markets. This has really been the reason that I have been interested in the issue of portfolio lending. As many know, I represent Flint, Michigan, which not unlike a number of communities across the country have very weak and very low cost markets. You can purchase a single family home in Flint for $25,000—not $250,000— $25,000. Under the QM rules, financial institutions sometimes, justifiably, struggle to make these small mortgages, resulting in even more stagnant markets—it is a vicious cycle—and weakening these markets permanently. If we can’t get people financed into mortgages, these communities and the market will never recover. b1345 This bill will encourage community banks and credit unions to make those smaller mortgages, to help weaker markets. It is for that reason and many others, but particularly for that reason, that I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation. It is a big step in the right direction for weak markets. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting it. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, I want to thank my friend, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. KILDEE ), for his constructive comments, his support. And the gentleman is absolutely correct. He engaged with me and my colleagues who were cosponsoring this legislation in a very constructive manner. He made valuable contributions, along with Mr. CAPUANO  and the ranking member. Several other members on the other side of the aisle, Mr. PERLMUTTER , for example, offered his thoughtful comments as well. I appreciate the support, the bipartisan support, working through a compromise to get this legislation to where 
it is today, so I thank the gentleman for that. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. EMMER ), who is also a sponsor of this legislation and a distinguished member of the Committee on Financial Services. Mr. EMMER. Madam Speaker, when the House passed the Financial CHOICE Act to repeal DoddFrank last year, we did so because we believe in Main Street, we believe in the consumer, the American consumer. DoddFrank promised to protect consumers from the big banks on Wall Street. In reality, DoddFrank has punished small banks and credit unions and, ultimately, the American consumer. The loss of community financial institutions tells the story. In my State of Minnesota, we had 513 community banks in 2000. Today, we have about 309, and continue to experience a drought in de novo charters. Credit unions have, unfortunately, faced similar challenges. This means there are fewer places for Americans to turn when they are seeking a loan for their first home or perhaps to get a small business off the ground. One specific provision in DoddFrank requires lenders to deny loans to individuals who do not meet government prescribed standards. This, according to Washington, makes loans safer, since, of course, government knows best. But in reality, these mortgages have not been made safer. They have been made unavailable. As a result, the likelihood of getting approved for a loan and becoming a homeowner has plummeted. Representative BARR’s legislation, the Portfolio Lending and Mortgage Access Act, takes steps to empower lenders in Minnesota and across the country and to better serve the needs of their customers by extending important protections to institutions and ensuring access to credit for American borrowers. At the end of the day, the most effective way to ensure an individual has the ability to repay does not always need to be governmentprescribed. I appreciate my colleague from Kentucky’s hard work to protect and reinvigorate our community financial institutions, and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2226, the Portfolio Lending and Mortgage Access Act, as it comes before the House for a vote. Mr. KILDEE. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. HULTGREN ), who is also, I believe, a sponsor of the legislation. Mr. HULTGREN. Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman BARRfor yielding. Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of H.R. 2226, the Portfolio Lending and Mortgage Access Act, and I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this legislation. This is something that Chairman BARR has worked on for at least two Congresses now, and I feel that we are finally in a place where we can get some commonsense changes to the CFPB’s qualified mortgage rules that provide relief to community banks and credit unions. I was very pleased to see this legislation get a unanimous vote in the Committee on Financial Services earlier this year. I am also very happy to see that the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs is taking note of this issue and has advanced similar legislation. The DoddFrank Act required the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to come up with a series of new rules regarding mortgage lending. One of these rules was the socalled qualified mortgage rule, which provides a safe harbor to loans if they meet certain criteria prescribed by the Bureau. This effectively means that the market treats any loans that are not qualified mortgages as being much riskier. The Bureau’s rule is especially challenging for community banks and credit unions. These lenders do not tend to be as automated as larger financial institutions. They also tend to put more time into underwriting mortgages to reflect the unique circumstances of the customers in their communities. However, the CFPB’s qualified mortgage rule took away much of this flexibility from these lenders by doing things like instituting a 43 percent debttoincome ratio. This might be a good indicator of repayment risk for a lot of mortgages, but a onesizefitsall is almost never a good approach. The CFPB’s rule also did not acknowledge the fact that small lenders do not tend to sell these loans into the secondary market. They keep 100 percent of the risk on their portfolio. This means these lenders have a very strong incentive to issue loans that they believe will be repaid. If loans held on portfolio can be treated as qualified mortgages, then these banks and credit unions will have a stronger incentive to manage any risk associated with these mortgages. The Portfolio Lending and Mortgage Access Act would treat loans held on portfolio by community banks and credit unions as qualified mortgages if they meet some other criteria, such as not having a negative amortization or interestonly features. This change to the CFPB’s qualified mortgage rule will go a long way towards simplifying how our community financial institutions can help families achieve the dream of home ownership. I have been hearing about this legislation from community banks and credit unions in Illinois, and I am confident it will help my constituents. Madam Speaker, I want to encourage all of my colleagues to support this important legislation. Mr. KILDEE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to close. Madam Speaker, just to reiterate, we don’t agree on everything. Even some of the debate in this conversation, I think we could find areas of disagreement. But when it comes to the specifics of this legislation, I think it strikes a good balance. The balance, for me, being the notion that we can deem these mortgages held by smaller institutions, as long as they are held in portfolio, as meeting the QM requirements. In exchange for that, what we get is, in weak markets, we get a chance for folks who essentially have been locked out of home ownership to be able to get a small mortgage literally on a $25,000, $30,000, or $40,000 home and begin to build equity that will return value to that family and to that community for a long, long time. For that reason, I support this legislation and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting ‘‘yes’’ on it. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. In closing, let me just reiterate that this legislation solves two problems. It solves the problem of responsible expansion of access to mortgage credit, access to that American Dream of home ownership; and, at the same time, preventing the mistakes that led to the 2008 financial crisis, the originate to distribute model where originators of mortgages had no skin in the game and they allowed those mortgages to be poorly underwritten or not underwritten at all, with no documentation, and then securitized and sold into the secondary market, really without any eye towards the consumer and the borrower’s ability to repay. Everybody in this institution, as evidenced by the bipartisan work here, we all recognize that a borrower should demonstrate an ability to repay that loan, but the crux of this legislation, at the core of this legislation is a recognition that a local community banker, a local credit union, a lender with a personal relationship with a borrower is in the best position to determine whether or not that borrower, that prospective homeowner, can repay that loan. When there is risk retention, when that lender is charged with the responsibility of maintaining that loan in portfolio, the lender is much more incentivized to properly underwrite that loan and make sure that that customer, that borrower, that future homeowner, has a demonstrable ability to repay. I think it is a much better substitute to a onesizefitsall credit box from, frankly, bureaucrats in Washington, D.C., who have no eye towards the creditworthiness of that particular borrower. We have worked with our friends on the other side of the aisle to make this a bipartisan piece of legislation limiting the size of the institutions that can access this regulatory relief. But, clearly, when community financial institutions, bankers from around the country, every part of the country, are saying that they see the QM rule as not ‘‘qualified mortgages,’’ but as ‘‘quitting mortgages;’’ and when we see an 
unnecessary constraint of mortgage credit; and when the National Association of Realtors are reporting that they are unable to close mortgages due to this onerous qualified mortgage rule, clearly the pendulum has swung too far. So, yes, we needed some reforms in the aftermath of the financial crisis. This QM rule went too far. This is a recalibration of that. And this is important regulatory relief for our community financial institutions that will inure to the benefit of the American homebuying public, and it will do so in a responsible way, providing a viable alternative to the originate to distribute practices that really led to the financial crisis. Madam Speaker, let me just make one final observation, and that is to give credit to the administration. The Department of the Treasury, in their findings and recommendations in their report on banks and credit unions, they recognized that this was a problem in the mortgage lending space and they made a recommendation also to increase the portfolio lending safe harbor to institutions with $10 billion in assets or lower; and that, as they argued, will accommodate loans made and retained by small depository institutions, provide that needed regulatory relief to our community financial institutions, and also expand access to mortgage credit in a responsible way. Madam Speaker, I thank my colleagues for their support. At this time I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. BARR) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2226, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
COMMUNITY BANK REPORTING RELIEF ACT Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4725) to amend the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to require short form call reports for certain depository institutions. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4725 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Community Bank Reporting Relief Act’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. BARR) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. KILDEE ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky. Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I rise today in support of H.R. 4725, the Community Bank Reporting Relief Act. Community banks were hit hard by the Great Recession and the ensuing regulations. Numerous bankers have told me they are spending more and more money and resources and time on compliance costs and less money and resources on actually providing services to customers. This is particularly alarming because these small banks are so critical to their communities. From sponsoring the local Tball team, to lending money to a farmer for the next year’s crop, to helping the single mom purchase a used car so she can get to work, these banks are involved at every level of our communities all across America, but because of overregulation, these banks are rapidly closing and consolidating. Unfortunately, the headline for banks in the Commonwealth of Kentucky is no different. Since the enactment of the DoddFrank financial control law, we have seen a 20 percent drop in the number of banks in our State and there has been a dearth of charters for new banks. In fact, since 2010, there have been only a few de novo charters for banks nationwide. Now, some people say that consolidation and mergers have been a long term trend for the last 30 years and, therefore, not related to the recent uptick in regulations unrelated to Dodd Frank, but they are clearly not seeing the bigger picture, because even after mergers, many branches in rural and other underserved communities are closing, leaving many Kentuckians to drive a town or two over just to get to the nearest bank. It is not just about a longterm trend of consolidation. There have been literally no new charters, whereas before the DoddFrank law was enacted, there were many, many new charters every year; and since the DoddFrank law was enacted, no new charters. So the consolidation trend has gotten a lot worse since this avalanche of red tape coming out of Washington, D.C., and that is having a very negative impact on rural and underserved American communities. While new technologies are helping bring banking services to anyone with an internet connection, many people still prefer the personal oneonone banking style that they grew up with and the personal interaction often that helps the banks themselves understand the exact needs of their customers. b1400 The DoddFrank law was almost 2,300 pages and required dozens of agencies to create new regulations or revise existing ones. As a result, these agencies issued hundreds of regulations and, according to the Mercatus Center, the law placed about 28,000 new restrictions on the banking industry, effectively doubling the number of regulatory restrictions in title 12 of the Code of Federal Regulation to more than 52,000. Although not part of the DoddFrank rush of regulations, a growing number of banks have cited the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council’s, or FFIEC, Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income—or call reports, as they are commonly called—as too burdensome. Each quarter, all national banks, State member banks, insured State nonmember banks, and savings associations are required to file these call reports. The reports contain approximately 50 pages of financial data on each bank, including their assets, liabilities, capital accounts, expenses, and income. However, these reports are very burdensome for community banks with limited resources and offer little value to the regulators relative to the last quarter’s report. Thankfully, H.R. 4725, the Community Bank Reporting Relief Act, is fighting back against the bureaucratic nightmare of complying with these 52,000 restrictions by allowing banks with less than $5 billion in consolidated assets to file their call reports every 6 months as opposed to every 3 months. The impact of this regulatory change will be a huge development for banks across the country. Now they will spend less time on call reports and more time on actually helping customers. This means more capital will be flowing into our local economies, spurring job growth and economic development, while making a real difference in the lives of Americans trying to access affordable capital to buy a new home or car or start a business. I want to thank my good friend from Illinois, Congressman RANDY  HULTGREN , for his leadership and for introducing this important legislation. Due to his leadership, this great community bank bill is being considered as a suspension on the floor today. That means that there is a great chance that this bill will build on its unanimous support earned during the House Financial Services Committee markup and will be a bipartisan provision in the Senate Banking chairman’s Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, which is expected to pass out of the Senate very soon. 
In addition to Congressman HULTGREN , I want to thank Chairman HENSARLING and Ranking Member WATERS for their hard work on this critical legislation, and I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 4725, the Community Bank Reporting Relief Act. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 4725, the Community Bank Reporting Relief Act, which would reduce reporting requirements through first and third quarter call reports for depository institutions with less than $5 billion in total consolidated assets. This bill provides targeted regulatory relief to many of our smaller financial institutions, as has been the desire of both Democrats and Republicans on the committee and in this Congress for some time. Under the Obama administration, the Federal banking agencies began taking a series of steps to reduce and streamline various bank reporting requirements. Many of these requirements had existed for decades, including the quarterly Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income for a Bank, which is commonly referred to as a call report. These efforts by regulators have included creating a simpler call report for most community banks with less than $1 billion. Regulators have already been exploring raising the threshold to a comparable level that is proposed by this legislation. The regulators also allow for some data to be reported semiannually, as this bill would allow, or annually rather than quarterly. I am pleased that H.R. 4725 would give the regulators discretion to decide what information should be included in a reduced call report. It is also key that the bill would require a full call report every other quarter for banks under $5 billion, including at the end of the year, to make sure that regulators and the public have sufficient information on the health of financial institutions. Furthermore, this bill would permit regulators to limit the regulatory relief, as appropriate. This would, for example, exclude banks with foreign offices or ones that are affiliated with much larger banks, as they do today. This bill would appropriately maintain robust oversight of our Nation’s largest banks while providing targeted relief for smaller institutions. As I said, we don’t agree on everything. Many of us on this side believe that the robust protections built into DoddFrank have strengthened the financial system but that there are ways that we can improve and refine those restrictions in order to support particularly smaller institutions. This is a step in that direction, and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4725. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. HULTGREN ), the sponsor of the legislation and the vice chairman of the Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Securities, and Investments. Mr. HULTGREN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of the Community Bank Reporting Relief Act. I would like to begin by thanking Leader MCCARTHY and Chairman H ENSARLING for their support in getting this legislation to the floor. I also want to thank and express my appreciation to my colleagues, ANDY BARR and TERRI SEWELL , for serving as original cosponsors on this legislation. I would also like to point out that this identical language has been included in the bipartisan regulatory relief bill that the Senate is expected to take up maybe sometime this week. By way of background, the Federal Financial Institutions Examinations Council requires banks and savings associations to file a quarterly Consolidated Report of Condition and Income, also known as the call report. Banking regulators use data in the call report to monitor the safety, soundness, performance, and risk profile of each institution and to assess the overall condition of the banking system. I think we can all agree that our Federal banking regulators should have regular updates on the overall performance and health of financial institutions. For example, this is important if Federal banking regulators are going to be prudent stewards of Federal deposit insurance. However, this does not mean that the Federal banking regulators need regular reports about every single data point on every single financial institution. Unfortunately, the reporting burden has grown significantly over the years, which means banks have to spend more time with compliance issues rather than working with families and businesses to meet their financial needs. When I introduced similar legislation last Congress, one community banker in Illinois, Greg Ohlendorf, with First Community Bank and Trust, shared with me: ‘‘The quarterly call report has increased to some 80 pages supported by almost 700 pages of instructions, and it represents a growing burden on community banks.’’ According to a survey that the Independent Community Bankers of America conducted of its members in 2014, over 60 percent of the annual cost to prepare the call report goes to personnel salaries. This survey shows that this is not a highly automated process for those institutions and that oftentimes senior executives such as the chief financial officer are responsible for this regulatory burden. We also heard testimony in the Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit Subcommittee hearing from Robert Fisher, president and CEO of Tioga State Bank, on behalf of the ICBA, who stated: ‘‘When I first started in banking in the mid1980s, the report was 18 pages long. No change in our basic business model since that time warrants the sharp growth in our quarterly reporting obligation.’’ The length of the call report has simply gotten out of hand. Washington needs to get out of the way so that community banks can focus on meeting the needs of their communities. The role of smaller financial institutions is especially important in more rural areas, such as in my district, where larger banks tend to not have as many branches. The Community Bank Reporting Relief Act would require Federal banking regulators to permit for a shortform call report every other quarter for banks with less than $5 billion in assets and that satisfy other criteria determined by bank regulators. Federal banking regulators have not demonstrated there are statistically significant variations in this data quarter to quarter, and we heard testimony consistent with this from Tioga State Bank in the House Financial Services Committee. This means the banking regulators are simply collecting too much information too frequently. The Federal banking regulators would be required to take input from our neighborhood banks under consideration when making these changes. This cannot be simply check thebox exercises, but real reform is necessary. However, nothing in this legislation would prevent regulators from having access to the information that they need to adequately understand the health of the banking system. Regulators will still receive the most important information every quarter. The Independent Community Bankers of America has suggested this short form call report include three schedules: schedules RI, an income statement; schedule RIA, changes in bank equity capital; and Schedule RC, the balance sheet. Furthermore, in the event there is any reason for concern about the health of the bank, regulators would maintain their authority to make ad hoc information requests. This legislation is supported by the American Bankers Association, the Independent Community Bankers of America, and the neighborhood banks in all of our districts who are looking for commonsense regulatory relief. I urge my colleagues to vote in support of this legislation. We must cut regulation for community banks. Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Let me once again thank the gentleman from Illinois for his tireless advocacy on behalf of our community financial institutions and providing some commonsense, basic relief to those institutions so that, instead of dealing with paperwork, they could actually better serve their customers and grow our local economies. 
Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. WALDEN ). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Kentucky? There was no objection. Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I will just close by reiterating what I said earlier. From time to time, it is clear that we can come together on solutions to problems that we come across in any regulation, in any aspect of the Federal Government. Even in areas where we might find broad disagreement on the importance of many of the protections that were put in place after the financial crisis, across the aisle, we can often find common ground around particular solutions; and, when we do that, we should act. I think that is why so many of us were pleased to see this legislation come forward to give us a chance to demonstrate that this is a step in the right direction, particularly supporting some of our smaller institutions. I support this legislation and urge my colleagues to do the same. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. BARR) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4725. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR COMBATING THE FINANCING OF TRANSNATIONAL CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS ACT Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4768) to require the President to develop a national strategy to combat the financial networks of transnational organized criminals, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4768 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘National Strategy for Combating the Financing of Transnational Criminal Organizations Act’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. BARR) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. KILDEE ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky. 
Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Kentucky? There was no objection. Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4768, the National Strategy for Combating the Financing of Transnational Criminal Organizations Act. I want to, at the outset, applaud and thank my colleague Mr. KUSTOFF from Tennessee for his leadership on this important legislation and for bringing this solution to the Congress and this solution to the American people. As Members of Congress, our number one responsibility is the national security and the wellbeing of the American people. Unfortunately, transnational criminal organizations threaten the safety of Americans, and we must do 
everything in our power to stop them. Transnational criminal organizations, or TCOs as they are called for short, are engaged in illegal business ventures around the world such as money laundering, cybercrime, and the trafficking of drugs, weapons, endangered species, and even human beings. While TCOs may not be motivated by a particular radical, political, or religions ideology, they are motivated by money, and they will stop at nothing to get it. According to a 2011 report published by the Obama administration, entitled, ‘‘Strategy to Combat Transnational Organized Crime,’’ TCOs have dramatically ramped up their size, scope, and influence, and are even teaming up with terrorist organizations and corrupt foreign officials to expand their networks and conceal their illicit financial assets. These TCOs cost the Western Hemisphere about 3.5 percent of gross domestic product annually, and they generate for themselves around $870 billion, which is roughly the value of the world’s largest company, Apple. President Trump, on February 9, 2017, issued Executive Order 13773 on ‘‘Enforcing Federal Law with Respect to Transnational Criminal Organizations and Preventing International Trafficking.’’ b1415 It states that TCOs in the form of transnational drug cartels have a stronghold in America and threaten the safety of the American people. From former President Obama to current President Trump, TCOs are recognized as a major risk to national security. That is why I am very pleased to see that my good friend from Tennessee, Congressman DAVID KUSTOFF , has introduced H.R. 4768, the National Strategy for Combating the Financing of Transnational Criminal Organizations Act. This legislation requires the President, the Treasury Secretary, financial regulators, and other appropriate officials to create a national strategy to combat TCOs and their illicit use of financial networks. Specifically, the legislation requires them to identify and assess the largest TCO threats to the United States. It also mandates that the strategy include the identification of the people or groups that facilitate access to financial networks for the TCOs through laundering assets, such as, real estate, art and antiquities, smuggling bulk cash, exploitation of shell companies, and the use of covert cryptocurrencies and other cyber technologies. The legislation also requires the strategy to include longterm and shortterm goals, an explanation of how goals will be integrated into existing national security apparatuses, and, if needed, suggest legislative and regulatory changes to better fight against TCOs. This legislation passed the House Committee on Financial Services with unanimous support in January, and it is my hope that it passes with unanimous support today on the House floor. Mr. Speaker, in addition to Congressman KUSTOFF , I thank Chairman H ENSARLING and Ranking Member W ATERS  for their hard work on this issue. Together we can, in a bipartisan way, empower our government to better fight transnational criminal organizations, making the American people safer and our economy stronger. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 4768, the National Strategy for Combating the Financing of Transnational Criminal Organizations Act. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, if ever there is a time for Democrats and Republicans to come together in a bipartisan fashion, it would be around this issue, around an issue to combat the financing of transnational criminal organizations. That is what H.R. 4768 would do. Specifically, it would require the Secretary of the Treasury to lead the effort, in consultation with other key agencies and departments, and update the strategy to fight these organizations at least every 2 years. Additionally, the legislation requires the administration to assess the key threats, financial support networks, and methods used by criminal groups to launder the proceeds of illicit activities. In passing this legislation, we will not only build upon but also cement the importance of the interagency approach taken by the prior administration in combating the impact of global criminal enterprises. Indeed, in 2010, the Obama administration conducted a comprehensive assessment of organized crime, the first such review that had taken place since the mid1990s. The assessment came to the alarming conclusion that the threat of global criminal networks had become more complex, volatile, and destabilizing and that such groups were proliferating, striking new and powerful alliances, and engaging in a growing range of illicit activities such as we have never seen before. To combat this growing threat and lessen its impact both domestically and on our foreign partners, the Obama administration, in 2011, issued a comprehensive interagency strategy that identified 56 priority actions across five strategic objectives. One of these key objectives included breaking the economic power of transnational criminal networks and protecting strategic markets and the U.S. financial system from penetration and abuse by transnational organized crime. This strategic objective, in particular, resonates with me, as I have always believed strongly that following the money and using our economic leverage is the best way to counter illicit activity. This is especially true in countering transnational criminal organizations, whose primary objective is economic gain. In a number of ways, this legislation before us will ensure that the Treasury, as well as the intelligence and broader U.S. national security apparatus, remains focused on some of the emerging threats posed by transnational organized crime groups; including, kleptocrats, human traffickers, drug traffickers, and cybercriminals. Additionally, the legislation explicitly requires the administration to examine how such groups exploit the use of shell companies, misuse digital currencies and other cyber technologies. I am also pleased that, with the concurrence of the chairman and the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. KUSTOFF ), the committee agreed to adopt an amendment offered by Ranking Member WATERS that sharpens the bill’s focus on the methods by which transnational organized crime groups launder illicit funds using real estate and other tangible goods, such as art and antiquities. These significant vulnerabilities have been identified as major threats to our national security and the integrity of our financial system by a broad range of bipartisan experts, including the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and the Financial Action Task Force. For example, just last year, FinCEN noted in a public advisory that: ‘‘Real estate transactions and the real estate market have certain characteristics that make them vulnerable to abuse by illicit actors. . . . For these reasons and others, drug traffickers, corrupt officials, and other criminals can and have used real estate to conceal the existence and origins of their illicit funds.’’ The entities and individuals that have sought to exploit real estate to conceal illicit funds includes Iranian banks subject to U.S. sanctions, Russian oligarchs and Russianorganized crime rings, as well as Venezuelan officials found to be engaged in narcotics trafficking. The fact that these vulnerabilities are not merely theoretical and have been used by a wide range of criminal groups should disturb all of us. We also know that money laundering through the global art and antiquities market is another key method for washing illicit funds, and that is undoubtedly being exploited by wellorganized transnational criminal groups. Indeed, we know that the looting and trafficking in cultural heritage is a source of revenue that has funded ISIS’ heinous activities, and we know that the opaque characteristics of the highend art market and its lack of basic anti moneylaundering requirements make it a target for illicit funds. So I am pleased that the members of this committee were able to agree that real estate and art market vulnerabilities should be given due consideration when it comes to transnational organized crime. Again, this is one of those 
subjects around which bipartisanship should be assumed. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to join in this bipartisan effort and to support this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. KUSTOFF ), a member of the House Financial Services Committee and a former United States Attorney from the Western District of Tennessee, who has brought considerable prosecutorial experience in drafting and authoring this legislation. Mr. KUSTOFF of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, the National Strategy for Combating the Financing of Transnational Criminal Organizations Act. On February 9 of 2017, last year, President Trump issued an executive order directing the Federal Government to combat international drug trafficking. Now, before I go any further, I want to take note that this executive order was issued in the third week of the Trump administration. This early action gives us an idea of how seriously we must take this issue. The executive order recognizes that illegal drugs are pouring into our country and they are threatening American safety, primarily at the hands of cartels and other transnational criminal organizations. These criminal organizations are responsible, in large part, for the rising opioid epidemic sweeping across our Nation. Take my district of west Tennessee, where we continue to see a rise in the deaths caused by opioid overdoses. From heroin to fentanyl, and the more potent synthetic opioid known as carfentanil, we must continue to use every available resource to prevent the further destruction of our communities. We have got to say enough is enough. The important legislation that we are discussing today will create a plan to track illicit money channels and cut them off at the source. Specifically, it directs the United States Treasury Department to develop a national strategy aimed at disrupting these financial crimes. The Treasury Department will work hand in hand with the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Justice, the State Department, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to produce a yearly report outlining a strategy and detailing ways that the United States Government can continue to prevent these financial crimes. For far too long, these criminal organizations have used illicit business ventures to further finance their activities, which range from money laundering and cybercrime to the trafficking of drugs, human trafficking, weapons trafficking, and trafficking in endangered species. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime estimates that these cartel and transnational criminal organizations generate nearly $870 billion a year. This money is used to directly threaten the security and the prosperity of the United States of America and other countries in the Western Hemisphere. Our legislation is a critical step in disrupting this illicit finance and putting an end to the needless crimes committed by cartels. As we have seen, these organizations have evolved in a continued effort to evade law enforcement. Therefore, in an effort to stay one step ahead of these bad actors, we have also got to evolve. These transnational organizations have developed interstate networks to and from the border in which drugs come up from Central America and the cash returns back to the country of origin. We simply cannot stand idly by as these activities continue. We must keep money out of the hands of those who intend to cause harm to our Nation. I think this legislation does exactly that. I greatly appreciate the hard work done by my colleagues from the Financial Services Committee on this very important legislation. I urge all my colleagues to support its passage. Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. SINEMA ), a cosponsor of this legislation and a distinguished member of the Financial Services Committee. Ms. SINEMA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4768, the National Strategy for Combating the Financing of Transnational Criminal Organizations Act. Mr. Speaker, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration’s Phoenix division, the Sinaloa cartel is the biggest, most violent, and nastiest organization threatening Arizonans, even bigger than MS–13. It is a dangerous and highly sophisticated organization. Sinaloa smuggles heroin and methamphetamine across the border into Arizona and, with it, a pattern of crime, intimidation, and addiction that rips at the very fabric of our communities. Arizonans know we need to be tough, smart, and aggressive to confront Sinaloa and other cartels. Our bill cracks down on the drug cartels and other international crime syndicates that threaten Arizona families and our quality of life by hitting them where it hurts: their bank accounts. Drug cartels like Sinaloa obtain wealth and power through money laundering; cybercrime; and human, drugs, and weapons smuggling. To stop the drug cartels and protect Arizona families, we need a comprehensive approach to cut off the money that fuels their operations. b1430 That is why Congressman KUSTOFF  from Tennessee and I introduced H.R. 4768. This bill requires the administration to develop and execute a strategy that cuts off funding and other resources for transnational criminal organizations and to routinely report to Congress and the American people on the strategy’s progress. Our bill is a commonsense solution that protects Arizona families, communities, and businesses from the threats of transnational organized crime. By focusing on the money, we take a meaningful step in combating cybercrime, money laundering, drug trafficking, and human trafficking, as well as other issues that transnational criminals bring to our communities. I thank Chairman HENSARLING and Ranking Member WATERS for supporting this important legislation, and I will continue working with my colleagues across the aisle to keep Arizona families safe. Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. ROTHFUS ), the vice chairman of the Financial Services Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit. Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman BARRfor yielding me time. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my support for the National Strategy for Combating the Financing of Transnational Criminal Organizations Act. I want to thank my colleague Representative KUSTOFF for his work on this important issue. The Subcommittee on Terrorism and Illicit Finance has been examining global criminal organizations and the threat they pose to the United States financial system. These sophisticated and dangerous organizations, like drug cartels, increasingly pose a direct threat to the safety and security of all Americans. They have fueled the opioid crisis that continues to kill tens of thousands of Americans each year, including the spread of human trafficking, among a host of other illicit activities. I want to remind my colleagues that entire communities are still plagued by this crisis, including hardhit communities in western Pennsylvania. Beyond the opioid crisis, though, I want to highlight an exceptionally dangerous situation in which the United States finds itself. Some of the cartels are now working directly with organizations like Hezbollah, a terrorist organization, as reflected in a recent Politico article. Fortunately, the new administration is taking a tougher stance now with the announcement of a newly created Hezbollah Financing and Narcoterrorism Team. Mr. Speaker, it is about time America fought back against this growing international threat, and this bill will help ensure the government has a strategy to stay in this fight. Lives depend on it. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from North 
Carolina (Mr. B UDD), a member of the Financial Services Committee. Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of Mr. KUSTOFF ’s bill, the National Strategy for Combating the Financing of Transnational Criminal Organizations Act. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend for his leadership on this important issue, even if it does have a really, really long name. I have seen firsthand how these transnational drug cartels can disrupt civil society. In my own district, the opioid epidemic has destroyed innocent people’s lives, including kids, while transnational criminal organizations, or TCOs, profit on people’s misery and their death. TCOs have brought heroin to our streets and, along with it, increased crime, placing additional burdens on law enforcement in local communities. We are in crisis mode, and targeted steps need to be taken to address this epidemic at all phases. We have to crack down on the pusher on the street. We have to crack down on the drug cartels. We have to crack down on the drug companies that have made a profit from overprescription and filling suspect orders. Most of all, we have to crack down on the intricate faceless and unbelievably complex international criminal organizations that allow the profits from these activities into our economy. We must eradicate the international illicit financing networks that are the linchpin of any criminal organization’s operations. But we don’t have a unified national plan. Luckily, this committee has an opportunity to make a difference by coming up with a national strategy and plan to attack transnational criminal organizations’ finances. Mr. KUSTOFF ’s bill would direct the Secretary of the Treasury to provide that plan, a vital first step towards addressing the threat posed by the growing sophistication of illicit financing networks. Passing this bill is a significant step toward an effective, sustained national strategy to attack the funding that makes these TCOs possible. Therefore, it is critical that we continue to maximize cooperation among Federal departments to keep our policies ahead of these transnational criminals. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of Mr. KUSTOFF ’s timely and important piece of legislation. Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. GAETZ ). Mr. GAETZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time. I also thank the gentleman from Tennessee for introducing this responsible legislation. Mr. Speaker, I look forward to circumstances where this administration will have additional tools to deal with transnational criminal organizations, and I hope that we will use those tools to counter the threat posed by Hezbollah. Hezbollah is not a political party. It is not a quaint reflection of history. It is a web of terrorists and criminals, and that web extends here to our hemisphere. In fact, in 2009, there was an arrest made in Philadelphia, where Hezbollah operatives were looking to move 1,200 machine guns into Syria. More recent arrests have been made in Latin America, where countries like Argentina, Peru, and Paraguay are dealing with an enhanced Hezbollah presence. This important legislation will help us build a plan to leverage our allies, to leverage the Organization of American States and other assets so that we recognize the threat that Hezbollah and other terrorist organizations pose and so that we meet that threat head on. Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, obviously, as I said, we need a national strategy to combat the financing of transnational criminal organizations. This legislation requires that such a strategy be put together. It is an issue that crosses virtually every partisan or ideological line. It is an example of legislation that we all can embrace and should support. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to do so, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I, once again, thank my colleagues for supporting this legislation. In particular, I thank the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. KUSTOFF ) for his leadership on this issue. I would note, also, in addition to all of the many sound and persuasive arguments that have been offered for why we need this legislation, this National Strategy for Combating the Financing of Transnational Criminal Organizations Act, the National Fraternal Order of Police has endorsed this legislation, and I include in the RECORD  their letter. 
NATIONAL FRATERNAL  ORDER OF POLICE , Washington, DC, February 15, 2018. Hon. PAULD. R YAN, Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. KEVIN O. M CCARTHY , Majority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. NANCY P. P ELOSI , Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. STENY H. H OYER , Minority Whip, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR MR. SPEAKER AND REPRESENTATIVES  MCCARTHY , PELOSI , ANDHOYER : I am writing on behalf of the members of the Fraternal Order of Police to advise you of our support for H.R. 4768, the ‘‘National Strategy for Combatting the Financing of Transnational Criminal Organizations Act.’’ The Office of National Drug Control Policy was established to set out our strategy in combatting our nation’s drug problem. Similarly, the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services has served as the cornerstone for our nation’s crimefighting efforts for more than two decades. With the growing threat posed by transnational criminal organizations, it is important that we adopt a comprehensive national approach. President Donald J. Trump took the first step by issuing Executive Order #13773, the Enforcing Federal Law with Respect to Transnational Criminal Organizations and Preventing International Trafficking a year ago. The Threat Mitigation Working Group was set up to bring Federal agencies together a common goal of investigating, prosecuting and dismantling transnational gangs. This bill would codify part of this Executive Order by developing a national strategy for combatting transnational criminal organizations. We need to attack their ability to profit from unlawful activitywhether it is money laundering, bulk cash smuggling, shell companies or digital currencies. Simply put, until we can stop the flow of criminal profits to these organized, unlawful enterprises, they will continue to survive no matter how many individuals we arrest and prosecute. On behalf of the more than 335,000 members of the Fraternal Order of Police, we believe this bill will make our country safe from these transnational criminal organizations. If I can provide any additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me or my Senior Advisor, Jim Pasco, in my Washington office. Sincerely, CHUCK CANTERBURY , National President. 
Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, as a Member of Congress representing a State that has been ravaged by heroin and opioid addiction, I can’t think of a more important thing for this Congress to do than to develop a national strategy for combating these transnational gangs that are preying on our communities. Once again, I commend Mr. KUSTOFF  for his leadership in this area and in this effort and in this fight. I applaud my colleagues for supporting the legislation on both sides of the aisle. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. PALMER ). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. BARR) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4768, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
REPACK AIRWAVES YIELDING BETTER ACCESS FOR USERS OF MODERN SERVICES ACT OF 2018 Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4986) to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to reauthorize appropriations for the Federal Communications Commission, to provide for certain procedural changes to the rules of the Commission to maximize opportunities for public participation and efficient decisionmaking, and for other purposes, as amended.

Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Oregon? There was no objection. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased today that the House of Representatives is taking up an important bill from the House Energy and Commerce Committee. It is titled the Repack Airwaves Yielding Better Access for Users of Modern Services Act of 2018, or RAY BAUM’S Act. I thank our subcommittee chairman, MARSHA BLACKBURN , for her hard work in introducing and moving this legislation forward. Before I get into the policy side, I want to touch on the meaning behind this bill’s title. 
H.R. 4986 is a nod to our dear friend, and mine of 30 years, the former staff director of our Energy and Commerce Committee, who recently lost his battle with cancer. It is a testament of not just Ray’s dedication to telecom policy—as you know, he served as public utility commissioner, he chaired the Joint Board with the FCC on communications issues, and was such a policy brain for our committee—but also his ability to work across the aisle and with all levels of government officials. He got good things done for America. Years ago, when I became chairman of what was then called the Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet, Ray, at my invitation, finally agreed to come back to Washington and work on the committee. He had served as a State representative and as majority leader of the Oregon House. He had been chairman of the public utility commission in Oregon and brought a lot to our process as senior policy adviser. In the years that followed, these issues remained both a priority and a passion for Ray, and I believe and I hope our bipartisan work today reflects admirably the kind of commitment he wanted all of us to share in making good public policy. By the way, that is Ray right there, for those who didn’t know. The RAY BAUM’S Act reauthorizes the Federal Communications Commission. It includes efficiency and transparency reforms for the FCC, and it spurs the development of next generation 5G technologies. It is good for consumers, and it is good for our Nation’s critical telecommunications services. Importantly, the bill before us today is the product of a bipartisan and bicameral agreement, House and Senate, Republicans and Democrats, including my friend from New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE ), Senate Commerce Committee chairman Mr. THUNE , and the ranking member in the Senate, BILLNELSON . Mr. Speaker, we bring you a good product today of sound policy named for a wonderful individual, and I reserve the balance of my time.

Sincerely, GREGWALDEN , Chairman. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I also rise in support of H.R. 4986, the RAY BAUM’S Act. This bill is the product of extensive bipartisan collaboration. After exhaustive negotiations, we were able to reach a deal that includes bills introduced by Democrats and Republicans in both the House and in the Senate. That does not happen often, and I would like to thank my colleagues for working with me so closely. This bill is a real tribute to its namesake, Ray Baum. Ray had a passion for telecommunications policy and a special place in his heart for broadcasting. Ray was also an eternal optimist. He never faltered in his belief that we could find a way to work together to find a solution, and he was right. We were able to incorporate proposals from Members on both sides of the aisle, just the way Ray would have liked it, and we were able to produce this legislation that will reauthorize the FCC for the first time in 28 years. Mr. Speaker, I would like to briefly mention some aspects of this bill that I am most proud of. First, we were able to include the SANDy Act, which is named to honor those affected by Superstorm Sandy, a storm that ripped through the Northeast, including my district, over 5 years ago. During that 
superstorm, we saw firsthand how important communications were for survival. From television and radio broadcasters to wireless providers and cable networks, each played its own role in making sure people knew how to find help, look for loved ones, and stay out of harm’s way. b1445 I used the lessons we learned from Sandy in writing this legislation. When this bill is signed into law, our networks will be stronger, more resilient, and more capable to serve in an emergency. This FCC reauthorization bill also includes the Viewer Protection Act. I introduced the Viewer Protection Act to make sure no viewer loses signal as a result of the FCC’s incentive auction. Access to local information has become even more important as the number of natural disasters has increased over the past few years. Not only does this bill help ensure consumers’ broadcast stations don’t go dark, as part of this bipartisan, bicameral deal, we have agreed to provide $50 million in funding to help educate consumers about the transition. This funding is critical to make sure that people have access to information about how to get their televisions to work. My colleagues will discuss other important aspects of this deal. But before they do, I would like to point out two important provisions that we included as part of the reauthorization. First, we included a provision that makes the FCC’s inspector general independent of the Commission’s chairman. The IG is currently conducting a number of critical investigations, including one into whether the chairman of the agency has been improperly favoring Sinclair Broadcast Group. But under current law, these investigations are being conducted under a cloud—the very chairman who is under investigation can obstruct the review by firing the inspector general or his or her staff at any time. So by passing this bill, we are ensuring that these important investigations can conclude without any interference. Finally, I do not normally support unnecessarily cutting the budget of our agencies. But in this case, I would like to thank my colleagues for agreeing to limit this cut to the length of this administration. The current leadership of the FCC, in my opinion, has proven that it cannot be trusted to serve the public interest. Most notably, the agency has ignored its statutory duty and the call of the American people by destroying our net neutrality protections. Net neutrality safeguards our American values by empowering small businesses, creating new jobs, and ensuring free speech online. By limiting the resources that we provide for the next 3 years, this reauthorization will limit this Commission’s power, in my opinion, to do more harm. For these reasons and many more, I urge my colleagues to support the bipartisan and bicameral agreement embodied by the RAY BAUM’S Act. I would like to also thank the Democratic committee staff—David Goldman, Gerald Leverich, and Dan Miller—for all of their hard work in getting this bill to the floor today. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. BLACKBURN ), the chair of the subcommittee, who has been an incredible leader on our communications issues on the Energy and Commerce Committee for some time. Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for the recognition, and I thank him for his efforts on this. Mr. Speaker, it really is a pleasure to come here today to talk about the RAY BAUM’S Act. We have, for so long, talked about the need to push this through to completion, and Ray served as our staff director and really helped the committee and our subcommittee push this forward to the point that we could say: Yes, we have the FCC reauthorization done. As Mr. PALLONE said, it has been 28 years since this agency has been reauthorized. It is certainly an honor to say we have done this in Ray’s name, and we have done it in a bipartisan way. There are so many things that are included in this bill, and one of the provisions that is in here is Chairman WALDEN’s FCC reform. Many times you will hear us talk about needing to bring sunlight to these agencies, bringing order, and the ability for constituents and citizens to know what is happening. We have that included in this bill. We also have provisions that our whip, STEVE SCALISE —the Consolidated Reporting Act—has included in this bill. We have provisions from Ms. ESHOO and from Representative E NGEL . These are all bipartisan provisions that you will see included in this legislation. Mr. JOHNSON has a provision that is included that will change the way the inspector general works in this agency so that he truly is an inspector general who is independent. So we have worked together in a bipartisan way to do our repack which deals with our broadcasters and our spectrum to handle MobileNOW, which has been a priority of the Senate. They could not get it finished. We have finished that process, and then also the FCC reauthorization. So I express my gratitude to the committee members, both Democrats and Republicans, and the staff members from both sides of the dais to say thank you for the work that is done to bring this bipartisan effort together to reauthorize this agency to deal with our spectrum repack and to address the MobileNOW concerns. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. MICHAEL F. D OYLE ), who is the ranking member of the Communications and Technology Subcommittee. Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a moment to speak in memorial to the late Ray Baum. He was a dedicated husband and father, the staff director for the majority on the Energy and Commerce Committee, and a trusted adviser and friend to Chairman WALDEN. We were all saddened by his passing, and I would like to express our condolences to his friends and family. The legislation before us today is the product of bipartisan and bicameral compromise. While it is not perfect, it represents a good faith effort by Ranking Member PALLONE , Chairman W ALDEN, Senator N ELSON , and Senator THUNE . This compromise incorporates a number of Democratic priorities, including Ranking Member PALLONE ’s Viewer Protection Act and SANDy Act, and Congresswoman ESHOO ’s RESPONSE Act and ‘‘Dig Once’’ bill, and a number of provisions from other members of our committee on cybersecurity, Tribal broadband, broadband access for veterans, and others. Like Ranking Member PALLONE , I am also happy to see bipartisan language included in the bill which makes the FCC inspector general an independent entity. This sends a strong bipartisan and bicameral message to Chairman Pai that he cannot end the FCC inspector general’s investigation into collusion between his office and Sinclair Broadcast Group simply by firing the current inspector general. These allegations also require congressional oversight and investigation. I am also happy to see that we have an agreement to provide the remainder of the funds necessary to transition broadcasters as part of the FCC’s incentive auction—keeping a promise that we made to them that they would be held harmless. The agreement also includes funds for consumer education about the transition. It is critical that the public be educated about the upcoming television repack and understand the what, when, and where of how it will work. Mr. Speaker, I look forward to continuing to work on this legislation with my colleagues as it moves forward. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LANCE ), who is a talented member of our committee. Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in very strong support of the RAY BAUM’S Act, which reauthorizes the Federal Communications Commission for the first time in 28 years. How appropriate that this critical legislation is named for Ray Baum, who dedicated his tremendous public service to these issues, and whom we all admired. 
I commend the leadership. The Energy and Commerce Committee puts more bipartisan bills on the President’s desk than any other committee here on Capitol Hill. This is important legislation strengthening the FCC, protecting consumers, and, most important of all, expanding the information channels our lives and the economy need. I am pleased that this legislation includes the AntiSpoofing Act, a bill I have worked on with Congresswoman MENGand Chairman Emeritus B ARTON  for several years. Spoofing is an insidious practice used by scammers to call consumers using a faked phone number, often pretending to be a bank or government agency. Millions of Americans continue to be defrauded by con artists and scammers who perpetrate this despicable crime. This disgraceful practice must end, and it will be ended in large part due to this legislation. I am pleased this FCC reauthorization enacts consumer protections like those in the AntiSpoofing Act. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. MATSUI ). Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that today we are reauthorizing the Federal Communications Commission through the RAY BAUM’S Act, which, among other things, ensures our local broadcasters have the resources they need and will deliver additional spectrum into the commercial marketplace. Spectrum is the invisible infrastructure that supports our wireless economy. As the way we do business continues to depend on connectivity and mobility, spectrum will be a part of everything from remote health monitoring to precision agriculture, to public safety communications and connected devices. That is why I am pleased that this package includes several of my priorities, including my Spectrum Auction Deposits Act, which I coauthored with Congressman GUTHRIE . This legislation will enable the FCC to continue to conduct auctions that will unlock the spectrum necessary to deploy next generation broadband networks. Without this fix, auctions to deliver more spectrum into the commercial marketplace may be put on hold indefinitely. This package also includes my legislation to create a Federal spectrum challenge prize, which would accelerate the development and commercialization of innovative technologies to make spectrum use more efficient. It could also facilitate the application of existing technologies, such as blockchain, to develop spectrum sharing mechanisms that will allow providers to access spectrum on a real time basis. This bipartisan legislation will promote the expansion of current and next generation broadband networks across America. It is an important step forward, and I am proud to support its passage. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. KINZINGER ), who is a great member of our committee. Mr. KINZINGER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the RAY BAUM’S Act. It is fitting that this bill be named for him, a shining example of public service and a great friend. My heart goes out to his wife and all his family and loved ones. Mr. Speaker, this legislation reauthorizes the FCC for the first time in 28 years. I am proud of the inclusion of two of my bipartisan bills. First is the Rural Spectrum Accessibility Act, which Mr. LOEBSACK and I introduced. It expands access to coverage in rural communities by allowing licensed, unused spectrum to be suballocated to carriers serving rural populations. The second is the Improving Broadband Access for Veterans Act, which Mr. MCNERNEY and I introduced. It requires the FCC to thoroughly examine veterans’ access to broadband and provide recommendations to increase access, especially for rural and lowincome veterans. Again, this legislation is one more example to show the majority of the work done in Congress is bipartisan and sometimes even bicameral. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and everybody for working together to get this done, and I urge my colleagues to support the RAY BAUM’S Act. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. MCNERNEY ). Mr. MCNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my ranking member and the chairman for yielding. I thank my colleagues on the other side of the aisle for their bipartisan efforts here. I rise in support of H.R. 4986, the RAY BAUM’S Act. In the first place, this bill will help ensure that the incentive auction repack can move forward in a timely fashion and that Americans can have access to their local broadcasting stations during this period of time. On the other hand, I am very proud that this bill includes a bipartisan provision that Congressman KINZINGER  and I worked on. This provision will move us forward in closing the digital divide for our Nation’s veterans. Access to broadband internet service is critical for the more than 20 million veterans across our country, with the highest population of veterans residing in California. Having a broadband internet connection helps veterans apply for jobs more easily, obtain necessary vocational training, communicate with family and friends, keep up with current events, access healthcare services, and get important information about their benefits and military records. Without broadband internet access, it is difficult to fully participate in today’s society. Veterans face many challenges when they return home, and not having internet access makes what is already an incredibly tough transition process even harder. This is particularly likely to be the case for lowincome veterans and veterans living in rural areas. Although we lack specific data on the number of veterans with broadband internet access, we know that Americans who live in rural areas are less likely to be connected. This is also the case for Americans who live at or below the Federal poverty level. We must find ways to ensure that veterans, especially the more than 1.4 million veterans living below the Federal poverty level and the 5.3 million residing in rural areas, are not left behind. This is why my provision directs the Federal Communications Commission to examine the current state of broadband access for veterans and what can be done to increase access, with a focus on lowincome veterans and veterans residing in rural areas. The findings and recommendations from this report will be important for paving the way to get more veterans connected. I urge my colleagues to vote for this bill. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. BILIRAKIS ) to speak on this important legislation. Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, named in memory of a hardworking and honorable man, the RAY BAUM’S Act reauthorizes the Federal Communications Commission for the first time in 28 years. This bill is the result of a wholly bipartisan process that includes important provisions that will benefit all our constituents. b1500 This includes further prohibitions on spoofing calls, reports on promoting internet access for lowincome veterans, and improving 911 caller information. The bill also provides additional funding for the repack process and fosters technology growth by authorizing studies on spectrum available for future auctions. I applaud the work of the subcommittee on getting this done. This bill will truly benefit innovation and our constituents, and I support its passage. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. LOEBSACK ). Mr. LOEBSACK. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chair and ranking member for working to bring this bill to the floor today. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to see the RAY BAUM’S Act moving forward. This bill really is a good example of compromise. No one got everything that they wanted, but we worked together to find common ground. I think it represents what we need to be doing more of in Washington and in this body and what people and I want to see happen more often, namely, that Members 
of Congress come together in a bipartisan manner to reach a commonsense agreement. But today I come to the floor to talk about a piece of legislation, the Rural Wireless Access Act, which I was pleased to help introduce and incorporate into the larger FCC Reauthorization Act. I want to thank, in particular, my friend Mr. COSTELLO for working with me on this bipartisan bill. I also want to thank Mrs. BLACKBURN , chair of the Communications and Technology Subcommittee, for helping to move this forward. This bill, which I introduced last year, would require the FCC to establish standards for collecting wireless coverage data. Everyone at some point has been driving through places in rural America that don’t get wireless coverage. Unfortunately, the maps that the FCC uses to fix coverage gaps are often inadequate. Currently, the standards that define how wireless coverage is determined are not sufficient, meaning the coverage maps can be incomplete or inaccurate. Without accurate coverage maps, resources needed to improve wireless access will not be directed to the areas that need the most help, including rural areas. I am pleased that the Energy and Commerce Committee agreed to include this legislation, the Rural Wireless Access Act, as part of the larger package so that we can improve wireless voice and mobile internet services and ensure the resources go to the areas that need it the most. In order to fix the problem, we have to get the data right. I am hopeful that the passage of the FCC Reauthorization Act will help folks in rural areas get the wireless coverage they need. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. JOHNSON ), who has been a real leader on telecommunications issues. Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I, too, want to add my strongest, deepest sympathies and condolences to Ray Baum’s family on his passing. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4986, the RAY BAUM’S Act, to reauthorize the FCC for the first time in 28 years. This important legislation also provides transparency and efficiency reforms, including language from my bill, H.R. 2636, to create an independent inspector general for the FCC. Currently, the IG is not only appointed by the chairman, but also reports to and is under general supervision of the Chairman of the Commission. This legislation would require the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate, to appoint the inspector general. It is simply good governance and a matter of transparency and accountability to have an independent IG. Importantly, this legislation also creates and authorizes a broadcast repack fund to address the anticipated shortfall in funding available to relocate broadcasters who are displaced from the most recent spectrum auction. It is important that we provide the funding necessary to successfully relocate these broadcasters and ensure an efficient and timely transition. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation to reauthorize the FCC. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. RUIZ). Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman WALDEN , Ranking Member PALLONE , and the committee for their hard work on this bipartisan bill. This legislation includes my bill, H.R. 5007, the Tribal Broadband Deployment Act, which will direct the FCC to improve broadband access on Tribal lands within 30 months. For the communities in my congressional district, California’s 36th District, and throughout our Nation, this will be a game changer. Throughout the Coachella Valley, the San Jacinto Mountain communities, and the Pass regions of California, rural, underdeveloped Tribal lands are spread out among nonTribal communities, both of which are often lacking broadband internet and both of which will benefit. My bill will bring real resources and opportunities to these areas, improving connectivity and helping to close the digital divide in these historically underserved communities. With expanding access to the internet, families, students, workers, and businesses will be able to harness the power of their ideas and information to achieve their dreams and grow our local economies. I want to thank Chairman BLACK BURN for honoring her commitment to work with me on this issue. I urge the House to pass this important bipartisan bill. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. COSTELLO ), a very important member of our committee. Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4986, RAY BAUM’S Act of 2018, named after the late Ray Baum, who dedicated his life to public service. Mr. Speaker, this bill includes important provisions to modernize our telecommunications agencies and to craft policies that will fuel next generation services like gigabit service and 5G networks. We are going to increase access to information and services for millions of Americans with this bill, Mr. Speaker. 5G networks mean doctors can more effectively treat patients that live hours away from the closest hospital, automated vehicles can offer mobility to our Nation’s most vulnerable, small or rural businesses can compete beyond their local markets, and it means that first responders can more quickly reopen critical lines of communications in the aftermath of a natural disaster. By passing this bill, we can fully realize the benefits of an interconnected and increasingly wireless world. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4986. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER ). Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman’s courtesy in permitting me to speak on this. This bill, I think, is an example of the politics and legislation that Ray Baum would be particularly proud of, characterizing his work as a policymaker and a policy adviser. I had a chance to work with Ray in his other hats: chairing the Public Utilities Commission, as a distinguished legislator and majority leader, and, of course, his role here in Congress. I appreciate the product we have before us today. I have enjoyed listening to people reaffirm areas that they are proud of, making a difference for people. I appreciate, in particular, the authorization of new spending to help broadcasters’ expenses relating to spectrum reallocation. This is very important, especially for public broadcasting stations. But I want to raise one item of concern, and I hope the chairman and ranking member would work with us to look at the bill’s study of spectrum for commercial uses dealing with the mid band, or Cband, to consider public broadcasting. I fear that if we are thrust into competitive bidding with public broadcasting, they are likely to not be able to compete effectively. But it will affect millions of people across the country. I applaud the committee’s bipartisanship and work with the Senate, but I hope that future consideration of the impact of Cband reallocation on public broadcasting would be something that the committee could look at to make sure that we are protecting those vital interests. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I would concur with my friend’s comments. I am happy to work on these issues involving spectrum. I know there are multiple uses around, and we want to make sure that those using these frequencies are not disadvantaged. I look forward to working with the gentleman on that. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. SCALISE), a distinguished member of the Energy and Commerce Committee. He also happens to have a pretty important title around here as the whip of the House. He has been very involved in telecommunications policies since he first came on the Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding and for his leadership working together in a very bipartisan way to bring forward RAY BAUM’S Act. Not only is this piece of legislation important to reauthorize the FCC and the important work that they do, but it also is a fitting tribute 
to Ray Baum himself and, in so many ways, to all of the work that our great staffs do to allow this Capitol to work properly and to allow Congress to work for the American people. It doesn’t just take Members of Congress, but an incredibly dedicated and talented staff, and each of us are blessed to have wonderful staffs—I am surely no exception—who allow us to do our jobs so well. The fact that we are using this legislation to pay tribute to Ray Baum and all of the staff of the Capitol, I think, is equally important that we do just this. Mr. Speaker, President Trump challenged Congress to make the Federal Government more accountable to the American people and to eliminate red tape that hurts job creation and economic growth. The RAY BAUM’S Act does just that. First of all, we meet those two goals by doing a number of things. The legislation will reauthorize the Federal Communications Commission for the first time in 28 years. The FCC does important work for our country, especially in the telecommunications arena. I am proud to continue to serve on the Communications and Technology Subcommittee, which is one of the great examples of United States dominance—America is the dominant force in technology—and it is important that we have fair rules of the game. The FCC is that arbiter. The fact that they haven’t been reauthorized for 28 years, I think, it is long past due that we get this done. We also make critical reforms that will modernize the agencies with tools that it needs to meet the demands of consumers for the 21st century. This legislation creates an important backstop for our local radio and TV broadcasters who have been completing the final stage of the incentive auction. This keeps America on track to be the global leader on 5G communications by implementing new spectrum policy. This is something our committee has led on. The country needs more spectrum. We have been able to find creative ways to free up more spectrum so that billions of dollars of private sector investment can be used to build out these great networks in 3G, 4G, and, now, 5G so that we can continue to advance technology. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Louisiana an additional 1 minute. Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I would like to also thank Chairwoman BLACK BURN for including the FCC Consolidated Reporting Act that I worked so closely on with Senator HELLER for years to try to get this legislation passed. This is included as part of this legislation. This will provide relief to so many job creators and to the FCC by consolidating and eliminating so many outdated reporting requirements. What do I mean by eliminating outdated reporting requirements, Mr. Speaker? How often do we hear about things that are on the books, laws that are on the books that are so outdated and so unnecessary? This is one of the reports that we are outdating in this bill. Right now, there is still, on the books, a requirement that the FCC report on the annual competition within the telegraph industry. Mr. Speaker, that is right. Since Samuel Morse invented the telegraph back in the 1830s, that might have been important in the 1800s, even in the early 1900s; but the fact that today, in 2018, there is still a requirement that the FCC issue a report on competition within the telegraph industry is a glaring example of why it is so important for us to update our laws and eliminate outdated laws. We are getting rid of this ridiculous requirement and a number of other unnecessary and ridiculous requirements like that so that we can free the FCC up to do the important work they need to do. b1515 So, again, I commend the chairman for the work that he has done in a very bipartisan way to bring forth the RAY BAUM’S Act, and I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. WALBERG ), who has been a very important member of our committee and active on these issues, and he had a provision in this legislation as well. Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I would first like to start off by remembering Ray Baum, whom this legislation is named after, very appropriately, and I thank the chairman for sharing him with us. As was correctly stated by the whip, we appreciate the staff that does so much work for us. Leaders like Ray Baum are special. He will be missed, but we will carry on in his memory and in the quality of service that he supplied. The RAY BAUM’S Act does something that hasn’t been done in over 28 years: it reauthorized the Federal Communications Commission. It is amazing to think that we have a commission as important as that and it hasn’t been authorized—or reauthorized, or reauthorized. It is time to do it and bring it up to this century, as well, and beyond. This bipartisan bill is good, forward thinking policy that modernizes the FCC to ensure it is more transparent, efficient, and able to tackle the issues of the 21st century. It maintains the credibility of spectrum auctions and the promise the FCC made to Michigan broadcasters. It paves the way for new spectrum auctions that will allow for the United States to maintain its leadership in developing and deploying technologies such as 5G and, ultimately, win the race to 5G. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from Michigan. Mr. WALBERG. Additionally, it requires the FCC to report to Congress on its efforts to promote broadband internet access for veterans, especially lowincome and rural veterans. I would love to have broadband to my home, as well. This bill is critical for consumers and our Nation’s telecommunications infrastructure, and I urge its passage today. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I just want to say, again, that this bill is a bipartisan bill. There has been a lot of work done on both sides of the aisle. I appreciate the fact that we are able to accomplish this and also include a lot of initiatives from Members on both sides of the aisle. And, again, as a tribute to Ray Baum and all that he did for us over the many years, I am proud to say that we enthusiastically support the bill and urge its passage. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend from New Jersey for his good work on this legislation and his kind words in memory of our mutual friend, Ray Baum. I think it would be appropriate, as well, to thank the staff who put so much work into this, including Robin Colwell, Tim Kurth, Sean Farrell, Lauren McCarty, Evan Viau, and Elena Hernandez on the Republican side, and David Goldman, Gerald Leverich, and Dan Miller on the minority side. We thank all of them for working both here and on the Senate side. Mr. Speaker, I just want to quickly go through the provisions again, because this really is important. For more than a quarter of a century, the FCC has not been reauthorized. We do that here, thanks to Chairwoman BLACKBURN ’s legislation. Second, we take care of our broadcasters, both public and private, and their translators, including FM translators as well as public broadcasting. Mr. PALLONE has been a long champion of the repack effort and, of course, his SANDy legislation. You heard from Mr. SCALISE on the legislation to consolidate redundant and outdated FCC reports: get rid of the ones we don’t need, streamline the rest, and bring efficiency. Mr. JOHNSON ’s legislation to establish an independent inspector general at the FCC, this is just good government we can all embrace. Congresswoman MIMIWALTERS ’ legislation gives the chief information officer of the FCC the authority to play a significant role in planning, budgeting, and programming. Congresswoman GRACE MENG’s bill to prohibit spoofing calls or texts originating outside the U.S., plus an 18 month shot clock, is put on the FCC to 
conduct rulemaking in this matter. I think we are all kind of getting tired of those spoofs we get on our phones. It looks like they are coming from our hometowns, and it turns out they are not. We are going to try to get to the bottom of this and have the FCC work to do that. Congressman GUTHRIE and Congresswoman MATSUI ’s bill to include a spectrum auction deposit fix, this will actually allow future actions to go forward legally. They couldn’t do that under existing law because of an interpretation, and so we fixed that. That was very, very important. Congressmen MCNERNEY and KINZINGER ’s legislation to require the FCC to report to Congress on promoting internet excess for veterans, we all know how important that is, especially those lowincome veterans in our rural communities. Congressman LOEBSACK ’s legislation to improve mapping methodology for mobile coverage, we need to know where we have service in America and where we don’t and have numbers we can trust. Representative RUIZ’s legislation is very, very important, dealing with broadband in Tribal areas and carrying out rulemaking to address unserved Tribal areas. We have lots of Tribal areas in our country that lack service. ANNA ESHOO ’s legislation to provide further improvements on 911 caller information that builds on Kari’s Law that we have already approved, that is really, really important. And, again, ELIOT ENGEL ’s legislation requires the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, the NTIA, to study and consider how the agency can best coordinate the interagency process following cybersecurity incidents. It just goes on and on, including Senator THUNE ’s MOBILE NOW Act that will help us move forward on 5G. So, as you can see, this is comprehensive, thoughtful, wellwritten legislation on telecommunications, moves our country forward, reauthorizes the FCC, and is a fitting tribute to my friend and our policy leader, Mr. Ray Baum from Oregon. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4986, the RAY BAUM’S Act, the first FCC reauthorization in 28 years, named for our dear friend, the late Ray Baum. This bill is the product of many long hours of hard work to achieve a bipartisan, bicameral compromise. While no bill is perfect, this legislation contains many solid policy advancements for digital communications in the 21st century. I’m especially glad to see two bills I’ve championed for many years included in this package, ‘Dig Once’ which I first introduced in 2009, and the RESPONSE Act, which I first introduced in 2010. Broadband is essential for every community in our country to function today, just as the physical roads and bridges we travel on are. For nearly a decade, I’ve been pushing for a ‘Dig Once’ policy, a commonsense proposal to ensure broadband conduit is included in the buildout of roads and highways when they’re being built and where there’s a demonstrated need for broadband access, rather than tearing up roads later. Dig Once will enable states to make it easier for broadband providers to enter new and underserved markets by laying the broadband conduit during construction. H.R. 4986 also includes the RESPONSE Act that ensures that multiline telephones commonly found in office buildings and hotels are equipped with location accuracy technologies. This is essential for responders to locate a 911 caller in a large building as quickly as possible because lives are literally on the line and every second counts. This provision will help save lives. I’m disappointed that the FCC Collaboration Act was excluded from the final version of H.R. 4986. This is another bipartisan, commonsense proposal that I have consistently introduced since 2009. It passed out of the Communications and Technology subcommittee, the full Energy and Commerce committee, and previously passed the full House, all with bipartisan support. All of the former Democratic and Republican FCC members have supported this policy one hundred percent. It’s unfortunate that despite such broad support, this provision was stripped from the final bill despite our work in Committee. I also want to express my concerns about some parts of the bill which consolidate the FCC’s reporting on issues like price hikes, competition, and program diversity, and the scaling back of provisions on critical unlicensed spectrum. I worry that we’ll regret weakening these public interest policies. Nonetheless, I support H.R. 4986 as a set of largely positive developments for consumers, policymakers, and many other stakeholders in the communications marketplace. I want to thank Chairman Walden for his hard work on this, and urge my colleagues to vote YES on H.R. 4986, the RAY BAUM’S Act of 2018. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4986, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ‘‘A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to reauthorize appropriations for the Federal Communications Commission, and for other purposes.’’. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
POLITICAL APPOINTEE BURROWING PREVENTION ACT Mr. BLUM. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1132) to amend title 5, United States Code, to provide for a 2year prohibition on employment in a career civil service position for any former political appointee, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 1132 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Political Appointee Burrowing Prevention Act’’. 
Mr. BLUM. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Iowa? There was no objection. Mr. BLUM. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1132, the Political Appointee Burrowing Prevention Act, introduced by the gentleman from Colorado, Representative BUCK. This important bill will protect the integrity of the civil service and ensure the American people are served by a competent, nonpolitical career workforce. Under current law, each administration appoints a political staff to help advance the administration’s political goals. These political employees leave at the end of the administration to make way for the next administration’s appointees. In contrast, the career civil service is designed to carry over from administration to administration. These employees should be hired based on their qualifications and promoted based on their performance. Despite the significant differences between the two types of positions, however, political appointees are currently allowed to convert to career positions. This practice is known as ‘‘burrowing.’’ As the Government Accountability Office explained: ‘‘Circumstances surrounding conversions can raise questions as to whether the individuals selected experienced favoritism or enjoyed an unfair advantage in the selection process.’’ GAO went on to say: ‘‘Any appearance of this could compromise the merit system’s integrity.’’ H.R. 1132, the Political Appointee Burrowing Prevention Act, will enact in law the requirement for OPM to review political conversions. The bill also raises the bar for political conversions, requiring an agency certify the conversion is necessary to meet its mission. To ensure Congress can continue to monitor for abuse, the certification must be provided to Congress before it is approved. Finally, the bill prohibits political conversions within 2 years of leaving a political appointment. This ensures sufficient time has passed between when political appointees finish their appointment and when they may become a career employee. In closing, this bill protects the integrity of the meritbased system so career politicians stay free of politics. The American people deserve nothing less. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the bill before us is H.R. 1132, the Political Appointee Burrowing Prevention Act, as amended. I want to thank my friends on the majority for working with us to improve this bill since its consideration by the committee. Because of the improvements we have been able to make, I support moving this bill forward in the legislative process; however, I continue to believe that some further changes may be needed. The bill would make it very difficult to hire former political appointees into career positions in the Federal Government. It would prohibit hiring a former political appointee into a career position for 2 years after that individual held a political position. It would also add significant hurdles for agencies seeking to hire an applicant to a career position who separated from a political appointment in the last 5 years. The agency would be required to certify to the Office of Personnel Management that the appointment is ‘‘necessary to the agency’s ability to meet its mission.’’ There are several controls already in place to ensure that the process used to hire former political appointees into career positions is fair, open, and based on merit. For example, the Office of Personnel Management must ensure, right now, that the appointment process was free from political influence and report the results of its reviews to Congress. A February 2017 report found that OPM reviewed just 16 requests by agencies to hire former political appointees from October 1, 2016, through January 20, 2017, and did not find any reason to deny any of those requests. We all want the best people in the Federal service, and there should be no undue favoritism in the hiring process. In comments on this bill, OPM suggested that certain provisions may conflict with the merit system principles that have formed the basis of the Federal civil service for over a century. That issue should be clarified before this bill becomes enacted into law. Nonetheless, we support the spirit with which the bill is offered us today, and we have no objections to the legislation in front of us. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BLUM. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. BUCK), the sponsor of the bill and my esteemed colleague. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Iowa for the time today to talk about this important legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to speak on behalf of the Political Appointee Burrowing Prevention Act. This important legislation addresses a problem affecting our Federal workforce. Our Federal civil service hiring process is supposed to be a competitive, meritbased system where the best and brightest individuals are considered based on their qualifications and ability to do their job, not because of their political connections. However, we have seen a concerning trend where excepted service employees, specifically political appointees, are converted into highpaying, lifelong civil service positions, bypassing the normal competitive hiring process. This process, also known as ‘‘burrowing,’’ defeats the purpose of having a nonpartisan, meritbased civil service. In fact, the Government Accountability Office reports that the Obama administration converted 78 political appointments into career positions, while the Bush administration allowed 135 political appointees to burrow into career positions. This trend raises significant concerns that individuals who were not chosen based solely on their merits may, at best, not be the most qualified candidate for the job, or, at worst, may not be willing to properly execute the law under a new administration. b1530 Political appointees are supposed to serve their appointing President’s agenda for a temporary period of time. Part of their duty to the Nation is to know when it is time to step down from their position of power. Congress must act to ensure this principle is upheld and to protect the independence of our meritbased civil service. That is why I, along with my friend and colleague, Representative TEDLIEU, have offered an equitable solution to ensure this problem is stopped in its tracks. Our bill, the Political Appointee Burrowing Prevention Act, places a 2year ban on political appointees being hired for any job in the civil service after they depart a political position. Additionally, the bill ensures that after the 2year ban is completed, the head of the agency seeking to employ the individual must submit a written request to OPM detailing why hiring a former appointee is necessary to the agency’s mission. Furthermore, OPM is instructed to deny the application unless the agency head can prove why it is necessary to hire this individual instead of an applicant from the meritbased hiring pool. This commonsense bill ensures that our Federal workforce is filled with career civil servants who are the most qualified, not the most politically connected. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense legislation that ensures our Federal workforce is being selected by merit, not by political patronage. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I do support the bill in the spirit in which this bill is offered. I think we want to make sure we preserve the integrity of the civil service system that we have worked so hard to build in this country, where we build in integrity and we avoid nepotism and favoritism and political connections over merit. One caveat, though, as I mentioned: once in a while, there may be a political appointee who is the best thing since sliced bread, who brings a level of expertise that we need, and we don’t want to make it harder to look at those credentials on their merits. I know that is not the intention of the bill, but it may be one of the unintended consequences, and that is what we want to just make sure we are not doing as we move forward, but with that, I support the bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BLUM. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. BLUM) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1132, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
SOCIAL MEDIA USE IN CLEARANCE INVESTIGATIONS ACT OF 2017 Mr. BLUM. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3737) to provide for a study on the use of social media in security clearance investigations. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 3737 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Social Media Use in Clearance Investigations Act of 2017’’. 
Mr. BLUM. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Iowa? There was no objection. Mr. BLUM. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3737, the Social Media Use in Clearance Investigations Act of 2017, introduced by the gentleman from Florida, Representative DESANTIS . According to the Pew Research Center, 7 in 10 Americans use social media today. A significant portion of those Americans’ personal and professional interactions occur online. It is just common sense that the government should check the social media of individuals who apply for security clearances, but it doesn’t. H.R. 3737 will move the government toward implementing checks of social media for individuals we trust with our country’s most sensitive information. The bill requires a study of the use of social media in security clearance investigations to inform government wide implementation of social media checks. The study will provide comprehensive information on existing pilot programs, lessons learned, and costs. We must begin the process of strengthening the system now, and that starts with determining best practices for moving forward. H.R. 3737 will help ensure that government checks social media before issuing security clearances. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I think this bill is long overdue and recognizes the internet world in which we live and operate. This bill would require the Director of the Office of Personnel Management to issue a report to Congress on the use of social media checks in background investigations for security clearances. In recent years, a number of agencies have begun pilot programs to help develop the best methods of incorporating social media into those background checks. For example, the Army initiated a pilot program that found that while checking social media is a 
valuable tool, it can be costly and may raise some legal issues. This bill would require that OPM conduct a comprehensive study on those issues and report back to the Congress. This onetime report would describe the current uses of social media postings for investigative purposes and any legal concerns or impediments that may arise. In addition, the report would summarize the results of any pilot programs on the use of social media conducted to date and provide cost estimates for implementing their widespread use in background investigative processes. The report would greatly assist Congress, I believe, in determining whether further legislative action is needed when it comes to the Federal Government’s use of social media in background investigations. This bill was approved without opposition by our committee, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, last year, and I certainly commend it to our colleagues today. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. DESANTIS and Mr. L YNCH for their leadership on what I think is a commonsense measure that will actually improve the process. Mr. Speaker, I urge every Member to support the bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BLUM. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DESANTIS ), the sponsor of this bill. Mr. DESANTIS. Mr. Speaker, in the private sector, if an employer is going to hire somebody, a lot of times they will do a Google search, they will check social media postings to try to learn a little bit more about this prospective employee. It may be hard to believe, but the Federal Government often fails to conduct a simple internet search on individuals before they are trusted with a security clearance. Publicly available social media is one of the best ways to understand an individual’s interests and intentions, but our investigatory process still focuses on interviewing the applicant’s family, friends, and neighbors. For over a decade, various agencies, including the Office of Personnel Management, have conducted studies and pilot programs to assess the effectiveness of social media checks in security clearance investigations. Congress has not been provided those results. What this bill will do is it will require these agencies to identify best practices so that we can use this going forward to make sure that the people who are employed by this government, armed with a security clearance, who have access to sensitive information that puts the security of the country at risk, that these are people whom we want to have there and they are not folks who have ulterior designs. A lot of times it is going to be much more informative to look at their publicly available writings than to talk to somebody who may have lived next door to them in an apartment 10 years ago. I think that this bill is overdue. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Massachusetts (Mr. LYNCH ) for cosponsoring it for me, and I am proud to be here today as the sponsor. I think this should have bipartisan support. I think it will give us some good answers and we can move forward and modernize this process. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, in closing, we think this is a commonsense bill. I agree with the sentiments just expressed by our friend from Florida that, in today’s day and age, we can’t not take cognizance of social media, and it can be a useful tool in evaluating someone’s security clearance application. We also understand it could be a tool that is used to invade people’s privacy, and we want to avoid that. That is why what this bill does is call for a report looking at all of the legal ramifications and the practicality of utilizing this tool to get to a better outcome in the process of security clearances. Mr. Speaker, I support the bill and commend it to our colleagues. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BLUM. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. BLUM) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3737. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION EXTENSION ACT OF 2017 Mr. BLUM. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4043) to amend the Inspector General Act of 1978 to reauthorize the whistleblower protection program, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4043 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Whistleblower Protection Extension Act of 2017’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. BLUM) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Iowa. 
Mr. BLUM. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Iowa? There was no objection. Mr. BLUM. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4043, the Whistleblower Protection Extension Act, a bill I introduced with Ranking Member ELIJAH CUMMINGS . The Whistleblower Protection Extension Act reauthorizes the whistleblower ombudsman program. Whistleblowers are the front line of defense against waste, fraud, and abuse in the Federal Government, but too many Federal employees are unaware of the laws that protect them and the options available for dealing with retaliation and other actions intended to silence them. To address this problem, Congress created the ombudsman program in 2012. The program directs agency inspectors general to designate an ombudsman for whistleblower protections at the agency. They provide information to employees on whistleblower protections and remedies in the event of retaliation. This program was originally a component of the 2012 Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act and was set to expire after 5 years. Over the past 5 years, the ombudsman program has received high marks from the inspector general community. This benefits the country as a whole and makes the Federal Government more efficient. For that reason, it is imperative that we pass H.R. 4043 and make the ombudsman program permanent. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the need for this bill comes into recent focus just today with reports, maybe unconfirmed, that one of the Trump Cabinet members is engaged in a witch hunt against a whistleblower. We need this kind of protection. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4043, the Whistleblower Protection Extension Act. Representative BLUM and Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Ranking Member ELIJAH CUMMINGS introduced this bill to extend the pilot program that requires every inspector general’s office to have a liaison dedicated to assisting whistleblowers. Under this legislation, the whistleblower protection coordinator would help educate agency employees about whistleblower protection laws. This bill would help employees who want to blow the whistle know their rights, and it would put agency management on notice that it is against the law to retaliate against whistleblowers. This bill would require whistleblower protection coordinators to provide whistleblowers who have suffered retaliation information about options available to them to have their allegations evaluated. b1545 No matter how strong we make our whistleblower protection laws, they will not help if whistleblowers do not know how to exercise their rights under those laws. I urge my colleagues to pass this bipartisan measure to strengthen whistleblower protections. I urge passage of this commonsense bill, this good government bill coming out of our committee. I thank my friend from Iowa for collaborating with the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. CUMMINGS ) on this commonsense piece of legislation, and I urge its adoption. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BLUM. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. BLUM) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4043, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
ELIMINATING GOVERNMENT FUNDED OILPAINTING ACT Mr. BLUM. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 188) to prohibit the use of Federal funds for the costs of painting portraits of officers and employees of the Federal Government, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 188 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Eliminating Governmentfunded Oilpainting Act’’ or the ‘‘EGO Act’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. BLUM) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Iowa. 
Mr. BLUM. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on the bill under consideration, including an exchange of letters on the House companion bill, H.R. 1701, between the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and the Committee on House Administration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Iowa? There was no objection. Mr. BLUM. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 188, the Eliminating Government Funded OilPainting Act, a bill introduced by Senator BILLCASSIDY . In years past, the Federal Government spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on portraits of government officials. Taxpayer funds should be invested in programs that benefit taxpayers and our country, not oil paintings of Cabinet members to boost their egos. That is why today we consider S. 188, the Eliminating GovernmentFunded OilPainting Act, otherwise known as the ‘‘EGO Act.’’ The EGO Act makes clear, once and for all, that government agencies cannot spend taxpayer dollars on oil paintings. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense, bipartisan legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT AND GOVERNMENT REFORM , Washington, DC, December 6, 2017. Hon. GREGG HARPER , Chairman, Committee on House Administration, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN : On September 13, 2017, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform ordered reported H.R. 1701, 
the ‘‘Eliminating Governmentfunded Oil painting Act’’ with an amendment, by voice vote. The bill was referred primarily to the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, with an additional referral to the Committee on House Administration. I ask that you allow the Committee on House Administration to be discharged from further consideration of the bill so that it may be scheduled by the Majority Leader. This discharge in no way affects your jurisdiction over the subject matter of the bill, and it will not serve as precedent for future referrals. In addition, should a conference on the bill be necessary, I would support your request to have the Committee on House Administration represented on the conference committee. Finally, I would be pleased to include this letter and any response in the bill report filed by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, as well as in the Congressional Record during floor consideration, to memorialize our understanding. Thank you for your consideration of my request. Sincerely, TREYGOWDY . 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON HOUSE ADMINISTRATION , Washington, DC, December 6, 2017. Hon. TREYGOWDY , Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Washington, DC. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN : Thank you for your letter regarding H.R. 1701. As you know, the bill was received in the House of Representatives on March 23, 2017, and referred primarily to the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and in addition to the Committee on the Committee on House Administration. The bill seeks to restrict funds appropriated or otherwise made available to the Federal Government from being used to pay for the painting of a portrait of an officer or employee of the Federal Government, including the President, the Vice President, a Member of Congress, the head of an executive agency, or the head of an office of the legislative branch. On September 13, 2017, your Committee ordered H.R. 1701 to be reported with an amendment by voice vote. I realize that discharging the Committee on House Administration from further consideration of H.R. 1701 will serve in the best interest of the House of Representatives and agree to do so. It is the understanding of the Committee on House Administration that forgoing action on H.R. 1701 will not prejudice the Committee with respect to appointment of conferees or any future jurisdictional claim. I request that your letter and this response be included in the bill report filed by your Committee, as well as in the Congressional Record. Sincerely, GREGG HARPER , Chairman. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. This is a sad day in the swamp, to eliminate oil paintings of men and women who consider themselves very important, to make sure that taxpayer funds are never used for such a thing; sad day for the swamp in Washington. One can come to the Capitol and look at oil paintings that bestride every corridor and wall, in hearing rooms here in the Capitol, and not know most of these people. We haven’t got a clue who most of them are. We recognize John Adams, but when we go to committee hearing rooms, one or two chairmen past, we often don’t know who they are. I guess it was an attempt to achieve immortality, but it really is an act of ego that is a little embarrassing, even for Washington, D.C. This is an important bill, a commonsense bill, that brings us all back to Earth; that none of us is expendable and that, frankly, we make our contribution and we move on. This bill strikes at the uncontrolled egos and, I hope, sends a message to those narcissists among us that they can stay that way if they wish, but the taxpayer is not going to pay for their oil painting. I thank my friend from Iowa for bringing up the bill. I support the bill, and urge its passage. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BLUM. Mr. Speaker, I would like to make the gentleman from Virginia aware that I have no further speakers and I am prepared to close. I enjoy my colleague from Virginia’s rather dry sense of wit and humor. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Iowa, with whom I share a dry sense of humor. I will remind him, being Irish, that leprechauns are always on the shoulder, especially this time of year. Mr. Speaker, I like this bill. I think most taxpayers are going to like this bill. I think it is high time we acted on this kind of improvement and injected a sense of humility and humanity into our enterprise here in the United States Capitol. I urge passage of this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BLUM. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 188, the Eliminating Governmentfunded Oilpainting Act, an acronym for the EGO Act. S. 188 is the Senate companion to H.R. 1401, legislation that I introduced along with Representatives JIM BRIDENSTINE , C HERI BUSTOS , W ALTER JONES , L EONARD LANCE , DAVID MCKINLEY , PETEOLSON , and T OMRICE. My friend and former House colleague, Senator BILLCASSIDY , is the lead sponsor of S. 188 which passed the Senate unanimously on September 18, 2017. The EGO Act would prohibit Federal funds from being used to pay for the costs of painting portraits of officers and employees of the Federal Government. Federal agencies have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on portraits that are displayed within agency buildings, often in secure locations that are not open to the public. Although this money is only a fraction of a percentage of the federal budget, it represents a failure to exercise fiscal restraint. Every dollar the government spends on vanity projects for federal officials is a dollar that is not spent improving the lives of everyday Americans. Congress has the responsibility to ensure that taxpayer dollars are being used efficiently and effectively. For these reasons, I am proud to sponsor the EGO Act, and urge the House to pass S. 188, sending it to the President’s desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. BLUM) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 188, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ‘‘An Act to amend title 31, United States Code, to prohibit the use of Federal funds for the costs of painting portraits of officers and employees of the Federal Government, and for other purposes.’’. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained. Had I been present, I would have voted ‘‘nay’’ on rollcall No. 94 and ‘‘yea’’ on rollcall No. 95. 
RESIGNATION AS MEMBER OF COMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT AND GOVERNMENT REFORM The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following resignation as a member of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform: 
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES , HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , Washington, DC, March 6, 2018. Hon. PAULD. R YAN, Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR SPEAKER RYAN: I, Val Butler Demings, am submitting my resignation from the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform in compliance with the Rules of the Democratic Caucus. It has been a privilege and honor to have served on this Committee. If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me. Sincerely, VALBUTLER DEMINGS , Member of Congress. 
The resolution was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
b1630 HONORING MARVIN KAHN, FLORIDA CITRUS GROWER (Mr. THOMAS J. ROONEY of Florida asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. THOMAS J. ROONEY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, when you drive through Florida’s heartland in Highlands County, you will probably see signs that say ‘‘Kahn Groves,’’ and then you will drive through miles of citrus groves. Marvin Kahn has been a passionate advocate for citrus over the last five decades, leading his management company from managing 400 acres to over 5,500 acres at its peak. Mr. Kahn is one of the State’s most innovative growers, caretakers, and marketers. He served on the Florida Citrus Commission for 8 years and worked on the longrange planning committee for several years after that. His devotion to Florida citrus and agriculture was real, and he did everything he could to share his passion with others, especially with young people. Each year, the Florida Citrus Hall of Fame honors the most distinguished leaders who have made significant contributions to the Florida citrus industry, and there is no one more deserving of a spot on that hall of fame than Mr. Marvin Kahn. When it comes to serving Florida’s agriculture industry, his passion for Florida’s citrus is unparalleled. Florida is a better place because of Mr. Kahn, and it has been an honor to serve him in the House of Representatives. 
COLORECTAL CANCER AWARENESS MONTH (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of death for men and women combined. It is a silent killer because the disease often has no signs or symptoms. Each year, more than 50,000 Americans die from colorectal cancer even though it is mostly preventable and treatable if caught early. Six years ago today, my father, the late Congressman Donald Payne, died from colorectal cancer. Colorectal cancer screening just wasn’t something people of his generation did. Mr. Speaker, my father might have lived had he gotten tested for colorectal cancer. That is why each year I sponsor a resolution to recognize March as National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month, a time to educate the public about the disease and the need for screening. By educating people, increasing research funding, and making Medicare coverage better for seniors, we can save tens of thousands of lives each year. I would rather not have to make this 1minute speech every year, to have my father still be a Member of Congress from the 10th Congressional District. f 
MILITARY SAVE ACT (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of the Military SAVE Act. Last year, the Department of Defense reported there were an estimated 20,300 military members who indicated they had experienced a sexual assault the year prior. Many of these military sexual trauma survivors expressed concerns that services available within the VA healthcare system did not meet their posttrauma needs. This bill will now require the Department of Veterans Affairs to establish a 3year pilot program to allow these survivors treatment related to their injuries from the provider of their choice. Then the VA will compare the care received from outside providers with the VA so that they can find ways to provide better care for MST survivors. Mr. Speaker, anyone who is sexually assaulted should be able to receive the care that they need, and that stands true for the men and women protecting our Nation. Members of the military should be confident in the quality of care they receive from the VA, and this new bill, when it becomes law, would help the VA to improve the services that they offer. 
INFRASTRUCTURE The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from California (Mr. GARAMENDI ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I see my colleagues from the great South 
are here, and they should be listening very carefully as we discuss infrastructure. I might like to draw the attention of the House to this, if I might, a fellow that we know etched in marble at the FDR Memorial: ‘‘The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much’’—keep in mind the tax bill that passed here and was signed by the President in January. ‘‘The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little.’’ These are words to legislate by, wouldn’t you say? So I ask my colleagues to please keep this in mind and not leave right in the middle of a good discussion. If we are to pay attention to what is important here, keep in mind those who have little. It turns out that the great tax cut was probably best described by the President. Shortly after he signed the bill, he went down to his MaraLago club and told his friends who had gathered there, all of whom were the great beneficiaries of that tax cut: I have made you so much more wealthy. Indeed, that is exactly what the tax cut did. It made the wealthy in America even more wealthy to the tune of several hundred billion dollars. The American corporations saw their tax rate fall from 35 to 20 percent, and the top income earners in America saw their tax rate go down by 2
1⁄2percent. It was marvelous if you have a great deal of money, because 80 percentplus of the $1.5 trillion—perhaps more—of the benefits went to the top 10 percent: American corporations and the superwealthy. Is there such a thing as trickledown economics? Is there really a probability that the superwealthy are going to buy more cars and build new homes—palatial palaces—in America with all of the new money that they received? The answer is probably not in America but probably on some island somewhere where they can use the new tax breaks for foreign investment that are in this tax bill. Oh, they were going to close the loopholes for corporations and individuals who wanted to go offshore. No, it didn’t happen. Instead, new offshore tax advantages are created for American corporations. Were inversions eliminated? No. Corporate inversions are not eliminated. They are, in fact, continued and increased. How did this come to pass? It probably came to pass because there was not one substantive hearing in the Ways and Means Committee and in the Senate Finance Committee on the most important tax bill that has passed out of Congress in the last 25 years. So now we live with this. Now we live with the situation where the Treasury Department announced a couple of weeks ago that the tax revenues for the 2018 fiscal year—that is now—are down by a couple of hundred billion dollars. So what is going to happen? When the tax bill was moving along, all of the deficit hawks—and there used to be, I don’t know, a couple hundred of them over here on my Republican colleagues’ side—left town in December. There was not one word about the new $1.5 trillion addition to the deficit. But like most migratory birds, they are going to come back when the weather warms up in Washington, and they are going to go after the deficit with a vengeance. I will bet they are not going to propose that we go back and clean up the tax mess that was created. My guess is what they are going to do is go after programs. I think we know what programs they are, because the Speaker of this esteemed House has very clearly laid out in previous budgets that he wrote when he was head of the Budget Committee that he is going to go after Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid—the programs of the social safety net. I had a phone call just a few moments ago from a constituent in my district, saying: You have got to understand that more and more of your constituents are getting elderly. They are getting Alzheimer’s, and they need care. Their husband or their wife needs respite care. What about the programs for that? 
I had the answer. It doesn’t look good, because we know what the Speaker said he wanted when he was chairman of the Budget Committee, and unless he is having an epiphany, he is likely to want it again. In fact, I believe he already said they are looking at cutting Medicare and Medicaid. So what does that mean for the working men and women who are taking care of their parents? It means there are tough times ahead. It means that the proposed discussion about the reduction in Medicaid is $1,400,000,000,000 over the next decade. It means that $500 billion will be cut from Medicare. So, if you are a senior, you should worry. If you are among the working men and women of America whose father or mother is now a senior, you should worry. The most expensive illness now and in the future is Alzheimer’s. So what of Alzheimer’s research? It is going to get reduced. Oh, and that corporate tax cut for Pfizer? Do you remember how happy they were to have the extra $12 billion? Are they going to spend it on Alzheimer’s research? No, they are not. They stopped their Alzheimer’s research. Instead, guess what they are going to do with the money that they were investing in Alzheimer’s research. They are going to use it, together with their tax cut money, to buy back their stock which has the marvelous result of increasing the value of their stock because there are fewer shares out there. It is brilliant for the managers and for the corporate officers because their pay is based on the stock price. What a marvelous way to use the tax cut: end research on the most expensive illness in America, Alzheimer’s and dementia, and instead use that money to buy back stock so that you can increase your pay as the corporate president. Now, there is a good, American, capitalistic idea. That is where we are. So today we had a hearing on infrastructure in the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, a great opportunity to understand the President’s infrastructure plan. Wow. It is big and it is beautiful, he says, and it is going to provide a gazillion jobs. We took a look at it, and we said: Where is the beef? Where is the money? $200 billion over a 10year period, $20 billion a year, said to be new money. And then you look at the President’s budget proposal and you tee it up with the infrastructure proposal, and you say: Wait a minute. What kind of shell game are you playing here? Your budget removes over $200 billion from infrastructure, and you come over here on your infrastructure plan and you say you have $200 billion of new money. No, you don’t. You really don’t have $200 billion of new money. You have $200 billion of repurposed money in programs that actually devolve the Nation’s infrastructure back to the States and the counties so that we will have a disconnect between an interstate in one State and an interstate in another State that connect at the State lines, and one is repaired and the other is not. b1645 So infrastructure and transportation is a national network. But in this case, what happens is that the States are said to be given the responsibility and the Federal Government will simply pick and choose among those programs that the administration happens to like. I represent a rural area. Sure, it is nice to have an extra $50 billion for rural infrastructure. That would be great. But what is the definition of rural? It is 55,000 people. How much territory? Is it an entire State? Well, there is no State that is rural, then. In a county? In a multitude of counties? In a metropolitan statistical area? We don’t know. But I will tell you that I do have a rural area. I have got two cities, Yuba City and Marysville together, with 100,000 people. Rural is 10 miles down the road. So where is the line around this rural area? I am concerned, particularly because the Federal Government will maintain control of that money. It doesn’t go out by formula, at least as we now look at the language. So it is a grand, a glorious, a wonderful, spectacular infrastructure plan. Incidentally, there is a small problem for 
cities and counties. Presently, if the Federal Government is involved in a levee project to prevent floods, an interstate highway or one of the federally designated highways, or an airport, they will usually come up with somewhere between 70 and 80 percent of the money. That is all well. Well, let’s see. It is 70 to 80 percent Federal and another 20 to 30 percent local money. In the President’s proposal, that flips. The State and the local government come up with 70 to 80 percent and the Federal Government comes up with 20 to 30 percent. The role of the Federal Government is diminished. It becomes the minor partner, and the State or local community becomes the major partner. I had a meeting today with Hamilton City, a community of about 1,600 people right on the Sacramento River with a levee that is maybe good for a 10year high water, but not for any extended amount of flood beyond what normally occurs. They have been trying for 30 years to raise the money locally to match the 80 percent by the Federal Government. They did it. Are they going to be able, going into the future, to complete that flood project if this program goes into effect and they have got to come up with 80 percent of the money? It won’t happen. I would dare say, all across this Nation, with the possible exception of Houston, Texas, no community is going to be able to come up with 70 to 80 percent of the money for a flood control project. This is a role that has traditionally been the Army Corps of Engineers and the Federal Government. But, no. In their infrastructure proposal, this administration flips it over so that now the great burden lies with the local government. ‘‘Oh, that is fine,’’ you say. Well, I think not. All across this Nation, small communities, rural communities, and even urban communities do not have the resources. So here we are. Here we are in a situation where we had a massive tax cut that benefits the superwealthy and American corporations. The American corporations clearly indicate—not from me; go look at the Wall Street folks that have done the analysis— clearly indicate that that tax reduction, which is now in the pockets of the corporations, is not being used for higher wages, is not being used for the plant and equipment and new jobs above the 16 percent. The rest of the money is used for acquisitions and buying back stock. So much for trickle down. Of course, how much can the superwealthy possibly spend? How much can you possibly spend on your McMansion? How much can you possibly spend on a fleet of Mercedes? The bottom line of it is, when it comes to infrastructure, there is no money. It is gone. It disappeared with the tax cut. Think about what could have been done if that tax bill had actually had hearings in which the Democrats could have put forth proposals that we have introduced in bills—proposals to repatriate the offshore earnings of corporations with a lower tax and then use that money for infrastructure. We would have real dollars for an infrastructure program to the tune of maybe $50 billion to $100 billion over a period of time. But, no. No hearings, no amendments from Democrats. No, not at all. We could have used that tax bill to create infrastructure banks so that there would be a financing mechanism for those small communities around the Nation that needed to build a road, needed to build a levee, needed to build broadband infrastructure for their community. But no, that didn’t happen either. Not one hearing. Not one Democratic amendment to that tax bill. Therefore, we go into the great infrastructure program where we really need to do some things. What do we need to do? Some of you may have noticed just 12, 13 months ago the manmade creation of the biggest waterfall in the world, Oroville Dam, and the breakdown of the spillway. And 200,000 of my constituents had to evacuate within hours because that spillway, the emergency spillway next to it, was being overtopped by the river and eroded at the base and a 30foot wall of water almost descended upon those 200,000 people. The number of deaths would be unknown, but it would have been in the thousands because they couldn’t get out of town fast enough. Thankfully, the rain stopped and the reservoir receded. Had it not, had it continued and the water continued to spill over the emergency spillway here, it would have been an unmitigated disaster. Why did this fail? This failed for lack of repair, for lack of maintenance. It is just one example of the thousands of dams in America that could fail. We saw this potential failure in Puerto Rico with one of the major reservoirs there. Fortunately, a third hurricane didn’t occur. Or maybe you are interested in bridges. This isn’t a picture of a bridge to nowhere. This happens to be one of the main bridges on Interstate 5, an interstate highway system that goes from Vancouver to Tijuana, Mexico. It goes down through Oregon, Washington, and California. It is the major trade route on the West Coast. This is about 7 years ago. The bridge fell down. I could put a picture up here showing another bridge that failed on the Mississippi River, in the Twin Cities area. We could put thousands of pictures up here of bridges that could fail and have failed. This is an infrastructure structure issue. Where is the money to rebuild this? Well, it is in the hands of the corporations who are spending it to buy back their stock and to increase the stock price so that the corporate officers can have a higher paycheck. Oh, did I forget to mention how generous they were in bonuses? We are talking about onetime bonuses here. We are not talking about increasing the paycheck over time. We are talking about onetime bonuses. I do like my San Franciscobased Wells Fargo, that so generously said: ‘‘We are going to increase the pay for the minimum wage workers.’’ Good for you. You are obeying the State laws that require minimum wage increases. Good for you, obeying the law. Take credit, if you will, but it is not out of the generosity. Where is the money for all this? It is gone. What if we had a chance in that tax bill to talk about a program the Democrats have been putting forth for the last year? It is A Better Deal for America, a tax policy that actually provides benefits to the working men and women of America and the families that are on the edge of poverty. It actually provides an infrastructure program that has real money—money that can be used to build the foundation for economic growth, money that can be used for employing people in highpaying construction jobs. By the way, it is not at all clear—in fact, there are those of us who think this may actually be in the present infrastructure plan—all of the talk about Buy American, Build America. It appears that language in that infrastructure plan would do away with the Buy American provisions in highway infrastructure. We can’t let that happen. A Better Deal for America would be tax policy. It would be a program that would provide the education and training for the men and women who we need in our manufacturing sector. Every 6 months, I do a manufacturing advisory organization meeting of manufacturers. Every time over the last 8 years we have met, they have come back with the very same concern. And that concern is: We need highly skilled workers. How do you get highly skilled workers? You train them. You provide the job training for those who have lost their jobs, for those who want to improve themselves. Whatever happened in our high schools to technical training, vocational training? It is critically important. The programs that are out there need this support. The programs where American unions have apprenticeship training are a critical way of building our economy. They are highly skilled men and women that earn a good, solid living as welders, plumbers, and technicians of all kinds. That is what we want. It takes money to do those things. So what are we going to do? I don’t know how we are going to come back from this tax cut. It is not 
going to be done anytime soon. But I know this: we are going to be really, really short of money. It has been estimated that in this current budget year, the deficit will reach $1 trillion. I know that we are just weeks away from the return of the deficit hawks on this floor who are going to say: ‘‘Oh, my goodness, the money is gone. We are going to have to make cuts. We can’t have these kinds of deficits.’’ I can hear them already. I hear the voices of the past and I hear the voices of the future. I know they are going to come back. They are going to go after programs that are absolutely essential. We have got work to do. We have got things we need to do in America. The American Society of Civil Engineers points out where we need work. Aviation. We got a D for how good our aviation system is. Bridges, C; dams, D; drinking water, D. Is anybody here from Michigan? Is anybody here from the Central Valley of California? Shall we talk about water supplies? I remember when I was in college, you would never go outside the United States and drink the water from the tap. Now you don’t go to the United States and drink water from a tap, because there is a high probability that it is contaminated. We have seen this story. We have seen this story in Flint, Michigan. We have seen this up and down the Central Valley of California. So what are we spending our money on? Not on drinking water, not on energy systems, hazardous waste, or inland waterways. Oh, this is a good one. If you are on the Mississippi and the Ohio River and you have got your tugboat and a fleet of barges, you depend upon the Federal Government lock system so that you can travel up and down the river. b1700 If you are out there in the maritime and you are an international shipper and you want to go into one of the harbors on the East Coast, where is the money for dredging? Well, it disappeared with the tax cuts. It is not there. So is your ship going to run aground? No, you won’t let that happen. What you do is you will go to some other port. Cuba. We love to talk about Cuba, so let’s talk about Cuba. At Mariel, they are building an international port for the purpose of taking the new ships that are able to go through the Panama Canal, bring them to Cuba, offload them, and put them on a smaller ship so they can get into American harbors. Now, there is an American success story. We don’t have the money to dredge our harbors, but we have the money for a new Mercedes for the superwealthy. Parks and recreation. Ports. Rail systems. Rails are doing pretty good, but not Amtrak. The President’s budget proposes to cut Amtrak—to basically defund Amtrak. If you want to go on the East corridor here, if you want to go from Washington to Boston, if you want to take a plane, well, we know we have an aviation problem. If you want to take the train, I guess you are going to hop a freight train, because Amtrak isn’t going to be around to run. That is the President’s budget proposal. Schools, Dplus. Solid waste. Transit. Wastewater. The American Society of Civil Engineers rate America in the D range. We should be so proud of the most advanced Nation in the world. No, I think not. I certainly wouldn’t take pride in our infrastructure. But it takes money. Where did the money go? Well, it just happens I like charts. The Trump infrastructure scam cuts more than $168 billion from existing transportation and infrastructure programs. I haven’t talked about this one. Do you remember I told you about the flip—80 percent Federal, 20 percent local flipped to 20 percent Federal, 80 percent local, unless you happen to be a private investor. Do you want to buy Dulles International Airport or maybe Reagan National—excuse me, I promise not to do that. Whatever the name of that airport here is. Okay, I will say Reagan. The Reagan National Airport. Do you want to buy it? It is up for sale, according to the Trump administration. And, by the way, the Federal Government will come up with 80 percent of the money. Not a bad deal. Slashes Federal investments and passes the buck back to the local governments. We just talked about that. We haven’t talked about the environmental programs, the environmental protection programs that are significantly harmed, reduced, gutted in the proposal. The Senate is going to speed up projects. Hello? Does anybody around here know that over the last two transportation programs this Congress, with Democrat and Republican support, significantly reduced the time for an infrastructure program to be done? It is not 14 years. The laws that have been in place now for the last almost decade significantly reduced the processing time for infrastructure projects in which the Federal Government is involved in, without harming the vital environmental protections that are out there: clean water, clean air, all of those things. Anyway, they are gone. We have a task before us. I see my Republican colleagues anxious to get up and engage me in a debate. If they want to, I could yield to them, and we could debate the wisdom of what has happened here, but that is not happening. What is happening is there is an alternative, an alternative that we put forth from our side that, unfortunately, was not considered in the tax legislation. We are going to be working on the infrastructure bill. I dare say that the President’s infrastructure program is going nowhere in Congress. At least it shouldn’t. We are going to have to find the money as best we can. And I have an idea. Over the next 15 years, we are going to spend $1 trillion rebuilding our entire nuclear armaments. All of the delivery system, all of the bombs, all of the satellites, all rebuilt. So will Russia and so will China, and we are in the midst of a nuclear arms race—well into the second quarter of a new nuclear arms race, exceedingly expensive and exceedingly dangerous, because the delivery systems are stealthy, designed not to be observed. That is a problem because that increases the risk. Maybe we can use some of that money to build the infrastructure to educate our kids, to provide for seniors who have Alzheimer’s, to care for the caregivers that are taking care of their parents, to build an infrastructure program that really gives America a solid foundation for economic growth, one in which the research facilities are the most modern and in which the most advantageous research is conducted. Maybe we could find, amongst our choices here, money to build a highway system that is worthy of this Nation, one in which there are not potholes every 100 yards, one in which bridges don’t collapse; that we can build water systems in which you can take tap water from every fountain in this Nation and drink it, without a concern about contamination of lead or something else. We could do that. We could make some choices. We can go back and revisit the tax scam in which there are specific inducements for offshoring American jobs. Maybe we can do that. Maybe we can look at some of the military spending and say: Why does it cost $1 billion to launch a satellite with one system and $90 million with another system to do the same thing? There are things we can do. And, most of all, it is time for a better deal for America: a better deal for the working men and women, a better deal for the elderly, and a better deal for the children. That is what we need to do. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
TAX REFORM The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. MITCHELL ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. 
Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the topic of my Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Michigan? 
I made a notation that I want to share with everyone tonight as we move forward. With the changing of the standard deduction, with the nearly doubling of the standard deduction, about 90 percent of taxpayers will be able to file their taxes on a form about this size. They will be able to file their taxes like this, rather than the pile of paperwork they have dealt with for years. Here it is on a larger scale. Most are going to be able to simply file their wage and compensation income and use the standard deduction. They will be done except for a few other tax credits we will talk about, the tax credit they can get, for example, on investment tax credit or family child credit. We will talk about that. But most Americans can file like this. That is one of the things we wanted to achieve, one of the great achievements of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Mr. Speaker, next I yield to Congressman FREDUPTON , who represents Michigan’s Sixth Congressional District, the former chairman of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, another colleague of mine from Michigan, the senior member of our delegation, experientially only, not age, with decades of experience in Congress focusing on job creation and economic opportunity for our State and for our Nation. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman and my good friend for yielding and for hosting this hour tonight. I look forward to the comments by all my colleagues from Michigan and Illinois. Let me just start out by saying a couple of things. I had a great ninth grade teacher, Mr. Denekas. We learned about how the government worked. You pass a bill in the House and you pass a bill in the Senate. I learned later on that the House bill is always better than the Senate. But in this case, JOHN SHIMKUS and I—and he is going to be a speaker from Illinois a little bit later on this evening—were two conferees on this bill. I have got to say that, as we debated this bill, there were some elements that were not so good. But at the end of the day, as this bill meshed together, we took the best elements of both the House and the Senate bill and we got a bill that the President was able to sign. I can remember being trashed left and right back in November and December about what this bill was going to do or not going to do: it wasn’t going to provide real tax relief to the working class; companies weren’t really going to give bonuses; this was all just going to be bogus arguments. Now, at the end of the day, 2plus months since the bill was signed and became enacted, my constituents are finding out good things about the bill. Yes, they are getting real takehome pay increases from the jobs that they do. Yes, they are getting bonuses. I was at a small, little almost farmers market, multigenerational market down in Niles, Michigan, just north of Notre Dame, Shelton’s Farm Market. They have 83 employees. The owners gave every employee there a bonus. I talked to one of them who literally stocks the shelves. He got $600. He said: You know, Mr. UPTON ...  I said: Call me FRED. He said: This wasn’t just crumbs. This made a real difference. I said: What are you going to do with that $600? He said: You know, my wife has cancer, and I bought her a new dress. He was so excited that that increase in the takehome pay was actually going to do some real benefit for him and his family. I was at a groundbreaking at Pfizer, my largest employer, in Portage, Michigan. Not only did they announce that they are going to, in the next couple of years, invest $6 billion—that is B as in ‘‘big’’—in new facilities here in North America, they also announced that they are going to give $100 million in bonuses for all of their nonexecutive employees. That is real money, and that is thanks to tax reform. Mr. WALBERG talked a little bit about some of the utilities in Michigan. A little bit earlier today, I was with the chair of Consumers Energy, a very important player; and the chair of DTE Energy as well. Yes, because of the reduction in the corporate tax rates, they are going to pass on those savings, as they want to, to the consumers. In the case of Consumers Energy, they are going to give back $200 million in rate relief to virtually every one of their customers that they serve across the board. That is good news. It has to be approved by the Public Service Commission, but, in fact, that money is going to be there. So whether it is a small business who is now going to get a lower rate in that passthrough rate, which means a lot, keeping your deductions on healthcare, seeing the highest corporate rate being reduced to 21 percent—and I remember well that debate that we had between Mitt Romney and Barack Obama back in 2012. In September of 2012, the question was on tax reform, and even Barack Obama said that he would support lowering that corporate tax rate to 25 percent, because we were already at the highest corporate tax rate in the world. That is what this bill did, and thank goodness. The last point I would make is I was tired of economic growth being at .7 percent or 1 percent. We can do better than that. This bill is now starting to lead the way to see that happen. In fact, the report even this week, I think, is predicting a 3.5 percent growth rate for calendar year 2018. That is a far cry from where we were just a few years ago. I dare say, in large part, it is due because workers are, in fact, getting more money from their paychecks. We have reduced the corporate rates so companies, instead of having an incentive to go overseas, as they did with my largest employer in one of my counties a few years ago, they now have a reason to come home and invest that money here. So, Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman for hosting this hour. I look forward to the other folks’ comments tonight. Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. UPTON for joining us. I appreciate him taking time out of his busy schedule to talk about how the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has impacted his district and the State of Michigan. Let me state, as we get our next speaker to come forward, that in my district alone, the average savings for the average filer in my district is $2,700 a year. Now, I know that some of the colleagues on the other side of the aisle refer to that as crumbs, as meaningless, but that is real money that allows people to make a difference in their lives, to move forward, make decisions about fixing their houses, go on vacation, put a downpayment on a new car, all things that wouldn’t be possible. More importantly, that is money they worked for. That is not money somebody gave them. That is their money to begin with, and they get to keep it. That is what is so important about it. Mr. Speaker, our next speaker who wants to come forward and talk about his district is Representative SHIMKUS , who, as Mr. UPTON said, was a conferee on this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield to Congressman JOHNSHIMKUS , who represents the 15th Congressional District, a member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, a conferee on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and who has been an advocate for smaller government for years. Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman very much for yielding. It is great to be here with my friends from the State of Michigan. As a Republican, sometimes people ask: What is the difference? I always say: Well, Republicans, we believe in less government, individual responsibility, lower taxes, more personal freedoms and liberties. From my time here in Washington, I have always wanted a fairer, flatter, simpler Tax Code. We shouldn’t have to fear filing our income taxes. We shouldn’t have to fear whether we have the receipts. I think the other thing that was always frustrating about the Tax Code is you never know if you have done enough of the itemizing that you are actually going to get anything or not. And then, have you forgotten something that you are not recouping? So having said that, that is why—and I am glad Congressman MITCHELL  raised this issue, the fairer, flatter, simpler Tax Code. Before we passed the bill, 80 percent of my constituents did not itemize. Under this tax reform, 90 percent of all of my filers—90 percent—will be able to do it on this simple postcard. And it is easy to find. People can pull it up at fairandsimple.gop to check it out. 
liked our Tax Code—I mean nobody. Nobody could defend it because it was absurd. It was so complicated. Those of us who are from the Chicago area, we know that the last time the Tax Code was updated was when the Bears won the Super Bowl, so that is 30 years ago. And yet we have got this Tax Code that had been a complete throwback. The Tax Code was such a throwback that the last time it was updated, 1986, the internet didn’t exist, basically, as a commercial enterprise. There was no shared economy, per se. Airbnb, Uber, Lyft, all those things, they didn’t exist. Global supply chains were nowhere nearly as connected as they are today, which all begged the question that we needed a Tax Code to update things. Now, here is what was interesting: The hyperbole that surrounded the debate on the tax reform bill as H.R. 1 kept moving in and, ultimately, came to a crescendo, passed through the House, passed through the Senate, and was signed into law, it was described by, God bless them, our friends on the other side of the aisle as the worst bill ever, Armageddon, and, obviously, now, the famous line that the result of these things were crumbs. Well, none of that turned out to be true. This was a terrific bill. Let me just give you a couple of examples, Mr. Speaker, of people in my constituency who have written publicly or they have written to me privately about this bill. Here is Mary from Wheaton, Illinois, my hometown. She said: ‘‘Our family is already feeling the positive impact of the changes made in the Tax Code. Our daughter and her husband just had their first baby and will be able to take advantage of the doubled child tax credit next year. Throughout our extended family, those who work for big and small businesses alike are witnessing immediate effects. Companies are investing the anticipated benefits of the new tax law in the form of bonuses, pay raises, capital improvements, and new hires. And that’s just the beginning. The true value of this Tax Code will become even more evident in the months and years ahead.’’ Mary is absolutely right. Or another person, Nicole, from Elgin. She says: ‘‘Thanks to the new tax bill, my family will be saving an estimated $4,000 on our taxes next year. Not only that, but I’m getting a $1,000 bonus and an extra $1,500 in my employee pension account from my employer as a result of the changes.’’ Or how about an enrolled agent, Stephen, from Wayne. He prepares people’s taxes. He says: ‘‘As an enrolled agent entering my 35th tax season, I am anxiously awaiting the smiles I will be getting from my clients when I inform them how much they will be saving on their 2018 tax return . . . the clear majority of my clients will be paying lower tax rates in 2018 due to the recently passed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.’’ And then I will go to the end of his note. He says: ‘‘I haven’t been able to say this very often over the past 35 years, but I am actually looking forward to this tax season.’’ So we know that these things are true. We know that they are manifesting themselves. I have got a constituency where there are about 30,000 people who get hit hard by the alternative minimum tax, and they are not going to be hit by the alternative minimum tax. They are going to be spared that tax. There are many other examples in the State of Illinois where you see real progress being made. Up by me in Chicagoland, MK Incorporation, a fleet management company, is giving $1,000 bonuses to 150 employees. Ameren Illinois, the customers are using both electricity and natural gas. They will see a combined savings of lower utility rates. We have talked about AT&T already today: $1,000 bonuses to 10,000 Illinois based employees and, nationwide, over $1 billion increase in capital expenditures. There is example after example after example after example. Look, if all the critics can do is basically say, well, this isn’t enough or this is crumbs, they have not been to my constituency. To tell a family that I represent, Mr. Speaker, that $1,000 is crumbs is just patently obtuse. $1,000 is real money: $1,000 is getting ahead on a car payment; $1,000 is the ability to move forward and say we are going to go on a little extra special vacation, we are going to put a little bit more money toward our college fund, we are going to put a little bit more money toward our retirement. And that is just one particular example. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman for organizing this, and I very much appreciate his bringing us together to celebrate these things. Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I will ask the gentleman to stay for just a moment for a real quick question. First, I would say that the Bears is his example—and my example is Steve Yzerman was a rookie in the NHL and captain of the Detroit Red Wings. If you ask a young hockey fan now who Steve Yzerman is, they would look at you blankly. That is how long ago tax was tackled. I have a question for the gentleman. Ninety percent of our taxpayers, we believe, are going to file a standard deduction, but we kept—we talked about it a great deal. We kept some key tax cuts in the Tax Code to actually help families. Can the gentleman briefly talk about, maybe, the family and child tax credit and what we did with that and why we think that is important. Mr. ROSKAM. What we did with it is we doubled it so that the family tax credit is now doubled. So, you know, when folks say, ‘‘Well, I don’t like this tax plan,’’ really? You don’t like doubling the child tax credit? So there was very much an intentionality, as you know, to say we value family, we value children, we value domestic life, and, toward that end, we are going to support it through the Tax Code. So there was a very specific design not just to keep it, but to enhance it. Mr. MITCHELL. I want to be clear with folks. There is a child and family tax cut, the earned income credit, and the higher education credit, and those are all credits against your tax liability. This is not simply a deduction. After taxes are determined, those are credits back, not a tax deduction. Mr. ROSKAM. Right. Mr. MITCHELL. People don’t understand the difference some days. Mr. ROSKAM. That is right. So, to the gentleman’s point, a deduction is a decrease in a taxable liability; a credit is a credit. Once the tax is calculated, the credit is an amount that comes off of that tax liability, so it is a very significant thing. Said another way, credits are more valuable than deductions. Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for clarifying that, and I certainly hope people listen to the difference because some people don’t understand that. I appreciate the gentleman taking time to join us tonight. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman representing the 12th District of Illinois (Mr. BOST), a small family business owner himself. Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for holding this Special Order tonight. And I also say, just because we are following a theme, if we put in perspective how long ago it was that we did tax reform in this Nation, I was running for my first political office for county board. I had a mullet, and it looked good—at least my wife told me it did. But let me tell you that, after we passed this tax reform—I come from deep southern Illinois, nowhere near Chicago, a very rural district, a little bit of metropolitan—a typical family of four will receive a break of over $2,000 per year. Now, folks, I don’t know how it would be in your district or in your hometown if you are listening to this tonight, but that is not crumbs where I come from. Some of the folks here in Washington may think that that is the case, but that is not. Let me tell you that I have been around my district talking to people; and you go to barber shops and coffee shops, and my wife and I own a beauty salon, and you hear from the people how much they are saving, so much so that we actually asked for people to start replying on our Facebook and to tell us what their story was. I am just going to give you a few of these. I know that we are on limited time, but I am going to tell you that Bobby from Makanda, here is what he writes: 
I am a police officer and my wife is a high school teacher. Combined, the new tax rates save us over $300 a month. We have two teenage children. The additional income will help us save for upcoming college expenses. 
My wife is an educator and I am in healthcare. Since these changes have affected my pay about the same as hers, we know how much it changes our monthly income. About $300. 
Hey, Nancy, if that is crumbs in your world, it’s not in mine. 
Tax reform allows more money for college, more money to be put towards paying off our home, provides more activities for our children, and allows us to save more money for the future. 
My next speaker has extensive experience on economic development and creating a better business climate. Mr. Speaker, I yield to Congressman DARIN LAHOOD, representing the 18th District of Illinois, a member to both the Joint Economic Committee and Ways and Means Committee. Mr. LAHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman MITCHELL for yielding. I thank him and Congresswoman MIMI WALTERS for putting together and organizing this Special Order in order to highlight the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on families in Illinois and across the country. Thirtyone years is way too long. That is what it took before we passed comprehensive tax reform at the end of last year. And in my 2
1⁄2years here, I couldn’t be more proud to support the bill. And when I went in to looking at the legislation in the bill, I really looked at two things as we looked at comprehensive tax reform. One is, how do we help middle class and lower middle class people across this country and in my district? And secondly, how do we get the economy roaring again? We, for almost 9 years, had a very sluggish economy and stagnant wages. How do we get the economy healthy, robust, vibrant again? We succeeded on both those counts with this bill, and I am very proud to support it. This historic tax reform law is making a real difference for our families and our workers. But you don’t have to take my word for it. Take it from the hardworking people I have spoken with across Illinois’ 18th District. The workers I have spoken with are already seeing the results of the new withholding tables, which is no surprise. In fact, the median family of four in my district will save $2,593—again, let me repeat that, $2,593 every year from this new law. This figure is certainly not crumbs, as some people would describe it. When half of Americans say they are living paycheck to paycheck, this is real money for them. The benefits have already gone beyond lowering the rates, with more bonuses and pay raises being announced every single day. One example from my district is the Five Senses Spa in Peoria, Illinois. This is a small business. And for over a decade, the owner, Paola Hinton, has provided clients with relief from the stresses of their life at her spa. With the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Five Senses Spa is now providing tax relief to their employees. After calculating the savings from her business that she saw through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Paola handed out $500 bonuses to all of her employees as a ‘‘thank you’’ for their hard work. This is real money that the employees can put towards expenses, new purchases, or even saving up for things like education or a home or a new car. But tax reform also has positive effects beyond larger paychecks. Last month, I spoke with a constituent named Chris, who is a smallbusiness owner, and also the fire marshal for Springfield and Sangamon Counties. Chris attended a roundtable discussion I hosted in Springfield and talked about how the new depreciation rules, as a part of the tax reform law, have already incentivized building owners to upgrade their sprinkler and safety equipment, which has benefitted his small business. Safer buildings and up todate fire prevention are a winwin for everyone. I was glad to hear that even our local fire marshal was seeing the real effects of commonsense tax reform and reforming our Tax Code. Stories like these are coming from every district across this great country, and the benefits of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act show no sign of slowing down, and that is good news for all Americans. It should be clear by now that letting workers keep more of their hardearned paychecks is a recipe for a healthy economy, and I am excited to see how this bill continues to improve the lives and security of all American families. Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, could the Congressman stay one moment for a quick question? Mr. LAHOOD. Mr. Speaker, sure. Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, he was talking a little bit about the depreciation allowance and what that depreciation means for small business—especially small business. One of the important things we did was to change how the taxes are structured for a path we call passthrough to small businesses. Maybe he could explain that briefly, what was done to help small business be viable and grow in this country. Mr. LAHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I think we acknowledge that small businesses are the lifeblood of our economy. They create the most jobs in our economy. So when we looked at comprehensive tax reform, we obviously talked to those small businesses, those independent folks, and said: What can we do to help you in terms of lowering the rates, depreciation, expensing? We took that into account, and now you are seeing the results of that. So when you talk to small businesses on the real effect, what does that mean? What do they do with those savings? Well, they are hiring more people, they are investing in higher wages, they are investing back into their companies, which has a downstream effect throughout this country, and those are real results; and, again, that is a positive nature, which will continue into the future, and we are awful proud of those provisions. Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. LAHOODfor detailing that, and I appreciate him taking time this evening. We now will rotate back to Michigan, a fellow freshman, good friend of mine, also a proud Yooper. I am proud to introduce my fellow colleague in the freshman class from the northern regions of Michigan, who, throughout this process, served on the Budget Committee and had input into what this bill is. Mr. Speaker, I yield to Congressman JACKBERGMAN from the First District of Michigan. Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, what a great opportunity to really stand up here and smile and talk to the American public with the words of constituents from Michigan’s First District, because these are not my words. These are their words over the last 2
1⁄2 months or so since we passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. You know, in November 2016, the great people of Michigan’s First District sent me to Washington with a direct, yet simple, mandate: Get Washington, D.C., out of our pockets and off our backs. For a marine, that is a pretty simple missionoriented instruction. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was the first major step to accomplishing that goal. Since we passed tax reform, I have travelled throughout many of the First District’s 32 counties talking with constituents, business owners, and hearing their individual stories. Farmers, businesses, both large and small, and families are already seeing the benefits that tax reform brings, and we are just getting started. Many of these small companies said: Well, I don’t know yet, but I have got to meet with my accountant around the middle of April, and then we will really see. But now they are starting to see wage increases and bonuses, and business expansions are all beginning to roll in and take effect, and it is long overdue in our neck of the woods. And when I say, ‘‘our neck of the woods,’’ that is not a figurative statement. That is a literal statement. You know, many families in our district live paycheck to paycheck, and even a small crisis could send them into a tailspin. An extra $100 or $150 in a paycheck in my district is not crumbs. It is not Armageddon. It is a big plus. It gives that family flexibility to live their life and to raise their kids and be a proud community—wageearning members of that community. That $1,000 a year may mean a new set of snow tires. And by the way, we only have, roughly, a little over 2 weeks of winter left, but we use our snow tires up there through about mid May. That is just the way it works. That money might go for the kids to play on a sports team. Hockey is not a cheap sport to put your son or daughter in. Or it could be, possibly, just saving up in that family rainy day fund for an emergency. We hear of businesses from Boyne City to Marquette expanding, growing their staff, raising wages, all a result of a fairer and simpler Tax Code. You know, when I talk to some folks, they say: You know what, I don’t mind working. I am proud to work. The dignity of work is what makes me strong as an individual, what makes me strong as a mother or a father. 
THE DREAM WILL SURVIVE The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. KUSTOFF of Tennessee). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida (Mr. SOTO) for 30 minutes. Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, tonight, I rise for the 92,000 Dreamers in the State of Florida. Tonight, I rise for the 3.6 million Dreamers across this Nation. President Trump may have terminated the DACA program this week, but the dream will survive. These Dreamers are serving in our military. They are our teachers. They are students and businessowners, lawyers, doctors, and engineers. They are an ambitious group of young people who are renewing our democracy and who are some of the very best of what the next generation has to offer. I have no doubt, despite this termination this week, these young people will continue to fight, and we in the Congressional Hispanic Caucus will stand with them. We in the Democratic Caucus will continue to stand with them. I hope some of my colleagues who have signed on to this bill in the Republican Conference will continue, but we need a vote on the floor. Seventy percent of Americans already stand with our Dreamers. It is true that the Federal courts this week have continued with their injunction enjoining the termination of the DACA program. This will help those who are already in the program, but that is a small fraction of the Dreamers in this country. It is a sad state of affairs that Dreamers could only find justice in our courts. This is the people’s House, and the people’s business needs to be done. It is time to have a vote on the floor in a bipartisan fashion—a clean Dream Act now, or in November the voters will have their own vote regarding Dreamers. HONORING SERETHA TINSLEY DURING WOMEN ’S

ABORTION IN AMERICA The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. KING) for 30 minutes. Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to have the opportunity to be here on the floor of the United States House of Representatives. I ask that people who are listening to our conversation weigh heavily on some of the remarks that will be made here this half hour. I come to the floor tonight, Mr. Speaker, to address the situation of innocent, unborn human life in America and to recount the path that we have followed and to lay out a path for the future that gives us a better opportunity to save as many lives as possible. For me, Mr. Speaker, I recall that when 1973 rolled around—January 22, 1973—on that date, we had two major decisions that came down from the United States Supreme Court: Roe v. Wade, which most everybody knows; and the other was Doe v. Bolton. Of those two cases that dropped on us in January of 1973, not very many people, if any, understood the magnitude of the decisions that had been made that day or the impact it would have on the population of the United States of America. They did not believe that we would see 45 years of prolife marches coming to the city in the middle of the winter and sometimes marching through the snow from down on the Mall, all the way up to the United States Supreme Court building, calling upon the Supreme Court to correct the decision that was made by an activist court in 1973. The bottom line of that decision was that an abortion was essentially declared to be, some would say, a constitutional right for any reason or no reason at all, as much as you might want to parse the phrases in Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton, Mr. Speaker. Of course, for me, I didn’t realize the impact of this in 1973. But by 1976, when my first son was born, I remember holding him in my hands and looking at David Steven King, understanding the miracle of life and the miracle of birth and thinking within that first hour of his life how anyone could take his life now, this little miracle child with that big head and dark hair and blue eyes and gurgling a little bit and crying some and squirming a lot, but a miracle. I thought: How could anyone take his life now, when he is an hour old or a minute old or a minute before he was born or an hour before he was born? Could they take his life a day before, a week before, or a month before, or a trimester before? When could you decide that this child’s life could be ended, and do so within a moral framework rather than a framework of maybe selfinterest? I concluded that there was only one moment, only one instant. We have to choose that moment when life begins. There is only one, and that is the moment of conception. We all know that. I knew it in 1973. I am sure I knew it before then, but I hadn’t thought about it very much. And here we are today and we know. We know by the benefit of ultrasound. We are watching little babies squirm around in the womb. We are watching them yawn and stretch and suck their thumbs and try to talk and stretch themselves and belch and do all the things inside the womb that they do pretty shortly when they get outside the womb. It is life. It is miraculous life. Little hands, little feet, little fingers, a little nose, little eyes. They are little babies that are defenseless. This Congress has allowed a Supreme Court to impose abortion on demand in America, and we have worked to put together very few limitations on that abortion on demand. I don’t think we have done enough, either, to send the message to America that life begins at the moment of conception. But ultrasound has shown many of us in this country—millions of us—that life does exist inside the womb. We know that we can, even with a transabdominal ultrasound, verify a heartbeat in 7 to 8 weeks from conception. In 7 to 9 weeks, that little baby is formed by then with a beating heart. We know that of those babies that have a detectable beating heart, 95 percent of those babies will experience a successful birth. It is at least 95 percent. Some say more. So 95 percent of them, or more, are destined to experience a successful birth. Yet the most dangerous place for a baby is in the mother’s womb. It is the most dangerous place because our hearts are hardened by a Supreme Court decision that some think will not change, that we have to live with it 
in perpetuity and accept the consequences of 60 million Americans being aborted. There is a hole in the population of America that is 60 billion babies strong. Some of those little girls who were aborted would be mothers by now. When you do the math on that just on the back of the envelope, that is perhaps as many as another 60 million babies—a missing 120 million Americans that would otherwise have been born in this country and had the opportunity to live, to love, to laugh, to learn, to worship, to be mothers or fathers themselves. That is what we are asking for here in this Congress with 170 cosponsors on the Heartbeat bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. LAMALFA ), one of those cosponsors who is a bit of a rare commodity himself, a conservative from California. Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I am, indeed, pleased to join my colleague from Iowa (Mr. KING) tonight, who has been a very strong, tireless leader on this issue and many other important ones for our Congress and our country. So I thank him for that and for letting me be here to be a part of this tonight. Obviously, this is a very important issue and we need to have a much better discussion than we have had in a long time in this country. The moral of the Heartbeat Protection Act is extremely simple to understand. It is against the law for a physician to perform an abortion after detecting a heartbeat, other than to save the life of the mother. Mr. KINGwas speaking a moment ago about this. For anybody who uses common sense, life begins at that moment of conception. At that moment of conception, you have a life. If you don’t have a conception, obviously, you don’t have a life. So how is it that it is even a debate? How do people hide on the sidelines, in the shadows, somehow debating it as something like, ‘‘Well, is it really a life,’’ or, ‘‘At what line do we draw that point at?’’ That is an important point Mr. KING made as well with all the different ideas of when an abortion is appropriate. We have a 20week mark. We have the end of the first trimester, the end of the second trimester. What date is appropriate? We have people these days talking about partialbirth abortion not being a problem at all. Even in some extreme quarters, some people are saying that postbirth is somehow an acceptable way and that it isn’t really a person with rights at that point. We are talking about a much narrower thing here, with the heartbeat being a true detectable moment of life. When prospective mothers go in for those ultrasounds, it is a very moving moment for her, and, hopefully, her mate there with her, to see what is going on inside there with all those little baby parts that are being formed and the miracle that life is. But it is really a telling moment when that prospective mother hears that heartbeat. That is what is so important in this debate about having the tool of an ultrasound to show what is really going on here, for those who try to obfuscate what is happening with the pregnancy. Let that prospective mother make an informed decision, not one that is hidden, not one that is obfuscated by, ‘‘Oh, it is just a tissue mass or something.’’ The crime about a lot of this is that a lot of these women are not being allowed to make an informed decision about what is really going on. So this Heartbeat bill that Mr. KING is championing here is an important moment in time for a prospective mom and her mate to be able to have an informed decision and really contemplate this life that is happening and the downside of what that abortion might mean. So, indeed, is it not a crime to murder a human being with a heartbeat? It really shouldn’t be any different for babies that are yet to be born. Arguably, since they are innocent, isn’t it more important we protect their rights? They don’t really have someone to speak for them, except for those of us who realize what we are truly taking about here: an innocent life with a heartbeat that will become a life outside of the womb and walk amongst the rest of us humans with dignity, with passion, with ideas, with dreams. That is what we are defending here. It really mystifies me how legislation like this is so difficult to move through this body, the Senate, the Congress as a whole, or State legislatures in other types of bills we have tried in order to preserve life, to preserve the value of life. Indeed, if we are not a country that is going to value life in all of its human forms, then what are we? Our Founders placed a great value on those liberties that have formed this country. Indeed, right above the dais it says: ‘‘In God we trust.’’ I think God watches what we do here. He is watching what is happening to these babies and he wants us to tell the truth and know the truth and be able to project the truth on what is really going on with a pregnancy or those who are contemplating a very serious decision. This bill will go a long way toward shedding the light on a quantifiable moment when there is a detected heartbeat that anybody around that ultrasound can hear. That should be a reality moment. I think more times than not, a prospective mother will make a decision for life, given that. I commend my colleague, Mr. KING, for battling this for those who have lost their lives so many millions of times in the past and had nobody to defend them. But he is building momentum on this legislation and his effort with so many prolife groups around the country, so many prolife legislators that are onboard with this. We need a couple more of these national groups to get involved and not see the fog, but, instead, see the clear path that this is. I implore people to contact their legislators and contact the organizations that are supposed to be standing for life and make sure they get onboard with this effort, because a heartbeat is a true indication of life. I thank Mr. KINGfor his effort with this. Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman gives me a little too much credit and doesn’t take enough credit for himself. b1845 That is that measure of humility I was asked about earlier today. Trent Franks always said: The funny thing about humility, about the time you think you have achieved it, you have lost it. Mr. LAMALFA is a solid principled conservative, and I appreciate him coming to the floor to defend life. The effort that we have had is the whip team has gone out and pulled together 170 cosponsors on this bill that has set the stage for a path that I believe soon will be to the floor of the House of Representatives. Let’s put the Heartbeat bill over on MITCH MCCONNELL ’s desk. That is a good place for a lot of good things to have a chance to happen, even though they are a little slower at moving over there than we are over here. One of the nimble folks who has been actively engaged in the prolife movement in the House of Representatives is Mr. LAMBORN from Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. LAMBORN ). Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman KINGfor his endless and tireless leadership in reminding us of the humanity of the unborn. I am a proud cosponsor of the Heartbeat Protection Act. I am one of those 170 who have stepped forward to support this muchneeded piece of legislation. The development of an unborn baby is truly miraculous. Around 6 to 8 weeks, you can detect, through ultrasound, the heartbeat of the little child inside the mother’s womb; 6 to 8 weeks. So I don’t see how people can deny that an abortion is the taking of a human life. How many lives would we save if we remembered that simple fact? What if instead of rushing to abortion, which some people think is their only option, we instead turned our attention to addressing practical needs, the needs of a woman facing a pregnancy decision? What if we empowered women to carry and raise their child? Or what if we did everything we could to promote a stable and happy life for the child through adoption? America was built on the principle that life is a Godgiven gift. Here, in Congress, it is our duty to protect 
human life at all stages. I will continue to do so, and I know Representative KINGwill continue to do so. I thank him for his leadership. I am glad that I can support him with this wonderful piece of legislation. Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Colorado for coming to the floor to make such a strong message here on the sanctity of human life. When I think about that heartbeat, a heartbeat is a certain indicator of life. If the baby has a beating heart, we know that baby is alive. Statistically speaking, 95 percent or more of those little babies that have a beating heart, that can be detected by an ultrasound in that 6 to 8week period of time, 95 percent of them will experience a successful birth. I have asked the question to those who weren’t supportive of the bill: Did you ever hear the expression, ‘‘Let’s error on the side of life?’’ Well, let’s not error with life at all if we can help it. If we have a 95 percent chance of a successful birth, we can’t take a chance on ending that little baby’s life. Mr. Speaker, this bill is a bill that has come together over the last year and a half or so. Just to mention some of the points here that I think are important is that we have at least 162 pro life organizations and leaders that support the Heartbeat bill. I have a little demonstration here. These are some of the organizations and leaders that support the Heartbeat bill. We have to really search pretty hard to find somebody that is not onboard. You can go down through this list. I could read these all off, but I think it would be a little bit tiresome and maybe a little bit redundant. I put this together. This may be onethird of—or maybe even onefourth—of the overall list of 162 prolife organizations and leaders that support the Heartbeat bill. It is nearly universal across this country. Of course, we don’t have Planned Parenthood on here. We don’t have the NARAL here. The National Abortion Rights Action League is what they used to be. They say they aren’t anymore, but, yes, they are. We have the prolife organizations here: the people who care about life, the people who understand that human life is sacred in all of its forms, it begins at the moment of conception, that we have to protect life from that time on, and that we have a constitutional duty to do so. We have an equal protection clause in the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution that tells us that. But it seems as though the United States Supreme Court, in Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton, upset that. They decided that a right to privacy, which was a manufactured right—I don’t think I have it in my memos—but it is Griswold v. Connecticut back in the 1960s. It is a decision that a couple had a right to privacy in order to buy birth control pills. It was in Connecticut in that period of time. Shortly after that decision, they decided it wasn’t just a married couple that had a right to privacy; it was an unmarried couple that had a right to privacy in the form of contraceptives. That was only in the midsixties. Then Roe v. Wade came along. I think that this Court can never be defended for the decision that they made, the idea that privacy trumps life, and that the privacy of a mother will allow for an abortion at any stage, is how this all came together between Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton. But even some of our professors that you might think have been on the other side of the issue had their skepticism. In fact, there is a bit of it here in Ruth Bader Ginsburg in a statement that she made in 1985. Our Supreme Court Justice Ginsburg said: 
Roe, I believe, would have been more acceptable as a judicial decision if it had not gone beyond a ruling on the extreme statute before the court. Heavyhanded judicial intervention was difficult to justify and appears to have provoked, not resolved, the conflict. 
I would restate the Fourteenth Amendment. It says this: ‘‘No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.’’ This comes back to personhood. I believe that a conceived baby from that moment is a person. We don’t have the technical medical ability to define that moment at this point, Mr. Speaker, but we can define ‘‘heartbeat,’’ and we have done so in the Heartbeat Protection Act. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. ROTHFUS ), who has been a leader and a fighter for life since back in the 1980s or so, when I was still in the crib. Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to commend Mr. KINGfor his work on the Heartbeat Protection Act. It gives us an opportunity to reflect on some of those bigger issues that we have going on in our society. This is personal to everybody. We all have our own stories of when we are in a family situation and somebody becomes pregnant. I certainly remember that when my wife and I had our first child. The first visit to the doctor when you got to hear the heartbeat was just amazing. I remember also having a subsequent appointment where the doctor couldn’t find the heartbeat. We were very concerned, very worried, so they sent us to the hospital. They wanted us to have another test. It is a small town we were in. The hospital was where they had the sonogram. My wife and I were praying all the way: Please, let this baby be okay. Well, we got to the hospital and the technician did a sonogram, and, lo and behold, we saw the baby, we saw the beating heart, and we were just in awe at this new human life. Mothers and fathers are forever changed when they first hear that heartbeat, that tiny pulse that reinforces the big and beautiful reality of a precious human life. Mr. Speaker, that is why I rise in support of H.R. 490, the Heartbeat Protection Act. As a lawmaker, I took an oath to our Constitution to protect the constitutional rights of all Americans. That is why I am cosponsoring this bill. This legislation protects a preborn baby’s life when his or her heartbeat is detected. A heartbeat is a very basic sign of life. The pulse represents a unique person with inherent dignity and natural, human and constitutional rights that extend throughout the continuum of life through conception until natural death. And where do these rights come from? The Founders who signed the Declaration knew, for the Declaration itself says: ‘‘We hold these truths to be selfevident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights.’’ That is interesting, Mr. Speaker, because the first unalienable right that is identified is the right to life. Do you know who else knew? President Kennedy. President Kennedy reminded us in a different context, in the struggle against atheistic totalitarian communism. He said these words: ‘‘And yet the same revolutionary beliefs for which our forebears fought are still at issue around the globe—the belief that the rights of man come not from the generosity of the state but from the hand of God.’’ The right to life, defined in our Declaration, protected in our Constitution, and reiterated time and again by leaders across the religious and political spectrum, applies to every human life. It is easy to see who is human, if you look. Twentysix years ago, the late Governor Bob Casey from Pennsylvania, and others, including Sargent Shriver and Eunice Kennedy Shriver, signed onto a statement regarding abortion as true today as when it was published. Under the section of that document that was titled ‘‘Without a Doubt, a Human Life,’’ Governor Casey and his coauthors observed: 
From the beginning, each human embryo has its own unique genetic identity. Three and a half weeks after conception, its heart starts beating. At 6 weeks, brain activity can be detected. At the end of 2 months, the limbs, fingers, and toes are complete. By 3 months, the baby is quite active, forming fists, bending arms, and curling toes. At 4 months, vocal cords, eyelashes, teeth buds, fingernails, and toenails are all present. By 5 months, the baby is sucking its thumb, punching, kicking, and going through the motions of crying. By 6 months, it responds to light and sound and can recognize its mother’s voice. 
Advocates of unrestricted abortion do not want the public to focus on these undeniable facts of fetal development, but the facts cannot be ignored. They may claim that abortion is a violent act, not against potential life, but against a living, growing human being, a life with potential. 
Governor Casey subscribed to that belief. Mr. Speaker, let’s be clear. Intentionally stopping a heartbeat is not healthcare. H.R. 490 recognizes what science has already affirmed: that there is a baby growing in her mother’s womb, one with her own distinct heartbeat. Therefore, we have an obligation to protect the most vulnerable among us: to defend the defenseless. How can our country continue to flourish and claim itself as a champion of human rights when we allow our society to rid ourselves of our own future generations? That is why I came to the floor today to urge support for the Heartbeat Protection Act, to give our country a chance to reflect on some of the deeper questions and deeper values, to walk in solidarity with one another when one encounters a difficult situation, and to stand in each another’s shoes with empathy. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for his eloquent words. I hadn’t heard the description delivered by Governor Casey in those years back. But Governor Bob Casey—God rest his soul—captured my attention years ago, 20 or more years ago. I had a quote from Governor Bob Casey, a Democrat, that I had on my bulletin board that I don’t have to look up anymore. And it was this: 
Human life cannot be measured. It is the measure itself against which all other things are weighed. 
It rang so clear and true to me that I cut it out of the magazine and stuck it up on the bulletin board. His words echo in this Chamber today. I wish they echoed in his son over in the Senate the same way they echoed out of the mouth of Governor Bob Casey back in those days when he was denied the opportunity to speak before the Democratic National Convention because he is prolife. And we look today and we see this issue has been more and more polarized. I hope that we can be more broad with this and that we can be more bipartisan than we are. b1900 We do have bipartisan cosponsorship on this bill. It is narrow, but it exists. I urge, Mr. Speaker, this body to take this bill to the floor. 170 cosponsors is further ahead than any comparable piece of prolife legislation. To have that many cosponsors and a good number of other Members who have said, ‘‘I am not ready to sign on the dotted line, but you bring it to the floor, and I will vote ‘yes,’’’ I think we get to ‘‘yes,’’ but we need to bring it here. There are concerns that, well, if we pass it off the floor of the House, the Senate won’t take it up. Well, we know they won’t take it up if we don’t pass it off the floor of the House. There is concern about the Supreme Court. Of course there is. We have to challenge the Court. We are going to live with the 1 million abortions a year in this country until we are willing to challenge the Court and do so successfully. I believe, Mr. Speaker, that we are going to see one or two more appointments to this Court in the next 2 or 3 or more years, and we need to get the bill off the floor, onto the desk of Leader MCCONNELL so that it has a chance then to go to the President’s desk, where I am very confident that President Trump will sign the bill. And then it has a chance to go—I am happy with it not being litigated, but we expect it will be litigated like every other effective piece of prolife legislation. I appreciate the attention tonight, Mr. Speaker, and the speakers who have come to the floor to weigh in for innocent, unborn human life and to lay out the path for the future that we have to follow here if we are to answer to God and country for that gift from God, which is life, in the first priority, then liberty, then the pursuit of happiness. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
