Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, for over the last decade, I have been working with a bipartisan group to deal with helping some of the foreign nationals in Afghanistan who helped Americans’ mission be able to escape the tender mercies of the Taliban and others with long memories. These are men and women who helped us as guides, as translators, people who provided onbase security, construction workers, and truck drivers—a vast array of people who helped us with our vital mission. As we have scaled down and moved on, it has left these people vulnerable. We have example after example where the Taliban and al Qaeda have threatened them, have attacked their families, held them for ransom, tortured them, and, in some cases, killed them. We have implemented a Special Immigrant Visa program that has enabled over 8,500 people to get to safety to protect themselves and their families. I have witnessed some of these tearful reunions where a guide returned, was able to escape to the United States, and united with the person, the soldier, whose life he saved. This happens time after time. Unfortunately, the process is hopelessly tangled. It is slow, and it is bureaucratic. We have over 10,000 people still in the pipeline. Every year we struggle to be able to have sufficient visas authorized to be able to help thousands more who are at risk. We have the National Defense Authorization Act that is coming forward that would pose another problem to help those who put their faith in us. This version would leave out all individuals who worked with the State Department and the USAID—critical parts of our mission in Afghanistan. It would leave off all the onbase staff who worked in direct support of the Department of Defense, people who did construction, firefighters, onbase security, maintenance, and administrative support, people whose services were vital and whose service to the United States is well known and who are at risk. We are hopeful that as this bill comes to the floor that the House will be able to work with us to modify these unnecessary restrictions, to give more time to process and allow more people to come to safety. We have a moral obligation to protect people who put their lives on the line to support Americans in these troubled areas. I would hope that we would, once again, be able to make necessary adjustments to be able to try and help more come to safety. I have been working with my good friend ADAM KINZINGER , who represents some of the newer Members of the House who actually served in theater, who are committed to helping people whom they saw help us. I would hope, as the process comes forward, we can consider amendments to be able to reduce some of these restrictions; and then I hope, as it works its way through the legislative process to the Senate that does not have anything in their version of the bill speaking to the Special Immigrant Visas, that we will be able to do our job to make sure that we are not having people at risk, their families threatened, and undermining the credibility of the United States. Remember, around the world, foreign nationals help us with our missions; and if we send a message that we are not going to stick with them when the going gets tough, then they are going to be much less likely to help us wherever it is in these trouble spots. America will be more vulnerable as people who have already helped us are at risk. We can do better. f 
SUPPORTING OUR VETERANS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York (Mr. ZELDIN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, as a nation, supporting our veterans must always be one of our highest priorities. These brave men and women who willingly and selflessly put their lives on the line while defending our country deserve the highest quality of life and care once they return home. According to the Suffolk County Veterans Service Agency, there are 83,254 veterans who live in my home county of Suffolk. With the highest population of veterans by county in New York State and one of the highest populations in the country, there is a significant need for increased care options for our veterans in Suffolk. There are so many options of quality care for veterans, but too often their choices are limited. Quality care can also come at great expense. In an effort to expand access to care for our veterans, I recently introduced bipartisan legislation in Congress, H.R. 2460, which would ensure that 70 percent or more serviceconnected disabled veterans are able to receive adult day health care, a daily program for disabled veterans who need extra assistance and special attention in their daytoday lives. It comes at no cost to the veterans and their families because the program is defined as a reimbursable treatment option through the Department of Veterans Affairs. This legislation has strong bipartisan support in Congress, with over 45 cosponsors, including the entire Long Island congressional delegation. My bill would greatly expand this great option of care for veterans on Long Island and across the country. Just last month, on April 20, 2016, the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee hosted a hearing of the Subcommittee on Health regarding my bill, and on April 29, 2016, the Health Subcommittee held a markup and favorably forwarded my bill to the full committee for final consideration before being sent to the House floor for a vote. Working with my colleagues in the House and various veterans service organizations, I will continue pushing to get this bill passed out of committee in earnest to allow this bill to come to the House floor this year. While serving in the New York State Senate, I secured the funding necessary to create the PFC Joseph P. Dwyer Program, a peertopeer support program for veterans suffering from post traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury. PFC Dwyer, from Mount Sinai, New York, received nationwide recognition for a photograph that went viral showing him cradling a wounded Iraqi boy while his unit was fighting its way up to the capital city of Baghdad. Sadly, after returning home and struggling with PTSD, PFC Dwyer died in 2008. Created in his honor, the Dwyer Program was initially launched in the counties of Suffolk, Jefferson, Saratoga, and Rensselaer. Since 2013, the program has expanded to over a dozen counties across New York. Earlier this year, I introduced bipartisan legislation in Congress, H.R. 4513, that will expand the Dwyer Program on a national level so that every veteran in the U.S. eventually has access to a peertopeer support group. This bill has strong bipartisan support, including the entire Long Island congressional delegation. I will continue working together with them and others in the fight to expand the Dwyer Program. Additionally, on the east end of Long Island, working closely with the Peconic Bay Medical Center and VA, I secured an east end healthcare facility for veterans and their families at Peconic Bay’s Manorville campus. After so bravely serving our country, this facility provides an important new option for veterans, increasing access to care for those who live on Long Island’s east end, while still allowing them to continue receiving other services and ongoing treatment at the VA hospital in Northport. b1015 There is so much more that Congress can do to improve the quality of life for our veterans. I will continue working to ensure that my bills that previously passed the House are signed into law, including H.R. 1569, to protect the benefits of deceased veterans, and H.R. 1187, which would eliminate the loan limit that the VA can guarantee for a veteran. Congress also must continue to reform the VA wherever it underserves a veteran. A recent series of USA Today articles reported that VA supervisors in multiple States instructed employees to falsify wait times. They must be held accountable. This is a slap in the face to our vets. 
Just last year the House took a step forward by passing the VA Accountability Act of 2015, H.R. 1994, legislation that I cosponsored that would make important reforms to the VA system, which will provide the necessary resources and the flexibility the VA needs to hold poorperforming employees accountable. While I believe that the VA has 99 percent of employees generally caring about the work they do and want to help veterans, we must always ensure that the other 1 percent of those who are not acting in the best interest of veterans are held accountable. Our veterans deserve only the highest quality of care at our VA facilities. Fighting for our veterans who fought for us always has been and will always be one of my top priorities. I will continue my work in Congress to improve our veterans’ quality of care in any way that I can. 
RECOGNIZING KEY WEST FIRE DEPARTMENT The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida (Mr. CURBELO ) for 5 minutes. Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Key West Fire Department on their Class 1 Insurance Service Office rating, the highest achievable rating that a fire department can attain. They are 1 out of fewer than 200 departments in the Nation to receive this score, which is based off of a multitude of factors, including training, response time, and how well they are equipped. This rating also helps by providing residents with the lowest fire insurance rates possible, something I am sure that all Key West residents appreciate. I commend Fire Chief David Fraga and the entire Key West Fire Department on their diligent work and their devotion to keeping everyone in Key West safe. We are very fortunate to have a strong team of firefighters protecting us. 
Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the Florida Keys Marathon Airport for officially becoming an international airport on April 20, 2016. For 8 years the staff has worked to attain this clarification. It comes as no surprise to me that they were able to achieve this feat. I commend the Florida Keys Marathon Airport on receiving this welldeserved designation. This airport will provide additional travel options for the families living in our community and the millions of tourists who visit south Florida every year. Congratulations to Mayor Senmartin, Vice Mayor Kelly, council members Zieg, Coldiron, and Bartus, and city manager Chuck Lindsey and, also, former Mayor Ramsey and former city manager Mike Puto, all who worked very hard to make this a reality. RECOGNIZING OFFICER MARIO GUTIERREZ  
Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Miami Dade Police Department’s own Officer Mario Gutierrez, who received the Medal of Valor, the highest decoration of honor given to public safety officers in the United States. In 2013, Officer Gutierrez was on a routine call when he noticed an individual exhibiting strange behavior at a gas station near Miami International Airport. As Officer Gutierrez approached, the man attempted to light a gas pump on fire. In an attempt to disarm the assailant, who was holding a knife, Gutierrez received several stab wounds that nearly cost him his life. Had the assailant been successful in causing a mass fire, many lives may have been lost on that day. Officer Gutierrez went above and beyond the call of duty to protect the members of our community. We thank him for his service, his selflessness, and his bravery in the face of danger. Officer Gutierrez, thank you. You are a true hero. 
Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Brian Reedy, a seventh grade visual arts teacher from Zelda Glazer Middle School in my south Florida congressional district. In 2014, Mr. Reedy became the visual arts instructor at Zelda Glazer and, in only 2 years, has propelled the program to national recognition. Mr. Reedy has received numerous accolades for his work at Zelda Glazer, with his fellow teachers referring to the work of his students as magnet quality. His classroom, however, does not require an application to enter like many art magnet programs in south Florida. Any student can register. Students have had their art pieces showcased from local shows in Miami all the way to the New York Scholastic Art Awards. What is even more impressive is that Mr. Reedy works with a wide range of talents, including those just getting started to people who have been painting for many years. As a former MiamiDade County School Board member, I always appreciate and support teachers who encourage our youth to explore their passions in life, and Mr. Reedy does just that. It is an honor to recognize Mr. Reedy for his great work at Zelda Glazer. I look forward to both his and his students’ future successes. 
HONORING NATIONAL POLICE WEEK The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah (Mr. STEWART ) for 5 minutes. Mr. STEWART. Mr. Speaker, along with many of my colleagues, I rise today to honor National Police Week. One of the favorite things that I get to do as a Member of Congress is to ride with police officers as they go about their duties, and from St. George to Salt Lake City I have had the opportunity to do this. Sadly, many in our society, particularly among the press, have become highly critical of law enforcement officers. Now, I recognize that not all law enforcement officers are perfect. People make mistakes. We all do. But we can’t let the mistakes of a few tarnish the name of such a noble and a brave profession. Such criticism of police efforts doesn’t come without a cost. It forces the officers to pull back, to become overly cautious, and to view every encounter that they may have through the prism of a lens of a media event. What is the result of this? We now know that crime rates have been rising across the country. Interestingly and sadly, they are rising in some of the poorest communities, the communities that most need the help of an effective police force. Now more than ever we need brave men and women who are willing to serve and to protect. As I have said, I have had the chance to go on several ridealongs with several police departments. Again and again I have been impressed with their hard work, their professionalism, and their willingness to put themselves at risk to protect other people. There is a great example of this. I am reminded of the heroic actions of Officer Hone, a police officer who in the last year saved two young girls in Salt Lake City. A disturbed man who had recently been released from prison and was on drugs broke into the home of two sisters, both of them college students. He began to viciously attack them. He took a knife and attempted to take their lives. Fortunately, Officer Hone was in the area, heard the screams of these young girls, and just seconds before the intruder expected to take the life of one of them, this heroic officer quickly diffused the situation, literally saving her life. Bree, the sister who was saved, said of this officer, ‘‘He was so professional and calm. Right when we made eye contact, I knew I was safe. It’s a miracle that he had so much composure. He was our angel.’’ This is just one example of the thousands of courageous police officers we have in America. I am proud to live in a country where professionals are ready to put their lives at risk in order to serve and to protect members of their community. Let us honor these police officers, their courage, their selflessness, and their dedication. Let us honor them not just this week, but, frankly, all year round for the sacrifices they make for us. 
HONORING SALLY CLARK The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Sally Clark, who was part of the class of 1963 at East High School in Des Moines, Iowa. I never knew her as Sally Clark because I knew her as Sally Davis, my mother. I am very appreciative that the class of 1963 allowed my mom to be part of a reunion in July of 1993 because my mom never graduated with that class. Sally Clark dropped out of high school in 1962 and eventually finished her degree much later by getting her general equivalency diploma with the help of my sister, who was the reason she dropped out of high school in 1962. In looking at the program from that reunion in 1993, the fondest memories my mom had of East High School were the friends she left behind. In 1977, she left not only friends behind, but she left family behind and moved our family to Taylorville, Illinois, where I grew up and where she inspired so many. My mom passed away 17 years ago today. The reason I am here is because of the inspiration she was to me and to so many. I want to tell her what I couldn’t tell her on Mother’s Day: Your family is doing great. Your granddaughter, who you knew as a 2year old, just finished her freshman year of college. The grandsons you never met are doing fine as freshmen in high school. Mom, your whole family is doing well. As a matter of fact, you have a greatgranddaughter now that shares your middle name. I am here on the House floor to fight to make sure that we work in a bipartisan way to end the scourge of the cancer that killed you and that has killed so many, young and old. We will never forget this fight and I will never forget that fight because of what you meant to me and to so many. Mom, I love you and I miss you every day. You are the reason that I get this privilege to be a Member of this great institution. 
HONORING DR. FRANCES BARTLETT KINNE, PH.D. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida (Mr. CRENSHAW ) for 5 minutes. Mr. CRENSHAW. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life work of Dr. Frances Bartlett Kinne, Ph.D. We in Jacksonville, Florida, will be celebrating 99 years with our friend, Dr. Fran Kinne, on May 22 of this year. Dr. Kinne is first in Florida in many ways. In 1979, she became the first woman president of a Florida college, Jacksonville University, JU. Prior, in 1961, she became the founding dean of JU’s College of Fine Arts, the first woman in Florida to hold such a position. In fact, it was her idea to form the college where she had been a humanities professor for several years. She was the first woman elected as president of the International Council of Fine Arts, and not only the first woman in Florida’s first rotary club, the Rotary Club of Jacksonville, but she later became the first woman president of that club. She also became the first woman member of a club in Jacksonville called the River Club. Again, the first woman member. As you can tell, Dr. Fran Kinne was first in many ways and a role model to not only women in Jacksonville, Florida, but all across this great country. To those of us who know her well, she is also first in our hearts. A tireless advocate for education and young people, Fran Kinne always reminded us that life is not about us, life is about others. She would tell her graduates each year to go out into the world and make the world a better place. One of those graduates, Tim Cost, is now the president of Jacksonville University. So many of her students have made a difference not only in Florida, but all across this great land. Last year, at the age of 98, she became the Nation’s oldest commencement speaker at a major college or university. The wife of an army colonel, Fran spent years overseas following World War II. She was in Germany, she was in Japan, and she was in China. While her husband worked, so did Fran. She created postwar education programs for children in Japan, and she went to class with young German students who accepted her as the caring American that she was. b1030 She numbered among her friends Bob Hope, Winston Churchill, Charlton Heston, Billy Graham, and Steve Forbes. Fran Kinne brought Bob Hope and Jack Benny together for their only joint appearance, and that was at Jacksonville University. She is listed in over 25 ‘‘Who’s Who’’ and similar publications, and six facilities in Iowa and Florida are named in her honor. Her autobiography is aptly named ‘‘Iowa Girl: The President Wears a Skirt.’’ Never intending to live in Florida, Fran came here with her husband, and, thankfully, for those of us in Jacksonville, she never left. She was born in Iowa. She was educated at Drake University and graduated with a bachelor’s and a master’s in music education. She remains a member of the Board of Trustees at Drake University and is on the board of the Mayo Clinic in Florida. Since 1994, she has been the chancellor emeritus at Jacksonville University. Her infectious enthusiasm for life and positive thinking goes on and on. I visited her the other day, and she reminded me: If you laugh 100 times a day, that is the same thing as 20 minutes of physical exercise. She would say: If you keep a positive attitude and if you smile a lot, that will add 10 years to your life. Fran and I have always been good buddies, and she has been a mentor to me just as she has been to thousands of her former students. Mr. Speaker, I ask you and Members of this House to join me in celebrating the outstanding 99 years and counting of one of Florida’s most outstanding citizens: my good buddy, Dr. Frances Bartlett Kinne. f 
CONGRATULATING DONNA EISENMAN ON HER RETIREMENT The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN ) for 5 minutes. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Donna Eisenman, who recently retired after 40 years in working for American Airlines’ Washington desk. Donna Eisenman began her career as a flight attendant with Trans World Airlines in 1969. A year later, she transitioned to American Airlines for a position as a reservations agent in Philadelphia. In a time before computers, Donna effortlessly sold airline tickets and helped customers with travel arrangements. In 1972, Donna moved to Washington, D.C., to start the next phase of her career. Donna spent the next 10 years working at the City Ticket Office and at the ticket counter at Reagan National Airport. In 1982, she transitioned to the Schedule Airline Ticket Office, which served DOD customers in northern Virginia. Donna’s efforts were so successful that she was asked to open a different satellite office to assist Fort Belvoir travelers. Later, Donna was asked to reestablish a longabandoned desk specifically designed to help government travelers. Donna accepted this challenge, and the American Airlines Washington desk was reborn. For the next 28 years, Donna’s unyielding commitment to customer service and her natural sales ability provided government and frequent travelers with the best experience in the industry. On March 25, Donna retired from American Airlines, and she is now spending time with her lovely family and is volunteering for the wildlife rescue causes that she champions. I thank Donna for her service and dedication. Congratulations, Donna. I wish you all the best in your muchdeserved retirement. 
Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I recognize the outstanding career of Lourdes Sovedia. After 40 years of teaching, Lourdes will be retiring at the end of this school year. Like me, Lourdes’ family fled the oppressive Castro regime when she was just a young girl in order to seek freedom and refuge in this wonderful Nation, the United States. She worked hard at learning the language and the culture, and with inspiration from her mom, she dedicated her life to pursuing a career in education. After working her way through college, Lourdes made her American Dream a reality when she became a fulltime teacher at Gesu 
Catholic School in downtown Miami. Throughout the years, Lourdes has taught at multiple schools and has earned many awards and deserved recognition. As a former Florida certified teacher, I recognize Lourdes’ dedication, and I thank her for all that she has done for the students in south Florida throughout her impressive career. Congratulations to Lourdes. 
Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize teen philanthropist Joshua Williams of south Florida and the foundation that wears his heart on its sleeve—Joshua’s Heart Foundation. In 10 years of service to underserved communities in south Florida, Jamaica, Africa, and India, Joshua’s Heart Foundation has activated over 7,000 youths to collect and distribute food and personal items that have helped 600,000 families in need. With the help of his supportive mom, Claudia, Joshua began laying the foundation for Joshua’s Heart’s success when he was only 4
1⁄2years of age. New JHF chapters are springing up all over the country, and I encourage everyone to check out the amazing work that Joshua’s Heart Foundation is doing every day and to get involved in a charity or with a volunteer organization that represents your own vision for the world in which you would like to live. Congratulations to Joshua’s Heart Foundation for a decade of service. 
Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the air traffic control at Miami International Airport, which is an area that I am so proud to represent. This upcoming Thursday, May 19, the Federal Aviation Administration and the MiamiDade Aviation Department will celebrate this accomplishment and honor the men and women who keep our skies and our airports safe. Working around the clock, the air traffic controllers direct aircraft and minimize potential troubles in the sky, like the ones that come from severe weather patterns. I am very proud to know so many of these diligent workers—individuals like Mitch Herrick, Jim Marinitti, Bill Kisseadoo, and many others—who, in their professionalism, keep order in the airspace and protect our public. Mr. Speaker, rerouting aircraft to avoid congestion and minimize delays is not an easy task, especially at one of our Nation’s busiest airports; but it is because of the controllers’ dedication and commitment that we can feel safe in arriving at our destinations. Congratulations to my friends—all of the air traffic controllers at Miami International Airport. 
PORTER RANCH GAS LEAK The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. SHERMAN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to report to this Congress on the Porter Ranch gas leak, the largest methane leak in the history of our country. It began last October 23, and it lasted for, roughly, 5 months. The amount of natural gas that escaped is measured in billions of cubic feet. Some 8,000 families were evacuated for months. Our family, because we live just about as close as anyone to the leaking well, chose not to evacuate but, rather, to rely on filtration systems and the fact that we spend much of our time in Washington. So how should Congress respond? We must say never again—not again in Porter Ranch, not again anywhere in this country—but it could happen again because this natural gas storage facility was the fifth largest in the country. That means there are four other areas that could have an even larger natural gas leak. There are no Federal regulations for the safe storage of natural gas, and State regulations are so minimal that they are incredibly minimal even in famously green California. Currently, PHMSA, an agency of the Department of Transportation, acknowledges that it has the authority to write Federal regulations. They have decided to do so, and my hope is that they will have them this fall. This arises, in large part, because I had a chance to discuss this with the President of the United States back in January in front of about 80 or 100 of our colleagues, and he made a commitment that his administration would work to make sure this never happens again. Not only is PHMSA working on the regulations, but the OMB has assured me that they will act promptly on approving those regulations once they are finalized. We in Congress are working on legislation that is designed to prod PHMSA into acting quickly, but it is important that we not pass legislation that actually narrows the existing statutory power or gives sentences in statutory provisions that could be used by the oil and gas industry to invalidate tough regulations. That is why it is critical, for example, that any statute we pass, as the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee’s product provides, states explicitly that we are not preempting higher, tougher State regulations and that the action taken in Congress will not make people less safe than their States would have them be. Two issues confront SoCalGas, which is the utility that is responsible for this leak. The first is that they are going to try to get consumers to pay for the cost of their negligence, using the phrase that they should pass through to consumers the ‘‘reasonable cost’’ of dealing with this disaster; so the consumers around Los Angeles should pay for the cost of providing relocation assistance to 8,000 families, many of whom have been out of their homes for 5 months and longer; the ‘‘reasonable costs’’ of plugging the leak should be passed through to consumers. The reasonable costs of repairing unreasonable negligence is never an ordinary and necessary expense to be passed through to consumers. This leak resulted from SoCalGas’ negligence. There was a subsurface safety valve on the well in question that was installed in the 1950s, that was removed by SoCalGas in the 1970s, and was never replaced. This well they used to inject and remove natural gas, not through the piping that was intended or the tubing that was intended for that purpose, but through the casing that was never intended for that purpose; and the pressure, which is the amount of gas crammed into the field, seems to be inconsistent with the age of the wells—some going back 60years plus—that were being used to inject and withdraw the natural gas. The costs of this event must not be passed through to the consumers of Los Angeles. Second, realizing they may have to bear the costs themselves, SoCalGas has decided to shortchange the residents who have evacuated. They have decided they don’t want to pay for the required cleaning protocol that is necessary to make homes safe. That is in their release of just a couple of days ago. That is outrageous. The cleaning is necessary to make the homes safe. LA County Public Health says so, and SoCalGas should pay that cost, too. 
CONGRESSIONAL ART COMPETITION The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. MOONEY ) for 5 minutes. Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, each spring, a nationwide high school visual arts competition is sponsored by the Congressional Institute and Members of the U.S. House of Representatives. Since the art competition was created in 1982, over 650,000 entries have been submitted. The Congressional Art Competition is an opportunity to recognize and encourage the artistic talent of our Nation’s bright and talented youth. The winner of this prestigious award in each congressional district will have his or her artwork hung on display for 1 year in the Cannon Tunnel of the U.S. Capitol. I rise today to recognize the artistic ability of a young woman from the Second Congressional District in West Virginia—Kayla Barbazette from Capital High School in Charleston. Ms. Barbazette is the winner of the 2016 Second Congressional District of West Virginia’s Congressional Art Competition. Congratulations, Kayla. Her entry, ‘‘Human Water Basin,’’ was chosen from dozens of outstanding entries this year. 
b1045 The competition was open to all high school students in the Second Congressional District of West Virginia. Kayla is pictured here receiving her first place prize with West Virginia Cabinet Secretary Kay Goodwin of the Department of Education and the Arts. I thank all of the impressive artists for allowing us to celebrate their talents. I wish them all the best in their future endeavors. 
b1200 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker at noon. 
PRAYER Rabbi Jay Weinstein, Young Israel of East Brunswick, East Brunswick, New Jersey, offered the following prayer: Our God in heaven, please grant Your blessing upon our Nation’s leaders, our President, Vice President, Members of Congress, and all our officers of government. Grant them courage and wisdom, sensitivity and compassion, as they respond to the needs of our diverse population. Allow them to bring to fruition the hopes and visions, dreams, and goals upon which this country was founded. Merciful God, we express our deep gratitude for this magnificent country, a home built upon the values of peace, religious tolerance, and respect. Protect our courageous military forces, who are spread throughout the world. Quickly return them to their family’s warm embrace. Guard and shield the members of our country’s police force, fire department, emergency personnel, and all those who risk their lives to protect us from harm. Almighty God, who makes peace in Heaven, from this glorious House of Representatives, our seat of democracy, we ask that You bless our world with peace, safety, and prosperity, so we may fulfill our sacred responsibility of making the world a better place. And let us respond amen. 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. LAMBORN ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. LAMBORN led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. WELCOMING RABBI JAY WEINSTEIN The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. GRAHAM ) is recognized for 1 minute. There was no objection. Ms. GRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to thank Rabbi Jay Weinstein for delivering this morning’s invocation. Rabbi Weinstein is a native of Miami Beach, Florida. He received his ordination from Yeshiva University. He is now rabbi at Young Israel of East Brunswick, New Jersey, which serves more than 220 families. I also want to recognize Rabbi Weinstein’s parents, Stanley and Lenore, his wife, Sharon, and his four wonderful children, one of whom, Ora, is here with me on the floor today. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to live in a Nation where we open our doors and our hearts to invite leaders of all different faiths to offer a blessing. I am very thankful to Rabbi Weinstein for offering such an incredibly meaningful prayer this morning. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, in my district in the North Country of New York, brave law enforcement officers dedicate their careers and risk their lives each and every day to keep our communities safe. We are grateful for the outstanding service from men and women like Sergeant Jay Cook of the New York State Police, whose courageous actions put an end to the manhunt for the killers who escaped Clinton Correctional Facility last year. Sadly, far too many of these brave men and women have lost their lives in the line of duty. Each year communities across our Nation gather to honor in recognition of these heroes and tens of thousands of law enforcement officers descend on our Nation’s capital to honor the fallen. Mr. Speaker, in commemoration of National Police Week, I rise today to thank our law enforcement officers for their service and to honor the brave men and women who have paid the ultimate sacrifice. 
NABISCO BAKERY (Mr. LIPINSKI asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the hardworking men and women at the Nabisco Bakery 
on the southwest side of Chicago, once touted as the world’s largest bakery. These workers have faced daunting challenges in the past year as their plant was downsized and hundreds lost their jobs. Now they are working without a contract and face the prospect of losing their current pension plan. For more than half a century, workers at this bakery have proudly made Oreos, Chips Ahoy, Ritz crackers, and other iconic products. Generations of families have been employed here and contributed to the local economy. What is happening now is even more disappointing because taxpayers have previously provided $90 million to Nabisco in return for a commitment to expand and hire locally. The continued lack of a negotiated agreement reflects the plight of middle class Americans across the country, with workers facing eroding wages and benefits along with job insecurity. Mr. Speaker, I urge Mondelez to do right by its employees, use its profits to reinvest in its American workforce, and grow goodpaying jobs in Chicago and across the Nation. 
PRESIDENT NOT CORRECT (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, over the weekend, Iran held another governmentsponsored Holocaust cartoon contest in the capital of Tehran. Their denial of the mass slaughter endured by millions of men, women, and children during the Holocaust is yet another example of this theocratic regime’s irrational and counterproductive conduct which hurts the citizens of Iran. As he announced the dangerous Iran deal, the President claimed that it would help Iran become a more moderate regime, one that respects our allies. The President was not correct. This is a nation that continually denies the genocide of the Holocaust, is a state sponsor of terrorism, tests missile development, and chants ‘‘Death to America,’’ ‘‘Death to Israel.’’ Sadly, the President continues to put faith in this dangerous regime. I am grateful that, under the leadership of Chairman EDROYCE on the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, we are putting forth legislation to deny Iran access to the U.S. dollar if they continue to promote terrorism to threaten American families with mass murder. In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may the President by his actions never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. 
RECOGNIZING NAHLA KAYALI (Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Nahla Kayali. She is the founder and the executive director of Access California Services. Access, as we call it, is a nonprofit organization in my hometown of Anaheim, California, that serves the Arab American, refugee, and immigrant communities with culturally appropriate services, including English as a second language, health and human services, employment assistance, and citizenship resources. In 1998, she opened a small office and had two clients the first month. She initially helped people sign up for the California Healthy Families program. With only a high school diploma, Nahla has now expanded Access California to serve over 11,000 Arab American, refugee, and other underserved community members in 16 different languages. She works to foster a better understanding of the cultural needs of the Arab American community, and, quite honestly, she is a living example of what is the American Dream. As we celebrated last month Arab American Heritage Month, I wanted to honor and recognize her accomplishments, the accomplishments of Nahla Kayali, and her continued work in supporting the Arab American communities and helping, in particular, refugees resettle and become contributing citizens and leaders in Orange County. f 
OFFICER DOUG BARNEY (Mrs. LOVE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Mrs. LOVE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor National Police Week. We owe a great deal of gratitude to the men and women who serve our communities by putting their lives on the line every day. Utah has lost 139 police officers since 1853, most recently, Officer Doug Barney of Salt Lake County Unified Police Department. Officer Barney died in the line of duty on January 17. Officer Barney was a dedicated 18 year veteran police officer, and loved every moment of his distinguished career. His kindness deeply touched the families and the community and sometimes even the people he arrested. He was known for his humor and compassion as well as his toughness. Ten thousand people attended his funeral. The State of Utah is truly a kinder serviceoriented place because of police officers like Doug Barney. I am honored to recognize all of them here in the House of Representatives. 
NETWORKS IGNORE COURT BLOW TO OBAMACARE (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, recently a U.S. District Court judge ruled that the administration’s subsidy funding scheme for ObamaCare was unconstitutional. This marked a major victory in citizens’ efforts to stop the President’s failed healthcare law. However, the ruling was ignored by all three major news networks, leaving many Americans in the dark on the latest development involving ObamaCare. Last year it was revealed that ObamaCare created or hiked at least 13 different taxes. However, all three major networks also largely ignored this increased burden on taxpayers. It is no wonder that only 6 percent of Americans trust the media to give them balanced news. Americans deserve all of the facts about the President’s failed healthcare law. The liberal national media should not ignore important information just because it conflicts with their political agenda. f 
HONORING LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS (Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, this week is National Police Week, a time to thank and remember those law enforcement officers who have paid the ultimate price, officers like Deputy Carl Koontz of the Howard County Sheriff’s Department in Indiana. Deputy Koontz was killed in March while serving a warrant well after his shift had ended. He, like so many members of our law enforcement community, showed dedication and commitment to his duties despite the risks. As a former deputy mayor of Indianapolis and a former U.S. attorney, I have witnessed firsthand the challenges faced by our law enforcement officers and their remarkable families. But, even more importantly, I saw again and again men and women in law enforcement display courage in the face of adversity, compassion in the face of hardship, and an unending commitment to serve the communities in which they live. Today I salute the men and women in uniform who every day unfailingly honor the call to serve and protect. This week we must also renew our daily commitment to support our heroic men and women in blue. Our thanks and prayers are with them and their families this week and every week. 
SOVEREIGNTY (Mr. LAMBORN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, national sovereignty is one of the most basic and fundamental principles of international law. Countries differ in their history, culture, aims, locations, and challenges. These factors work to shape the laws that govern that nation. 
Without understanding and respecting these fundamental principles of sovereignty, nationstates would have their territorial integrity infringed upon, be subordinated to outside imposed actions, or come under threat from other hostile forces. That is why I cofounded the House Sovereignty Caucus here in Congress. We must never forget that the supreme law of the land is the U.S. Constitution, Federal laws made pursuant to the Constitution and treaties made under the Constitution’s authority. Upholding this supreme law is what makes America great. Threats to U.S. sovereignty are being attempted every day. We must stay on guard against them, both from without and from within. We must uphold the supreme law of the land. If we divert from this law, we will lose our sovereignty and our freedom. 
b1215 RECOGNIZING COACH JERRY CLAY (Mr. WESTERMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize 43 years of service to young men in Garland County, Arkansas, by Coach Jerry Clay, whose 269 wins as head coach at Fountain Lake High School and Lake Hamilton High School are sixth alltime on the list of most wins in Arkansas high school football. Good coaches have the ability to teach their players to win consistently on the field. Great coaches teach their players to be winners in life. Jerry Clay is a great coach. Not only has he coached 14 conference championships and had teams compete in six State championships—winning two—many young men he coached have gone on to excel in virtually all areas of society, from doctors, to businessmen, to true American heroes like SEAL Team 6 operator Adam Brown, whose life story was chronicled in the bestseller book, ‘‘Fearless.’’ I will forever be grateful for the investment Jerry Clay made in my life as my coach, and I wish him many happy years in retirement. 
HONORING NATIONAL POLICE WEEK AND NATIONAL EMS WEEK (Mr. ZELDIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, this is National Police Week and National EMS Week, which is when we pause to reflect and honor the service and sacrifice of the brave men and women who have lost their lives in the line of duty while serving to protect us. We also pay our respects to all who continue to serve us today. All lives matter. These men and women risk their lives for the safety and security of communities all throughout our country. With the terrorist acts in Paris, Belgium, and around the world, we are constantly reminded of how dangerous this world can be. When these attacks occur, they are the ones who run head on into the mayhem and chaos without fear to do everything in their power to save as many people as they can. Unfortunately, today we are witnessing the shameful targeting of our first responders and police officers. Their authority is constantly being questioned, making an already difficult job even more dangerous. It seems we cannot go a day without hearing on the news that police officers have been shot or even killed in trying to do their jobs. We must unite around our police officers and first responders and support them just as they support us each and every day. f 
TIME FOR COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM (Mr. POLIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, my friends, the time for immigration reform is now so as to increase our economic growth, creating good jobs for Americans; to reduce our budget deficit by over $200 billion; to improve our national security so we know who is here and what they are doing; to make sure that people who are here legally have the ability to get jobs and so that we have the ability to screen out people who are violating our laws; to restore the rule of law; to secure our border; to unite families so we don’t tear American children from their immigrant parents. For all of these reasons and more, it is time for this body to act. Only Congress can pass comprehensive immigration reform. Only Congress can enforce our laws. Only Congress can ensure that we grow our economy, meet the needs of our labor force, grow jobs for American families, and increase wages, all through comprehensive immigration reform. I call upon my Republican and Democratic friends to stop waiting and to act and to take up comprehensive immigration reform now. 
CENTRE COUNTY VOLUNTEER OF THE YEAR WINNER CHERYL JOHNSON (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise in honor of Cheryl Johnson, a resident of Centre County in Pennsylvania’s Fifth Congressional District, who was recently named Centre County Volunteer of the Year by the county’s Chamber of Business and Industry. For more than 20 years, Cheryl has been the executive director of the Private Industry Council of the Central Corridor, or PICCC, a nonprofit organization which focuses on improving workplace effectiveness and preparing people for either firsttime employment, making career changes, or returning to the workforce. It is estimated that PICCC and its staff impact more than 15,000 people annually in Bedford, Blair, and Centre Counties. During her time with PICCC, Cheryl has dealt with challenges, including the county’s transition from being a manufacturing economy to being one that is more service driven. As evidence to PICCC’s success and the good work of other organizations, the county regularly has the lowest unemployment rate in Pennsylvania. Cheryl’s good work in Centre County extends beyond PICCC, to volunteer efforts with the United Way, Leadership Centre County, and the Juniata Valley Council Boy Scouts of America. She is an essential part of our community, and I congratulate her on earning this recognition which came as a result of her hard work. f 
PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 4909, NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2017 Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 732 and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. RIBBLE ). The gentleman from Alabama is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. POLIS), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. 
Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Alabama? There was no objection. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 732 provides for the consideration of H.R. 4909, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017. Mr. Speaker, this is the most important thing this House will do this year as it has been the most important thing this House has done for 54 straight years—setting the policy for defending the American people. The resolution provides for a structured rule and makes in order 61 amendments. This is the first of the two rules the House will consider on the NDAA. The Committee on Rules is continuing to work through the over 375 submitted amendments, and it will be making more amendments in order at this afternoon’s meeting. As a member of the House Committee on Armed Services, which is the jurisdictional committee for this bill, I, like many others, have spent substantial time in working through this year’s NDAA. A lot of work has gone into the bill to get us to this point, and I want to recognize the work of Chairman MACTHORNBERRY , of Ranking Member ADAM SMITH, and of each of the subcommittee chairmen and ranking members. We should also recognize the very capable Committee on Armed Services staff who has devoted so much time to this legislation. This process, as in years past, has been truly bipartisan. The bill passed out of the committee by a vote of 60–2. It is my sincere hope that this bipartisan nature will continue here on the House floor as we consider the most important thing we will do all year. Providing for the common defense is the most important function of the Federal Government, and it is one we all take very seriously. There are many different threats and challenges around the globe, and we and the servicemen and women who protect us need to be ready for each of those threats; so you will be hearing a lot about readiness over the next couple of days as we consider this bill because just having a soldier or an airman or a sailor is not enough—they have to be ready to do the job that we assign to them. Readiness means that they have been trained appropriately, that they have the equipment they need, and that they have the support they need to carry out their vital role. Look around the world as we sit here today: North Korea is threatening us with nuclear weapons. They say they have miniaturized the nuclear weapon. They have the missile technology not only to shoot it from land, but to launch it from submarines. China, every day, is pushing out further and further with these artificial islands in the South China Sea, claiming, virtually, the entire South China Sea as theirs that they can control and against the claims of other countries in the region—a part of the world where over $5 trillion in trade moves to and fro, which is something that has a direct impact on the wellbeing of the American people. Look at what is happening in Europe. Russia has taken the Crimea. They are involved in actions in the eastern part of Ukraine today. They threaten NATO allies—countries with which we have an Article V obligation to defend if any country attacks them—and Russia is threatening those countries today. Then in the Middle East, as many of us know, we have a resurgent Iran. After the deal that the President struck with Iran last year, Iran now has access to tens of billions of dollars. As the major state supporter of terrorism in the world, they are using that money to fund terrorist groups like Hezbollah and Hamas, which cause so much havoc and destruction and death. We have this terrible situation in Syria, a continually bad situation in Iraq, failed states in Yemen and Libya. Our military—our defense forces—are called upon to address all of those—to protect us, to protect the American people. That is why getting this bill right is so important. That is why taking it seriously is so important. Whether it is fighting terrorism in Iraq or in Afghanistan, deterring Russian aggression in Europe, or projecting force in the Pacific, our military has their hands full, and this bill is critical to ensuring that they are ready for what is coming to them and to us. Let us make sure we understand. Experts far beyond my background have said that the United States has never faced this level—this complexity—of threat to our national security since the end of World War II. This bill is also an important oversight tool for Congress as we work to ensure accountability, efficiency, and effectiveness from our Nation’s military. The NDAA authorizes spending at a level of $574 billion for national defense base requirements and an additional $36 billion for overseas contingency operations. This matches the total funding level of $610 billion that was requested by President Obama. These spending levels are needed to make critical investments that will begin to restore our military readiness. It seems like every day a new and alarming report comes out about the dire situation our military is in: planes can’t fly due to deferred repairs; troops aren’t adequately trained; there is a lack of naval vessels in critical theaters. These stories have begun the sad reality for our military in recent years, and we are putting the lives of our servicemembers at risk. b1230 To be clear, none of these are the fault of our servicemembers who continue to rise to the challenge and do more with less. But we, as a Congress, have to fix this problem. The NDAA will put us back on track by strengthening our commitment to our military men and women. It fully funds the 2.1 percent pay raise for our troops and restores funding for training and maintenance programs, while also helping rebuild crumbling facilities. The bill is also reform oriented. You are going to hear a lot about reform over these next 2 days. It includes long needed reforms to the acquisition process and the Uniform Code of Military Justice, as well as boosting healthcare programs to ensure high quality and access to care. All told, there are five components of reform in this bill. I also want to briefly touch on a few issues up front that I know my colleagues will likely bring up. First, this rule selfexecutes an amendment by Chairman SESSIONS of the Rules Committee that would strike a provision of the bill relating to women and Selective Service. This is an issue that the Armed Services Committee has not debated. No hearings have been held. It was added 
to the NDAA by an amendment in the dead of night. This rule removes that provision and allows Congress to properly study the issue. Wherever you stand on the issue of including women in the draft, the American people should have the benefit of a full hearing, a full consideration of that issue. Jamming this thing into this bill and considering it without going through that is not right for the American people, whichever side they stand on. Making that the way this bill stands today is the right thing to do before we make a substantial change. I also know the President has some concerns about the way this year’s NDAA funds our military. The bill funds the overseas contingency operation until April 2017, when a new President will have time to assess the security situation, and then they could submit a supplemental budget request based on their priorities. This is common for the first year of a new administration. Indeed, in 2008, thenSenator Barack Obama, thenSenator John Kerry, and thenSenator JOE BIDEN all supported a similar strategy. So I find it very odd that they now oppose that same strategy. The bottom line is that this bill adequately funds our military while meeting critical needs for military readiness and supporting overseas operations. Let’s not let politics get in the way here. There is enough political theater taking place in the Presidential election. On this issue, this critical issue of national security, let’s come together as Democrats and Republicans and show the American people that we can work together on behalf of our military and our national defense. I urge my colleague to support House Resolution 732 and the underlying bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30 minutes. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the rule providing for general debate on H.R. 4909, the NDAA, or National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017. For 54 straight years, the United States Congress has come together in a bipartisan fashion to craft policies and recommendations for the United States Armed Forces and to put these into law. As has been indicated, of course, this is one of the most consequential and substantial items that we have. It is one of our responsibilities here in the United States Congress. Personally, I have found objections to some of the policies in the bill. Of course, I commend the work of the men and women on the Armed Services Committee on this legislation. I am going to highlight some of the problems that exist and why many of us on both sides of the aisle will likely be opposing the legislation. Many of my colleagues on the Armed Services Committee currently serve or have served in the Armed Forces. They are dedicated public servants, and they have worked hard on this bill. Of course, the bill includes the rest of us as well. Over 375 amendments have been offered to improve this bill. The Rules Committee will be meeting this afternoon to determine how many of those we make in order, and I hope that the Rules Committee makes in order a great number of these amendments. Of course, the first step under this rule is to make a few dozen amendments in order, and we will continue that work in the Rules Committee shortly. Mr. Speaker, for all the hard work that the Armed Services Committee has done, what we have before us this week is, unfortunately, an argument that needs to be resolved in the Budget Committee. What we have is effectively an accounting trick that drives us deeper into debt and increases the budget deficit to pay for 1 year of increased defense spending. To this point, I object to having this budget debate even in the context of a defense bill. But by disregarding the proper use of what is called the overseas contingency operations account and by flouting the Budget Control Act agreed upon by Republicans and Democrats, unfortunately, this Armed Services bill has been overtaken by a debate on the Federal budget. What we have before us is a bill that will increase the deficit and increase the debt above and beyond the spending levels the Democrats and Republicans agreed to. The freespending Republican Party continues to throw taxpayer dollar after taxpayer dollar. Do they just intend to drive up the debt or do they intend to increase your taxes? When we increase our deficit, it means increased taxes. Effectively, this Republican bill is a tax increase on future American families, like my kids. So this week we see a debate about the inability of the Republicans to pass a budget or adhere to a budget when they do agree to one. If the debate over our armed services was not such a serious topic, I would say that this was a very clever, elaborate budget scheme. And it is clever. It is far too clever, more so than the traditional budget gimmicks that we have been presented with. I am going to explain to you exactly what this taxandspend Republican plan is. The bill authorizes $540 billion in discretionary base budget authority that includes $523 billion for the DOD and $19.5 billion for the Department of Energy’s defense work. But since the United States has been embroiled in conflict abroad since 2001, several administrations have requested and Congress has always granted another pot of money known as the overseas contingency fund. This year the bill provides $59 billion for what we call overseas contingency. Now, together with the $543 billion base, plus the $59 million in overseas contingency, that equals the President’s budget request. Now, as a reminder, the Republicans haven’t actually produced a budget this year; so, it is hard to make a comparison. All we can do is compare it to the President’s budget because there is no House budget and there is no Republican budget. We haven’t even seen one to be able to act on it or have a debate. Traditionally, we bring before the body several budgets and whichever one gets the most votes is the budget of the House. There are usually several budgets from the Democratic side, several budgets from the Republican side. In years past, there have even been bipartisan budgets which I have been honored to support. This year, however, Republicans are not even allowing the House of Representatives to consider, no less pass, a budget. So what the NDAA does is it takes this overseas contingency account, which many consider to be a slush fund for Pentagon operations, and it takes $18 billion of that to pay for base operations. Some of that $18 billion goes to fund the Pentagon’s unfunded priorities or what we might call their wish list or items that they couldn’t fit into the agreedupon budget control number of $543 billion. So this busts through the deficit, increases the debt. It is a Republican plan to tax and spend, tax and spend, tax and spend, like they always do through accounting tricks that they are doing right here in the defense budget. So the Pentagon gets more of the bigticket items they want. Taxpayers are left paying the bill to the detriment of our economy, to the detriment of job creation, so that our own kids have to pay future taxes, putting our Nation deeper and deeper in debt, which I should point out to my friends is a national security issue. When we are economically beholden to other nations like China or Saudi Arabia, that is as great, if not greater, a national security threat than the one we combat with the tanks and Armed Forces that this bill seeks to authorize. So it is very important to take that into account. If we look at what are the reasons that we defeated the Soviet Union during the cold war, they overinvested in their defense relative to their GDP, which effectively hurt their economy and made their economic model unsustainable because they were allocating too much to defense to try to keep up with where we were. If we mortgage our future to the Chinese and Saudi Arabians, how are we increasing our security, Mr. Speaker? In fact, we are decreasing our security to fund current consumption for 1 year at the price of mortgaging our future to foreign adversaries. By stealing $18 billion from the overseas contingency account, the NDAA guarantees that we run out of money 
for overseas operations sometime in April 2017. And, of course, this Congress would never let money run out for operations against ISIS and Afghanistan and elsewhere. So, of course, when it comes down to it, this bill will come before Congress in April and Congress will make sure that we have the money we need to fight ISIS because they looted from this bill the money that was designed to fight ISIS to pay for items on the Pentagon’s wish list. So that is what is happening here. Rather than appropriating money to combat ISIS and Afghanistan and other countries for the full year, they are just doing it for a few months. They are taking some of that money, putting it into the base, mortgaging our future, putting burdens on taxpayers, and making us economically at risk of being dominated by the countries that we continue to borrow from. Look, that is why the Secretary of Defense and that is why the President of the United States, the Commander in Chief, are completely against this way of budgeting. It is fiscally irresponsible. As the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee testified at the Rules Committee yesterday, this old gimmick probably violates the bipartisan Budget Control Act. When you do that, that is where the budget debate gets going. Congress has set limits on how much we can spend on defense versus nondefense. So when we run out of money next year under this NDAA plan, we are going to be forced to spend more. I mean, who before us is not going to spend the money we need to combat ISIS? Of course Congress will spend more. This is a plan to set up Congress to spend more. Of course, Congress will spend more regardless of who controls Congress. That is why budgets matter. That is why this arcane and esoteric gimmick in this bill matters. It is why we should have these debates in the Budget Committee. It is why this Congress should pass a budget. It is why we should let the national defense bill be about defense rather than mortgaging our future. Look, if it wasn’t enough to have this budget smokeandmirrors debate in the defense bill, this year’s NDAA also has a debate about whether we should let taxpayer dollars subsidize discrimination and whether we should encourage corporate misconduct. Mr. Speaker, I am not going to dwell long on the subsidization of discrimination and encouraging corporate misconduct, but I can’t fathom why there would be a place in this bill about national defense for provisions that allow Federal contractors to discriminate against LGBT employees. That is unacceptable, bizarre, and contrary to meeting the security needs of our Nation. Also included in this bill is an exemption from the President’s Fair Pay and Safe Workplace Executive Order. The place to debate that is in another committee I serve on, the Education and the Workforce Committee, not the national defense bill. Those need to be removed. Of course, this bill also strikes the Selective Service registration for women. The committee mark included women in Selective Service. Personally, I cosponsor a bill with Representative MIKECOFFMAN to eliminate Selective Service that would save money. And, of course, in my entire lifetime, there has not been a draft. If we are going to have a Selective Service system, of course, it needs to include women. Women serve in every single combat role. It needs to include everybody so we can mobilize manpower and womanpower most effectively. But, unfortunately, that has been stripped out of this bill. I believe we should take a hard look at doing away with Selective Service entirely. Of course, at the very least, we should include both men and women at the age of 18. To move forward without any real debate on this issue and to strike that section without meaningful floor debate is bad policy, bad procedure. It is an offense to the committee which put it into the bill and yet another reason I plan on opposing the bill. There are other pieces of this bill which I and many Democrats and Republicans object to. There is a lot of time to go into those, which I will do depending on how many speakers we have. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I was listening very carefully to my colleague, and I heard him talk about what is being proposed in this bill as being accounting tricks and cover. I am going to repeat again that what this bill is doing is exactly what then Senator Obama, thenSenator Kerry, thenSenator BIDEN voted for in 2008. There is nothing new here. We are going into another President, and we are giving that President an opportunity to take a look at the situation and come back to us and tell us what they want. He said that this will drive up the deficit. It only drives up the deficit if we are not willing to work together to cut in other places because national defense is more important than anything else we do. If we don’t want to drive up the deficit—and I sure don’t want to drive up the deficit—let’s talk about some serious cuts to other parts of the budget that aren’t nearly as important as national defense. He called the overseas contingency account a slush fund. It is a fund directly requested by President Obama. It was requested by the President before him. It is something we have done for a while. It is adequately accounted for. There is plenty of oversight over it. So it is not a slush fund at all. The gentleman from Colorado said that we should be careful about overinvesting as the Russians did relative to GDP. If you look at what the defense spending is as a percentage of the American GDP, for the last several years it has gone down. It is so much lower than it was even just a few years ago. In fact, we now know it is dangerously low because of what our adversaries—Russia, China, et cetera— are doing. b1245 He talked about that this bill somehow encourages corporate misconduct. This bill has more reforms in it than we have seen in years that are going to require more and more people to toe the line, as they should when we are spending the taxpayers’ money. He said that there is something in this bill that might have something to do with LGBT discrimination. No, sir. Mr. Speaker, what is in this bill, what is going to be proposed for this bill, is something that gets to people’s religious freedom. We don’t treat religious freedom seriously enough in this body. We act as if it is somehow now a secondary right. Well, it is a primary right. It has always been a primary right, and we should always stand up for it in this body. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. LAMBORN ). Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Alabama for his good work on this rule and on this bill. I want to talk about the critical part of the bill and an amendment that was proposed and then withdrawn, and that has to do with Iran’s heavy water production. The reason this amendment was withdrawn and won’t be under consideration in the Committee on Rules for discussion later today is because it deserves to have standalone treatment. It is that important. Heavy water is used to produce weaponsgrade plutonium. Its distinctive properties make it a critical component in the production of nuclear weapons. Now, the nuclear deal that some of the Senators voted for—not by two thirds by any means—forbids Iran from stockpiling more than 130 tons of heavy water during the initial years of the deal, and they will be allowed to produce 90 tons later. But they are required, under the deal, to redesign and rebuild their Arak facility to support its ‘‘peaceful’’ needs and research. So Iran did agree to keep pace with international technological advancement trends and rely only on light water, not heavy water, for future nuclear power, yet they have been producing heavy water nevertheless. The Wall Street Journal has exposed the proposed purchase of Iran’s overproduced heavy water, stating that the administration is encouraging ‘‘Tehran to stick to the nuclear agreement reached last year.’’ So apparently the administration is seeking to entice others to purchase 
Iran’s overproduced heavy water by making the first purchase. U.S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz said: ‘‘That will be a statement to the world: ‘You want to buy heavy water from Iran, you can buy heavy water from Iran. It’s been done. Even the United States did it.’’’ So we are enabling Iran to violate the terms of the deal, and we are going out and buying this, using taxpayer dollars nevertheless. Now, if the Iranians cannot or simply will not keep the deal, we have to come up with a better deal, not bail them out of aspects of the deal that they don’t want to comply with. So this proposed purchase by the administration violates the intention of the deal and the will of the American people. We can’t let this administration or the speech writer Ben Rhodes or their fabricated echo chamber deceive us any longer. By the way, this speech writer, Ben Rhodes, admitted in a New York Times article published just the other day that they took things they knew not to be true and misled the American people on purpose to get the deal passed. We must not authorize funds to purchase heavy water from Iran. Because this issue is so important, I will work with leadership to make sure that we consider this later as standalone legislation. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. TSONGAS ). Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak against this rule that repeals a provision that was added to the NDAA, the National Defense Authorization Act, after a bipartisan, recorded vote in committee which expands the Selective Service System to include women. That provision was in line with the Secretary of Defense’s decision to eliminate the ban on women serving in direct ground combat positions and the recognition that women are much needed across all aspects of military capability. This rule precludes Congress from having an open and transparent debate about this very important issue that impacts women’s equality. If we want a full hearing, is there no better place than on the floor of this House? This rule would prevent that. Gender equality is achieved when women and men enjoy the same rights, opportunities, and responsibilities across all sectors of society, including military service, and when the abilities, aspirations, and talents of women and men are equally valued. Including women in the draft is a step toward that equality. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. POLIS. I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from Massachusetts. Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Speaker, this position is shared by both Army Chief of Staff Mark Milley and Marine Commandant Robert Neller. I urge my colleagues to reject this rule that denies the current reality of military service, limits gender equality, ignores a bipartisan vote, and does not allow for an open and transparent debate on the floor of the House. Mr. BYRNE. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I completely agree with my colleague who just spoke that, if we are going to do this, we should have a full debate on it. But we should also let the American people be heard. Because of the way this happened in committee, there was no public hearing beforehand. There was no notice to the American people that this was going to be considered. So the most important people we need to hear from on this haven’t been heard from, and they need to be heard from. The way to do that is for us to announce that we are considering this; have full public hearings in committee; and then, after having full public hearings, the committee makes a decision and brings something to this floor for us to debate. But for us to bring up an issue of that magnitude without having gone through the process of letting the American people be truly heard here, that is not appropriate. So while I understand exactly what my colleague just said—I was there for the committee meeting. I know that there was a vote on it. It was a vote after we had no debate in committee, no hearings, no opportunity for the American people to be heard—if we are going to take an issue like this and bring it to the floor of this House, we need to do all of that or we wouldn’t be doing our job. So I respectfully disagree with her. I think the selfexecuting amendment by Chairman SESSIONS is appropriate, and I would urge my colleagues to support that. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. POLIS. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I would say in response to my friend that the committee did a lot of work through the night and voted on a number of issues that Members raised, and many of the items that they voted on were not subject to their own hearings. What we are seeing here is a failure of Speaker RYANto follow through on his pledge for regular order. What is regular order? There is a committee markup of the bill for good or bad. Sometimes the chairman has things in that bill he or she doesn’t want. Other times it is exactly like they want it. That gets reported out to the Committee on Rules, and other Members have a chance to change it. If any Member of this body wanted to remove women from the Selective Service, which was in the HASC markup, they would simply offer an amendment to do so. That is the normal process. There would be debate and there would be a vote. Instead of that process, there is a mysterious selfexecuting amendment in the rule itself; so the rule, itself, controverts the actual bill that the HASC reported out. It actually changes the very bill that the committee worked on without a vote, without debate, and that is the opposite of regular order, the opposite of the process that allows Members to fully debate and vet these issues. This rule actually stifles the debate on this very issue that the HASC weighed in on. It is my understanding it is in the Senate bill, to include women in Selective Service as well. I think it will likely be in any conference report that comes out. But for whatever reason, rather than having the debate and vote on the floor, it is being hidden behind a procedural trick in a selfexecuting rule. I yield 21⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. MOULTON ) to discuss the bill and the rule. Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on important provisions contained within the National Defense Authorization Act. I have said many times that too little attention has been given to a long term political strategy in our fight against ISIL. That is why I worked with colleagues from both sides of the aisle to include an amendment now contained in the bill that requires the administration to develop an integrated political and military strategy to defeat ISIS. Without this strategy, we risk repeating mistakes of the past. We largely defeated al Qaeda in Iraq militarily in 2009 but failed to follow through on the root causes and ensure the success of Iraqi politics going forward. It created a political vacuum that ISIS grew into. We cannot afford to make that mistake again. Second, we should all be able to agree that our military personnel and veterans deserve the best health care in the world. That is why I am proud to report the bill also contains provisions I worked on with several Members to address the increased rates of suicide in our military. Since 2012, suicide has been the leading cause of death in our military. In the past 3 years alone, the suicide rate has been nearly 50 percent greater than in the civilian population. The Department of Defense needs to take an aggressive approach in solving this crisis. My amendment included in the bill would identify trends and instances of suicides and require better proactive and reactive mental health care for active personnel. Finally, I want to call attention to the urgent need to continue the Special Immigrant Visa program for Afghans who worked for U.S. forces. A bipartisan amendment before the Committee on Rules now would remove the unfortunate narrowing of eligibility requirements included in the mark, which would prevent hundreds of Afghans whose lives are at risk because of their work for our country from even being considered for resettlement in the United States. The narrowing of eligibility intentionally excludes hundreds of Afghans who worked for the U.S. State Department, USAID, and U.S. security contractors in a number of capacities, 
many of whom face welldocumented death threats due to their work with our government, regardless of whether that was with frontline troops or on an American base. By narrowing eligibility, the program would erode the expectations of hundreds of Afghan staff whose lives remain in danger because of their work for the U.S. mission and also make it more difficult to hire and retain qualified Afghan staff who are essential to achieving our diplomatic and assistance goals. For that risk and sacrifice, the very least we can do is offer them a chance to stay alive, to keep living, rather than abandoning them to the same enemies they united with us to destroy. Mr. BYRNE. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleague from Massachusetts and all the points that he has made. Indeed, there were a number of bipartisan amendments that were added to the bill during that very long day and night that we spent considering it, which just points out the bipartisan nature of what we are doing here. On the committee, we try to work together to find the right way forward for the defense of America. When colleagues on either side of the aisle offer something that is common sense and we think will work, we work together to make sure it gets in the bill, and that is what he just alluded to. He also alluded to an amendment that he hopes will be added as a result of the Committee on Rules meeting this afternoon. We are going to be considering an awful lot of amendments this afternoon. There are over 60 amendments that we have made in order in this rule, bipartisan amendments, so this is a very strong effort on our part to make sure that this is a bipartisan bill; and as a bipartisan bill, it deserves bipartisan support. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, it is particularly ironic that the gentleman is touting the bipartisan amendments. It is one of those bipartisan amendments that adds women in the Selective Service that is stripped out of the HASC bill, of the committee’s bill right here in this rule, through a selfexecuting amendment. So this rule, if it were to pass—and I hope it doesn’t. I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle vote ‘‘no.’’ This rule undoes one of those very bipartisan amendments that the gentleman is touting. I yield 2
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. WELCH ). Mr. WELCH. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. I thank the Committee on Armed Services for the hard work they did to produce this bill. I am not going to support it. The most important function that we have is to make certain that America is secure. Our defense authorization bill is a major component of that, but I believe this bill fails in some fundamental respects. Number one, the budget is very large. We are approaching $700 billion. But throwing money at a problem does not solve a problem. What we are doing as we throw more money at a problem without making hard decisions is we generate and accept as inevitable an immense amount of inefficiency. Number two, there is an overreliance on the OCO funding. First of all, OCO, off budget, should be debated, and it should be appropriated. It should be subject to all budget caps. But to then begin using it not just for overseas contingency operations but to actually invest in major weapons systems is a gross mistake that is just going to lead to a weaker budgeting system that is essential, in my view, to our national security. b1115 Of that OCO funding, money would be used for weapon systems like the F/A– 18E Super Hornet and the F–35. The $35 billion in the OCO authorization is for war requirements, including dollar amounts in the millions. Now, the other issue with respect to OCO—and another failure in this bill— is we are once again continuing to have military operations—this country is at war—without having any debate on an Authorization for Use of Military Force. That should be part of it. Third, we have significant issues in NATO. As the Speaker and my colleague, the chairman, know, NATO is absolutely essential to our defense. But the time for the United States to be bearing as big a burden for that defense has come to a conclusion. We will bear the majority of the expense, but the commitment on our NATO allies is to reach 2 percent of their gross domestic product in defense spending. If our NATO allies are not doing that, we are asking the American taxpayer to do it. These are mature democracies. They have stable economies. It is about time that we asked for this to absolutely happen. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds. Mr. WELCH. The real fundamental question for us is whether or not in this defense budget we are going to ask what are the fundamental strategic necessities of the United States to be in a strong posture to defend itself. The approach of just throwing more money and maintaining weapons systems that our military is not even asking for, of blinking on the question of personnel review—all of these things are just postponed for another day. They need to be faced today. So, Mr. Speaker, I thank the committee for its work, but I will not be supporting this bill. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from Vermont. He and I and a group of Members of this body met recently with members of the German Bundestag and the Russian Duma to talk about these very issues, and it was a most enlightening trip for all of us. By the way, all of us went as American citizens, as Members of the United States Congress, not as Democrats or Republicans. One of the most troubling things that we learned from that trip is that the Russians continue to invest at a significantly higher level than we are in terms of their increases every year and their military activities. That is why they have been so successful in Ukraine, why they have been so successful recently in Syria. So this bill begins to turn back around so that we are investing properly. If I thought that we were throwing money at the problem, if my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and the Armed Services Committee thought we were just throwing money at the problem, this bill would not have received a 60–2 vote in committee, I can tell you that. The inefficiencies the gentleman talked about we are very concerned about. That is why there is so much reform in this bill. There are five different components that deal with reform. We can’t expect American taxpayers to pay for any part of the government that is inefficient, including our military. He brought up the Authorization for Use of Military Force. We had a big debate about this in committee, and I asked my staff: Why can’t we consider an Authorization for Use of Military Force in our committee? I think we should. I was told and we found out by reading the War Powers Act, a law passed by Congress in 1973, that, under that law, jurisdiction for the Authorization for Use of Military Force is vested in the Foreign Affairs Committee, not in the Armed Services Committee, so we could not consider that when it came before the committee. And then, finally, as to his comments about NATO, I share a lot of his concerns. I think many of us do. There is nothing wrong and everything right with expecting our NATO allies to meet their 2 percent obligation. Most of them are not doing that. I do believe the administration is working with them to get them to that point, but I don’t think we should ever miss an opportunity to keep the heat on them to do that. Ultimately, the defense that we provide over in Europe through NATO is the defense of those countries. So I think it is appropriate that the gentleman brought up that point. I hope the administration will continue to do that, and I hope that we will continue to back any effort that is taken by this administration or the next to do that. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I want to take some time to highlight some of the terrible 
environmental provisions that run counter to our national security imperative to create a more sustainable society that are in this bill or that have been submitted as amendments to this bill. For instance, there has been an amendment that would block implementation of the collaborative Federal land use plans and prevent listing of the sagegrouse under the Endangered Species Act for the next decade. We have had extensive hearings in another committee I serve on, the Natural Resources Committee. This has nothing to do with defense. In fact, we hold up the collaborative Federal land use plan as an example of how to avoid listing this species and, yet, make sure that we can maintain a viable habitat. I think it was a great success. I think it is ridiculous that we are talking about amending a national defense bill to undo something that we have had extensive hearings on in the Natural Resources Committee and is held up by all parties involved as a huge success. In addition, there is going to be an amendment offered to sell off over 800,000 acres of the Desert National Wildlife Refuge in Nevada. It would be transferred to the Air Force, which has not requested a transfer. The Air Force has not requested this land for any military use; yet, there is a bill to impose the management of these lands on the Air Force. It would represent a harmful public land selloff precedent. It is important habitat for desert bighorn sheep, mule deer, mountain lions, and other wildlife. As we mentioned, the Air Force has not requested the stewardship of these lands. Of course, it would put a costly new burden on the Air Force to the detriment of our national security. In addition, there are two provisions already in the NDAA that will remove or block Federal endangered species protections for the American burrowing beetle and the lesser prairie chicken. Again, I am happy to have those debates. But what on Earth do they have to do with national defense, and why are they in the committee bill? Section 2866 would block ESA protections for the lesser prairie chicken for 6 years and then impose arbitrary restrictions on whether the Secretary of the Interior can relist the lesser prairie chicken, regardless of its biological status, even if there is only a handful left or it is nearing extinction. Section 2866 would also immediately and permanently remove the burrowing beetle for protection under the Endangered Species Act and prevent it from receiving any protections in the future. Our biodiversity is a source of strength. To somehow have a backdoor attempt—if you can’t get these things through the proper regular order of the Natural Resources Committee, to somehow say that the burrowing beetle has something to do with national defense is a great stretch of our rules of germaneness that we have here in the body of this House. More perilously, more dangerously, there is language in the House NDAA bill that is a repeal of section 526 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The purpose of this law is to reduce the Department of Defense’s dependence on oil from hostile regimes of the world. So it is a disparate element of advanced lower carbon fuels to promote energy security. Repealing this provision is something the Department of Defense does not want. It would be unwise for our clean energy future. So this bill actually detracts from the current language in the repeal of section 526. It reduces our energy security as a Nation, renders us to be more reliant on foreign powers for our oil, just as the budgetary tricks in this bill will force us to borrow more from China and Saudi Arabia to spend this year. Finally, there is some damaging language about aquatic invasive species, which, of course, cost billions of dollars annually when we deal with the zebra mussels in lakes in Colorado, damaging shipping, damage to industrial and government facilities. Invasive species cause great irreversible damage to coastal and inland waters, including some in my district. Once a nonnative species invades a lake or river, it is basically impossible to eliminate, as we know. S. 373, the Vessel Incidental Discharge Act, or VIDA, would discard the Clean Waters Act goal of stopping further invasive species and replace it with a law that would instead put ineffective standards for removing invasive species from ships’ ballast water discharges that bear no relation to protection of water quality. So, again, this bill will strip out very important measures that would prevent the dissemination of invasive species. Even in the lakes in my district, including in Grand County, we have had a devastating impact of the zebra mussel invasive species both on local habitat as well as directly on recreational ships and boaters. There is not a direct military aspect to where we are, but, again, this applies to both military and shipping and is a great cost to the American economy when these invasive species threaten us. Again, these are issues people may differ on. I am happy to have that debate. In fact, it is a little bit of de´ja`vu. I feel like I have had that debate on the Natural Resources Committee. We have debated many of these same things. But instead of bills being reported out of that committee and coming to the floor, apparently, the NDAA is seen by some as a catchall to attack our environmental safeguards. That is wrong. That actually detracts from our national security. It makes us more reliant on foreign oil. It is the wrong direction for the bill, the wrong direction for national defense. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I wish we didn’t have to deal with environmental issues on the Armed Services Committee, but, unfortunately, we have military bases all across the United States where they are being limited in what they want to do, what they could potentially do, by other Federal agencies that are using their powers to tell our defense folks that they can’t do things that are important to carrying out their military mission. So I heard my colleague, and I know of his service on the Natural Resources Committee and the good work of that committee. But when you have those agencies beginning to impinge on our ability to deliver on national defense, I think that is under the jurisdiction of our committee. We have gotten waivers to be able to take these issues up from those committees, including the Natural Resources Committee. Look, I am not saying the sage grouse or the beetle is not important, but they are not more important than the defense of the United States of America. We have dealt with these issues in a responsible way. I hope and pray that the time will come when we won’t ever have to talk about that in the Armed Services Committee again. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I still remain hard pressed to see how the burrowing beetle or the lesser prairie chicken are somehow a security issue that needs to be addressed in the National Defense Authorization Act. Look, there are a number of other flaws with the bill. It greatly overfunds our nuclear weapons activities, which will cost taxpayers hundreds of billions over the next 10 years. I have offered an amendment to reduce this. This is for a stockpile of weapons that could be greatly reduced and still maintain the capability of destroying the world many times over, however useful that capability may be. I think it should be good enough that we have enough capability to destroy the world three or four times instead of seven times. God forbid, we don’t have enough capabilities to destroy the entire world and wipe out life. This bill does not include, as had been mentioned, an Authorization for Use of Military Force for our ongoing operations in Iraq, Syria, and elsewhere. Despite repeated calls to write an updated authorization, despite the belief of many Members on both sides of the aisle, the current war is illegal. This Congress has taken zero meaningful action to date. We should change that or at least debate changing that this week. As I said before, when you have a national security bill that mortgages our future, makes us more reliant on foreign oil, you wonder at what point you 
should stop calling it a national security bill and start calling it a national insecurity bill. The vision that my constituents have, the vision that I have, for a safe and secure America is not one with bloated budget deficits and borrowing from China and Saudi Arabia. It is not one where we cut off our own renewable energies program so we can rely more on foreign oil. It is not one where we borrow more from our kids’ future and mortgage them. That is not the secure America that we should seek as a United States Congress. These are the kinds of questions that we should be debating in the defense bill. But instead of focusing on these real questions of how to improve our armed services and how to provide for the national defense, the general debate we will see under this rule will dedicate a large portion to debate on the budget and the looting of this overseas contingency fund, which Congress will have to come back and backfill in April, therefore mortgaging our future and increasing our national debt to fund. Instead of actually passing a budget, this Congress is having a backdoor budget debate, debating it now. It is the wrong way to do things. Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule that would shed light on the secret money in politics. The DISCLOSE Act, authored by Mr. VANHOLLEN , would require outside groups to disclose the source of the contributions they are using to fund their campaigns. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the amendment in the RECORD , along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Colorado? There was no objection. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ and defeat the previous question. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the rule with the self executing language which undoes the committee language, in violation of regular order. Vote ‘‘no’’ on the rule. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. b1315 Mr. BYRNE. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate and respect the gentleman from Colorado and his earnestness and all of what he has said today; and I do agree with him that there are many things that we need to debate on this floor and that we will be debating on this floor over the next 2 days. But let’s make sure we don’t lose sight of the central thing we are here to do, and that is to protect and defend the people of the United States. Yes, there are going to be some extraneous issues, issues that we wish we didn’t even have to talk about; but at the end of the day, we are going to come back to that central function, that most important function that we have, and that is defending the people of the United States. Because of things that have happened before today, the readiness of our Armed Forces, the people we charge with the direct responsibility of defending us, the readiness has come down steadily. Planes can’t fly. Armed vehicles can’t drive. Weapons don’t function. We don’t have enough training for our troops. So we have listened to all of the uniformed commanders that have come before our committee and heard the dire circumstances we face all across the national defense of this country, and this bill begins to turn that around. It is not a big enough turnaround. We have got a lot of work to do to get back to where we need to be, but this begins that process of getting our Armed Forces ready in a way that is meaningful and responsible for them but also will create the actual effect of protecting the American people. We have put into this bill very important reforms, reforms that we have been needing to look at for a long time, that will require our military to be more efficient, save taxpayer dollars, but also make them more effective in their jobs. This bill does what we, as a House, are charged with doing, and that is setting responsible policy for defending the United States of America. I hope that everyone, as we debate the amendments and the underlying bill over the next 2 days, will keep central in their mind that that is what this is all about and that we will strive to do this in a bipartisan fashion, as we have done on the Committee on Armed Services and as we have done on the Committee on Rules. This needs to be a bipartisan bill. This needs to be a bipartisan vote. If we really care about this country, if we really care about those men and women in uniform, then it is important for us to understand that we have a bipartisan responsibility to make sure that we provide for them and provide for the defense of the American people. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 732 and the underlying bill. The material previously referred to by Mr. POLIS is as follows: 
In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled ‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ‘‘Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon.’’ Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Republican majority’s agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan. 
Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous question. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. 
MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE A message from the Senate by Ms. Byrd, one of its clerks, announced that the Senate has passed without amendment a bill of the House of the following title: 
H.R. 4957. An act to designate the Federal building located at 99 New York Avenue, N.E., in the District of Columbia as the ‘‘Aries Rios Federal Building’’. f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 897) to amend the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to clarify Congressional intent regarding the regulation of the use of pesticides in or near navigable waters, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 897 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Zika Vector Control Act’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. GIBBS) and the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DEFAZIO) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio. 
Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 897. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Ohio? There was no objection. Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 897, the Zika Vector Control Act. 
This summer, it is evident that the Nation will have to contend with the outbreak of the known Zika virus. Like West Nile virus, it is spread to people primarily through the bite of an infected mosquito. It has been a year since the first alerts of the Zika virus spreading to Brazil were issued. Since then, the virus has been spreading north, and with warmer months approaching, communities in the United States should be given the tools necessary to stop Zika. Many States, counties, and municipalities rely on mosquitospraying programs to protect public health, especially with the threats like Zika, which is particularly harmful to pregnant women. But protecting communities from Zika and other mosquitoborne diseases has become difficult thanks to a burdensome and duplicative Federal regulation that requires more time and money to be spent on compliance rather than protecting the health and safety of the American people. Congress cannot let this bureaucratic nonsense stand in the way of potentially preventing a public health crisis like the spread of the Zika virus. For 60 years, before the Clean Water Act was passed, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, known as FIFRA, regulated the use of pesticides in the United States. Even after the Clean Water Act was implemented, the Environmental Protection Agency believed that FIFRA was the appropriate regulatory authority for pesticides. It was only after the decision by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in the case, National Cotton Council v. EPA, were permits under the Clean Water Act required for pesticide use. This case vacated a 2006 EPA rule that codified their longstanding interpretation that the application of a pesticide for its intended purposes, and in compliance with the requirements of FIFRA, is not a discharge of a pollutant under the Clean Water Act and, therefore, an NPDES permit is not required. To put this in simple terms, the court’s ruling cast aside Congress’ intent in pesticide permits, and added another layer of bureaucracy for entities that work to protect the public health. In vacating the rule, the Sixth Circuit Court simply reversed sensible agency interpretation, and instituted a new Federal policy by judicial decision. In the process, the court undermined the traditional understanding of how the Clean Water Act interacts with other environmental statutes, and expanded the scope of the Clean Water Act regulation further into areas and activities not originally envisioned or intended by Congress, and against longstanding EPA interpretation. As a result of this court decision, EPA has been required to develop and impose a new and expanded NPDES permitting process under the Clean Water Act to cover pesticide use. EPA has estimated that approximately 365,000 pesticide users, including State agencies, cities, counties, and mosquito control districts, water districts, pesticide applicators, farmers, ranchers, forest managers, scientists, and even everyday citizens that perform some of the 5.6 million pesticide applications annually, are affected by the court’s ruling. This substantially increases the number of entities subject to NPDES permitting. With this illadvised court decision, Federal and State agencies are expending vital funds to initiate and maintain Clean Water Act permitting programs governing pesticide applications, and a wide range of public and private pesticide users are now facing increased financial and administrative burdens in order to comply with the new unnecessary permitting process. Despite what the fear mongers suggest, all this expense comes with no additional environmental protection. NPDES compliance costs and fears of potentially ruinous litigation associated with NPDES requirements are forcing States, counties, mosquito control districts, and other pest control programs to reduce their operations and redirect resources in order to comply with the regulatory requirements. We know that routine mosquito prevention programs have been reduced due to the NPDES requirements. Two anecdotal examples: In Orchard City, Colorado, the city council decided to abandon their aerial mosquito spraying due to the new NPDES permits. The Colorado Aerial Applicator Association, which was certified, completely discontinued all aquatic application services due to compliance of either the Colorado or NPDES permits. In Utah, for the last 3 years, an Idahobased NAA operator has been contracted with a homeowner association north of Salt Lake City for treatment of mosquitos. It was not uncommon for him to treat 17,000 acres in one night. The NPDES permit makes it impossible for him to continue his services as he will be liable for noncompliance because the client/decisionmaker did not require any sort of paperwork other than to substantiate that his equipment was calibrated, thereby constituting noncompliance under that Federal permit system. b1330 In 2012, this most likely increased the impact of the recordbreaking outbreak of West Nile virus around the Nation. In response to those West Nile outbreaks, many States and communities were forced to declare public health emergencies, but this was only after the outbreak of the West Nile virus. So what happens here when they have an outbreak, an epidemic of West Nile in their community, they can declare an emergency, and they don’t have to get any permits. They can just go out and spray to attack the epidemic. So let’s do this right and do it under the permitting process, but let’s have a process that works. It is absolutely irresponsible to allow a public health crisis to get to this emergency stage, and then we have the ability to prevent it before removing a simple regulatory barrier. H.R. 897 will enable communities to resume conducting routine preventive mosquito control programs without additional bureaucracy getting in the way. H.R. 897 provides a limited exemption for pesticides regulated by FIFRA and used under its product label—which is, by the way, approved by the EPA. Keep in mind, the pesticides necessary to combat Zika and stop the spread of mosquitos are already appropriately regulated under FIFRA. The red tape and compliance costs of an additional NPDES permit make it more difficult for our applicator sprayers to stop the Zika virus. FIFRA regulation includes human health and environmental safeguards when pesticides are approved, including the rules of label use of a pesticide. Adding an NPDES requirement is redundant and unnecessary. H.R. 897 was drafted very narrowly to address only the Sixth Circuit Court’s decision and gives State and local entities that spray to control mosquito populations the certainty and the ability needed to protect public health. This commonsense legislation even received technical assistance from the EPA to achieve that goal safely and effectively. Well over 100 organizations representing a wide variety of public and private entities and thousands of stakeholders support a legislative resolution of this issue. Just to name a few, these organizes include: the American Mosquito Control Association, the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture, the National Water Resources Association, the American Farm Bureau Federation, the National Farmers Union, the Family Farm Alliance, the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, CropLife America, the Biopesticide Industry Alliance, the Responsible Industry for a Sound Environment, the Agricultural Retailers Association, and the National Agricultural Aviation Association. I want to thank Chairman SHUSTER  for his leadership on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee as well as Chairman CONAWAY of the Ag Committee and Ranking Member COLLIN PETERSON of the Agriculture Committee for their leadership on this important public health issue. This is a responsible, commonsense bill that will help ensure public health officials aren’t fighting Zika with their hands tied behind their back. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support H.R. 897. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
Well, Groundhog Day came a month earlier this Congress. That is how I described this bill 2 years ago, July, because this is the third time that we have considered this bill. Now, we must admit the rationale has changed. Just last week—last week—it was named the Zika Control Act. But before that, it was the Regulatory Burden Removal Act. So the first time it was considered, it was H.R. 1749. That one, the 109th Congress defeated. That was for West Nile virus—whoops. Then H.R. 872, last Congress, Reducing the Regulation Burdens Act, at the request of the American Farm Bureau because of a huge burden; and now just renamed last week, we are going to try and game a very serious thing, which is the potential spread of Zika, for which the Republicans thus far have appropriated zero dollars to help the States—zero. Now we are going to pretend we are doing something here today about Zika. It is not about Zika. Now, this is pretty darn personal for me because the reason we have this rule is because of a huge, massive fish kill in Oregon—a misapplication of pesticide, an aquatic pesticide, into an irrigation canal. We are talking about applications in or near water. People drink water, fish swim in water, and other things are dependent upon water. We are talking about, no, we don’t want to have the EPA watch the pesticide operators who are putting pesticides in or around water. They should not be allowed to do that. Now, 92,000 steelhead died in Oregon, and that was essentially the beginning of this rule. Now they are saying this is horribly burdensome. Well, first off, in my State, my one, little, isolated State, we have 825 miles of rivers that are showing a significant level of pesticides, 10,000 acres of lakes. Nationwide, it is hundreds of thousands of miles, tens of thousands of miles and hundreds of thousands of acres. We haven’t been testing for pesticide residues in water, in drinking water, until very recently. But now we don’t want to do that anymore. We don’t want people to know. Let’s just stop, because this is a horrible burden. Well, actually, not so much. This is controlled at two levels: the EPA and the States. Now, we just heard one anecdote about an aerial applicator in one State that just came up yesterday, unnamed, anecdotal, they suspended operations. Why? Who knows why? We don’t know why. There are no facts behind it. But we should end the whole program nationwide because of one anecdote regarding one applicator who may have been misapplying it in Colorado. We don’t know. So the committee asked the EPA and the States, how many people have complained and have had their operations interrupted? Interesting answer: zero and zero. The 50 States say zero, except we now hear about an anecdote in Colorado, and the EPA says zero. So now we are going to pretend this has something to do with Zika. This has nothing to do with Zika. It has to do with whether or not someone is going to misapply a pesticide that is going to get in your drinking water. Now, we should become kind of sensitive about drinking water after what happened in Michigan, but, nah, we don’t care. Get rid of those stinking regulators. Don’t worry. No one would ever misapply a pesticide. It won’t get in your drinking water and won’t kill fish—even though it clearly did that in Oregon. So this is really a kind of transparent renaming and opportunistic approach to Zika. How about considering a real bill to put some real money to partner with the States to deal with this? By the way, they can spray wherever they want because of a declared emergency, so it is automatically covered. But we are going to pretend that somehow we are going to facilitate the spread of Zika if we don’t wipe out the EPA’s authority to keep pesticides out of our water. This has been defeated twice before. Even though it was creatively renamed in the last week, I would recommend that my colleagues oppose it yet again. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. SCALISE ), the majority whip. Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this Zika Vector Control Act and want to commend Congressman GIBBS for his leadership in bringing this forward as we work here in the House to combat Zika. The House is doing a number of things this week. Number one, we are moving legislation to reprioritize money so that there will be a total of $1.2 billion of moneys allocated to combat Zika. But, in addition, while we are fighting Zika and giving not only Federal, but local agencies the resources they need to combat this terrible disease from spreading, we know, and CDC has told us, that it is spread by mosquitos. Mosquitos are the agents that spread Zika. So here we have got Congressman GIBBS identifying a problem where the EPA is making it harder to actually kill mosquitos. I come from south Louisiana. We have a lot of mosquitos in south Louisiana, and we don’t like them. We actually spray using federally approved pesticides to kill mosquitos where they breed. Where do they breed, Mr. Speaker? They breed by water. They breed by sources of water. So you have got federally approved sprays and pesticides that are used to go and kill the mosquitos so that they can’t spread Zika, and yet the EPA comes in and has a rule that makes it harder and more expensive to actually go kill mosquitos. All that Congressman GIBBS is saying is let’s block that rule because local governments, by the way, still control this. It is our local governments, our parishes and counties, that are doing the spraying. They understand how to comply with their own local laws. They are not going to do anything to jeopardize groundwater, but what they want to do is kill mosquitos so that the mosquitos don’t spread Zika to our constituents. If you look, this legislation actually was passed. It actually was passed in 2011 when we were responding to West Nile. So the House did pass this legislation already, and it was good legislation then. In fact, it got a wide bipartisan vote. All of a sudden, some people want to politicize it. This isn’t a political issue. This is about common sense. Mr. Speaker, the EPA is just putting additional hurdles in place. It is not like they are saying don’t spray these pesticides. They are just jacking up the costs. It is an EPA money grab that makes it more expensive and more difficult to actually go kill mosquitos. So while we are debating whether or not to prioritize more money for Zika—which we are doing, by the way, $1.2 billion worth—shouldn’t we make sure that the money can actually be used to effectively kill the mosquitos that spread Zika? If the EPA has got a rule that makes no sense and makes it harder to kill mosquitos, shouldn’t we remove that rule and that barrier and allow and trust our local governments? There are some people up here who think that Washington knows best, and if your local parish or county knows what they need to do to control the mosquito population in their parish or county, shouldn’t they be able to do it? Or you don’t trust them; you don’t want to give them the ability to go kill mosquitos. Well, I do trust our local governments, and I want to give them the tools that they need to actually go and kill mosquitos at the source where they breed, and that is near sources of water. It is not in a way that contaminates groundwater at all. In fact, EPA still gives these permits out, but it just costs a lot more money to go and kill the mosquitos. So let’s remove that burden so we can kill more mosquitos and stop Zika from spreading. Mr. Speaker, it is a really good, commonsense piece of legislation, and I urge its adoption. Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the horrible burden the gentleman is talking about is a notice of intent which says where and how something was applied. It is virtually cost free. You can use a standardized form. But it is just good to know where we are putting the pesticides and what pesticides are being used in case there are problems like the massive fish kill in Oregon, which we were able to trace back to one misapplication by one private company, not by the local county or any other public entity. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. NAPOLITANO ). 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I do rise in strong opposition to H.R. 897, the Zika Vector Control Act. The Clean Water Act in no way hinders, delays, or prevents the use of approved pesticides for pest control operations. In fact, the Clean Water Act permit provides a specific emergency provision to prevent outbreaks of disease, such as Zika. Under the terms of the permit, pesticide applicators are automatically covered under the permit, and spraying may be performed immediately for any declared pest emergency situations. In most instances, sprayers are only required to notify EPA of the spraying operations 30 days after the beginning of the spraying operation. As I have noted before on similar bills, I have remained concerned that this bill would mean that no Clean Water Act protections would be required for pesticide application to water bodies that are already impaired by pesticides. Most pesticide applications in the U.S. are done in accordance with the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, FIFRA, which requires proper labeling of pesticide products regarding usage. However, FIFRA labeling is no substitute for ensuring that we understand the volumes of pesticides that we seem to apply to our rivers, our lakes, and our streams on an annual basis. According to a 2016 USGS report on pesticides, commonly used pesticides frequently are present in streams and groundwater at levels that exceed human health benchmarks and occur in many streams at levels that may affect aquatic life or fisheating wildlife. In the data that the States provide the EPA, more than 16,000 miles of rivers and streams, 1,380 bays and estuaries, and 370,000 acres of lakes in the United States are currently impaired or threatened by pesticides. EPA suggests that these estimates may be low because many of these States do not test for or monitor all the different pesticides that are currently being used. I am very concerned about the effect these pesticides have on the health of our rivers, on our streams, and especially the drinking water supplies of all of our citizens, especially the most vulnerable, which are the young, the elderly, the poor and disenfranchised, who have no other protection. I would also add that, if our true concern here is protecting the health of pregnant women in particular, we should focus on preventing pesticide application directly or indirectly to drinking water sources. Mr. Speaker, I have here a Federal report on how pesticides in California are a leading cause of impairments to water quality. Currently in California, there are over 4,500 miles of rivers and streams, 235,000 acres of lakes and reservoirs, and 829 square miles of bays and estuaries in my State that are impaired by pesticides. b1345 This is a significant concern in my home State, where every drop of water needs to be conserved, reused, and cherished. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman and additional 1 minute. Mrs. NAPOLITANO. We hear that pesticide application is already regulated under FIFRA and that the Clean Water Act review is not needed. I understand the concerns about duplication of effort and the need to minimize the impacts that regulations have on small business or business at large. However, I am still very concerned that these pesticides are having a very significant impact on water quality and that we are creating this exemption from water quality protection requirements without considering the impacts to the waters that are already impaired with pesticides, as they are in California. This, in turn, costs our ratepayers, our water users, hundreds of millions of dollars to filter these pollutants out of the water before it is potable. This is something I deal with on an ongoing basis, as the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment. We currently have aquifers that are contaminated by the continued use of pesticides and fertilizers. Millions of dollars have been spent on the 15year long cleanup effort of a Superfund site in my area that has pesticides as one of its contaminants. We cannot and should not take away one of the only tools available to monitor for adverse impacts of pesticides in our rivers, streams, and reservoirs. Over the past 5 years, this tool has been reasonable. I oppose this bill. Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I want to respond a little bit to the gentlewoman from California’s concerns about USGS studies. A lot of these studies are more than 10 years old and do not reflect the current status of pesticide conditions and pesticide regulation today. Many of the detections were what we call legacy pollution stemming from many years ago. Many of the detections were of pesticides that have not been used in the United States for many years. The vast majority of these detections that were in the more current studies have found very low concentrations, which were at levels well below what they consider human health benchmarks. For example, approximately 99 percent of monitored water wells and greater than 90 percent of the monitored stream sites were below human health benchmark levels. Between 2002 and 2011—so before this court decision was in place—USGS only found one stream where human health benchmarks exceeded levels of danger. That is just one stream in the entire United States. Because the USGS data is old, the data does not reflect improvements made by the EPA made to its pesticide regulatory program under FIFRA over the past 10 years. This program has become more rigorous than it was a decade or more ago. The committee has also received testimony on how EPA uses its full regulatory authority under FIFRA to ensure that pesticides do not cause unreasonable adverse effects on human health and the environment, including our Nation’s water resources. In fact, EPA’s pesticides and water programs both use the same risk assessment data, which helps to ensure that both programs are providing the same level of protection against risk. Pesticide usage patterns have changed, technologies have become more sophisticated, and pesticides are much more carefully applied, in part driven by more elaborate label instructions and the high cost of pesticides. Consequently, to argue that the USGS reports show that regulating the use of pesticides under the Clean Water Act is needed is nothing more than just a red herring. To address the issue that my good friend from Oregon raises about the fish kill, NPDES permitting is really a permit to discharge. If an applicator misuses that pesticide under the label, under FIFRA, that is illegal. They broke the law. So not fixing this court decision doesn’t have any effect on the unfortunate situation that happened in Oregon with the fish kill. Nothing in the Clean Water Act will stop misapplication. It is already illegal under FIFRA. The person should be held accountable, prosecuted, and responsible for damages. On the cost, there is more evidence out there of what is going on. The California vector control districts came out with a report that estimated the cost is $3 million to conduct the necessary administration for these permits. Just to conduct the administration, the $3 million in California, that money could be used in other ways to fight and control mosquitos. Also, as another example, Benton County, Washington’s, Mosquito Control District calculated that their compliance with the NPDES permit cost them $37,334. They spent over $37,334 doing paperwork to secure the Federal and State permits. They spent this money updating maps to secure the permit. They spent this money on permit fees. They spent this money on software to help with the reporting requirements for the permit. They spent the money on lots of things associated with the permit, but they did not spend that money spraying for mosquitos. Benton County estimates that, with that $37,334, they could have treated 2,593 acres of water where mosquitos breed or they could have paid for over 
400 West Nile lab tests or they could have hired three seasonable workers. But Benton County got to spend their $37,334 to comply with a redundant Federal permit. The National Agricultural Aviation Association, whose members perform over 17,000 public health and mosquito abatement applications every year, estimates that, for one of their members with two planes and five employees, compliance with the NPEDS permit requires one fulltime employee and $40,000 annually for one fulltime employee to comply with this additional permitting. This permit is not simply ‘‘the modest notification and monitoring requirements are providing valuable safeguards against overapplication of pesticides’’ that my colleague is claiming. It is an incredibly heavyhanded, expensive, timeconsuming process that takes dollars away from public health protection, putting it to more paperwork and putting more people at risk and the health of our communities at risk. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time remains on each side? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Oregon has 10
1⁄2minutes remaining. The gentleman from Ohio has 4 minutes remaining. Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Maryland (Ms. EDWARDS ). Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the House consideration of the Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act that House Republicans have incorrectly and misleadingly renamed the Zika Vector Control Act. In the 113th Congress, this exact legislation with a bill number of H.R. 935 failed under suspension of the rules 253–148. At the time, Republicans subsequently rescheduled it 2 days later under a closed rule to allow passage. I was a Democratic manager of that bill under consideration in 2014. In fact, since my statement laid out a real substantive concern with the legislation, I include in the RECORD a copy of my remarks from that time. Mr. Speaker, in the 112th Congress, the Republican leadership moved similar legislation under the guise that, unless Congress acted, the process for applying a pesticide would be so burdensome, that it would grind to a halt an array of agricultural and public healthrelated activities. Some may say that this may be a bit of hyperbole to describe the impacts of the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) pesticide general permit. However, if you were to compare the concern expressed before the agency’s draft permit went into effect with the almost nonexistent level of concern expressed after almost three years of implementation, you would likely question why we are here this evening debating this bill. Contrary to the rhetoric, EPA and the States have successfully drafted and implemented a new pesticide general permit (PGP) for the last twoandahalf years that adopted several commonsense precautionary measures to limit the contamination of local waters by pesticides. And they do so in a way that allows pesticide applicators to meet their vital public health, agricultural, and forestryrelated activities in a costeffective manner. The sky has not fallen, farmers and forestry operators have had two successful growing seasons, and public health officials successfully address multiple threats of mosquito borne illness, while at the same time complying with the sensible requirements of both the Clean Water Act and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). I say sensible because, as we should clearly understand, the intended focus of the Clean Water Act and FIFRA are very different. FIFRA is intended to address the safety and effectiveness of pesticides on national scale, preventing unreasonable adverse effects on human health and the environment through uniform labels indicating approved uses and restrictions. However, the Clean Water Act is focused on restoring and maintaining the integrity of the nation’s waters, with a primary focus on the protection of local water quality. It is simply incorrect to say that applying a FIFRAapproved pesticide in accordance with its labeling requirement is a surrogate for protecting local water quality. As any farmer knows, complying with FIFRA is as simple as applying a pesticide in accordance with its label—farmers do not need to look to the localized impact of that pesticide on local water quality. So, why are groups ranging from the American Farm Bureau Federation to Crop Life America so adamantly opposed to this regulation? One plausible answer is because these groups do not want to come out of the regulatory shadows that have allowed unknown individuals to discharge unknown pesticides in unknown quantities, with unknown mixtures, and at unknown locations. I wonder how the American public would react to the fact that, for decades, pesticide sprayers could apply massive amounts of potentiallyharmful materials, almost completely below the radar. In fact, prior to the issuance of the pesticide general permit, the only hard evidence on pesticide usage in this country came from a voluntary sampling of the types and amounts of pesticides that were purchased from commercial dealers of pesticides. No comprehensive information was required, or available, on the quantities, types, or location of pesticides applied in this country. Based on that practice, I guess we should not be surprised that, for decades, pesticides have been detected in the majority of our nation’s surface and ground waters. Which leads me to question how eliminating any reporting requirement on the use of pesticides is protective of human health and the environment? All this would do is make it harder to locate the sources of pesticide contamination in our nation’s rivers, lakes, and streams, and make accountability for these discharges more difficult. If this legislation were to pass, we would require more disclosure of those who manufacture pesticides, than those who actually release these dangerous chemicals into the real world. During the debate on Monday, several speakers questioned the environmental and public health benefits of the Clean Water Act for the application of pesticides. However, many of these benefits are so obvious, it is not surprising they may have otherwise gone overlooked. First, it is the Clean Water Act, and not FIFRA, that requires pesticide applicators to minimize pesticide discharges through the use of pesticide management measures, such as integrated pest management. I find it difficult to argue that using an appropriate amount of pesticides for certain applications would be a problem. Second, it is the Clean Water Act, and not FIFRA, that requires pesticide applicators to monitor for and report any adverse incidents that result from spraying. I would think that monitoring for large fish or wildlife kills would be a mutuallyagreed upon benefit. Also, it is the Clean Water Act, and not FIFRA, that requires pesticide applicators to keep records on where and how many pesticides are being applied throughout the nation. Again, if data is showing that a local waterbody is contaminated by pesticides, I would think the public would want to quickly identify the likely source of the pesticide that is causing the impairment. Finally, and perhaps most important, I am unaware, despite repeated requests to both EPA and States, of any specific example where the current Clean Water Act requirements have prevented a pesticide applicator from performing their services. Despite claims to the contrary, the Clean Water Act has not significantly increased the compliance costs to states or individual pesticide sprayers, nor has it been used as a tool by outside groups or EPA to ban the use of pesticides. So, let me summarize a few points. One, the Clean Water Act does provide a valuable service in ensuring that an appropriate amount of pesticides are being applied at the appropriate times, and that pesticides are not having an adverse impacts on human health or the environment. Two, to the best of my knowledge, the pesticide general permit has imposed no impediment on the ability of pesticide applicators to provide their valuable service to both agricultural and public health communities. In fact, most pesticide applications are automatically covered by the pesticide general permit, either by no action or by the filing of an electronic ‘‘Notice of Intent.’’ Three, Federal and state data make it clear that application of pesticides in compliance with FIFRA, alone, as was the case for many years, was insufficient to protect waterbodies throughout the nation from being contaminated by pesticides, so if we care about water quality, more needed to be done. I can see no legitimate reason why we would want to allow any user of potentially harmful chemicals to return to the regulatory shadows that existed prior to the issuance of the Clean Water Act pesticide general permit. It has caused no known regulatory, administrative, or significant financial burden, and has been implemented seamlessly across the country. As was stated during the debate on Monday, this legislation is seeking to address a pretend problem that simply doesn’t exist. I urge a no vote on H.R. 935. 
In this Congress, this legislation was marked up early last year in the Agriculture Committee as the Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act. The committee of primary jurisdiction, the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, has taken no action on the bill this time around; yet, here we are again on the House floor. The Republican leadership has now changed the name of the bill to the Zika Vector Control Act. A new name and the inclusion of a sunset date in 2018 are the only differences from previous iterations of this bill. H.R. 897 is the exact same legislation that pesticide manufacturers and other special interests have been pushing for the past several years. It would eliminate Clean Water Act safeguards that protect our waterways and communities from excessive pesticide pollution. The pesticide general permit targeted in this legislation has been in place for nearly 5 years now, and alarmist predictions by pesticide manufacturers and others about the impacts of this permit have failed to bear any fruit. In fact, in March 2015, before the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Ken Kopocis, Deputy Assistant Administrator of the Office of Water at the Environmental Protection Agency, testified that: ‘‘We have not been made aware of any issues associated with the pesticide general permit. Nobody has brought an instance to our attention where somebody has not been able to apply a pesticide in a timely manner . . . There have been no instances.’’ Yet, here we are. Since then, all across the country, pesticide applicators—usually utilities managing their rightsofway—are complying with the Clean Water Act permits to protect water quality. The public is getting information they need that we couldn’t get before about what pesticides are being sprayed into what bodies of water. Congress should not and must not respond to outdated skyisfalling problems that history has shown has never occurred and weaken protections for the water our children drink. In past Congresses, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have chosen a public health emergency de jour as rationale to pass and enact this legislation into law. At one time, they cited, as they have again today, West Nile virus. The next time it was the western wildland fire suppression. Last Congress, it was the drought. Now, in nothing less than a purely political move, Republicans are considering this bill on suspension, but this time under the guise of combating the spread of Zika. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1 minute. Ms. EDWARDS. Let us be clear. This bill has absolutely nothing to do with Zika or trying to stop the threat of the Zika virus. Despite claims made by my colleagues to the contrary, the permit already in effect allows spraying for Zika or other mosquito control programs. H.R. 897 is simply another attack on the Clean Water Act as part of the Republican’s antienvironmental, deregulatory agenda. I urge my colleagues to vote this legislation down. And let’s do something real to combat Zika. The President has asked for $1.9 billion in emergency funding because it is an emergency. It is a public health threat. If we did that now, then we would be fulfilling our duties and responsibilities. But this legislation today fulfills no responsibilities, gets in the way of protecting clean water, and does absolutely nothing to combat the Zika virus that, if you look at the map, is quickly spreading across this country. Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD the following letters of support: A letter from nearly 100 organizations supporting H.R. 897, including the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture, the National Farmers Union, Ohio Professional Applicators for Responsible Regulation, the Pesticide Policy Coalition, and the National Council of Farmer Cooperatives; The American Mosquito Control Association; National Pest Management Association; Responsible Industry for a Sound Environment; and American Farm Bureau. 
MAY17, 2016. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , Washington, DC. DEAR MEMBER OF CONGRESS : The nearly one hundred undersigned organizations urge your support for HR 897, the Zika Vector Control Act, which the House will consider today under suspension of the rules. Pesticide users, including those protecting public health from mosquito borne diseases, are now subjected to the court created requirement that lawful applications over, to or near ‘waters of the U.S.’ obtain a Clean Water Act (CWA) National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or delegated states. HR 897 would clarify that federal law does not require this redundant permit for already regulated pesticide applications. Under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), all pesticides are reviewed and regulated for use with strict instructions on the EPA approved product label. A thorough review and accounting of impacts to water quality and aquatic species is included in every EPA review. Requiring water permits for pesticide applications is redundant and provides no additional environmental benefit. Compliance with the NPDES water permit also imposes duplicative resource burdens on thousands of small businesses and farms, as well as the municipal, county, state and federal agencies responsible for protecting natural resources and public health. Further, and most menacing, the permit exposes all pesticide users—regardless of permit eligibility—to the liability of CWAbased citizen law suits. In the 112th Congress, the same Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act—then HR 872— passed the House Committee on Agriculture and went on to pass the House of Representatives on suspension. In the 113th Congress, the legislation—then HR 935—passed the both the House Committees on Agriculture and Transportation & Infrastructure by voice vote, and again, the House of Representatives. The water permit threatens the critical role pesticides play in protecting human health and the food supply from destructive and diseasecarrying pests, and for managing invasive weeds to keep open waterways and shipping lanes, to maintain rights of way for transportation and power generation, and to prevent damage to forests and recreation areas. The time and money expended on redundant permit compliance drains public and private resources. All this for no measureable benefit to the environment. We urge you to remove this regulatory burden by voting ‘‘YES’’ on HR 897, the Zika Vector Control Act.

THEAMERICAN MOSQUITO  CONTROL ASSOCIATION , Mount Laurel, NJ, May 16, 2016. Hon. BOBGIBBS, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR CONGRESSMAN GIBBS: The American Mosquito Control Association, in concert with mosquito control agencies, programs and regional associations throughout the United States, want to express our enthusiastic support for passage of HR 897 the Zika Vector Control Act clarifying the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination Systems (NPDES) permitting issue facing our public health agencies. Each year, over one half million people die worldwide from mosquitotransmitted diseases. In the U.S. alone, the costs associated with the treatment of mosquitoborne illness run into the millions of dollars annually. This amendment addresses a situation that has placed mosquito control activities under substantial legal jeopardy and requires ongoing diversion of taxpayersupported resources away from their public health mission. Though the NPDES was originally designed to address point source emissions from major industrial polluters such as chemical plants, activist lawsuits have forced US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to require such permits even for the application of EPA registered pesticides, including insecticides used for mosquito control. These permits are mandated despite the fact that pesticides are already strictly regulated by the EPA under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). Currently, mosquito control programs are vulnerable to lawsuits for simple paperwork violations of the Clean Water Act (CWA) where fines may be up to $35,000 per day for activities that do not involve harm to the environment. In order to attempt to comply with this potential liability, these governmental agencies must divert scarce resources to CWA monitoring. In some cases, smaller applicators have simply chosen not to engage in vector control activities. Requiring NPDES permits for the discharges of mosquito control products provides no additional environmental protections beyond those already listed on the pesticide label, yet the regulatory burdens are potentially depriving the general public of the economic and health benefits of mosquito control. This occurs at a time when many regions of the country have seen outbreaks of equine encephalitis, West Nile virus, dengue fever and the rapidly spreading new threat of the Zika and chikungunya viruses. This negative impact on the public health response and needless legal jeopardy requires legislative clarification that the intent of the CWA does not include duplicating FIFRA’s responsibilities. HR 897 seeks to achieve that goal and we strongly encourage its passage via any legislative vehicle that enacts its clarifying language into law.

H.R. 897 is scheduled to be considered by the full House of Representatives tomorrow, May 17. H.R. 897 would suspend the need to obtain unnecessary and burdensome permits, allowing our industry to better protect you from the mosquitoes that transmit the Zika virus. Zika is an emerging mosquitoborne virus that currently has no specific medical treatment or vaccine. Zika virus is spread through the bite of infected mosquitoes in the Aedes genus, the same mosquitoes that carry dengue fever and chikungunya. The Zika virus causes mild flulike symptoms in about 20 percent of infected people, but the main concern among leading health organizations is centered on a possible link between the virus and microcephaly, a birth defect associated with underdevelopment of the head and brain, resulting in neurological and developmental problems. The World Health Organization (WHO) recently declared Zika virus a global health emergency. Currently, pest management professionals who apply even small amounts of pesticides in and around lakes, rivers and streams to protect public health and prevent potential disease outbreaks are required to obtain an additional, redundant and burdensome National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit prior to application. Under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), all pesticides are reviewed and regulated for use with strict instructions on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approved product label. A thorough review and accounting of impacts to water quality and aquatic species is included in every EPA review. Requiring water permits for pesticide applications is redundant and provides no additional environmental benefit. Pest management professionals are on the front lines of protecting the public, using a variety of tools, including pesticides. Requiring pest management applicators to obtain an NPDES permit to prevent and react to potential disease outbreaks wastes valuable time against rapidly moving and potentially deadly pests. Water is the breeding ground for many pests. The pest management industry strongly urges you temporarily remove this regulatory burden and help us protect people throughout your community from mosquitoes that transmit dangerous and deadly diseases, like Zika, by voting YES on H.R. 897, the Zika Vector Control Act. Sincerely, National Pest Management Association. 
RESPONSIBLE INDUSTRY FOR A  SOUND ENVIRONMENT , Washington, DC, May 17, 2016. Hon. BOBGIBBS, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR REPRESENTATIVE GIBBS: Thank you for reintroducing the H.R. 897. RISE (Responsible Industry for a Sound Environment) 
is a national notforprofit trade association representing producers and suppliers of specialty pesticides including products used to control mosquitoes and invasive aquatic weeds. For most of the past four decades, water quality concerns from pesticide applications were addressed within the registration process under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) rather than a Clean Water Act permitting program. Due to a 2009 decision of the 6th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, Clean Water Act National Pollution Discharge Elimination System Permits (NPDES) have been required since 2011 for aquatic pesticide applications. NPDES permits do not provide any identifiable additional environmental benefits, but add significant costs and paperwork requirements which make it more expensive to protect people from mosquitoes that can vector the Zika Virus, West Nile Virus, Dengue Fever and other viruses. Permits also make it more expensive to control invasive aquatic plants that over take our waterways and impede endangered species habitat. H.R. 897 would clarify that duplicative NPDES permits are not needed for the application of EPA approved pesticides. The elimination of these permits will speed response to public health and other pest pressures, save resources for, states, municipalities, and communities. We support this legislation look forward to working with you and your colleagues to advance this legislation. Sincerely, AARON HOBBS, President. 
AMERICAN FARMBUREAU FEDERATION , Washington, DC, May 16, 2016. Hon. MEMBERS , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR MEMBERS OF CONGRESS : Later this week, the House will vote on legislation that clarifies congressional intent regarding regulation of the use of pesticides for control of exotic diseases such as Zika virus and West Nile virus, as well as for other lawful uses in or near navigable waters. The American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF) strongly supports the ‘‘Zika Vector Control Act of 2016’’ and urges all members of Congress to support this legislation. AFBF represents rural areas nationwide that will be impacted by the spread of dangerous exotic diseases like Zika. The only control measure at this time is vector control. Our members are aware that local mosquito control districts face tight budgets and are concerned with the operational disruptions and increased costs associated with unnecessary and duplicative permitting requirements. Any disruption in vector control will expose a large portion of Farm Bureau members to mosquitos that may carry diseases like Zika and West Nile virus. We urge all committee members to vote in favor of the ‘‘Zika Vector Control Act of 2016.’’ Thank you very much for your support. Sincerely, ZIPPY DUVALL , President. 
Mr. GIBBS. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. MCDERMOTT ). Mr. MCDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, I come down here to oppose this bill. I am not on the committee, but I was sitting in my office and it made me angry to hear people down here talking about H.R. 897. You put out a title that says Zika Vector Control Act. That sounds like a good thing. People ought to be happy we are going to control the specter that is out there. But it is a lie. This does nothing about Zika. It doesn’t do anything with the research that the President has asked the money for. What it does simply is turn the applicators and the pesticide manufacturers loose on this country again. I have been here long enough to remember all of the problems with the bird eggs that had soft shells and the birds were dying. All these animals were dying all over the place because of DDT and all of the things that happen with that kind of application freely in this society. One of the things that you have to think about and what I would caution my congressional friends in the Republican Caucus of is that you ought to learn from history. Philadelphia was once full of malaria. Philadelphia was a malaria city. You kept the windows closed at night because you didn’t want to get malaria. Now, what we are seeing today because of global warming is that moving north from the equator are the organisms that create disease. I heard somebody from Louisiana say: Oh, my God. We have got malaria. We have got all kinds of problems in Louisiana. You are going to have them. You can find evidence everywhere that these organisms are there. But the answer is not to let there be unrestricted and uncontrolled application of pesticides. That doesn’t solve the problem because what it does is it creates another set of illnesses related to the effects of pesticides on human beings and on animals and on reproduction. So what you are doing is you are saying: Well, if you spread this stuff out on the ground and all over the water and people are going to get in contact with that water, there is no question about it, directly or indirectly, and you are going to have the other diseases that come from this. I won’t give a whole long lecture on the effects of pesticides on people, but I will remind Members about something called Agent Orange. b1400 Guys like me who were around during the Vietnam war saw that stuff being sprayed all over the trees. People said: Oh, that doesn’t do anything. It is just that the leaves drop off. Then we had an epidemic of physical illnesses that were secondary to Agent Orange. We told veterans for years: It is not a problem. It is not a problem. It was not that Agent Orange that got you. Then we found out that, in fact, it was, and we have been paying and paying and paying. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute. Mr. MCDERMOTT. So this is one of those issues where you put it on cheap, but you are going to pay for it in the long term. Now, some of you over there, clearly, don’t care. As for the guy in Michigan who made the decision that they use that dirty river water and inflict that on the children of Flint and the lead poisoning and the lead effects on their heads, that is the kind of mentality we are dealing with with the people who run this bill every 2 years from the companies that make this stuff. It came in 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015. Here it is again this year. It will be back. This bill isn’t done. They are going to keep trying to convince the American people that you can just spread chemicals everywhere, and it doesn’t have effects on people, but it does. That is what environmental health is all about. That is why this bill is a step backward to about 1950, when we didn’t really know what pesticides did to people. Now we do. We are absolutely right in voting against this bill, and the President ought to veto it if it gets through. The Senate, as bad as they are, won’t even let this bill through. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania). Members are reminded to direct their remarks to the Chair. Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Boy, talk about fear mongering. Comparing responsible pesticide use in protecting the environment and in protecting human health to Agent Orange is just really over the top. I do agree with one thing the previous gentleman spoke about, which is that we have to do more for Zika, and we are going to do more in the House this week. This is one tool in the toolbox to address this. As for this bit about spraying pesticides uncontrollably all over the place, as a farmer, I have heard that all of my adult life, and it is really bizarre because pesticides cost a lot of money. It is really bizarre in this case because to use these pesticides, you have to be certified by the State and the EPA, and you have to be applying it by the label that the EPA has already approved. This goes through rigorous testing and regulation, so it is not uncontrollable. It is under FIFRA, which is the law the Congress set up many, many years ago to control this. This is not an uncontrolled application of pesticides that is contaminating our water bodies. As I said, the recent geological studies document that we are not contaminating our water bodies. I will make this clear that this is not uncontrollable and that we have laws in place that are called FIFRA. If you break that law, you break the law, and you should be punished and held accountable. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. The problem here is that FIFRA doesn’t require recordkeeping. It is a 
label, and you are supposed to follow the label. There is an even more recent problem in Oregon—we talked about the fish kill earlier—which is the overflight spraying of an herbicide on forestlands, which was applied, and then it drifted into occupied areas and streams. Now, without the EPA’s requirement that you record and report, we wouldn’t know that that had happened; but now we do, and the people who are complaining about health effects have some recourse since they know what was applied, when it was applied, and who applied it. If we do away with that requirement and say, Oh, well, the States might still require something, well, they might not. Therefore, it would be: Are you going to follow the label or not? How are you going to find out if they followed the label? How are you going to find out whose plane that was? How are you going to find out what they sprayed? You won’t be able to. If you get an impaired body of water, we are now mapping things. The EPA says: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. That body of water is already impaired with this particular herbicide or pesticide. We should limit more applications in that area. No, we don’t want to know about that. We don’t want to know about that. That is the bottom line here. We are talking about recordkeeping and reporting after the fact: What did you use? Where did you put it? So if someone is injured or if we find out their water supply is impaired, they can figure out how it happened, but not if we do away with this requirement, with this Groundhog Day bill. Again, it was pest management, it was forest health, then it was reducing regulatory burdens; but now it has been reborn in the last week as Zika control because it is, as the gentlewoman from Maryland said, the cause du jour. It has nothing to do with Zika. I was really pleased to see the majority whip say that they were going to put $1.2 billion into Zika because, as of the publishing of the appropriations bill, it was only $622 million, which is a third of what the President asked for; so now they are up to 66 percent. That is great. I hope that is right because we haven’t seen that in writing yet. The bottom line is we need to partner with the States to deal with the threat of Zika just like we did with West Nile—none of which is going to be impaired by a little recordkeeping—so that we know where, how, what was applied so that citizens of the United States, private property owners, will have some recourse. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. First of all, the gentleman from Oregon talked about the recordkeeping. There are additional burdensome records on this requirement, the MPDS, but a certified pesticide applicator under FIFRA has to keep records. They have to keep records on what they applied, how they applied it, when they applied it, what the wind speed was, and what the temperature was—all of that—so that there is a record there. I wanted to correct his information as he was inaccurate on that. We talked about West Nile. In 2012, we had a crisis in this country of the West Nile epidemic. Dallas, Texas, had to declare an emergency. They probably weren’t doing what they needed to do because of the MPDS permits. If they declare an emergency, they can spray without a permit. That is why we put a sunset provision in this bill. On September 30, 2018, this bill sunsets. The reason we put that in there is to address this towards Zika. Zika will probably run its course. Hopefully, in 2 years, we will forget about it like we have done with Ebola. The problem is that we need to do everything we can to mitigate the problem in the interim. We saw last week there were 103 pregnant women in the United States who had the Zika virus. Today, I heard there were 113. That number is jumping up. It is going to jump up fast because we are in mosquito season. When these mothers start delivering those babies and when we have all kinds of problems, it is not going to be a pleasant experience; so we need to do everything we can. That 2year sunset provision in there will really target and address this issue. We need to give our States and local communities the tools they need, and we are going to do more this week. We are going to give them the resources, the dollars, they need; but we also have to make sure they can spend that money, like in the example I gave of the $37,000. Instead of spending it on administrative paperwork, they can spend it on killing the larvae and the mosquitos. It is easier to kill the mosquito population if you kill the larvae before they hatch. The risks are high, but we need to make sure we do this. I reiterate that FIFRA is already in place to make sure that we don’t have bad actors out there who are polluting our water bodies. If they do, they are going to be held accountable, and the EPA can step in and investigate those and do that. The EPA has all of the authority they need because they approve the label, they approve the pesticide certification, they approve the applicators. They can go back to every applicator and ask for their records. They can go into my local farm coop and ask: When did you apply? What did you apply? What date did you apply? And all of those records are there for our regulators to see. They can do that. All this bill does is fix the bad court decision that it has a regulatory burden. We need to support this bill and let our communities and our States do their jobs to protect the public health. Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in opposition to H.R. 897, the ‘‘Zika Vector Control Act,’’ because this bill was not written with the intent to control Zika carrying mosquitoes, but rather to allow higher amounts of rodenticides, fungicides, and insecticides in water. The title for H.R. 897, two days ago was the ‘‘Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act of 2015.’’ I am very interested in doing everything I can to address the threat of Zika Virus, but I am not supportive of tricks or misguided strategies to get legislation to the House floor in the name of Zika prevention that was conceived with no thought of the Zika Virus in mind. As a senior member of the House Committee on Homeland Security, which has a core mission of emergency preparedness of state and local governments to be equipped to react to emergencies make me acutely aware of the potential for the Zika Virus to be a real challenge for state and local governments during the coming months. I thank President Obama for his leadership in requesting $1.9 billion to address the threat of the Zika Virus. The 18th Congressional District of Texas, which I represent has a tropical climate and very likely of having to confront the challenge of Zika Virus carrying mosquitoes before mosquito season ends in the Fall. Houston, Texas, like many cities, towns, and parishes along the Gulf Coast, has a tropical climate hospitable to mosquitoes that carry the Zika Virus like parts of Central and South America, as well as the Caribbean. For this reason, I am sympathetic to those members who have districts along the Gulf Coast. These areas are known to have both types of the Zika Virus vectors: the Aedes Aegypti [Aupti] and the Asian Tiger Mosquito, which is why I held a meeting in Houston on March 10, 2016 about this evolving health threat. I convened a meeting with Houston, Harris County and State officials at every level of responsibility to combat the Zika Virus to discuss preparations that would mitigate its. The participants included Dr. Peter Hotez, Dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine and Professor of Pediatrics at Baylor College of Medicine and Dr. Dubboun, Director of the Harris County Public Health Environmental Services Mosquito Control Division who gave strong input on the critical need to address the threat on a multipronged approach. Dr. Dubboun, Director of the Harris County Public Health Environmental Services Mosquito Control Division stressed that we cannot spray our way out of the Zika Virus threat. He was particularly cautious about the over use of spraying because of its collateral threat to the environment and people. We should not forget that Flint, Michigan was an example of short sighted thinking on the part of government decision makers, which resulted in the contamination of the city’s water supply. The participants in the meeting represented the senior persons at every, state and local agency with responsiblity for Zika Virus response and they agreed we need plan to address the Zika Virus in the Houston and Harris County area that will include every aspect of the community. 
The collective wisdom of these experts revealed that we should not let the fear of the Zika Virus control public policy. Instead we should get in front of the problem then we can control the Zika Virus from its source—targeting mosquitoes. The consequences of too much insecticide, rodenticides or fungicides in water are known—to kill aquatic life and cause real damage to the food chain upon which fish and larger sea life rely. Along the Coast of the United States, many habitat restoration efforts are centered on the reduction of chemical run off from urban areas, not increasing insecticide pollutants in their waters. The real fight against the Zika Virus will be bottled neighborhood by neighborhood and will rely upon the resources and expertise of local government working closely with State governments with supported of federal government agencies. The consensus of the experts related to H.R. 897, the Zika Vector Control Act, is that we cannot rely heavily on spraying techniques to control Zika Virus carrying mosquitoes. Yes, spraying can reduce the population of mosquitoes, but it cannot eliminate the threat and we can reach a point where the presence of chemical insecticides is in fact more harmful than helpful. The Aedes Aegypti mosquito is the greatest threat to people has evolved to be near people. These mosquitoes fly close to the ground, enter homes or stay nearby places where people live. The spraying that this bill permits is on an industrial scale using products that are not found in a local grocery or home supply store. The most important approach to control the spread of Zika Virus is poverty and the conditions that may exist in poor communities can be of greatest risk for the Zika Virus breeding habitats for vector mosquitoes. It is the illegal dumping of tires; open ditches, torn screens, or no screens at all during the long hot days of summer that will unfortunately create a perfect storm for the spread of the virus. Zika Virus Prevention Kits like those being distributed in Puerto Rico will be essential to the fight against Zika Virus along the Gulf Coast. These kits should include mosquito nets for beds. Bed nets have proven to be essential in the battle to reduce malaria by providing protection and reducing the ability of biting insects to come in contact with people. Mosquito netting has fine holes that are big enough to allow breezes to easily pass through, but small enough to keep mosquitoes and other biting insects out. Bed nets that are not pretreated with insecticide are effective and they can be treated with DEET products after purchase. Mr. Speaker, there is no need to be alarmed, but we should be preparing to do what we can to prevent and mitigate the Zika Virus in communities around the nation. We know that 33 states have one or both of the vector mosquitoes. Dr. Peter Hotez said that we can anticipated that the Americas including the United States can expect 4 million the Zika Virus cases in the next four months and to date there are over a million cases in Brazil. The most serious outcome the Zika Virus exposure is birth defects that can occur during pregnancy if the mother is exposed to the Zika Virus. Infections of pregnant women can result in: still births; the rate of Microcephaly based on Zika Virus exposure far exceeds that number. Microcephaly is brain underdevelopment either at birth or the brain failing to develop properly after birth, which can cause: difficulty walking; difficulty hearing; and difficulty with speech. I call on my colleagues to pass the President’s request for the $1.9 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations. I urge my colleagues to reject H.R. 897, and support the President’s request to fight the Zika Virus threat. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. GIBBS) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 897, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore.

b1452 So (twothirds not being in the affirmative) the motion was rejected. The result of the vote was announced as above recorded. 
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous material on H.R. 4909. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 732 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 4909. The Chair appoints the gentleman from Idaho (Mr. SIMPSON ) to preside over the Committee of the Whole. b1455 
Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill (H.R. 4909) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2017 for military activities of the Department of Defense and for military construction, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes, with Mr. SIMPSONin the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the first time. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORNBERRY ) and the gentleman from Washington (Mr. SMITH) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I am honored to bring to the House today H.R. 4909, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017. The House Armed Services Committee reported it favorably 3 weeks ago by a vote of 60–2. The only way a vote like that is possible is that members are willing to work together for the best interests of the country. I want to start by thanking my partner on this committee, Mr. SMITH, for his work, his insight, and his commitment to work together to try to do the right thing for our servicemembers and for the good of the Nation. Now, I am sure that he does not agree with everything in this bill, nor do I. It is the product of difficult choices, of compromise, of input from many members of this body. But, as a whole, I think this bill is good for the troops, good for the country, and is faithful to the constitutional responsibilities that we have on our shoulders to provide for the military of the United States and defend the country. I want to thank all the members of the committee as well as the staff. We had a compressed schedule this year. At the same time, the country is facing national security challenges that are growing more complex and more dangerous and we are still dealing with the consequences of defense budget cuts. Coupled with an ambitious reform agenda, all of those things meant that our job was not easy, but members on both sides of the aisle put in the hours, attended the briefings and hearings, and contributed to this product. This bill was built from the ground up. We started with about 2,000 legislative provisions that were suggested by members of our committee. We then received many additional requests from members who are not on our committee through testimony, letters, and other forms of communication. For example, some members of the Small Business Committee all came together with a package of proposals to help small businesses contribute to our defense efforts. We had subcommittee markups and then a full committee markup that lasted about 16 hours and considered 248 amendments. Now we have more than 370 amendments that have been filed with the Rules Committee, and many of them will be considered over the next 2 days on this floor. Mr. Chairman, I think that is the epitome of a regular legislative process and is particularly appropriate for this bill because providing for the common defense is the first job, I believe, of the Federal Government. I would add that servicemembers here and around the world deserve to know that we in this body are doing our job and that we support them and are actually trying to do our job, inspired by the courage and dedication and selfless sacrifice that they exhibit in doing their jobs. I want to just highlight two primary thrusts of this bill in addition to fulfilling our constitutional responsibilities. Those thrusts are readiness and reform. The term ‘‘readiness’’ is often used by the military. It is sometimes not understood by those who are not in the military. Readiness involves the preparation and support required to successfully accomplish what the political leadership asks the military to do. 
b1500 It means having the right number of people for a mission, each of whom is fully trained, has appropriate equipment, and is able to carry out their mission. Now, we have got severe readiness problems today in the United States military. We have pilots who are getting less than half the minimum number of training hours they are supposed to get in order to stay proficient in their airplanes. We are cannibalizing some aircraft just to keep other aircraft flying. We have significant shortages of people in key areas, such as pilots and aircraft mechanics. I could go on with examples and statistics which point toward, unfortunately, the kind of hollow military that our country has seen in the past. Certainly there is a high level of frustration among many of our servicemembers. Now, we do not fix all of those problems in this bill, but we start to turn them around. And to truly turn them around, it means not only providing more resources for operations and maintenance and training accounts, it means we have to deal with personnel accounts, and we have to deal with modernization accounts. This bill authorizes spending at the same level as requested by the President, $610 billion, when you add it all together. Now, personally, I would prefer a higher number, but last year we saw military funding used as a hostage to get more domestic funding. In fact, the President vetoed this bill once last year to force more domestic spending, the first time that has ever been done. Once an agreement was reached, he signed the exact same bill into law with the funding adjustments. I think using the military as a hostage for domestic political leverage is deplorable, but I also want to avoid a repeat of that since President Obama is still in the White House. So we used the exact same number, the exact same top line as requested by the President. Mr. Chairman, it would also be irresponsible for us to turn away and ignore the severe readiness problems that are coming to the fore, so this bill authorizes funding for several items that the President rejected in the budget proposal that he sent to us. For example, it restores a full cost ofliving adjustment for our military. It prevents further cuts in the number of people serving. It begins to repair facilities. It adds funds for training and for maintenance, and it makes some progress on replacing outdated weapons systems. So this bill provides full funding for the base requirements for the full year, as was agreed upon in last year’s balanced budget agreement. It then provides a bridge fund to pay for the overseas deployments for about half of the new fiscal year. That gives the new President, whoever he or she may be, the opportunity to look at the deployments that President Obama has begun, look at the funding that he has requested, make adjustments however they think it needs to be adjusted, and then come back to Congress with their conclusions. Mr. Chairman, that is exactly the approach that was used the last time we transitioned between administrations. In June of 2008, this body, under Democratic leadership, did exactly what I have described with a bridge fund to get into 2009. We are following the same approach this year. Now, this bill also contains major reforms. In fact, there are five major reform packages in it, all of which are the work of bipartisan work on the committee, and consultation with the Department of Defense. Those areas, just briefly, are: Acquisition reform to try to ensure that we are getting more value for the money we spend, and that we get modern technology into the hands of the warfighters faster. Military health care to modernize the system, provide better care, and ensure that the emphasis is where it is supposed to be, and that is military health care for our warfighters. Commissary reform to put domestic commissaries on a selfsustaining track while maintaining the benefit for our servicemembers, their families, and for retirees. Organizational reform, including the changes to the 30year old Goldwater Nichols law, and replacing the Quadrennial Defense Review, the QDR, with something that is less costly and more useful. Reform of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, long overdue and modernization spurred by a review that we required in this committee that was prompted by the sexual assault allegations of recent years. So, Mr. Chairman, there is a lot here. There is a lot of substance, and there is a lot of reform, and it is all focused towards two goals. One is to support the men and women who volunteer to risk their lives to protect us. And secondly, to preserve and protect the national security of the United States of America in a very dangerous world. I believe this bill deserves the support of all Members. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 5 minutes. I want to thank the chairman and all the staff members and members of the committee for their excellent work in pulling this bill together. As always, I think it is a fine example of how the legislative process should work around here, and too often doesn’t. We had a bill before committee. We had many, many hearings to discuss the issues around it. Then we had a long markup with amendments offered and debated, and we put together a bill in a bipartisan fashion that I think was done quite well. I also agree with the chairman that there is a lot of good in this bill. There are a lot of efforts at reforming the way we do procurement and other things in the Department of Defense to try to get the most out of the money we spend. More than anything, the good in this bill is that it continues to provide for the men and women of our services who are fighting for us and protecting our national security, and I think it does a very comprehensive job of that, and that is an important issue right now. I will also agree with the chairman that we face as complex a threat environment as we have probably faced, gosh, in the history of the country. We have certainly had great national security challenges throughout our history, but now they are coming at us from all directions. Certainly, we have the asymmetric threat of terrorism from groups like al Qaeda and Daesh and all that goes with that. We have a newly belligerent Russia that is creating problems in Eastern Europe and elsewhere. We have Iran, which continues to pose challenges to us in the Middle East and also elsewhere; North Korea, that is acting in a very belligerent manner; and China, that is expanding its territory by creating islands in the South China Sea and challenging the territorial integrity of other nations. All of those things require us to be prepared and to have a robust national security policy. I think this bill does a good job of it. Now, we are facing a reckoning, coming down the road here, in that all of those national security challenges that I just mentioned are going to be tough to meet under any budget. One of the things that I would urge us to do is to work more closely with partners throughout the globe, as we have in some instances, to meet our national security challenges, because the sheer cost of them is going to be difficult. But on the whole, I think this bill does a good job of meeting our national security concerns. There are just two problems that I do want to point out. Number one, we don’t really make as many tough choices as we should make in this bill. The chairman has pointed out how this bill prioritizes readiness, and to some degree that is true; but this bill also still has $11 million less in money for readiness than the President’s budget that was proposed because we support a wide range of other programs. If you look over the course of the next 10 years at all of the programs that we are funding and planning on buying, and then you look at how much money we are likely to have, the two don’t add up. We have to start making some difficult choices about what we are going to fund and what we are not going to fund. Related to that is the second problem, the one the chairman alluded to, and that is the fact that while this 
budget sticks to the $610 billion number that was agreed to in the budget resolution last year, it takes $18 billion out of the overseas contingency operations fund and puts it into the base budget, which means that 6 months into the fiscal year our troops in Afghanistan and Iraq and elsewhere will not have the money to support those overseas operations unless a supplemental is passed. Now, the chairman is quite correct: this was done in 2008. But in 2008, we did not have the Budget Control Act. We did not have the complete unwillingness of this Congress to lift the Budget Control Act. I don’t see that changing in the next 6 months. Which brings us to the other issue, and that is the issue of ‘‘holding the defense bill hostage for other spending priorities, for domestic spending priorities.’’ Well, that is one way of looking at it. The other way of looking at is a budget is a series of choices that you have to make. And if we do spend an additional $18 billion on defense, over and above what the budget agreement of last year agreed to, then that money has got to come from somewhere. Either, one, it adds to a $19 trillion debt that I think most people feel is too high and that we need to eventually get to the point of a balanced budget. It requires new revenue which, of course, is—you know, I should be struck down by lightning in this Chamber for even mentioning the words ‘‘new revenue.’’ That is, apparently, verboten and not going to happen. However much we may claim to support the men and women who served in our Armed Forces, we are not prepared to raise taxes for what they need to do. Then you have got the domestic choices, and those domestic choices are not irrelevant. We have a crumbling infrastructure in this country that is way behind, massively unfunded. We have other priorities. We have the Department of Homeland Security. We have Intel priorities. All of those priorities are shoved backwards if we take an additional $18 billion for defense. So we are not holding defense hostage. We are arguing about what our budget priorities should be. Should we go and take the $610 billion agreement we had for defense and effectively up it to $628 billion at the expense of all these other priorities, or shouldn’t we? That is what we have to balance. I will look forward to the debate. There are a lot of interesting amendments coming up. I am not sure at this point how I am going to vote on this bill. I think it is incredibly important. We need to get it done. But those budget priorities are very real. And if we take an extra $18 billion for defense, that does shortchange other areas, given our unwillingness to raise revenue to pay for it. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCARTHY ), the distinguished majority leader. Mr. MCCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Chairman, I want to take one moment. Very seldom do we see a bill of this significance come to the floor in such a bipartisan manner. That takes leadership, it takes experience, and I want to thank the chairman for that. He knows that I trust his judgment, but more importantly, whenever we are talking about national security, he is the first one that I call. But I am not the only one who calls him: those around the world do as well. I want to take a moment to thank the ranking member as well. The vote to come out of this committee was 60– 2. That shows the leadership on both sides that when America looks at national security, they want Republicans and Democrats alike to work together. Both of you have shown that leadership, and I want to congratulate you for that, bringing it to the floor in that manner. Mr. Chairman, it is indisputable that our national security has declined under President Obama’s watch. Terrorists are attacking us right here at home. Europe is under siege. And, yet, the President is more focused on closing Guantanamo Bay and releasing detainees than he is on the real threats to American security. Afghanistan is increasingly unstable, and the Taliban and al Qaeda are gaining ground. Yet, President Obama remains committed to withdrawing our troops while constraining their ability to take the fight to the enemy. These are just two examples, and I don’t need to go through the whole list. Just look at the map of the world, and what do you see? Allies that have been slighted, enemies that have been appeased, regions that have fallen into conflict and chaos. The Obama administration is not the direct cause of every problem, but the President’s inadequate responses, naive beliefs, and failures of leadership have put American interests at risk and made our country less safe. Now, House Republicans have always been and remain committed to a strong American military, an active foreign policy, and continued American leadership in the world. We must counter the terrorist threats forcefully. We must reaffirm and strengthen our strategic alliances, like NATO. We must engage and prevent, not retrench and respond. This National Defense Authorization Act demonstrates our commitment by prioritizing funding to support more troops, better defenses, and better equipment. Most importantly, this bill works to improve readiness, and ensures that our men and women are prepared to go into battle. The President has fought this approach and has said he will veto this bill as it currently stands. That is despite a 2.1 percent pay raise for our troops, better resources for the warfighter, an aggressive stance against Russian expansion, and funding for Israel’s missile defense. b1515 This is the height of irresponsibility. With this bill, the House makes it clear that we intend to reinvigorate the Department of Defense, take care of our men and women in uniform, stand with our allies, and make every possible effort to defeat global extremism. The President should share these goals and sign this bill. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ), the ranking member of the Tactical Air and Land Forces Subcommittee. Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman THORNBERRY , Ranking Member SMITH, and all of our staff for tirelessly working on this very incredibly important bill. Also I would like to thank Mr. TURNER . For the past 4 years, he has been the chairman and I have been the ranking member of the Subcommittee for Tactical Air and Land Forces. It has been a pleasure. The National Defense Authorization Act, of course, is a mustpass bill. We have passed it for the past 53 years, and I am really honored to have been part of it for the past 20. The NDAA is the annual piece of law that puts the necessary resources and funding to ensure that our servicemembers are fully equipped and trained to defend our country here and abroad. All of our military systems—air, land, water, and space—are authorized by this legislation. It provides new opportunities for the Department of Defense to engage in innovative research and development to ensure that America has the most technologically advanced military. Of course, that also bleeds over into the civilian world with all of our new technologies. The NDAA makes sure that servicemembers and their families are provided with the necessary support and resources as they sacrifice their lives to defend their country. Just last Friday, I had the opportunity to be in Erie, Pennsylvania, where our son was commissioned as a second lieutenant and officer into the U.S. Army artillery. So I am pretty excited to continue to support our military families because we are one. This bill also provides provisions to support women in the military—making equipment that actually fits them, for example—and we put in language for parental leave for our servicemembers for up to 14 days. It increases funding for nuclear nonproliferation, something which I am an adamant supporter of, trying to eliminate nuclear threats for the future, for our grandchildren and their children. 
It increases funding for K–12 STEM education because, again, we have to invest in our future, and the future of education is equal to our national security. The legislation also provides funding and resources to counterterrorism, including those threats from ISIL. On our particular subcommittee, we included some significant oversight legislation. Everybody thinks about passing laws, but the reality is that one of the main things that we have to do as Members of Congress is to oversee what is really happening in programs and with the money of our taxpayers. So we included the F–35 Joint Strike Fighter’s software oversight, the F–18 Super Hornet oxygen system, and a multiyear procurement authority for the Army’s helicopters. However, the successful passage of this important legislation is at risk because, first, it doesn’t comply with the Republicans’ Budget Control Act because it is $18 billion over the budget caps. Secondly, it includes a number of discriminatory provisions, such as language that would allow government contractors to discriminate against the LGBT community. There are many things that we need to do to ensure that this bill can be, in a bipartisan way, passed by this House. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. FORBES ), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Seapower and Projection Forces. Mr. FORBES. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017. I want to first commend the leadership of Chairman THORNBERRY in bringing this bill to the floor. His leadership has been instrumental in tackling many of the tough issues this committee has had to address. I am particularly impressed with the chairman’s leadership to make sure that this Congress provides the required equipment and readiness that will begin to turn some disconcerting trend lines with our national security. For example, Navy aviation has only 3 in 10 Navy jet aircraft that are fully mission capable; aircraft carriers are not available in sufficient quantities, and our Nation had a carrier gap of almost 3 months in Central Command last year; Navy ship deployments have increased almost 40 percent, and submarine demand continues to outpace availability, with the Navy projecting they will meet only 42 percent of the combatant commanders’ demand, and this is before we reduce another 20 percent of our submarines by the end of the 2020s. As to the Air Force, our B–1 fleet was pulled back from the Arabian Gulf this year because of engine maintenance issues and replaced with B–52s that are over 50 years old; and in the last 4 years, we have reduced our tactical airlift by 20 percent. I think everyone would agree that these are disturbing trends. It is time we invest in these capabilities. This bill goes a long way to reversing this trajectory and authorizes funds to meet the 350ship Navy that our Nation needs. I believe it is a national security imperative to arrest the decline of our projection forces. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. LANGEVIN ), the ranking member of the Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee. Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairman THORNBERRY , Ranking Member SMITH, and my fellow colleagues on the committee this year for many important issues within the committee’s jurisdiction which we found in this bill, on which I have been proud to work with my colleagues. As ranking member of the Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee, I especially want to thank my subcommittee colleagues, particularly my colleague JOEWILSON , the chairman of the subcommittee. It has been a pleasure to work with him. I also want to take this opportunity to recognize members of the staff who worked so hard on this bill, without whom we wouldn’t be able to move legislation of this magnitude forward. The legislation, Mr. Chairman, before us today continues to address critical priorities and programs at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels when it comes to emerging threats and capabilities. In particular, I am pleased with many provisions relating to game changing technologies, such as language addressing how to properly operationalize directed energy technologies, electromagnetic rail gun mount funding, electronic warfare capabilities, strategy requirements, and a point person within DOD for directed energy systems. This legislation goes on also to prioritize the readiness of the Cyber Mission Force and fully supports U.S. Cyber Command while elevating this critical entity to its own combatant command. This effort enhances our superiority in the cyber domain, and I am glad the committee recognized the need to take this vital step. I am also pleased with the approach we took toward enhancing capabilities and extending authorities to defeat nonstate actors like ISIL and al Qaeda. I am also pleased with the continued support of our Special Operations Forces and their families who are under the responsibility of the subcommittee, and those forces which are always at the pointy tip of the spear. Although this bill moves the ball forward on policies vital to our national defense, of course, it is far from perfect. We must continue to address funding issues in other areas of concern as we move forward in the process. In closing, I want to thank all the members of our subcommittee, as well as the members of the full Armed Services Committee, for their support during this markup. I again commend Chairman THORN BERRY and Ranking Member S MITH for their leadership. I look forward to our continuing to work together to craft a final product with the Senate that provides further support for our men and women in uniform, our military families, and further strengthens our national security. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. WILSON ), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities. Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for his efforts to promote peace through strength. Mr. Chairman, I am grateful to support H.R. 4909, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, which I believe faithfully sets forth a path to recover and strengthen our military readiness. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities of the House Armed Services Committee, I am particularly appreciative to oversee some of the most innovative aspects of the Department of Defense. A few key areas of the subcommittee’s contributions to this legislation are providing robust and resilient cyber capabilities and authorities to improve our cyber readiness and ensure resiliency for Department of Defense networks and weapons systems. We support innovative science and technology programs and authorities to meet future challenges. We fully resource and support our Special Operations Forces, who remain at war and globally postured, supporting our national security in the global war on terrorism. We extend vital counterterrorism authorities while improving congressional oversight in this very important area. Again, I would like to thank Chairman MACTHORNBERRY for his steadfast leadership as well as the subcommittee ranking member, Mr. JIMLANGEVIN of Rhode Island, who has been an energetic partner on these issues with an extraordinary subcommittee staff. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this bill and vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 4909. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Guam (Ms. BORDALLO ), the ranking member of the Readiness Subcommittee. Ms. BORDALLO. Mr. Chairman, I commend Chairman THORNBERRY , Ranking Member SMITH, and the committee staff who have worked many, many long nights on the FY17 National Defense Authorization Act. I worked with Mr. SMITH and members on the committee, particularly the Readiness chairman, Mr. ROBWITTMAN , to include a number of provisions that will 
improve our military readiness and continue to support the AsiaPacific rebalance, allowing crucial infrastructure projects to move forward and requiring the Navy to report on land usage on Guam that will have positive impacts for our posture in this region. The bill provides critical funding to the Long Range Strike Bomber program as well as adds additional funding to keep the fielding of the MQ–4 program on track. I especially want to thank Ranking Member SMITH for working to get a provision mandating a review of distinguished Asian American and Pacific Islander veterans who may have been unjustly overlooked in the Medal of Honor consideration included in the chairman’s mark. It is important that we appropriately recognize the contributions of our brave men and women in uniform. While I am proud of these and other provisions, this bill is far from perfect. There are, once again, numerous damaging environmental provisions; and, more broadly, I am disappointed that the majority has again created a bill that circumvents budget caps, a maneuver that plays politics with our servicemembers in the field—particularly reckless in this environment. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to address these and other concerns, and I hope common sense will prevail as this process continues. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. TURNER ), the subcommittee chairman on Tactical Air and Land Forces. Mr. TURNER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017. As the chairman has indicated, the President has issued a veto threat on this bill claiming criticism that the bill uses overseas contingency operations funds for base requirements. This is a hypocritical attack by the President because the President, in his own bill, included $5 billion in overseas contingency operations funding to be used for base requirements as part of the President’s budget for 2017. The reality is that $5 billion is not enough to address the readiness crisis that is facing our military, and it does not ensure that our troops are ready to deploy and are fully prepared. The military, in fact, submitted $22 billion in unfunded requirements for fiscal year 2017 alone. I want to thank Chairman THORN BERRY for his leadership as he begins the process of rebuilding our military and restoring readiness back into the future. As the chairman said, this bill came out of our committee, 60–2. It is the same bill that is going to come to this House floor. I certainly hope we are not in the situation, as we were last year, where we had Democrats on the committee who actually voted for the bill in committee and then voted against the bill on the House floor. This is a bill that deserves passage. It deserves the support for our men and women in uniform. In my subcommittee, the bill authorizes almost $6 billion in additional funds to address critical unfunded requirements, a benefit provided by the military services. I want to also thank Chairman THORNBERRY , in this bill, for reversing the President’s proposed cuts to our end strength, our numbers of those serving in the Army and the Marine Corps. He has incorporated the POSTURE Act, which was first introduced by Representative CHRIS GIBSON . The bill also includes funds for the European Reassurance Initiative, which is incredibly important as we move to respond against Russian aggression. Additionally, this bill calls for continued action to eradicate sexual assault in the military, and I appreciate the chairman’s support for those provisions. The bill provides greater transparency in the military criminal justice system, acknowledges the need for intensive treatment for male victims of sexual assault, and continues to address the critical issue of retaliation. b1530 Before I conclude, I want to thank our subcommittee’s ranking member, Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ , for her support in completing the markup of this bill as well as that of other Members, and I want to thank LORETTA SANCHEZ for her long service on the Armed Services Committee. I ask everyone to support this bill. The CHAIR. The Chair would remind Members to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. COURT NEY), the ranking member of the Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee. Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Chair, I enthusiastically support the seapower portion of the defense bill, which is a strong bipartisan boost to our security on, below, and above the seas. The Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee worked hard this year examining the President’s budget as well as the larger strategic maritime context that we are considering these programs in. We have determined the following, that the demand for our naval fleet is higher than ever and so is the strain on the force. A casual review of the headlines explains why. China’s navy is militarizing the South China Sea, threatening good order and commerce on the world’s seaways, completely in violation of international maritime law. Russia’s navy is recapitalizing its fleet, particularly its undersea fleet, and operating at a level not seen since the cold war. These are just two examples of the uptempo challenges that the Navy faces every single day. In this strategic context, the seapower portion of our bill builds on the work done by the Navy, the Obama administration, and this Congress to put us on a path to a 308ship Navy within the next 5 years. That is good, but it is clear we need to do more to ensure that we have the capability to keep pace with the growing and changing threats around the world. That is why this bill adds three new ships to the seven ships in the President’s budget, a third littoral combat ship, funding to complete a third DDG–51 destroyer, and resources to add an additional amphibious ship. Our bill also has another area of good bipartisan work. It is in the area of our undersea forces. Our bill not only sustains the twoayear build rate of our advanced Virginiaclass submarines, but also includes a measure that I pushed for to continue that build rate through the 2020s to provide the undersea capabilities our military leaders are pleading for. Our bill also fully funds our Nation’s top strategic priority, the Ohio replacement submarine. We also continue our bipartisan work to strengthen the National SeaBased Deterrence Fund to support this critical program outside of the regular shipbuilding account. We provide this fund with new authorities to save additional funds during the course of building the Ohio class program—perhaps as much as 10 percent on components like missile tubes—on top of the billions in savings that already existing authorities in the fund were shown to garner by the CRS and the Congressional Budget Office. The bipartisan seapower mark is a down payment on the additional naval capabilities and capacity that we will need to keep pace with the fastchanging security challenges around the globe. I am confident that it will emerge in the final enactment of the 2017 NDAA. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. ROGERS ), the distinguished chairman of the Subcommittee on Strategic Forces. Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair, I would like to thank the distinguished chairman of the House Armed Services Committee for his leadership in bringing what I think is a very good NDAA bill to the floor. This is the 55th consecutive NDAA. This is not an easy bill to manage. We have a critical set of funding challenges as the administration’s budget submission for FY 2017 broke the deal negotiated in 2015 to achieve the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015. Because of this failure, we in Congress must exercise our constitutional duty to provide for the men and women in uniform and we must provide much needed oversight of the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy. This bill includes a number of key provisions that were authored by the 
Subcommittee on Strategic Forces that I lead, including: Consolidating and strengthening the Air Force’s organization regarding our nuclear command and control and missile warning systems; It enhances the authority for the Department of Defense and, also, the Department of Energy to mitigate threats from unmanned aircraft at its most sensitive nuclear facilities; It prohibits the DOE funding for Russia and for Secretary Kerry’s unilateral disarmament initiative concerning retired U.S. nuclear warheads; It tackles the significant and growing foreign counter space threat that our space systems are suffering by providing the necessary resources to build up our space security and defense capabilities and by ensuring the Department is organized properly and has the authorities it needs to maintain our space advantage long into the future; It makes clear that replacement of the RD–180 in a reasoned, prudent timeline is the primary goal of the Department of Defense to maintain assured access to space while protecting the taxpayers and ending our reliance on Russian rocket engines; It requires the Army to do a better job for its soldiers than delaying the procurement of a modern radar until 2028 at the earliest; and Most significantly to me, in this bill we have recommended to the chairman a significant increase of over $400 million for the Missile Defense Agency, focusing on R&D, and full funding of the request of our allies in Israel, $600.7 million, for codevelopment and coproduction of Iron Dome, David’s Sling, and Arrow 3. I want to thank the chairman for his leadership, and I want to thank my good friend and colleague from Tennessee, Mr. JIMCOOPER , for his support, counsel, and thoughtfulness. I couldn’t ask for a better ranking member. I urge support of the bill. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. COOPER ), the ranking member of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee. Mr. COOPER. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from Washington. I thank also the chairman of the full committee from Texas and my particular friend, the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. ROGERS ). All the members of the subcommittee contributed greatly to the final product. It is not to all of our liking, but we are making progress. We agree on so many of the fundamental provisions having to do with national security. For example, I am thankful that our safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent is fully funded and we are also providing full support for our nuclear nonproliferation efforts as well as providing for nuclear cleanup. Those are all very important efforts. The bill also provides a very robust missile defense, including not only protecting the homeland, but also our allies and partners, such as the $600 million for Israeli missile defense. The mark fully funds national security space programs and makes some very important adjustments, including ensuring that we adequately support acquisition of satellite communication services. There are a few provisions in the bill that I strongly oppose, such as restricting dismantlement of obsolete and unneeded nuclear weapons. Also, I think it was a mistake to mandate a poorlythoughtout, unaffordable, and unrealistic missile defense policy, including plans for a spacebased missile deterrent. I also plan to continue to oppose these provisions in conference. I would like to reiterate my thanks to Chairman ROGERS , my friend from Alabama. It is a pleasure to work with him and our other subcommittee members. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. WITTMAN ), the distinguished chairman of the Subcommittee on Readiness. Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank Chairman THORN BERRY , Ranking Member S MITH, and the ranking member on the Readiness Subcommittee, MADELEINE BORDALLO , for all of their efforts. Chairman THORNBERRY over the last few months has highlighted the significant readiness challenges and budget choices we are facing. The reality is that these decisions we make here will affect the strength of our national security for years to come. The American people are concerned. And why shouldn’t they be? The readiness obstacles that we face force our military leaders to choose between providing adequate training and equipment for troops at home and supporting our men and women who are already fighting on the front lines. We have heard verified media reports, for instance, that aircraft mechanics have taken drastic measures, even attempting to strip parts from museum pieces, to keep our fighters and bombers flying. We have heard testimony from each of our service branches about how critical it is for us to address our military readiness shortfalls. What we have heard has been sobering, to say the least. Today we are called to address these maintenance, sustainment, and readiness issues. That is our constitutional duty. I believe that this bill will move us toward that end goal of restoring fullspectrum readiness. This bill, for example, prohibits the Department from implementing another round of base realignment and closure in the absence of an accurate end strength assessment and it streamlines the Department of Defense’s civilian hiring practices so that critical manpower capability gaps can be filled. Most importantly, this bill also includes more than $5 billion in additional funds for, among other things, ship and aircraft depot maintenance, aviation training and readiness, and longneglected facility sustainment, restoration, and modernization accounts. Our military, an overruling force for good, is supported by the finest men and women in the world. They deserve our support in return. At the same time, I would like to note that these recommendations don’t fully alleviate my concerns about our readiness shortfalls. Here in Washington we need to make sure that we fully understand what is at stake and how the choices we make affect those who serve and sacrifice on our behalf. We have to continue to focus on restoring readiness in the years to come and make sure that we properly man, train, and equip our forces so that they can meet the challenges on the horizon with the confidence and superiority we have come to expect. I ask the Members of the House to support this National Defense Authorization Act and vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 4909. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much time each side has remaining? The CHAIR. The gentleman from Washington has 131⁄2minutes remaining. The gentleman from Texas has 11 minutes remaining. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. DAVIS), ranking member of the Military Personnel Subcommittee. Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Dr. HECKand the committee staff for working in a bipartisan manner to develop this bill and particularly recognize Chairman THORNBERRY and Ranking Member SMITH for their leadership during this process. The bill includes many provisions that will provide the military services flexibility to recruit and retain members of our Armed Forces and to continue our commitment to taking care of military families. One provision that we have expands parental leave for military members to 14 days as well as expanding adoption leave for dual military couples to 36 days to be split between them. It also requires DOD to study flexible maternity and paternity leave sharing for all of our dual military couples. This bill includes reforms that will put the commissary on a sustainable path while protecting the benefit for our servicemembers, retirees, and their families. It also begins to reform and modernize the military healthcare system. Although we would all agree it is not perfect, this bill is long needed to start ensuring that our servicemembers, retirees, and their families continue to receive the best health care in the world through efficient and economical means. Important issues were addressed in this bill. I support many of the reforms 
and all of the hard work that went into them. However, I am extremely concerned with how this bill is funded. I applaud Chairman THORNBERRY ’s desire to increase funds for end strength, modernization, and the operations and maintenance accounts. But the $18 billion required comes from the Overseas Contingency Fund and cuts short resources required for our troops in harm’s way. This will require the next Congress to pass a supplemental before May, and that assumes current operations don’t increase over the next year. What programs do we cut midyear to find that level of funding? This gimmick creates a hollow force. It will require the military services to hedge their bets that the funding to maintain the increased end strength authorized will be available in fiscal year 2018 when sequestration hits. The world we know is very dangerous in many places, and the pace of combat operations will most likely not diminish in the near future. In light of these dangers, I do not disagree that the Army may need more soldiers. But the Army has not provided us with the requested number, nor have they told Congress how they would create the appropriate force structure to use these additional soldiers. Lastly, this NDAA passed out of committee continued to expand on Congress’ efforts to increase opportunities for women to serve our Nation by requiring women to register for the Selective Service. This was only possible because the Department of Defense, after several years of intense review, opened the last remaining combat arms positions to women earlier this year. Unfortunately, the rule for the NDAA strikes the provision without debate. I understand that we are not always going to be in agreement, and that is why we debate and vote issues on the House floor. But to resort to gimmicks to hide debate is unconscionable. This is a national issue that Congress must debate and vote on. I certainly look forward, Mr. Chair, to continuing to work with the chairman and the rest of the committee to ensure we resource our military services in a responsible manner so that we can face the challenges of today and tomorrow. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. HARTZLER ), the chair of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of our national defense. There are some stark realities we must face in today’s world of increased and emerging threats from around the globe combined with decreased military readiness from arbitrary and reckless cuts to our national defense. In the face of these challenges, we have a choice: either continue to let our military capabilities wither as our adversaries grow stronger or we can recognize that everchanging global landscape and make sure our troops are prepared with the resources and training they need to keep Americans safe against today’s threats and tomorrow’s. The latter, Mr. Chair, is what this defense authorization does. From addressing the strike fighter shortfall with 14 additional F–18s that the Navy needs, to providing for maintenance of equipment and facilities so that museum aircraft do not have to be cannibalized for spare parts, to fully funding our troops’ pay raise, which they have rightly earned, we have listened to the services and our commanders. b1545 They know what they need to do their jobs, to keep us safe, and to retain their people, and we have acted on their priorities. This bill also addresses shortfalls in training and provides for the modernization of critical national security programs. It makes sure soldiers are prepared at all of our bases, including at the Army’s Maneuver Support Center of Excellence at Fort Leonard Wood, in my district. It ensures aircraft like the B–2 at Whiteman Air Force Base can continue to project power and the spirit of America around the globe. Mr. Chair, this authorization takes care of our troops, ensures the safety of the American people, and fulfills our constitutional obligation to provide for the common defense. I commend Chairman THORNBERRY , my House Armed Services colleagues, and the HASC staff for all of their hard work and leadership. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this responsible authorization. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Nevada (Mr. HECK), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Military Personnel, who is both a doctor and a general in the Reserves. Mr. HECK of Nevada. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4909, the National Defense Authorization Act of 2017. This bill contains significant policy and funding initiatives that continue our commitment to maintain military personnel and family readiness and address important issues for our troops. To that end, this bill: Establishes a fully funded pay raise for all of our servicemembers. After 3 years of executive action that has provided lowerthanbylaw calculated pay raises, it is time we give our troops and their families the pay increase they deserve; Stops the reductions in the active endstrengths of the Armed Forces, thereby increasing readiness while reducing the stress and strain on the force and their families; Reforms the Military Health System to ensure the system can sustain trained and ready healthcare providers to support the readiness of the force and provide a quality healthcare benefit valued by its beneficiaries; It also modernizes the Uniform Code of Military Justice to improve the system’s efficiency and transparency while also enhancing victims’ rights. This includes establishing several new offenses, including an offense prohibiting retaliation and prohibiting inappropriate relationships between military recruits or trainees and a person in a position of special trust; Reforms the commissary system in a way that preserves this important benefit while also improving the system so it remains an excellent value for the shoppers and a good value for the taxpayer; Includes an increase in parental adoptive leave for dual military couples in recognition of the importance of bonding time between parents and their newly adopted children. In conclusion, I thank the ranking member, Mrs. DAVIS of California, and her staff for their contributions to the mark and support in this very bipartisan process. We were joined by an active and informed and dedicated group of subcommittee members, and their recommendations and priorities are clearly reflected in this bill. Additionally, I appreciate the dedication and hard work of the subcommittee staff. I urge my colleagues to support our military men and women and their families and to support this bill. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. BRIDENSTINE ), who is a member of the committee and who also continues to be active in the Air National Guard. Mr. BRIDENSTINE. I thank the chairman. Mr. Chair, this defense authorization makes a huge down payment on the readiness of our forces. As a combat veteran, I have participated in the interdeployment training cycles that are getting ready to deploy. I have seen the force regeneration process. I have seen it during good times, and I have seen it during bad times. Personally, as a Navy reservist, most recently, I saw a very steep decline in readiness when my squadron got eliminated. The VAW–77, the Nightwolves, got completely eliminated when I was a Navy reservist. We busted about $2 billion worth of cocaine every year on the high seas. Now that cocaine comes into the country, and $2 billion worth of cash funds transnational criminal organizations in northern Mexico and in Central and South America. That is what happens when we have defense cuts the way we have had recently. In fact, I will tell you that our remaining forces still face significant shortfalls and disruptions to timetested training and deployment cycles. The OPTEMPO back home is almost more intense than an overseas deployment, 
but the resources are simply not available. Pilots are flying the bare minimum flight hours to stay qualified, and our maintainers and our depots can’t keep up. As a warfighter, I can attest that this will break our force. The important thing about this bill, this defense authorization—and, Mr. Chairman, it is why I am so grateful for your leadership and the bipartisan support that we had from the ranking member, Mr. SMITH—is it makes a huge down payment on the readiness that is required to make sure that the force we have remaining is not hollow, which is critically important to the national security of this country. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentlewoman from New York (Ms. STEFANIK ), the vice chairman of the Subcommittee on Readiness. Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Chair, I am proud of the bipartisan work of the House Committee on Armed Services on the FY17 National Defense Authorization Act. This legislation takes important steps to strengthen our defense capabilities, and it gives our Armed Forces the resources they need to keep us safe. Importantly, this bill works to stop the funding gaps that are harming our military’s readiness, and it includes a muchdeserved pay raise for our troops. This bill contains an important initiative to ensure our land forces will not be depleted as well as including some of my own initiatives—the creation of a DOD social media cell to counter radical online recruitment and maintain the edge in a 21st century battlefield. It also includes the development of joint directed energy capabilities between the United States and Israel. I am proud to support this legislation, which passed in committee by a bipartisan vote of 60–2, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this vital bill on the floor. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Washington has 10 minutes remaining, and the gentleman from Texas has 4 minutes remaining. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time. I want to reiterate some of the points that were made during the debate in the beginning of how important this bill is. We do have many national security needs. I know you see the size of the Department of Defense’s budget, and there are certainly ways we can save money. I think we have done that with acquisition reform and with some of the other reforms that are contained in this bill. It is also important to understand the threats that we face in the world— the continuing threat of terrorism and the continuing threats from nations like Russia, Iran, North Korea, and China. We need to be prepared to counter those threats if we are going to have a peaceful and stable world. Nonetheless, I think we still have the budget problem that I alluded to earlier, and that is that we do not have the money that we would like to have. It is not just for defense; it is for a lot of domestic priorities as well. In the way this bill is set up, it creates the possibility that we will take an additional $18 billion for defense. How does that balance against our other priorities? We have to figure out how to make our budget balance and meet the priorities domestically while also meeting the national security priorities because our infrastructure is critical to our national security as well. We have to remain strong economically as a country. In addition to that, it is not just the Department of Defense that provides for our security. There is the Department of Homeland Security, certainly, in the intelligence budget; the Department of Treasury; the Department of Justice. A lot of pieces to that puzzle are necessary, and they all get shortchanged if we don’t take into account their needs as well. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time. As usual, I largely agree with many of the comments made by Mr. SMITH. I think he is exactly right when he discusses the many complex, dangerous threats that face the United States at this point. I think he is also right that we all have to put the Federal budget— but especially the military budget—on a more stable, predictable footing. I absolutely agree with him on those points. At the same time, we have an immediate need, one in which lives are at stake. Mr. Chair, let me just offer the fact that the Air Force is currently short 4,000 maintainers and more than 700 pilots. Another fact: in fiscal year 2015, the Navy had a backlog of 11 planes in depot. In fiscal year 2017, they are going to have 278 planes backlogged in the Navy depots. Less than onethird of the Army is now ready to meet the requirements of the defense strategic guidance. We can’t just turn away and say: Oh, we don’t like this budget approach, so we are willing to live with all of those problems. We have to deal with them. That is what this bill tries to do. Mr. Chair, by the way, if we take away the $18 billion that we try to put to readiness issues, then a lot of the things that the Members have asked for go away. I have before me, for example, a letter that has been signed by a number of House and Senate Members who ask for new Black Hawks this year. The fact is the President did not request any Black Hawks in his budget request. Currently, too many of our military folks are flying Black Hawks that were made in 1979. They can’t get the parts for them. They can’t even fly them in a lot of the circumstances because of the restrictions on these helicopters. So we look to the Army’s unfunded requirements’ list of the things they would like to have had that were stripped out by the administration, and we put into this bill 36 new Black Hawks. That is the way you deal with a lot of these readiness problems, is you replace the 1979 helicopter with a 2016 helicopter. We do that in this bill, but if we take away the approach that we have here to meet the readiness requirements, all of those Black Hawks go away. I also have letters from Members who ask for the third littoral combat ship. We were only able to do that because of the $18 billion. I have a letter signed by a number of Members to increase the U.S.Israeli cooperative missile defense. Again, if our approach is not used, which some people on the other side are critical of, that funding goes away. It doesn’t just come out of the air. Mr. Chair, my point is we have an immediate problem. This bill tries to deal with the immediate problem that is affecting the men and women who serve our country today. Is it perfect? Of course not, but I have yet to hear of a better alternative that meets these needs and can pass the House. Mr. Chair, just to reiterate, the other point is this is exactly the same approach that was used in the last administration. It is curious to me that some people who wanted to give President Obama a chance of a fresh look of the deployments which he found when he came into office now want to deny the same possibility for the next President, whoever he or she may be. We take exactly the approach that was used under Speaker PELOSI and Majority Leader HARRY REIDin 2008, and we apply it to the next transition. I think that is what makes sense because that is what enables us to deal today with the readiness problems that threaten our military. I hope all Members will support this bill. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I ask that the following exchange of letters be submitted on H.R. 4909:

I agree that the Committee on Small Business has valid jurisdictional claims to certain provisions in this important legislation, and I am most appreciative of your decision not to request a referral in the interest of expediting consideration of the bill. I agree that by foregoing a sequential referral, the Committee on Small Business is not waiving its jurisdiction. Further, this exchange of letters will be included in the committee report on the bill. Sincerely, WILLIAM M. ‘‘M AC’’ THORNBERRY , Chairman. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I rise to speak on House consideration of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017. I thank Chairman THORNBERRY and Ranking Member SMITH and the Armed Services Committee for their work on the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015. As a senior member of the House Committee on Homeland Security, I take our role in Congress as stewards of our nation’s security seriously. I offer my thanks and appreciation to the men and women of the armed services who place themselves in harm’s way each day for the safety and security of our nation’s people. The National Defense Authorization Act’s purpose is to address the threats our nation 
must deal with not just today, but into the future. This makes our work vital to our national interest and it should reflect our strong commitment to ensure that the men and women of our Armed Services receive the benefits and support that they deserve for their faithful service. This is the 54th consecutive National Defense Authorization Act, which speaks to the long term commitment of the Congress and successive Administrations to provide for National Defense. This bill encompasses a number of initiatives designed to confront the military challenges posed by violent extremism, terrorists engaging in ground wars, making more efficient the work of protecting America, addresses the medical health needs of men and women in the armed services, and extends economic and education opportunity to small minority and women owned businesses. We do live in a dangerous world, where threats are not always easily identifiable, and our enemies are not bound by borders. Boko Haram, ISIL, and Al Shabaab remind us of how fragile our nation’s security could be without a well trained and equipped military. I appreciate the House Armed Services Committee’s continued support of our national defense and support a number of provisions in H.R. 1735, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year (FY) 2016, such as authorities that support ongoing operations. The Administration also appreciates much of the work of the committee, but is expressing strong objections because the bill: Redirects $18 billion in funding intended for use in defeating ISIL to base budget programs; Extends operations at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; Increases costs of the TRICARE administration; Prohibits the retiring or inactivation of TiconderogaClass cruisers or dock landing ships; Reduces by $250 million the Counterterrorism Partnership Fund; Bars the administration from making sure that companies that break United States labor laws are not rewarded; Prohibition on the use of funds for Countering Weapons of Mass Production; and Eliminates for the Department of Defense’s Joint Urgent Operational Needs Fund. Although the Administration points out areas of agreement with the Committee, the Administration strongly objects to several provisions in the bill. The opportunity to amend the bill will offer an opportunity to address these and other Administration concerns that will improve the bill. Congress should authorize sufficient funding for our military’s priorities, and avoid using the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding in ways that leaders of both parties over the years have made clear is inappropriate. The final bill considered by the Congress should adopt many of the needed force structure and weapons system reforms that have been identified by military leaders and experts. As written the President’s senior advisors would recommend that he veto this bill. It is my hope that the Rules Committee will make in order a number of perfecting amendments for consideration under the Rule for H.R. 4909. I have amendments that have been offered for consideration of H.R. 4909. Let me discuss briefly the amendments I offered that were adopted by the House and included in the final version of the bill. Jackson Lee Amendment Number 1 calls for increased collaboration with NIH to combat Triple Negative Breast Cancer. Jackson Lee Amendment Number 2 provides authorization for $2.5 million increase in funding to combat posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Jackson Lee Amendment Number 3 condemns the actions of Boko Haram and urges the CommanderinChief to ensure accountability for crimes against humanity committed by Boko Haram against the Nigerian people. Jackson Lee Amendment Number 4 authorizes the Secretary of Defense to work with local security partners in facilitating the provision of security at civilian nuclear research centers in educational institutions to ascertain that nuclear weapons do not end up in the hands of terrorists, in promotion of the United States’ and its allies’ security interests. Jackson Lee Amendment Number 5 authorizes the Secretary of Defense to work with local and international security partners, innovators, law enforcement, and other civil society organizations in the provision of technical assistance for the creation, facilitation and implementation of a technological app designed to enable the location, protection and tracking of missing persons, refugees, returnees and internally displaced persons. Jackson Lee Amendment Number 6 directs Secretary of the Navy to submit report to Congress on the feasibility of applying desalinization technologies to provide drought relief in areas impacted by sharp declines in water availability for both military as well as civilian purposes. Jackson Lee Amendment Number 7 authorizes the Secretary of Defense to provide technical assistance to local and international security partners in the provision of security and protection for activists and civil society organizations advocating for and promoting freedom of religion, education, press expression and personal expression. Jackson Lee Amendment Number 8 directs Secretary of Defense to conduct study and submit to Congress report regarding the awarding of secret and top secret security clearances to better understand the process for awarding clearances in effective and fair. Jackson Lee Amendment Number 9 requires outreach for small business concerns owned and controlled by women and minorities required before conversation of certain functions to contractor performance. Jackson Lee Amendment Number 10 expresses the sense of Congress regarding the importance of increasing the effectiveness of the Northern Command (‘‘NORTHCOM’’) in fulfilling its critical mission of protecting the U.S. homeland in event of war and to provide support to local, state, and federal authorities in times of national emergency. Jackson Lee Amendment Number 11 requires the Government Accountability Office to include in its annual report to Congress a list of the most common grounds for sustaining protests related to bids for contracts. Jackson Lee Amendment Number 12 directs the Secretary of Defense to report to Congress on the Department’s ability to support the rapid development, production and deployment of vaccines or treatments of emerging tropical diseases, like the Zika and Ebola viruses, to protect the men and women of the armed forces and their families. We must continue to direct our efforts as a body to ensure that our troops remain the best equipped and prepared military force in the world. They are not just soldiers they are sons and daughters, husbands and wives, brothers and sisters—they are some of the people we represent as members of Congress. Support of our men and women in uniform is a sacred obligation of Congress both to those who are at risk on battle fields and serving as the guard against threats around the world, but they are also those who have returned home from war. I look forward to the inclusion of the Jackson Lee Amendments and others that will improve the underlying bill. The CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired. Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment under the 5 minute rule. In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the Committee on Armed Services, printed in the bill, an amendment in the nature of a substitute, consisting of the text of Rules Committee print 114–51, modified by the amendment printed in part A of House Report 114– 569, shall be considered as adopted.

AMENDMENT NO . 1 OFFERED BY MR . 
The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 printed in part B of House Report 114–569. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 727, line 5, insert after ‘‘may’’ the following: ‘‘, as specified in advance by appropriations Acts,’’. 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 732, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORNBERRY ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. b1600 Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I appreciate the opportunity to offer this amendment, which I do not believe is controversial. Mr. Chairman, one of the many parts of this bill, on which Members on both sides of the aisle have contributed, is to try to improve our acquisition system, partly to get more value out of the taxpayer money that is spent and partly to try to get technology into the field, into the hands of our warfighters faster because technology evolves and the threats evolve so quickly. Members on both sides of the aisle have contributed to that effort, and we have consulted with folks in the Pentagon and in industry to try to make improvements in this part of the bill. This amendment is a technical amendment, which just deals with some of those issues, to ensure that whatever process we set up here, obviously, the money has to be appropriated as well. Mr. Chairman, I don’t think it is controversial, but I want to reiterate that most of this bill is built from the ground up on a bipartisan basis, including each of the five major reform areas. I think acquisition reform is very important that we pursue, that we continue to try to improve the equipment and the weapons that we provide our personnel. That is what helps make them more ready to conduct the missions that the country asks them to conduct. Mr. VEASEY. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. THORNBERRY. I yield to the gentleman from Texas. Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Chairman, I am not in opposition to the amendment. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. ROTHFUS ). The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORNBERRY ). The amendment was agreed to.

BY MR . THORNBERRY OF TEXAS  At the end of title VIII, add the following new section: 
want to remind my colleagues that these facilities are entitled to protection under international law. Yet, we continue to hear about airstrikes in Syria targeting these hospitals and medical facilities. Just pick up the newspaper. In 1 week, six facilities in Aleppo were targeted. Intentional attacks against hospitals, surgeons, nurses, and other healthcare workers is not a norm that we should accept. Neither is the Syrian Government’s blocking of humanitarian aid, including medical aid. Just last week, a U.N. Red Cross aid convoy, including medical aid to a besieged Syrian city, was blocked by the Syrian Government. A former top U.N. humanitarian official tweeted his disgust that the aid had been blocked ‘‘because it carried baby milk.’’ The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 15 seconds to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin. Ms. MOORE. Mr. Chair, I commend the courageous healthcare providers and nonprofit groups that are working in the midst of these attacks to provide health care to the millions under siege in Syria. Too many have died and too many more will die if we continue to be sorry. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT), another valuable member of the House Armed Services Committee. Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Chair, the world has become an increasingly unstable place due to conflicts in the Middle East and provocations by Russia, China, and North Korea. In order to maintain our national security in this environment, we must ensure that the United States military remains the best trained and most wellequipped fighting force in the world. My home State of Georgia plays an essential role in maintaining military readiness as we are the home to nine major military installations. As the only Republican from Georgia on the House Committee on Armed Services, it is an honor to serve as Georgia’s primary voice in Congress on military issues. My top priority is to offer effective representation of Robins Air Force Base and Moody Air Force Base, in addition to all of Georgia’s military installations. That is why I am proud to support the House version of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, which came out of the House Committee on Armed Services with a bipartisan vote of 60–2. This legislation takes many important steps to rectify the damage to our military readiness done by President Obama’s cuts to our defense budget over the last few years. We have got some big wins for Georgia in this NDAA. We, again, fought to make sure that two of the Air Force’s most valuable platforms stay in the air: the A–10 flown out of Moody Air Force Base and E–8C Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System, better known as JSTARS, flown out of Robins Air Force Base. Both of these fleets are taking the fight to the enemy right now. The A–10 is currently engaged in the fight against ISIS in the Middle East and supporting our Special Forces by carrying out precision strikes against these terrorists. Additionally, I am grateful that the committee adopted my amendment to delay retirement of the JSTARS through fiscal year 2018. This legislation also provides for the recapitalization of that fleet. During the committee process, we moved to protect the C–130 depot workload. Robins is an efficient and effective depot center and has the potential to become the C–130 center of excellence for our country. I believe the House version of the NDAA sets us on a course that sustains military readiness, makes appropriate investments for future threats, continues to reform the DOD’s outdated acquisition strategy, and supports the significant contributions that Robins, Moody, and other Georgia military institutions make to our national defense. I urge my colleagues to support our troops, get our military readiness back on track, and pass H.R. 4909, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017. Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GALLEGO ). Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Chairman, today I rise on behalf of the estimated one in five veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars who suffer with posttraumatic stress disorder, or PTSD. The Department of Defense and the Veterans Health Administration have collaborated to develop clinical practice guidelines for PTSD. According to a GAO report earlier this year, the Veterans Health Administration currently monitors the prescribing of medications that are included in these guidelines, but DOD and the Army do not. This discrepancy could result in negative consequences for our men and women in uniform undergoing treatment in military medical facilities. My amendment would require each branch of the armed services to monitor the prescribing practices of medications to treat symptoms of PTSD among servicemembers. By monitoring the prescribing practices, we can make sure our returning warfighters receive the proper treatment necessary to alleviate the symptoms of PTSD. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). b1615 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, coming from the State of Texas, let me express my continued appreciation for the men and women of the United States military, so many of them living in our State, so many different bases, so many veterans living in our State as well, which has caused me to continue to support the men and women who are posted overseas, those who are here domestically as well on bases here in the United States, and, of course, our veterans. As we move toward Memorial Day, it is important that we look holistically at our military and look at them as an entity that includes personnel. I want to take note of the fact that there is a 2.1 percent pay increase for military personnel and that this bill does update the Uniform Code of Military Justice to include new protections for victims of military sexual assaults. I am concerned, however, that the bill shortchanges war funding for efforts against ISIS and redirects funds that should continue to be used for base budget projects toward nonwarrelated base budget projects. Let me be clear that I think some of these projects are very important, but I would have wanted this legislation to deal with the fight against ISIS and not go into the contingency fund. As I indicated, I heard the debate and there was some suggestion that the President’s budget went into the contingency fund, but in the way that it is done in this bill, it is larger than should be. I also want to take note of the fact that I have concerns regarding an amendment in the bill, and I hope that we will be able to address it because this amendment allows any religious corporation, religious association, religious educational institution, or religious society that receives a Federal grant or grant to claim religious exemptions from antidiscrimination protections of LGBT individuals whom they may employ. I believe in the First Amendment and the separation of church and State and, as well, religious freedom, but under the Federal funding where we as taxpayers have the responsibility not to discriminate against anyone, this goes against that duty, and it also undermines President Obama’s landmark 2014 executive order banning all Federal contractors and grantees from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. So I am hoping, Mr. Chairman, that we will have the opportunity to work through this legislation and to move forward in a way that embraces all Americans. I do want to thank, however, Chairman THORNBERRY and Ranking Member SMITH and the Committee on Rules for making two of my amendments in order. They are in the en bloc No. 1 and No. 2. The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. JACKSON LEE. The amendments are amendment No. 8 and amendment No. 9. Amendment No. 8 calls for outreach for smallbusiness concerns owned and controlled by women and minorities prior to conversion of certain functions to contract upfront performance. Amendment No. 9 requires the Government Accountability Office to include in its annual report to Congress a list of the most common grounds for sustaining protests relating to bids for contracts. These are important amendments because they help to grow small businesses owned and controlled by women and minorities before conversation of certain functions of contractor performance. This amendment seeks to provide information to businesses that may have little experience in government contracting to make them aware of new opportunities. Amendment No. 9 seeks a report to be provided to oversight committees to better understand the circumstances that impact when a company wins a Federal contract award that is challenged. These challenges often come from companies that are big, competing for the same contract, and little companies can’t stand up. Successfully competing for a Federal contract can be difficult and costly, especially for new entrants into Federal contracting competition. I would ask my colleagues to support the included amendments and look forward to us working through this bill on some of the issues of concern. Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman THORNBERRY  and Ranking Member ADAM SMITH and the Rules Committee for making in order and including in En Bloc Number 1 two of the amendments I have offered to ‘‘National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017.’’ The first of these amendments, Amendment Number 8 calls for outreach to small business concerns owned and controlled by women and minorities prior to conversion of certain functions to contractor performance. The second amendment, Jackson Lee Amendment Number 9, requires the Government Accountability Office to include in its annual report to Congress a list of the most common grounds for sustaining protests relating to bids for contracts. Amendment Number 8 will provide information to businesses that may have little experience in government contracting to make them aware of new opportunities to contract for business with the Department of Defense. There are instances where it is prudent and appropriate for agencies to engage in sole source contracting. This can occur if the work is highly specialized and only one source can meet the needs of a component or agency. A sole source contract arrangement might arise because the work is only for a brief period of time. However, these sole source contracting arrangements may over time be converted to a competitive bidding process. The Jackson Lee amendment ensures that the Department of Defense make known to small and minority owned businesses when a sole source contract will be converted to a competitive bidding process. Having more competition for government contracting is the goal. Receiving notice that a new competitive bidding opportunity is coming does not mean that an award will be made to that business. However, the more businesses who compete for Federal government business the better off the government and the economy will be. Amendment Number 9 requires GAO to conduct a study and report to Congress on the successful challenges to competitive bid awards. Challenges to federal contract awarded by competitive bidding often come from companies that were unsuccessful in winning the contract in the bidding process. Successfully competing for a federal contract can be difficult and costly especially for new entrants into federal competitive contracting. Challenges to federal contract awards, especially when the winner is a small business can make it difficult for these businesses to pursue opportunities they have won. The amendment provides Congress relevant and useful information regarding how often challenges to a contract award are sustained and awards withdrawn, and upon which grounds. I thank Chairman THORNBERRY and Ranking Member SMITH for including these amendments in the En Bloc Amendment Number 1, and I urge all Members to join me in voting for its adoption. Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of this amendment, the text of which was previously adopted and favorably reported by the Committee on Foreign Affairs as H.R. 4678. This amendment focuses on asserting Congress’s longstanding constitutional and legal authority to determine the future of the U.S. military base at Guantanamo, which senior military officers continue to view as ‘‘indispensable’’ to our national security and to our strategic and humanitarian operations in this Hemisphere. For decades—and most recently during the President’s trip to Havana—the Cuban regime has demanded the return of the base as a prerequisite to the normalization of relations with the United States. This amendment lays out the legal and historical case why a President may not weaken U.S. ‘‘jurisdiction and control’’ over the base without affirmative Congressional action—either a new statute or a treaty concluded with Senate consent. U.S. Naval Station Guantanamo Bay is not a typical basing situation, and U.S. control is not premised on a treaty. Its history is wholly unique and has its roots in Acts of Congress. Cuba became an American protectorate after the U.S. prevailed in the SpanishAmerican War, which Congress had declared in 1898. In 1901, Congress rightly granted the President conditional authority to return control and governance of the island to the people of Cuba, subject to the express requirement of securing U.S. Naval basing rights there. In fact, the Administration stated that it did not have the power to return governance until that Congressional condition had been met. When the President signed the 1903 Guantanamo Lease—the agreements under which the U.S. continues to exercise ‘‘complete jurisdiction and control’’ over the base—the President specifically cited the 1901 Act of Congress as providing his authority to do so. The last Treaty of Relations between the U.S. and Cuba (in 1934) did not nullify, replace, or change the 1903 lease agreements, but noted that they ‘‘shall continue in effect’’ until the U.S. and Cuba agree to modify them. This means that any executive attempt to impair the United States’ ‘‘jurisdiction and control’’ over Naval Station Guantanamo Bay without congressional authority would illegally nullify the 1901 Act of Congress, and infringe on Congress’s exercise of its express constitutional powers. Some say giving up Guantanamo isn’t in the cards. Why worry? The Assistant Secretary of State for Legislative Affairs has recently written, stating that ‘‘the United States has no plans to alter any of the arrangements regarding the base.’’ But saying that you ‘‘have no plans’’ to do something is not the same as saying that you will not do something. As we have seen in any number of prior situations—whether it be unfulfilled pledges of consultation with Congress prior to any Cuba policy change, or the 11th hour lifting of missile restrictions as part of the Iran nuclear deal—plans can change very quickly, for the worse, with no prior warning to Congress. And we should be concerned about the next Administration’s plans. This amendment is about protecting congressional prerogative during this Administration, and the next, and the next. Congress needs to make clear its role in any decision to relinquish U.S. Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, which remains indispensable to our nation’s defense, and our support for regional stability. This amendment does this, and deserves our support. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendments en bloc, as modified, offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORNBERRY ). The en bloc amendments, as modified, were agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 2 OFFERED BY MR . WESTERMAN  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 printed in part B of House Report 114–569. Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of subtitle B of title I, add the following new section: 
the amount authorized to be appropriated for Department of Energy national security programs, as specified in the corresponding funding table in section 4701, for Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation, Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation Programs, Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation R&D, Material management and minimization is hereby reduced by $82,400,000. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 732, the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. WESTERMAN ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arkansas. Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of my amendment for a budget neutral increase in funding for Army surfacetoair missile systems. The Patriot Advanced Capability3 Missile Segment Enhancement, or the MSE, is the next generation of the battleproven PAC–3 interceptor for the Patriot air defense system. Along with its earlier generation PAC– 3 interceptor, the Missile Segment Enhancement is the world’s most capable air and missile defense missile. PAC–3 missiles are highvelocity interceptors that destroy incoming targets with direct bodytobody impact. This hittokill impact produces a tremendous amount of energy that defeats tactical ballistic missiles carrying weapons of mass destruction and/or submunition payloads, cruise missiles, unmanned aerial vehicles and aircraft. The MSE missile provides a 50 percent improvement in altitude and 100 percent improvement in range over earlier PAC–3 interceptors and is required to address advance air and missile defense threats. MSE capability is in great demand across the deployed force. In fact, the MSE missiles have been on the Army’s unfunded request top priorities list. Additional missiles have been on the Army UFR the past 2 years and have been funded by Congress. This amendment would allow approximately 20 new missiles to be purchased in fiscal year 2017, which would put the total at 105 missiles, which is still below the fiscal year 2015 and fiscal year 2016 levels. If we add these additional 20 missiles, the unit cost of the missiles would go down as well because of the quantity of scale in the program. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. GARAMENDI ). Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chair, yes, we would surely like to do what my colleague suggests. However, it does leave us rather vulnerable to terrorism, terrorism that would be carried out by those who might want to get their hands on highly enriched uranium or other elements to either make a bomb or to create a dirty bomb. The money comes from a very, very important fund, a fund that the National Nuclear Security Administration uses to secure loose nukes and highly enriched uranium and other kinds of material that might be used in making a bomb. It would be wonderful if we could carry out what our colleague would like to do for the surface toair missiles. I mean, those are important. But don’t take the money from this account. This account is extremely important in preventing the proliferation of nuclear materials as well as how we need to convert those reactors around the world, including here in the United States, that are capable of producing plutonium and highly enriched uranium. I don’t have a problem with where the gentleman tends to augment the surfacetoair missile defense program or the airtosurface program but, rather, from where he is taking, the account. I would suggest to the gentleman that we would be far better off finding a different place, one that has far less risk to us. The terrorists are out there. They are looking to get their hands on this kind of fissile material, and they will be able to do so unless we use the money in this program from the National Nuclear Security Administration, atomic agency, to secure these sites and materials. Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. ROGERS). Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the gentleman from Arkansas’ amendment. The Army included Patriot MSE procurement as number 12 on its fiscal year 2017 UFR list to ‘‘mitigate critical shortfall in Army war reserve requirements.’’ The ballistic missile threat from Russia, China, Pakistan, Iran, and North Korea is growing. We owe it to our men and women in uniform to give them the tools they need to defend themselves when we send them into harm’s way. I know that on the other side of the aisle they look at every dollar that goes to the defense nuclear nonproliferation budget as sacrosanct, but I know that the House Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development, and Related Agencies mark also has skepticism about whether this technology is ready for prime time. As the chairman of the Subcommittee on Strategic Forces, I urge the support of this amendment offered by the gentleman from Arkansas. Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. FORTENBERRY ). Mr. FORTENBERRY. Mr. Chair, Senator MARK KIRK, who used to be a Member of this body, told me a story a while back. He was a bomber pilot during the Bosnian war, and during that war he literally carried a map in his hands, and there was a red circle drawn around a particular point on that map, and it said, ‘‘Do not bomb here.’’ What was there? Loose nuclear materials, unsecured, that could have been a disaster had we inadvertently struck that target. Loose nuclear materials are all around the world. We have a very specialized program here called the global material security initiative program that helps secure these materials, brings down the risk that they will get into the wrong hands, brings down the risk of a nuclear explosion—which is an absolutely critical national security priority—to as close to zero as possible. I know it is not the intention of the author of the amendment, my friend Mr. WESTERMAN , to undermine this program. In fact, I support the underlying intent of enhancing the surfacetoair missile program, but this is the wrong place to take this money from. The Department of State, the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Defense, and the Department of Energy as well as other agencies are sharing in the multitasked effort to try to have a multipronged effect on reducing the probability of a nuclear weapons explosion, reducing the probability of nuclear materials getting into the wrong hands to, again, as close to zero as possible. That is why, as we move forward in looking at how to enhance important programs like my friend has raised, we should look for it in the right places and not undermine a critical aspect of our national security. I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding. Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chairman, I would also like to commend the Material Management and Minimization program for the work that they have done, but as was stated before, the House Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development, and Related Agencies of the Committee on Appropriations said: A significant portion of the highly enriched uranium minimization efforts going forward will involve multiyear research and development activities. To better align research and developmentrelated activities with resident expertise for managing such activities within the Office of Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation, the recommendation shifts funding responsibility for the development of fuel for highperformance research reactors and for demonstrating and commercially deploying domesticbased technologies for the production of the medical isotope Mo 99 to defense nuclear proliferation research and development. Mr. Chairman, I believe this is the appropriate place to offset the funding for these additional missiles. These missiles are critical to our Nation’s defense. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. COOPER ). Mr. COOPER. Mr. Chair, I think most of us are very interested in supporting the MSE portion of this. I just worry about the offset. It is very important that we make sure we do not raid the nonproliferation account in order to pay for what may be a very worthy priority. You remember that Secretary of Defense Robert Gates didn’t even allow an unfunded request to be transmitted to Congress. That removed a certain temptation from us. We all know there are a number of these requests, and some of them should be funded, but to raid the nuclear safety account—because that is basically what nonproliferation is—is a very dangerous precedent. I would urge the gentleman to reconsider. We hope to work on this amendment in conference, but this is not a piggy bank we are raiding. This is not a slush fund. This is an account that could keep America safe from a nuclear attack. I would urge the gentleman, as he pursues his very worthy priorities, to not pursue an offset in this area. I thank the gentleman. He is an excellent Member, but I think that we should all be very aware of the importance of the nonproliferation account. b1630 Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chairman, I would like to emphasize that, even with these additional 20 missiles, we will still be below the numbers for FY 2015 and FY 2016. This is an unfunded request and high priority for the Army, and I encourage a positive vote on this amendment. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. WESTERMAN ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 3 OFFERED BY MR . GARAMENDI  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 printed in part B of House Report 114–569. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of subtitle D of title I, add the following new section: 
Removing these funds . . . would be a doubletake to the program, hindering the GBSD contractors’ ability to fully fund their Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction phase contracts. This would prevent the winning contractors from appropriately ramping up their efforts . . . and result in a 5month delay. 
Furthermore, GAO does not support this reduction. The gentleman is basing his argument on GAO’s initial draft budget fact sheet released over a month ago, which said that the $17 million offset may be available. However, in its final GAO budget fact sheet released today, GAO says: 
The Air Force’s Fiscal Year 2017 request for GBSD could be reduced by a total of $17.93 million—as long as the funds are not reprogrammed. 
In their final fact sheet, GAO also said that the GBSD account for FY 2017 should only be reduced to offset the excess $17.93 million if the funds remain with the program and are not reprogrammed as currently planned. So both the GAO and the Air Force oppose the offset in this amendment. Furthermore, two successive Secretaries of Defense say that nuclear deterrence is DOD’s most important mission. Here is Secretary Hagel: 
Our nuclear deterrent plays a critical role in assuring U.S. national security, and it is DOD’s highest priority mission. No other capability we have is more important. 
The nuclear mission is the bedrock of our security. It is what stands in the background and looms over every action this country takes on the world stage. It is the foundation for everything we do. 
In short, GBSD is the future of one leg of the triad and must remain on schedule. According to the Air Force and GAO, this amendment delays that schedule. Let’s be clear. This is an antinuclear disarmament amendment disguised as something else. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the amendment. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chair, this is most assuredly not a disarmament. We are scheduled to spend a trillion dollars on this kind of program. It is hardly a disarmament. We are talking about $17.9 million; yet, this nuclear security program is a trillion over the next 25 years. It is hardly a disarmament. The reality is that this money is not needed now. This money is going to be 
reprogrammed by the Air Force to be spent next year—without our authority, but I suppose with summary programing authority—when we know that the Air Force has C–17s, C–130s, and other large aircraft that can be shot out of the sky now, not in 2028 and beyond, but now. Are we unwilling to protect our airmen and women that are on these airplanes? This is not disarmament. This is about protecting the men and women that are flying dangerous missions into Afghanistan, into Iraq, into other places where the terrorists do have MPADS and can shoot them out of the sky. Don’t give me that business that this has something to do with disarmament. This has to do with protecting the men and women that are flying our large aircraft and giving them the protection that they need. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair, this is about disarmament. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. GARAMENDI ). The amendment was rejected. 
AMENDMENT NO . 10 OFFERED BY MR . MCKINLEY  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 10 printed in part B of House Report 114–569. Mr. MCKINLEY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Add at the end of title VIII the following new section: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 732, the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. MCKINLEY ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from West Virginia. Mr. MCKINLEY. Mr. Chairman, this bipartisan amendment seeks to address the problem of America’s declining defense industrial base. Consider these facts. Since the 1980s, the number of American rocket motor companies has declined by 60 percent with only two companies remaining able to manufacture motors that propel our missiles. The Department of Defense has already published seven reports going back to 2009 and all the way up to last year, all talking about specifically warning of the danger of this decline of our solid rocket motor industrial base. In these reports, they use terms like ‘‘at risk,’’ ‘‘vulnerable,’’ ‘‘shrinking,’’ ‘‘atrophying,’’ and ‘‘fragile.’’ Despite these reports, the Air Force has permitted outsourcing of rocket motors for tactical missiles to foreign companies without even giving other U.S. companies the opportunity to compete. Mr. Chairman, this illustrates why so many Americans are frustrated with Washington. The DOD has identified a problem, but they haven’t done anything about it since these reports have been surfacing. This amendment will help correct the problem, strengthen the solid rocket motor industrial base, and possibly create American manufacturing jobs. The amendment simply says that, if there is a foreign supplier for solid rocket motors on our missiles, the DOD must ensure there is a second supplier available. The second supplier can be domestic or it can be foreign. Last year a similar provision passed in the House NDAA, but was removed in conference with the Senate. Since that time, we have modified this amendment to try to find a compromise that would be acceptable. Now, the bottom line is: This is about an opportunity to strengthen America’s industrial base and American jobs. The question remains: Does Congress stand for American jobs or with continued foreign outsourcing and weakening our fragile manufacturing capacity? Mr. Chairman, let’s give our firms in America an opportunity to compete. I would like to thank Chairman THORNBERRY for his support of this amendment and his staff for working with us as well as our bipartisan sponsors of this amendment. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this amendment. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. MCSALLY ). Ms. MCSALLY. Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong opposition to this proposed amendment. Although I have respect for my colleague and teammate, I have strong reservations and opposition to this amendment. This amendment is a solution in search of a problem. It would delay critical missile capabilities to the warfighter and will be more costly to the taxpayer. Only two tactical missile programs in production today use international motors, and both of them are made by our friend, Norway. If enacted, prime contractors will have to pause production of critical tactical missiles and spend tens of millions in compliance costs to certify an alternative product that does not currently exist. What is more, while we wait for the second company to develop a working product line, we will slow production of missiles needed by warfighters today. The history for why past programs have used international motors is important to keep in mind. In 2011, after a history of success, the AMRAAM missile, which is a critical airtoair missile—and, as a fighter pilot, I know a little bit about capabilities—that was built by a domestic company, but began to fail in cold weather. Think about that. You are a fighter pilot. You have been called to engage with the enemy. You have got them in your sight. b1645 You hit the pickle button and the missile fails on you; puts your life at risk and the risk of air superiority and our military capabilities and the military mission. In that circumstance, the domestic company was unable to solve the problem, so we turned to a backup company in Norway. Our NATO ally, Norway, stepped in to fill the production gap for the AMRAAM program, which produces missiles we sell to dozens of our partner nations to guarantee air superiority in any contingency. Without our foreign partner, the AMRAAM program could have been shut down for up to 5 years. Instead, we turned around a 2year production lag and put the missile program ahead of schedule. If this amendment passes, it will put a dangerous pause on this critical air toair missile program, risking air superiority for us and our allies. If the domestic producer, which will benefit from this amendment, wants its rocket motors back on the AMRAAM missile, they need to fix their quality issues and compete when the shortfalls are addressed instead of asking Congress to take up the slack with an earmarklike amendment like this one. The amendment puts parochial interests above what is best for our fighter pilots, our warfighters, and our military readiness. That is not right, and we owe it to our troops to shoot it down. In closing, the Department of Defense, the Navy and the Air Force have all expressed strong opposition to this amendment. The Pentagon believes this language would require significant program investment and ultimately result in increased program costs that will be passed on to the taxpayer or come at the expense of other important defense spending and readiness, which we are trying to fix in this bill today. We simply cannot afford it. Current law already provides the authority for the Department of Defense to address this issue. Mandating two vendors is merely a clever effort to essentially put an earmark for a specific 
defense company into this bill. This same amendment was debated last year, but it was dropped in conference. It will ultimately harm our warfighters in a time that we need to be giving them every advantage, ensuring the equipment that they have is reliable. I strongly urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on this amendment. Mr. MCKINLEY. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have? The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from West Virginia has 2
1⁄4minutes remaining. Mr. MCKINLEY. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Let’s try to clarify this. And I do appreciate the remarks of my colleague. We are talking about a situation that when the performance specification was changed, there was a problem. I recognize that. But the problem here, or the issue here is that the defense already was embarking on going overseas to find a supplier before there were any problems that had surfaced with this. This has been cleared. We understand that. Now, let’s go further with this. We are not talking about just an American firm. There are two, possibly there could be another one that could emerge, three or four. Remember, we used to have far more rocket motor manufacturers in America. We are down to two now. Now, maybe there is going to be a foreign corporation, someone else that surfaces with this. We know there are others. But it just seems patently shortsighted for us in America, with all this purchasing power that we have, to limit ourselves to one supplier, one supplier. So what we are saying is, fulfill the specifications, find out whether or not you can get another firm as qualified to be able to do this, whether it is foreign or domestic. But let’s have competition. For the American public and our defense and our spending, I think it is a fiscally responsible thing to do to try to find a way to be responsible in our dollars. So it may be an American firm. Quite frankly, I hope it is. And then we can stimulate our declining industrial defense base. But if it is someone else, at least we are going to find we have competition. And unless I am wrong, I always thought that the American way was finding competition to be able to compete with us. This amendment gives us an opportunity. Since 2009, our government has come out with report after report after report after report that there is a problem. We need to address it. But they have done nothing other than outsourcing this material. I think it is time that we take action, we allow an opportunity for a second firm to compete. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. MCKINLEY). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. MCKINLEY. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from West Virginia will be postponed. The Committee will rise informally. The Speaker pro tempore (Mr. HOLDING) assumed the chair. 
FURTHER MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE A further message from the Senate by Ms. Byrd, one of its clerks, announced that the Senate has passed a bill of the following title in which the concurrence of the House is requested: 
S. 2040. An act to deter terrorism, provide justice for victims, and for other purposes. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Committee will resume its sitting. 
NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2017 The Committee resumed its sitting. 
The Acting CHAIR (Mr. R OTHFUS ). It is now in order to consider amendment No. 11 printed in part B of House Report 114–569. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of subtitle B of title IX, add the following new section: 
Mr. Chairman, today we had a hearing. We had called Ben Rhodes to come testify to this hearing. But then, claiming executive privilege, Neil Eggleston, the General Counsel, said this person could not come. Ben Rhodes goes and talks to the media, he talks to his echo chamber. Ben Rhodes will go out and do public speaking. He will do everything except come testify in front of Congress, and then hides behind this shield that does not allow for openness and transparency. We want an NSC that helps make policy and direct operations and should be publicly accountable, if that is what they are going to be doing. The President has a choice. Keep the NSC small and advisory to maintain the status quo. That is what it was originally intended to do, but it has gone far more than that. It has become a public relations machine. It has become something that is problematic at every level. I think Chairman THORNBERRY is exactly right. I think all of our colleagues should support this amendment. It is the right thing to do, and I stand in whole support of it. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY ). Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Chair, H.L. Mencken once said that for every human problem there is a solution that is simple, neat, and wrong. I have a lot of sympathy for Mr. THORNBERRY ’s amendment and for what is behind it. He talks about micromanagement. Micromanagement goes back to the very founding of the National Security Council. You think that Richard Nixon’s Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense didn’t think Henry Kissinger micromanaged when he was the National Security Adviser? He surreptitiously altered the U.S. policy to China, on his own, with his staff at NSC. There is a long tradition of micromanagement and interference, and I have no doubt that Mr. THORNBERRY is right. Every Secretary of Defense and every Secretary of State would have a similar complaint. Of course they would, and they might be right. To elevate this job over 100 people, to Senate confirmation, actually aggravates the problem. Now you are going to codify the micromanagement. You are actually going to make this a policymaking apparatus, in direct competition with the very department you are trying to help, the Department of Defense and the Department of State. It is the wrong answer to the growing size of an NSC. I don’t remember Republican complaints about the growth of the NSC under the previous administration, and maybe we can work together in the future to try to make sure that we have a more manageable size. I applaud, certainly, the fact that the current NSC administrator has reduced the NSC by 12 percent. I know we can do better. But I don’t think this amendment is the way to do it, respectfully. b1700 Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I would inform the gentleman that I have no further speakers and am prepared to close on this side if the gentleman is. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time just to reiterate the argument. The National Security Council was formed for the very specific purpose of allowing the President to have that type of confidential advisement where people could speak frankly and give the President the advice that he needs to make decisions on matters of national security. Regrettably, our national security environment has grown more complex. I will point out that the current National Security Adviser has actually shrunk the size of the National Security Council since she took over. It was 411, and it is now down to 365. So they are making efforts to get that under control. But to shrink this to 100 and, as Mr. CONNOLLY pointed out, to make it subject to Senate confirmation would simply lock it in as a competing force to the very entities that the sponsor of this amendment would like to see have a greater voice, and therefore it would be counterproductive and would not achieve its goal even though, again, I certainly agree that there should be greater transparency. I don’t think there is a Member of Congress who has not complained at some point throughout the history about the lack of transparency between the White House and Congress on matters of national security. That battle will continue whether this amendment passes or not. I don’t think this amendment will advance the interests of national security, and, therefore, I oppose it. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Chairman, this amendment does not require any President to do anything. There is a choice, and the choice that any President will face is, if you go above a certain number, then I think common sense tells us that these folks are doing more than advising; they are in operations. As a matter of fact, the former Under Secretary of Defense for Policy in the Obama administration Pentagon, Ms. Flournoy, has testified that, as the staffs grow, they tend to get more into operational details and tactical kinds of oversight. Historically, when you have had smaller national security staffs—for example, the Scowcroft era—they had a very clear understanding of what their role was. This is a matter of common sense. Absolutely, there are no guarantees. You might have one person who would try to direct; but, generally, the more people you have got, the more stuff they are going to try to micromanage. So I don’t prevent a President from doing anything with this amendment. I simply say that it is a choice. You can have 100 people or fewer and not go before the Senate. If you have more than that, you have got to get Senate confirmed like the Director of OMB is now. I think that is what makes sense. I hope Members will support the amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORNBERRY ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 12 OFFERED BY MR . NADLER  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 12 printed in part B of House Report 114–569. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 732, the gentleman from New York (Mr. NADLER ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would strike sections 1032 and 1033 of the bill, which prohibit the use of funds to transfer detainees from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to the United States or to construct or expand any facility in the U.S. to house any individual currently detained at Guantanamo. Simply put, the section is designed to prevent the closure of the detention facility at Guantanamo and to make it as difficult as possible to transfer detainees to a different facility. My amendment is intended to do the opposite and to finally bring to a close a shameful chapter of American history. The President’s Statement of Administration Policy says the following: ‘‘The administration strongly objects to several provisions of the bill that relate to the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. As the administration has said many times before, operating this facility weakens our national security by draining resources, damaging our relationships with key allies and partners, and emboldening violent extremists. In February, the administration submitted a comprehensive plan to safely and responsibly close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and to bring this chapter of our history to a close. Rather than taking steps to close the facility, this bill aims to extend its operation. Sections 1032 and 1033 would continue to prohibit the use of funds to transfer Guantanamo detainees to the 
United States or even to construct or modify any facility in the United States to house detainees. These restrictions would limit the ability of the executive branch to take the steps necessary to develop alternative locations for a detention facility, and from fulfilling its commitment to close the facility at Guantanamo.’’ Mr. Chairman, it is truly astonishing that in 2016 the United States continues to hold people indefinitely who have not been charged, let alone convicted, of any crime and who, in some cases, have been judged not to pose any threat to the United States. By continuing to hold prisoners indefinitely without charging them and without trial is inconsistent with our professed support of liberty. Now, I know some will say the detainees are dangerous terrorists, and some undoubtedly are. But some of them are not. They are merely people who were captured in some way but who have not been charged or judged as terrorists. Some of them are simply victims of the fact that the United States paid bounties to people in Afghanistan years ago to turn in people who they said were terrorists. The Hatfields turned in the McCoys because— why not? We were giving them a bounty of a few thousand dollars a head. For the truly dangerous, we ought to prosecute them and, if convicted, punish them appropriately. We have, for those who need it, supermax prisons in the United States from which no one has ever escaped. There is no reason to spend so much money in Guantanamo and have this continuing shame on the reputation of the United States. Speaking of money, GTMO is the world’s most expensive prison by far. We are spending about $2.9 million annually per prisoner. It costs us less than $35,000 per prisoner to hold someone in a supermax facility in the United States. Frankly, they don’t deserve the spending. We should be spending that money here in the United States, not on terrorists, but on teachers or maybe on defense. No one will argue that that money could not be spent better somewhere else. Finally, Mr. Chairman, I include in the RECORD a letter signed by more than 30 retired generals urging the Congress to responsibly close the detention facility at Guantanamo. They quote President George Bush when he said that the facility had become a ‘‘propaganda tool for our enemies.’’ MARCH 1, 2016. Senator JOHNMCCAIN, Chairman, Senate Armed Services Committee, Russell Senate Building, Washington, DC. Senator JACKREED, Ranking Member, Senate Armed Service Committee, Russell Senate Building, Washington, DC. Representative MACTHORNBERRY , Chairman, House Armed Services Committee, Rayburn House Office Building, Washington, DC. Representative ADAMSMITH, Ranking Member, House Armed Services Committee, Rayburn House Office Building. Washington, DC. DEAR CHAIRMEN AND RANKING MEMBERS : For over seven years we, a group of retired flag and general officers of the United States Armed Forces, have advocated the responsible closure of the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay. We have done this because it is what is best for our country. It is in our national security interests, and above all, it is about reestablishing who we are as a country. Last week the administration presented its plan for closing the Guantanamo Bay detention facility. As the chairmen and ranking members of the House and Senate Armed Service Committees, yours is a solemn responsibility. We write to encourage you to use this plan as a foundation to come together and find a path to finally shutter the detention facility. This should not be a political issue. Former President George W. Bush determined that Guantanamo should be closed because, in his words, ‘‘. . . the detention facility had become a propaganda tool for our enemies and a distraction for our allies. I worked to find a way to close the prison without compromising security.’’ The current plan similarly seeks to achieve that objective, following the advice of our nation’s top military, intelligence, and law enforcement leaders. Closing Guantanamo will not be easy, but it is the right thing to do, and we call on you to work together to accomplish it. We take heart that our nation has elected people who will exercise their conscientious judgment, but who will not allow politics to obscure courage. Compromise for the common good is the true exercise of leadership and courage. Sincerely, General Charles Krulak, USMC (Ret); Vice Admiral Richard H. Carmona, USPHS (Ret.); Lieutenant General Robert G. Gard, Jr., USA (Ret.); Lieutenant General Richard L. Kelly, USMC (Ret.); Lieutenant General Charles Otstott, USA (Ret.); Lieutenant General Keith J. Stalder, USMC (Ret.); Major General Eugene Fox, USA (Ret.); Rear Admiral John D. Hutson, JAGC, USN (Ret.); Major General Michael R. Lehnert, USMC (Ret.); Major General Eric T. Olson, USA (Ret.); Major General Walter L. Stewart, Jr., USA (Ret.); Major General Margaret Woodward, USAF (Ret.); Brigadier General David M. Brahms, USMC (Ret.); Brigadier General James P. Cullen, USA (Ret.). General David M. Maddox, USA (Ret.); Lieutenant General John Castellaw, USMC (Ret.); Vice Admiral Lee F. Gunn, USN (Ret.); Lieutenant General Claudia J. Kennedy, USA (Ret.); Lieutenant General Norman R. Seip, USAF (Ret.); Major General Paul D. Eaton, USA (Ret.); Rear Admiral Don Guter, JAGC, USN (Ret.); Major General Carl B. Jensen, USMC (Ret.); Major General William L. Nash, USA (Ret.); Major General Thomas J. Romig, USA (Ret.); Major General Antonio M. Taguba, USA (Ret.); Brigadier General John Adams, USA (Ret.); Brigadier General Stephen A. Cheney, USMC (Ret.); Brigadier General Evelyn P. Foote, USA (Ret.). Brigadier General Alan K. Fry, USA (Ret.); Brigadier General David R. Irvine, USA (Ret.); Brigadier General Richard O’Meara, USA (Ret.); Brigadier General Daniel P. Woodward, USAF (Ret.); Brigadier General Leif H. Hendrickson, USMC (Ret.); Brigadier General John H. Johns, USA (Ret.); Brigadier General Murray G. Sagsveen, USA (Ret.); Brigadier General Stephen N. Xenakis, USA (Ret.). Mr. NADLER. So, again, for all these reasons—it weakens our security, it drains our resources, it emboldens our enemies, and it is contrary to liberty and everything that we stand for—I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and to lift these restrictions on closing the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay. If people must be kept in prison, then they can be kept here a heck of a lot more cheaply and without subjecting us to the continued propaganda against Guantanamo. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. WALORSKI ), a distinguished member of the Armed Services Committee. Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to the gentleman’s amendment. Mr. Chairman, I want to take particular issue with a point made by the gentleman from New York. He is saying we can’t afford to keep Guantanamo open. I stand here today and declare to you that we can’t afford to close it. Let’s look at the numbers. According to SOUTHCOM, which runs the detention facility, the annual operating cost is just over $100 million. However, according to this administration’s own figures, the cost to renovate a facility in the United States is nearly half a billion dollars, not including the annual operating costs. Mr. Chairman, what is the life of an American worth? Is the gentleman from New York willing to stand here and have that conversation? I don’t think so. This is a misguided amendment that would not make Americans safer. It is in the best interests of our national security to keep Guantanamo Bay open, and, as the numbers show, it is also in the best interests of the American taxpayer. I just also want to respond to another quick comment over here where he talked about some of those people are just merely detained. I just want to remind us in this Chamber that these are the worst of the worst. These are the most hardened terrorists the world has ever seen, and, more importantly, they have the blood of Americans on their hands and should be kept in a safe facility where they are. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues reject this amendment. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining? 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New York has 1 minute remaining. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Chairman, we have heard again the mantra from the other side: These people are the worst of the worst. They have American blood on their hands. Some of them may, but many of them don’t. They have not been tried. I don’t know with what authority you say they are the worst of the worst; they have American blood on their hands. True of some, not of others. What kind of system is it for the United States to simply take people, not try them, not accuse them, and hold them indefinitely because somebody says that they are the worst of the worst? On what authority and on what proof? As for the funding, it costs between $3 million and $5 million—$2.9 million here in 2013, closer to $5 million now— per person per year. It costs $35,000 to hold someone in a supermax facility. I don’t know why we have to build new supermax facilities, but if we do, we should. The point is it is incredibly expensive to keep them there for no reason. Again, some of those people ought to be tried and sentenced to life imprisonment or whatever, some of them ought to be freed. Some of them have been judged not to be, have already been found not to be a danger to the United States. Simply repeating over and over again that they are all the worst of the worst, they all have American blood on their hands, when it is simply not true—some of them yes, some of them no—does not make the case. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from Ohio (Mr. WENSTRUP ) of the Armed Services Committee. Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the Nadler amendment because the amendment would allow detainees currently housed at Guantanamo to be transferred to the United States. Why? Why do you want to do that, to endanger our communities? That is what I ask, Mr. Chairman. I served at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. We were attacked three, four times a week. Why? To try to release these prisoners. We have seen that our enemy is capable of planning and, in some instances, launching attacks within the United States. Currently, this move is not allowed. We asked the President for details on a plan. It was said that it was comprehensive. It didn’t say where they would be housed or what the housing would entail or how much it would cost the taxpayer. This was not a serious plan. What we do need, however, is a consistent policy on how to deal with future terrorist detainees. I would agree with that. Guantanamo remains our best option right now. It is a safe and appropriate location to hold detainees. It is secure and distant from our homeland. Guantanamo also provides humane conditions for the detainees. They have appropriate access to health care, the same as our troops have there. They have recreational activities, culture, and religious materials. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from Kansas (Mr. POMPEO ), who serves on the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Mr. POMPEO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the Nadler amendment as well. These are, in fact, the worst of the worst. The detainees that remain now, well under 100, are not cooks and bottle washers, but serious men who meant to do serious harm to the United States. I want to spend the time that I have talking about a particularly pernicious argument that has been made in favor of closing this facility. It is an argument that says that these men attacked America because of the existence of Guantanamo Bay. It is inaccurate, it is false, and the facts don’t support that claim. Indeed, we have evidence, 34 translated messages from al Qaeda, from terrorists, talking about the reasons for their attacks, and only 7 times was Guantanamo Bay ever mentioned. It was mentioned in each case as a glancing issue. Iraq, Afghanistan, and even the Crusades were mentioned hundreds of times, but Guantanamo Bay is not the reason that they attacked America. I can tell you that we wrote a letter to the Director of National Intelligence, Mr. Clapper. He, too, confirmed that this is not a motivation for the attacks. We should remember that these attacks began well before the existence of Guantanamo Bay. The fact that Guantanamo Bay acts as an agent to promote terrorism is false and must be rejected, as must this amendment. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from Colorado (Mr. COFFMAN), who is a member of the House Armed Services Committee. Mr. COFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong opposition to this amendment. The Obama administration’s efforts to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay are both irresponsible and dangerous. A report from January of this year by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence indicates that the number of Guantanamo detainees released by the Obama administration and suspected of returning to the battlefield has doubled since the last recidivism report in 2015. Those who remain in Guantanamo Bay are the worst of the worst; so it is safe to presume that, if released, an even higher percentage of them would remain a threat to our national security. These are not U.S. citizens. They are foreign, unlawful enemy combatants that have directly supported hostilities against the United States and our allies. b1715 Mr. Chairman, I have and will continue to oppose any attempt to transfer these detainees to my home State of Colorado or to any other State. They must be kept at Guantanamo Bay. The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. THORNBERRY. I yield the gentleman an additional 10 seconds. Mr. COFFMAN. Congress has a responsibility to the American people to ensure that these unlawful enemy combatants are not brought to the United States. Mr. Chairman, these congressional restrictions must remain in place. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, how much time does the other side have remaining? The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas has 45 seconds remaining. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. HARTZLER ), the chair of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee. Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Chairman, it is reckless to propose this amendment. Not only does it allow them to come here on our own shores and live in our own neighborhoods, but the administration has estimated it would cost potentially $475 million just to move them here. It also removes the prohibition that these detainees could be transferred to Somalia, Libya, and Syria. We do not want these terrorists released back onto the battlefield where they could kill our soldiers. This is a reckless amendment. It needs to be defeated. We need to keep them at GTMO, use our taxpayer dollars wisely, and ensure the safety of our neighborhoods. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. NADLER ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO . 13 OFFERED BY MRS . WALORSKI  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 13 printed in part B of House Report 114–569. Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of subtitle E of title X, add the following: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 732, the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. WALORSKI ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Indiana. Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today to offer an amendment which addresses both the incredibly important role played by the President’s National Security Council, but also the concerning trend of consolidation of authority in the White House. Over the past two administrations, the NSC has transformed from simply a coordination and advisory body to something else entirely. We recently heard from President Obama’s three former Secretaries of Defense—Gates, Panetta, and Hagel— each outlining the challenges they faced in trying to manage the Defense Department and combat operations in the face of a more intrusive NSC. Most notably, Secretary Gates said: ‘‘It was the operational micromanagement that drove me nuts of White House and NSC (National Security Council) staffers calling senior commanders in the field . . . second guessing commanders.’’ The NSC was never intended to operate in this manner. It was intended to be an advisory body and interagency coordination center for the President. However, its size has exploded from roughly 100 staffers under President Clinton, to 200 under President Bush, and now 400 under President Obama. Moving decisionmaking away from the departments undermines the authority of Secretaries and General officers who have been confirmed by the Senate and concentrates power with unelected, unconfirmed, and unaccountable bureaucrats who care more about optics and narratives. This is best illustrated in the recent profile of Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes, who has a master’s in creative writing and no practical experience in foreign policy. Mr. Chairman, the National Security Council has moved far beyond its original advisory role to one in which NSC staffers make critical operational decisions. My amendment simply restores accountability to this operational organization by requiring the NSC to participate in the Freedom of Information Act, or FOIA, upon coordination of the National Security Advisor by the Senate. Bringing the NSC under FOIA is not without precedent. The NSC actually maintained a FOIA program and complied with requests under Presidents Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush, and Clinton. However, a 1996 court case ruled that, since it was an advisory body, it did not need to participate. The NSC is not simply an advisory body anymore. It is time to bring it back under FOIA and shine light on its activities. This amendment fits well into Chairman THORNBERRY ’s broader NSC reform efforts. I thank him for making this a priority in this year’s NDAA. As the chairman outlined earlier, these provisions will make it clear to future administrations that the NSC cannot continue to just grow in size and mission without consequential oversight measures. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORNBERRY ), the esteemed chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. Mr. Chairman, the gentlewoman makes the point very well that, at a certain point, you get enough people that the institution of the National Security Council staff takes on different characteristics. When it has those different characteristics, then you have to comply with FOIA, then you have to be confirmed by the Senate, and then you have to be able to come before Congress and justify the decisions that you have made. That is the point with both of our amendments, that there comes a point that basic nature changes and there are implications of that, including the one that is related to the gentlewoman’s amendment. I support her amendment, and I hope Members will support it. Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for his strong support. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Montana (Mr. ZINKE), my friend and colleague on the Armed Services Committee. Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to support my colleague from Indiana’s amendment. The amendment is simply about restoring public accountability and transparency to the National Security Council. As a former Deputy Commander of Special Operations in Iraq, I have personally seen what happens. Oftentimes, our rules of engagement that dictate how we fight are politicized and it diminishes our ability to fight. I have seen it. It is time to change. If they move out of an advisory role to a role where they are commanding and interpreting commands, then we need FOIA. America deserves accountability. America deserves our ability to look at who is calling the shots and why. This is not a hit on the administration. This is an American issue. When a role is advisory and comes from advisory to command, then that command needs to be held accountable. That is what we do. Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from Montana. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, none of what has been said really changes under these amendments. What all this really is is an argument to get rid of the NSC, to say that this group of folks should not exist. As we argued before, the reason the National Security Council was created was to offer the President close and confidential advice. Now, that National Security Council, as was pointed out by other people who have made arguments about this, has consistently been criticized by the other Departments, going all the way back, I imagine, to when the NSC was formed. Whether there is 100, 200, or 300 of them, that really doesn’t change that basic conflict. Do you believe the President needs these confidential advisers? If you do, then you should oppose these amendments. They should get rid of the NSC. If you are going to take away the advice and their ability to do that, then we should just have the DOD and the President shouldn’t have these advisers. But there is a reason the NSC was created in the first place, to give the President those close advisers. Further restricting it in this manner effectively eliminates the NSC. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Chairman, this is absolutely not an amendment to get rid of the NSC. This just simply brings accountability and transparency into a very important agency, into a White House that has taken this to no longer just an advisory agency role on behalf of the American people who we serve. I ask my colleagues to support this amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. WALORSKI ). The amendment was agreed to.

AMENDMENT NO . 38 OFFERED BY MS . DELBENE  
OF WASHINGTON  At the end of subtitle F of title V (page 156, after line 23), add the following new section: 
I agree with the finding that acrossthe board cuts to the defense civilian workforce are not the answer. However, it is important to note, that all areas of the workforce do not need additional cuts. For example, depots had already taken a greater percentage cut than the military and now we find ourselves in the unfortunate position that for military readiness purposes—for the absolute necessity of supporting our warfighter—we are in the position of requiring some of our Air Logistics Complexes to hire over 1,000 additional personnel per year for a 2 year period. In fact, this bill contains a provision which will provide direct hire authority so that the services can hire the people they need, quickly and efficiently. Sometimes in our zeal to limit or cut our civilians, we lose sight of the mission and make assumptions that are not rooted in fact. Again, I want to commend and thank our outstanding civilian workforce and particularly those who live and work in the great State of Oklahoma for their skill and their dedication to the military mission. Their contributions to our great country should be acknowledged and commended. Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, Chairman MAC THORNBERRY , and Ranking Member A DAM SMITH, I rise in support of Rules Amendment Number 161 to H.R. 4909, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal year 2017. However, I would first like to thank you for your thoughtful approach in writing this year’s bill; it was not an easy task. The particular focus on endforce readiness restoration is to be commended; we cannot ask members of the armed forces to defend their country and democracy without adequately outfitting and training the soldier, unit and force. Additionally, I am pleased to see the NDAA’s approach toward much needed acquisition reform, healthcare reform, Goldwater Nichols reform and more. However, as we debate today it is incumbent on us as Members of Congress to continue the discussion about the right mix of active duty, civilian and contractors at the Department of Defense. The recent uniformed military drawdown has not been accompanied by an equivalent reduction of either the civilian or contractor work force as in drawdowns in the past. A large, disproportionate, and duplicative work force coupled with bureaucratic, structural inefficiencies has detracted from the Pentagon’s production of combat power and its ability to modernize. Right sizing the civilian workforce must be multifaceted, statutory in number, and implemented with executive discretion. Across the board cuts to the defense civilian workforce are not the answer. Spending on contract services is over 50 percent of all Department of Defense purchases even as the total defense budget has dropped. Expenditures in service contracting lack appropriate oversight, accountability, and scrutiny. However, no proper approach to addressing the civilian workforce may be accomplished without first understanding who these civilian workers are, where they are located, and what jobs they are performing. My amendment, Rules Committee Number 161, seeks a report by the Department of Defense on the total civilian workforce picture. In the past, reports have been requested but are fragmented in nature. The report I am requesting will require a projection from fiscal years 2017 through 2020 of Full Time Equivalent (FTE) and contractor employees broken down into several subcategories including location, job function, General Schedule (GS) level, and date of when the job was created. As we debate the Fiscal Year 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), it is incumbent on us as Members of Congress to continue the discussion about the right mix of active duty, civilian and contractors at DoD. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chair, I rise to express my concern with certain aspects of the Calvert amendment that is included in part of the en bloc amendments to the Fiscal Year 2017 National Defense Authorization Act that we will pass by voice vote. My colleague from California has every right to attempt to catalogue the quantity of civilian and contractors within the Department of Defense. But I must object to his characterization of our civilian defense employees’ roles. I am lucky enough to represent nearly 80,000 federal employees, many of whom work at the Pentagon, Joint Base MyerHenderson Hall, Fort Belvoir, or one of the myriad Department of Defense installations around Northern Virginia. This includes ground breaking work at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, important work to keep us safe at Defense Threat Reduction Agency, and the jobs supplying our military with the tools it needs at the Defense Logistics Agency. Our nation, its people, and its defenses would not by possible without the dedicated work of these individuals. Mr. CALVERT ’s effort to categorize these civilian defense employees as disproportionate or duplicative undermines the incredible work they do every day to keep our military running. The ability to produce combat power, modernize, and keep our troops healthy and safe are critical functions at the Department of Defense. Moreover, they are critical functions performed by highly intelligent, accomplished, and dedicated civilian employees. Our civilian workforce has already weathered years of uncertain budgets, pay freezes, a government shutdown, and sequester furloughs. We should not further demean the important work they do with this amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendments en bloc offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORN BERRY ). The en bloc amendments were agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 14 OFFERED BY MR . POE OF  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 14 printed in part B of House Report 114–569. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
BY MR . POE OF TEXAS  Page 394, after line 5, insert the following: 
Mr. POE of Texas (during the reading). Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent that the modification be considered as read. The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the modification? There was no objection. b1730 Mr. POE of Texas. I thank the chairman of the full committee. Mr. Chair, this amendment is very similar to amendments that have been on this House floor before, presented by me and others, and is similar to an amendment that passed unanimously in the FY 2015 NDAA. It is called the SEND Act. It addresses the process of sending excess military equipment, which is not being used, to our border security folks to help them secure the border. That is the purpose of previous 
amendments and legislation that started all the way back in 2011. One way that the Department of Defense helps the Border Patrol is through the transfer of equipment that it deems to be in excess to its needs. Under current law, the transfer of this excess equipment gives some preference to counterdrug, counterterrorism, and some border security activities. This amendment simply takes that preference a step further, giving border security preference for a few specific pieces of equipment which are particularly useful for border security applications: unmanned surveillance vehicles, including aerostat blimps that are now being used, night vision goggles, and Humvees. The Border Patrol, as we all know, is the first and last line of defense against criminal gangs that come into the United States. In my home State of Texas, I have been to the border numerous times, and we have the same issue that other border States have with the criminal drug cartels, which are involved in not only bringing drugs into the United States, but in trafficking humans for sex slavery, labor slavery, and other purposes. After talking with them about many, many issues, we found out the situation on the border regarding equipment. A Texas ranger once told me that the drug cartels outman, outgun, outfinance, and outequip the Border Patrol and those who are on the border who are trying to protect us from those criminal gangs that are coming into the United States. One of the issues the last time I was down at the border 2 or 3 weeks ago was that the Border Patrol was actually excited about these aerostats that are being used. That is a blimp that they put up in the sky, and it helps in surveillance along the border. They need more of those on the border. Of course, this amendment does exactly that. It gives a preference to those specific items that are mentioned in the amendment for the Border Patrol to use for border security purposes. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. O’ROURKE. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the gentleman’s amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. O’ROURKE. Mr. Chair, I yield myself 3 minutes. This amendment is a solution in search of a problem. In fact, I think it will exacerbate some of the security problems we already have. As the gentleman knows, the border security agencies can already apply for this excess military equipment, but I ask those representatives who represent the people who live on the U.S. side of the U.S.Mexico border—cities like San Diego, California; Nogales, Arizona; El Paso, Laredo, and Brownsville, Texas—whether they want UAVs, or unmanned aerial vehicles, which could also be MQ–9 Reapers, flying over their homes, their schools, their neighborhoods, prying into their backyards each and every day. This is at a time when we are already spending $18 billion a year to secure our border with Mexico and when we are seeing less than zero migration from Mexico itself. In the year 2000, we had 1.6 million apprehensions. This last year, we didn’t even reach 400,000 apprehensions. Of any border of which we are told by the Director of the National Counterterrorism Center, by the Director of the FBI, by the Secretary of Homeland Security that there has never been nor is there now a terrorist, a terrorist organization, or a terrorist plot that is seeking to exploit the border with Mexico, what this does is further takes our eye off the ball where we have known risks and known threats to this country and to the homeland. It stokes fear and anxiety and, in some cases, hatred towards our neighbor to the south, towards those communities on the U.S. side of the U.S.Mexico border—communities like my own El Paso, Texas, which happens to be the safest city in the United States today. Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment that does not solve any problems and, I argue, would make some of the security issues that we already have worse. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Chair, the first thing is that this amendment does not include the MQ–9 Reaper that the gentleman mentioned. It does not make a preference for that. I also take exception to the ‘‘hatred’’ comment that was made here. Look, the border security in the United States has issues. The Border Patrol says we need to help find those illegal gangs that are coming into the United States. This is not about the surveillance of Americans and spying on Americans. It is on the border. I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CUELLAR ), who represents part of the Texas border, the city of Laredo. Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Chair, I do support Mr. POE’s amendment. With all due respect to my good friend, we do want to secure the border. We just want to do it in the right way. While some people are talking about securing the border with a wall—a 14th century solution—I think if we use the aerostats, we can provide coverage and surveillance to make sure that we secure the border. In fact, in south Texas, including in my district, we have five of those aerostats right now. The communities support them. The Border Patrol certainly supports them. In fact, in appropriations, I am asking for five new aerostats so we can go ahead and secure the border. Each aerostat covers about 20 miles. So if you want to cover the border—1,954 miles of border—divided by 20, with about 97 or 98 aerostats, minus the 5 that we already have in place, we will secure the border in an electronic way. This also helps us secure the border on the Mexico side. In talking to the Border Patrol, they have used some of that information because they can go 20 miles into Mexico, and already we have coordinated some of those activities with the Mexican law enforcement officials to stop those drug gangs before they come over to the U.S. You turn the camera 20 miles into Mexico, and with about 97 aerostats, we can secure the whole border. Again, I support this amendment, and I thank the gentleman very much for yielding. Mr. O’ROURKE. Mr. Chair, I inquire as to how much time remains on my side. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. O’ROURKE ) has 3 minutes remaining. Mr. O’ROURKE. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. JOHNSON ). Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. I thank the gentleman from Texas. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the Poe amendment. This amendment would expand the military’s authority under the 1033 program to flood our streets with surplus battleready military equipment straight from the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan. Specifically, this amendment would allow the Defense Department to transfer equipment, such as the MQ–9 Reaper drone, to Federal and State law enforcement agencies. This is a cynical attack, cloaked in the name of border security on President Obama’s executive order, that limits the proliferation of military equipment within the borders of America. Typically, the 1033 program feeds more than $4.3 billion in surplus military grade weaponry, including armored vehicles and tanks, into the United States annually. Now we have Republicans looking to expand the type of weaponry that is distributed to law enforcement under the 1033 program to include military drones. While border security should remain at the forefront of our political discourse, the use of Grim Reaper drones and other military equipment to track and hunt down human beings is not the answer. An increase in manpower, training and facilities, not MQ–9 Reapers, is the way that we should go about our efforts in protecting our borders without sacrificing our values of respect for basic human rights and dignity. Moreover, allowing military equipment, such as predator drones, into America’s airspace puts Americans at risk. Federal agencies have already lost hundreds of guns and grenade launchers that have been donated to police departments, and many of these weapons have shown up for sale on eBay or have been reported stolen. I don’t want to see this happen with equipment, such as military drones, being doled out to border security. 
Further, the militarization of our State and Federal border security agencies will make the border more volatile and not safe. Therefore, I rise in opposition, and I ask my colleagues to support me in my opposition. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Chair, how much time remains on my side? The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. POE) has 30 seconds remaining. Mr. POE of Texas. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. O’ROURKE. Mr. Chair, the gentleman from Texas says that the MQ–9 Reaper is not specifically addressed in this amendment. However, UAVs are— unmanned aerial vehicles—and the MQ–9 is one of them. The point that I am trying to make is that we do not need to further militarize the border at a time when it is safer than it has ever been and when, in fact, U.S. cities on the U.S. side of the U.S.Mexico border are far safer than the average city in the interior of this country. If we need to send surplus military equipment elsewhere, let it be prioritized based on need, based on known threat. When we send security resources where we don’t have proven threats, we take them away from where we do. That makes this country less safe. I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time. The government already has a plan to send excess equipment to law enforcement. What this bill does is prioritize that equipment to the Border Patrol. For those concerned about national spying that takes place in the United States, which they claim, they would support this because its priority is to the border. It is not to other agencies. The gentleman from Laredo said it best. Mr. Chair, believe it or not, we cooperate with the Mexican Government, and they get information from us when we use those aerostats over the border, and they capture the bad guys before they come into the United States. We need to support this amendment, prioritize it, and give them the equipment that they need. And that is just the way it is. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment, as modified, offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. POE). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment, as modified, offered by the gentleman from Texas will be postponed. AMENDMENT NO . 16 OFFERED BY MR . KELLY OF  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 16 printed in part B of House Report 114–569. Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 732, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. KELLY ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania. Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of amendment No. 16, to prohibit the use of funds to dismantle the U.S. stockpile of antipersonnel landmines, APLs, unless the Secretary of Defense submits a report to Congress on the operational alternatives to APLs. Further, my amendment contains an exception for the destruction of APLs that would be unsafe to store. This amendment would effectively renew the ban that was passed by the full Congress and signed into law by the President in Public Law No. 114–92, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016. Mr. Chair, our military commanders have spoken clearly regarding the value and the need for APLs. On March 6, 2014, the United States’ highest ranking military officer, Martin Dempsey, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, called antipersonnel landmines an important tool in the arsenal of the United States. b1745 When he was head of the U.S. European Command, General Wesley Clark agreed, saying that ‘‘our field commanders count on APLs to protect the force, influence, maneuver, and shape the battle space, and mass combat power for decisive engagement.’’ He also added that the need for APLs was increasing. Furthermore, two major studies, one conducted by the National Research Council and the other by NATO, have concluded that APLs provide crucial tactical advantages on the battlefield. Yet on September 29, 2014, President Obama announced that outside of the Korean Peninsula, the U.S. would not use APLs in order to ‘‘underscore its commitment to the spirit and humanitarian aims of the Ottawa Convention.’’ The President’s actions were, by his own admission, taken to move the U.S. towards full compliance with a treaty, commonly known as the Ottawa Convention, to which the Senate has not given its advice and consent. Moreover, this was created by an NGO led process that openly sought to ‘‘push aside the central feature of state sovereignty.’’ The process that created the treaty was bad. The treaty has not been approved by the Senate, not signed by the President, and our senior military officials state that it would deprive us of an important weapon. Yet the Obama administration seeks to move us forward in compliance with it. The U.S. has taken action on APLs. We give more funding for APL clearance than any other nation in the world. We are party to amended Protocol II to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, the CCW, which requires U.S. APLs to be designed to deactivate or selfdestruct. Our APLs meet those standards. U.S. APLs are not killing civilians. Like all weapons, APLs can be used rightly or wrongly. When used responsibly, as U.S. APLs are, they protect our forces, the forces of our allies, and civilians alike. Landmine opponents, like the administration, state that the Ottawa Convention ‘‘shows our leadership’’ and that it is reducing the threat of landmines around the world. That is simply not true. Many IEDs, legally speaking, are APLs. From February 2015 to January 2016, the Pentagon’s own Joint ImprovisedThreat Defeat Agency recorded over 50,000 worldwide casualties as a result of IED attacks. The Ottawa Convention isn’t solving the landmine problem; it is simply disarming the good guys. In this environment, we need weapons that can protect camps, cities, roads, and bases 
from insurgent attack. Today, one of those weapons is the APL. Unless we have an alternative to APLs that is equal to or better than APLs at keeping our troops safe, we should not, and dare not, get rid of our stockpile of APLs. The safety of our sons and daughters in uniform is of the utmost importance. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairman THORNBERRY and his staff for working with my office on this important issue. I urge adoption of this amendment. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. HULTGREN ). The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I oppose this amendment because it restricts, the President restricts, the Department of Defense from taking actions that they feel are necessary in the best interest of the national security of our country by prohibiting their ability to get rid of the landmines that they wish to get rid of. The problem with landmines and the reason there was such an international outcry is, after conflicts, they tend to be left in the areas of conflict; and throughout the world, many innocents have wound up being killed by these landmines that are left over. They are a weapon that can indiscriminately hit civilians. I think the IED example is an excellent example of how pernicious these weapons are. They do attack, indiscriminately, civilians and military personnel alike. What the President is attempting to do is to get us to the point we are in compliance with the treaty that was reached. It has not been confirmed by the Senate, that is true. But as Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to decide what weapons we should or should not have. And it is important that they do maintain the exception of Korea, where we have the very specific threat from North Korea, to make sure that we preserve that option. Outside of that, the President and our commanders at the Department of Defense have determined that this option is not one that we need to provide for national security, and it is one that the international community has condemned. We have had attempts—the Geneva Convention and others—at limiting the carnage given by warfare. One of the ways to limit that would be to limit the amount of landmines that are available. That is what the President is attempting to do. This amendment, I believe, would unfairly restrict him in his ability to do that. He has the ability, as Commander in Chief, to make those decisions in consultation with the DOD. This restricts him in a way that I do not support, and I urge this body to oppose the amendment. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chair, I respect the gentleman’s opinion. I understand the President is the Commander in Chief, but I also understand that the APLs, the ones that we use, protect our forces, our friends, and our allies. As far as the danger of them, we lead on landmine clearance, and we have lived up to all the international obligations we have accepted. The landmine ban treaty disarms us, not our enemies. Dismantling our APLs is not showing leadership. Instead, it would be the height of irresponsibility. I know that sometimes in this House we get to the point where politics takes precedence over policy. If, at the end of the day, this House can’t do everything possible to protect our daughters and sons in uniform and our allies and friends around the world—we are the most responsible user of APLs. We are doing more than anybody else to disarm IEDs. The problem comes down to where does the United States stand. We need to stand, and we need to be resolute behind our Armed Forces. That is why I stand strong on this amendment. Make sure the APLs stay in place. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time to close. We are going to make the responsible decisions about what is best to protect our Armed Forces, and I believe the President will do that. This restricts him in one specific area that has not been shown—yes, we are the most responsible users of landmines, but that is not exactly a high bar to jump over. No matter how you use them, no matter where you use them—yes, we are trying to clear them, and I think that is great. But if we didn’t put them out there in the first place, we wouldn’t have to worry about, then, going in there and clearing them. What has been determined by the Department of Defense and by the President is that there are other, better ways to protect our troops that do not unnecessarily endanger civilian populations. That is why the President is going down the path that he is going down. I think he is right to do it, and I think we should reject this amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. KELLY ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 18 OFFERED BY MRS . WALORSKI  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 18 printed in part B of House Report 114–569. Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 732, the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. WALORSKI ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Indiana. Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. My amendment is very common sense. It is as simple in its concept as it is in requirements. My amendment simply increases the transparency and accountability surrounding transfers from Guantanamo Bay by requiring the U.S. and the foreign government receiving the detainee to sign a written memo of understanding outlining the terms of the transfer and to provide copies of that memo to Congress. These transfers are too significant and the stakes are too high for a simple handshake or verbal agreement. As Paul Lewis, the President’s own Special Envoy for Guantanamo Detention Closure, recently confirmed, detainees that were released have returned to the battlefield and killed Americans. The administration, itself, estimates the recidivism rate of detainees at nearly one out of three. In my 4 years on the Armed Services Committee, I have consistently been disappointed by the lack of transparency surrounding these transfers. In its plan for closure of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility that was released in February, the administration insisted it received security assurances and humane treatment assurances from countries receiving detainees. This includes travel restrictions, monitoring, and information sharing. However, in December last year, reports began surfacing that a detainee who was released to Sudan in July 2012 was now in Yemen operating as a senior leader of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, AQAP. Setting aside the fact that a dangerous terrorist was transferred to Sudan in the first place, a state sponsor of terrorism, I requested a classified briefing to find out exactly what type of assurances the administration received from the Sudanese Government that they would keep an eye on this detainee and what punitive measures they took against the Sudanese 
when it was discovered they let him out of their sight. Mr. Chairman, I came away from that briefing with more questions than answers. That is why I am offering this amendment today. A written memo of understanding between the U.S. and the foreign country receiving the detainee will provide a greater degree of transparency and accountability than exists right now. Mr. Chairman, one American casualty is too many. We must do more to ensure that every precaution is taken if and when individuals are transferred from GTMO. By providing this memo to the relevant oversight committees of this body, we take one more step toward real accountability for both the administration and for the foreign nation accepting these detainees. I would like to thank the gentleman from Montana (Mr. ZINKE) for his cosponsorship. I would also like to commend the Senator from Arkansas (Mr. COTTON ) for his work in offering this same requirement in the Senate bill. I include in the RECORD the letters I sent to the administration requesting information on the transfer of detainees, which are the basis for this amendment. 
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES , HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , Washington, DC, December 15, 2015. President BARACK OBAMA , The White House, Washington, DC. DEARPRESIDENT OBAMA : I write with grave concerns about statements you made regarding the detention facility at Guanta ´namo Bay, Cuba during a recent interview with Yahoo News. In particular, I was troubled by your comments on recidivism and on the process for selecting detainees for release. In the interview, you said of released detainees reentering the fight: ‘‘Out of four, five, sixhundred people that get released.. .a handful of them are going to be embittered and still engaging in antiUS activities.’’ However, the Director of National Intelligence identified 196 former detainees as either being confirmed or suspected of returning to the battlefield in its September 2015 Report on the Reengagement of Detainees Formerly Held at Guanta´namo Bay, Cuba. That’s a recidivism rate over 30 percent—this is hardly a handful. At the heart of the issue, however, is not the rate of recidivism, but rather its intensity. One of the 196 is Ibrahim alQosi. He was released in July 2012 to his home country of Sudan, a country designated as a State Sponsor of Terrorism by the State Department. Since his release, he has become a senior leader of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), which took credit for the attack on Charlie Hebdo in Paris in January 2015. A month later, Vincent Stewart, the Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, testified before Congress that AQAP ‘‘remains committed to attacking the West.’’ We may disagree over what constitutes a handful, but we cannot underestimate the difference another set of hands can mean to these terrorist organizations. The fact that alQosi was released to live in a US governmentdesignated State Sponsor of Terrorism is troubling enough, but comments you made in the interview concerning the release vetting process prompts more questions than it answers. On that topic, you said: ‘‘The judgment that we’re continually making is: are there individuals [in Guanta´namo] who are significantly more dangerous than the people who are already out there who are fighting? What do they add? Do they have special skills? Do they have special knowledge that ends up making them a significant threat to the United States?’’ Accordingly, I would like to request a classified briefing on how the administration has been evaluating the remaining detainees for release. Specifically, I would like the briefing to address: 1. What criteria, quantifiable or otherwise, are used to determine if a detainee is more or less dangerous than those currently on the battlefield 2. The groups or specific individuals currently on the battlefield that detainees are being compared to in order to make those determinations a. If the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) or its leaders are part of this set, please also detail how the weight given to the threat they pose has changed since January 2014 3. Flow the special skills and knowledge are defined and quantified 4. Any additional scrutiny given to detainees being released to State Sponsors of Terror It is disturbing that your administration seems to continue underestimating the danger posed by former Guanta´namo detainees returning to the fight. One more terrorist on the battlefield is too many because one more terrorist can be all it takes to cause more death and destruction. I strongly urge you to reconsider such consistent downplaying of this threat and I look forward to your timely response. Sincerely, JACKIE WALORSKI , Member of Congress. 
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES , HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , Washington, DC, March 1, 2016. President BARACK OBAMA , The White House, Washington, DC. DEAR PRESIDENT OBAMA : I am writing to follow up on a letter I sent on December 15, 2015 regarding your policy on the detention facility at Guanta´namo Bay, Cuba and questions surrounding the problem of recidivism. I am extremely disappointed that, twoand ahalf months later, I have not received any response. I am also troubled by the lack of detail in your recent Plan for Closing the Guanta´namo Bay Detention Facility released last week, which provided no clarity on the issues raised in the letter either. Last week alone, Hamed Abderrahaman Ahmed, a former detainee that was transferred to Spain, was arrested on Tuesday, February 23 for recruiting fighters for the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Two days later, Ibrahim alQosi, a former detainee that was transferred to Sudan, released a message on Thursday encouraging jihad in Somalia. He had also urged his followers to carry out attacks on New Years Eve celebrations, particularly in New York City and Paris. Recidivism is clearly a very real issue, but seems to be underestimated by your administration. In my December 15 letter, I had specifically raised the case of Ibrahim alQosi who is now a senior leader of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), which took credit for the attack on Charlie Hebdo in Paris in January 2015. He was also, curiously, transferred to a country that is designated as a State Sponsor of Terrorism by the U.S. State Department. The recentlyreleased Plan for Closing the Guanta´namo Bay Detention Facility states that the U.S. government obtains security assurances and humane treatment assurances from a country before transferring a detainee. Among the security assurances are restrictions on travel, monitoring of the detainee, and periodic information sharing. However, alQosi is currently operating out of Yemen. Obviously, there was a breakdown in these security assurances. Thus, I want to reiterate my request for a classified briefing that covers the questions raised in my December 15 letter, which I am enclosing. I would also like the briefing to address these additional questions: 1. Security assurances your administration received from the government of Sudan before the transfer of Ibrahim alQosi 2. The frequency and type of monitoring agreed to by the government of Sudan on Ibrahim alQosi and measures taken by the U.S. government to verify that this monitoring was taking place 3. The frequency and type of information shared by the government of Sudan on Ibrahim alQosi, his whereabouts, and his activities after his transfer 4. The date that the government of Sudan informed the U.S. government that Ibrahim alQosi was no longer in Sudan 5. Any punitive measures taken against the government of Sudan or members of the government in connection with its failure to live up to its commitments regarding the transfer of Ibrahim alQosi 6. Humane treatment assurances your administration received from the government of Sudan, whose head of state, Omar al Bashir, has an arrest warrant pending with the International Criminal Court for war crimes and crimes against humanity, before the transfer of Ibrahim alQosi 7. Questions 1, 2, 3, and 6 as they pertain to the two other detainees your administration transferred to Sudan: Noor Uthman Muhammed and Ibrahim Othman Ibrahim Idris 8. Questions 4 and 5 as they pertain to Noor Uthman Muhammed and Ibrahim Othman Ibrahim Idris if they are no longer in Sudan 9. Any extra security and humane treatment assurances your administration seeks from countries that are on the U.S. State Department’s list of State Sponsors of Terrorism 10. Any ongoing negotiations with the governments of Iran and Sudan regarding future transfer of Guanta´namo detainees Transferring Guanta´namo detainees— known terrorists—to countries that are State Sponsors of Terrorism is an incredibly dangerous and misguided policy. No reasonable person should trust these governments to follow through on any promises they make to ensure detainees do not rejoin the battle. I strongly urge you not to complete any future transfers to these countries and I look forward to your timely response to my request for a briefing. Sincerely, JACKIE WALORSKI , Member of Congress. 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. There are 80 detainees left at Guantanamo. A number have been transferred. Of those 80, I could be wrong, but I believe it is somewhere in the neighborhood of 34 of them have been cleared for transfer, basically deemed not to be 
risks to the United States. Restricting their ability to be transferred simply drives up the cost of Guantanamo unnecessarily. We have transferred a great many detainees out of Guantanamo. The statistics cited go all the way back to the Bush administration when, regrettably, we did let people go without proper vetting. We, through this bill, in past years, have put a number of provisions in place that require national security certifications that the people being transferred are not a risk to the United States. That is already required. This simply makes it more difficult to do that for no good reason. The recidivism in recent years has been drastically lower. It has been less than 10 percent, nowhere near the 33 percent figure cited. And the ones that are left to be transferred, like I said, are ones that have been determined not to be a risk. Now, we take our time in transferring these people to make sure that we have a place to transfer them, that it is safe and secure, willing to accept them and all of that. There are already multiple provisions in law to try and make sure that we don’t take any chances. Unfortunately, when you release people, there are always risks; but detaining people forever without charge and after you have determined that they are not a risk is also a risk. Basically, it goes against the very values of the United States of America. We could just never release anyone from prison in the United States under these standards, under the fact that, well, they might commit another crime. And they might. So why don’t we just lock them up forever? We have a process, a very careful process, that has been worked out in a bipartisan fashion to determine who needs to be held and who can be released. Then, after we determine they can be released, even then, we go through a process of where they are released to and work with the host country and try to determine what the best and safest available alternative is. This piles on to the bureaucracy and makes it more difficult to do transfers that are in the best interest of the national security of our country. I oppose the amendment for those reasons. I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Montana (Mr. ZINKE), a cosponsor of this amendment. Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Chair, well, how soon we forget why they are there. How soon we forget. Why are they there? Go to New York and look at the names engraved of the ladder men, the commercial pilots, the innocent. I did a lot to put them there. I don’t remember reading Miranda rights or warrants. Yet some people want to bring them back to the United States under U.S. law where rules of evidence and Miranda rights would apply. Yet that is ignored. Now we are asking for tighter controls overseas because onethird go back to the battlefield. Is it a risk we should incur? The answer is no. Why? Because what is left is the bottom. These are the guys that are not hanging around evil. These are the guys that are evil. They are absolutely evil, and we have seen it. So putting more controls, more restrictions to protect American lives is what we must do in Congress. This is not a Democratic or Republican issue. This is an American issue. b1800 Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time. I think that is the question: Why are they there? In the case of 26 of them, they are there because mistakes were made in picking them up. This happened with many people at Guantanamo, particularly in the early days, and these people have been there for a long time, where we basically weren’t taking any chances on whom we picked up. We threw out a wide net and brought people in. Now, there are estimated to be 44 of the folks there who are the baddest of the bad, who we have direct connections to active terrorism, who we know are a threat to the United States of America, and I am not proposing whatsoever that we should release those. But the question of why are they there is absolutely right, and it is not for the reasons that the previous gentleman stated in the cases of at least 26 of these inmates. They are there through a combination of mistakes, misidentification, misinformation, many different reasons why they were picked up, and the problem is, now: How do we transfer them out? How do we find a home country to send them to? I totally agree, if you are talking about incredibly dangerous people who have done what the previous speaker said, we have got to keep those people to protect America, but that is not the case with some of the inmates at Guantanamo. That is why we have been working to return these inmates to countries where they can be safely returned. It is not everybody at Guantanamo who falls into that category. That is the reason I oppose this amendment. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining? The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Indiana has 1
1⁄4minutes remaining. Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Chairman, I guess in answer to the questions that have been asked here, again, back to the fact that I think this is a very commonsense amendment, this is talking about transparency and accountability. How did a detainee go from Sudan to Yemen? Because the rules are too loose. Let’s just bring accountability and transparency into this issue so the American people can see and so there is some accountability in this country on where these people end up. These are the worst of the worst. They have American blood on their hands. The ones we are talking about from this point forward continue to have unbelievable issues, unbelievably dangerous criminal attached to their title. I am just simply asking for accountability and transparency. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. WALORSKI ). The amendment was agreed to.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 732, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORNBERRY ) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. O’ROURKE ) each will control 10 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORNBERRY ). Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, each of these amendments in this en bloc package has been worked on both sides of the aisle. I believe this package deserves Members’ support. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. O’ROURKE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. BEYER ). Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chair, I would like to thank the chairman from Texas for adding my amendment to this en bloc. Mr. Chairman, my amendment today would require the Defense Department and FAA to study the impact of military helicopter noise in the national capital region and to develop recommendations to reduce the effect of noise on people and property. The airspace around Washington, D.C., is more restricted and more highly congested than in any other part of the country. On average, 144 helicopter operations take place here every day, 75 percent of which are military, encompassing all types of military aircraft. One recent addition to our airspace is the V–22 Osprey, a hybrid helicopter and airplane with the width of an 8story building. It has been deployed to war zones in Iraq and Afghanistan, rescue missions in Haiti and the San Juan Mountains, and now the peaceful communities of northern Virginia. As most of my colleagues probably know, the Osprey can transition from a turboprop plane to a conventional helicopter, all while hovering at a low altitude. This noisy transition takes place directly over the Fairlington neighborhood in my district in Arlington, Virginia. Mr. Chairman, the communities in my district are realistic about the noise helicopters generate and are sensitive to the operational needs of the military, but the routes and altitude caps dictated by the FAA follow best practices for public and private aircraft, not military aircraft designed for a conflict zone. A total quieting of the skies in northern Virginia is not possible or even practical; but given the military’s insistence on using such heavy, loud aircraft, it is only right that they work with the FAA to reexamine the existing route structure and offer some possible solutions. I urge my fellow Members to support this amendment en bloc. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I would inform the gentleman that I have no speakers on this amendment at this point, so I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. O’ROURKE. Mr. Chairman, I have no speakers at this time. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN ). Mr. MCGOVERN. I thank the chairman for his graciousness. Mr. Chair, I rise in favor of the McGovernPompeo amendment, which is part of this en bloc, to create a medal honoring the service of atomic veterans or their surviving family members. Between 1945 and 1962, over 200,000 servicemembers conducted hundreds of nuclear weapons tests and were exposed to dangerous levels of radiation. Sworn to secrecy, they couldn’t even tell their doctors. Presidents Bill Clinton and George H. W. Bush recognized their service by providing specialized care and compensation, but this isn’t enough. Joe Mondello, a constituent of mine from Shrewsbury, Massachusetts, and other atomic veterans helped bring this issue to my attention. It is long past time to honor their service. Last year, with the help of the chairman, in the DOD authorization bill we included this amendment, but then the Department of Defense insisted the Senate remove it. Their explanation? We don’t have a medal and don’t want to create one. Congress should find another way to honor these veterans. That is no excuse. In fact, that is insensitive, it is dismissive, and it is ungrateful. We should be appalled. Tragically, many of these atomic veterans have already died without receiving recognition. They kept a code of silence that likely led to many of them passing away too soon. We must right this wrong. Support this amendment. I urge the Senate to do the same thing. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I have no further speakers. I urge adoption of the en bloc package. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendments en bloc offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORN BERRY ). The en bloc amendments were agreed to.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORNBERRY ). Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, this additional en bloc package No. 4 consists of a number of amendments that have been worked with both sides of the aisle. I believe that this en bloc package deserves the support of all Members. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. O’ROURKE. Mr. Chairman, at this time I do not have a speaker, so I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute. Mr. Chairman, there are a number of subjects that are covered in this en bloc package, and I think it exemplifies the work that goes into creating this defense authorization bill. If you look at the size of the bill, it is very large. As a matter of fact, it is over 1,200 pages when you look at the legislation. Of course, one of the reasons this bill is so large this year is that it includes five major packages of reforms, including: acquisition reform, healthcare reform, commissary reform, organizational reform, and Uniform Code of Military Justice reform. All of these things have been worked with Members on both sides of the aisle. I understand that not all Members may agree with every provision. I certainly don’t. But the point is this bill supports the men and women who risk their lives to serve our country, so that is the time when all of us should put aside whatever differences we have with this provision or that or this approach or that and come together on what has been for 54 years, and continues to be this year, a bipartisan product. For all of the amendments that are included in this en bloc package, I believe they deserve the support of the House. I hope they will be adopted. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. O’ROURKE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. JUDYCHU). Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Chairman, the Small Business Administration’s, or SBA’s, Women’s Business Centers, the WBCs, fill a critical gap in our economy. Despite being more than 50 percent of the population, women own just 30 percent of all businesses, and the same obstacles that keep some from starting a business keep others from growing theirs. By providing specialized resources, Women’s Business Centers are designed to make sure womenowned businesses succeed. That is why it is imperative that female entrepreneurs are able to access these resources in a convenient way. The reality is that in large, densely populated areas, the need for these centers is greater due to the higher concentration of women entrepreneurs. In fact, Los Angeles County was home to more womenowned businesses than any other county in the entire country in 2012, yet some women had to wait weeks or months or were forced to travel long distances in order to visit a WBC because the center closest to them was unable to meet the demand. My amendment would address this reality by ensuring that the SBA considers the population density of the area to be serviced when reviewing and selecting eligible organizations for the Women’s Business Center grants. We must continue to work to ensure that these centers are convenient and accessible for all women because, when women succeed, America succeeds. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute. Mr. Chairman, among the amendments in this en bloc package is one by Mr. NOLAN of Minnesota that prohibits funding for the Syria Train and Equip programs to recipients that the Secretary of Defense has reported as having misused that training or equipment. This amendment comes from a Democratic Member, but I think it is very important for all of us to do what we can to ensure that training and weapons provided to forces we are assisting in Syria not be misused, that they not get in the hands of terrorists. Just to take that one example, where I believe a good amendment has been accepted by both sides of the aisle, that helps ensure that the goals we all share—in this case, for the Syria Train and Equip program—are met. That is an example of the bipartisan nature of this bill. Similarly, there is an amendment here by Mr. AGUILAR of California creating a pilot program to improve the ability to recruit cyber professionals, a new domain of warfare, an enormous challenge for the government to compete with Silicon Valley, the Austin San Antonio corridor, and other places that are recruiting cyber professionals, but a good and valued step. Those are examples of the amendments in this en bloc package. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. O’ROURKE. Mr. Chair, I have no other speakers on this amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of the amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendments en bloc offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORN BERRY ). The en bloc amendments were agreed to. b1815 
AMENDMENT NO . 25 OFFERED BY MR . LARSEN OF  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 25 printed in part B of House Report 114–569. Mr. LARSEN of WASHINGTON. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 995, line 2, strike ‘‘to be new and emergency in nature’’ and insert ‘‘will significantly reduce the nuclear threat’’. Page 995, line 9, insert ‘‘and’’ after the semicolon. Page 995, strike lines 13 through 17. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 732, the gentleman from Washington (Mr. LARSEN ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Washington. Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Chairman, this amendment aims to remedy a provision in the base text that could unnecessarily hamstring the vital work of preventing terrorists from obtaining nuclear material. Section 3115 of the NDAA prohibits collaboration with Russia on atomic energy defense activities, but provides the Secretary of Energy with waiver authority. However, the Secretary of Energy can only exercise the waiver if there is a new emergency and if we completely eliminate the backlog of physical security maintenance work at DOE defense nuclear sites in the U.S. I stand with my colleagues in opposition to Russian aggression in Crimea, 
Ukraine, Syria, and threatening activity in the Baltics and elsewhere. However, I believe that the terms of this waiver are wrong and would be, frankly, impossible to execute. If we give the Secretary of Energy a waiver, it should be achievable. That is why my amendment improves the standard to a simple one: the Secretary must certify that this cooperation will significantly reduce the nuclear threat. It is no secret that nuclear material in Russia is vulnerable to theft and smuggling. According to Harvard University’s Managing the Atom project, Russian nuclear material is at risk from both insiders and outsiders. Nuclear material stolen in Russia does not have to remain in Russia and, therefore, could be a threat to the homeland. Currently, we do not do any nuclear threat reduction work with Russia. If the opportunity presented itself and it was in the interest of national security, why not at least have that option? So I encourage Members to support my amendment so our government can protect Americans from nuclear terrorism, regardless of where that material originates. Mr. Chairman, I urge people to support this amendment. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the points raised by the distinguished gentleman from Washington (Mr. LARSEN ). As a matter of fact, I remember very well that one of my early speeches on the floor of the House was on a motion to recommit—supporting a Democratic motion, actually—regarding our efforts to help the Russians get control of their nuclear material. That certainly has been an important priority. It is also true that, since I was in the well in the mid1990s on that, things have changed. What we see is Russia spending an incredible amount of money modernizing a variety of weapons systems, including their nuclear weapons. It includes submarines and bombers and a whole variety of things, but it includes new nuclear weapons. Yet, on the other hand, we have enormous backlogs of deferred maintenance, we call it, in our nuclear infrastructure, in our nuclear weapons complex. Deferred maintenance is a euphemism, Mr. Chairman, because even in my own district we have folks working in deplorable conditions. We are talking about engineers and others working in conditions that no one should have to work in because we have neglected our infrastructure throughout the nuclear complex. So I think the purpose of the underlying provision is that we shouldn’t spend money doing what Russia has the money to do for itself, especially when our own nuclear infrastructure is in such disrepair. Now, there is a waiver provision. If there is something crucial, then, obviously, another arrangement can be made. But the basic premise is Russia has changed. They are behaving not only more aggressively, but modernizing their military. Meanwhile, we have neglected ours. It is time for us to catch up. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I agree with the distinguished gentleman from Texas that Russia has changed. The threat of loose nuclear material has not changed. Nuclear material in Russia is far more vulnerable than in the United States, and stolen nuclear material anywhere is a threat to Americans. Now, on a bipartisan basis, this committee has increased funding for domestic physical security improvements. However, at current funding levels, that backlog will exist for years. If Congress is going to establish a waiver process, it should be an achievable one. Right now we do not do any of this work in Russia, but we have the opportunity to reduce the nuclear threat, and we should keep that option available. I would ask this body to support my amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, again, I appreciate the importance that the gentleman places on securing nuclear material. I share his view. I still am very concerned, for example, that terrorists will obtain—and we know they would use—nuclear material if they have the opportunity. The concern here is that we are doing things for Russians with American taxpayer dollars so they need not do it for themselves. In fact, what they do for themselves is build more capability that threatens us. We can’t continue down that road. I oppose the amendment, and I urge Members to do likewise. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Washington (Mr. LARSEN ). The amendment was rejected. 
AMENDMENT NO . 26 OFFERED BY MR . ROGERS OF  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 26 printed in part B of House Report 114–569. Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of subtitle B of title XXXI, add the following new section: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 732, the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. ROGERS ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Alabama. Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chairman, I offer a simple amendment to defend congressional prerogatives and ensure Congress is getting full information from the administration regarding one of our Nation’s highest priority defense missions: nuclear deterrence. Several years ago the Secretary of Energy tasked the Nation’s nuclear weapons labs to produce a study on the future of nuclear deterrence. That study was finalized in August of 2014, almost 2 years ago. The Secretary made a personal commitment to senior members of the Armed Services Committee that he would send over the report resulting from that study. Now, 2 years later, we still have not received that report. This amendment will ensure DOE acts to fulfill the Secretary’s commitment to provide this report to Congress, ensure Congress can conduct appropriate oversight and has visibility into matters as important as the future of nuclear deterrence, which the Secretary of Defense has called the Nation’s highest priority defense mission, and it fences only a couple million dollars in administrative funds within the Office of the Secretary. This will be enough to ensure we receive this report and will not impact the DOE’s mission at all. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this amendment. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. COOPER. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Tennessee is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. COOPER. Mr. Chair, I appreciate my friendship with the gentleman from Alabama, but I think this amendment goes way too far. To fence half the funds of the Office of the Secretary of Energy is overkill. 
Secretary Moniz has done an excellent job. This is really a punishment, though, that will go to the next Secretary, a man who is not in any way responsible for this delay. Has there been a delay? It is my information that the chairman of the full committee has had access to this report. Access to this report has been offered to the gentleman from Alabama and to myself. Without having read the report, we do not know what issues of classification or bureaucracy are involved in this. But this is among the Nation’s most precious and most classified secrets. To me, to use a sledgehammer like this against a good person and against that good person’s successor, whoever that may be, is really a crude way to handle a breakdown in communications. Surely there is a better way to solve this problem. His office is just down the street. We get along with him just fine. He has been fully communicative and extremely able in every aspect. But to have a delayed report merit a sanction like this is pretty extraordinary. So I would urge my friend, the gentleman from Alabama, to reconsider and not have what I consider to be a staffdriven tiff escalate into something much greater than it should be. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate my friend’s remarks, and I agree. I like Mr. Moniz. I think the Secretary is a fine man and he is trying to do the right thing. I have had a conversation with the ranking member earlier today, but I haven’t had a chance to follow up with him. I have been on the floor doing a lot. The only problem I have with withdrawing the amendment is we need this report between now and the time we go to conference to take what is yielded from it and visit with the appropriators. Just me reading the report with you in private would not give me the documentation to take what it says—what I believe it says—and produce some policy that will deal with what the report says is a threat to our country. b1830 For that reason, I would like to urge my colleagues to vote for the amendment, and reassure my friend and the Secretary that if, in fact, the report is forthcoming, and we are going to have a few months between now and the time we go to conference, I will be happy, in conference, to ask that this provision be withdrawn. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. COOPER. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from Alabama. I would just urge that both he and other Members not use this in any way as a precedent. It is one thing to fence an appropriate amount of money over a worthy disagreement, but this is overkill in this case, at least in my opinion. So we probably will not prevail on the vote, but we need to establish precedents that will work for the strongest possible defense for that country, and a minimum of bureaucratic conflict. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend from Tennessee, and I urge my friends in the House to vote ‘‘yes.’’ I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. ROGERS ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 60 OFFERED BY MR . ZINKE  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 60 printed in part B of House Report 114–569. Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of subtitle D of title XVI, add the following new section: 
Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. 60 be modified by the form that I have placed at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the modification. The Clerk read as follows: 
BY MR . ZINKE OF MONTANA  At the end of subtitle D of title XVI, add the following new section: 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Chairman, we had a technical issue earlier, and we had reached out to my friend’s office. I congratulate your staff. They understood the mechanical issue. It was a procurement timing. It has been taken care of with the amendment to the amendment, and so I want to make sure anyone that is listening, that the concerns that were being brought up from my office have been dealt with. We now are fully in support of the gentleman’s amendment. Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. ROGERS). Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment, and I am as frustrated as anybody that we are having to be here today. Secretary Carter has often said, and I agree with him completely, that the nuclear deterrent priority is our number one national security mission. But, unfortunately, that rhetoric has not matched up with the decision on this issue coming from the Secretary’s office. The UH–1N fleet that is used by the Air Force Security Forces for the ICBM field security consist of Vietnamera helos. The UH–1N program is a case study in a failed DOD acquisition process: The first move to replace the helos was in 2004. The Joint Staff validated a military requirement in 2010; The Air Force canceled the replacement program in 2011; And the SecDef recently overruled the SecAF in conducting a sole source replacement program, proposing instead a competition in 2018. Admiral Haney, Commander, USSTRATCOM, stated in February, 2016: ‘‘Maintaining the security of our nuclear weapons requires a modern helicopter with sufficient capabilities to counter both today’s and future threats. The UH–1N does not fully meet the current ICBM complex security requirements as outlined by DOD and USSTRATCOM.’’ We have been warned, colleagues. Let me be clear. This is the security of nuclear weapons here at home. There is no higher priority. If we are going down the path of competition, that is fine; but we have no more time to waste. I want to urge the gentleman’s amendment be adopted. Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Chairman, I would like to say thank you to everyone for working on this bill and doing slight amendments to ensure that we have a fair and open competition but yet not delay the problem. I think we can all understand that we need to replace the Hueys. The Hueys are inaccurate. They have been inaccurate for a long time. The acquisition process yet again, as we have identified, is broke. So I thank my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to place this in importance. Our nuclear weapon and our arsenal needs to be protected. We face an asymmetrical enemy, and ensuring that they are safe at all times is part of what this Congress should be doing. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment, as modified, offered by the gentleman from Montana (Mr. ZINKE). The amendment, as modified, was agreed to. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise. The motion was agreed to. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. ZINKE) having assumed the chair, Mr. HULTGREN , Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 4909) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2017 for military activities of the Department of Defense and for military construction, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.
