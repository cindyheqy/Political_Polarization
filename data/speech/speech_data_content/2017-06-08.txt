Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, less than 10 years ago in 2008, bad actors on Wall Street brought the economy of our country to the brink of collapse. Because of their greed, recklessness, and deceit, millions of Americans lost their jobs, families were thrown out of their homes, and seniors saw their life savings evaporate before their very eyes. Washington bailed out the big banks and they said they were too big to fail, but the American people never got a bailout. The American people were told: You are on your own. And in seven States, including my home State of Rhode Island, we are still working to recover jobs that were lost in this Great Recession. That is why it was so important 2 years later when Congress passed and President Obama signed into law the DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. This law was a landmark victory for the American people, especially the American consumer. That is why it is so disturbing that Republicans now want to take us back to the days of too big to fail, a time when powerful Wall Street special interests exploited consumers and small investors, and our entire economy was put at risk. The bill before us today, which I call the ‘‘Wrong’’ CHOICE Act, will turn Wall Street into the Wild West again and it will empower the big banks to do what they want at the expense of honest, hardworking families. This bill takes us back to an era when financial institutions could wipe out someone’s retirement and foreclose on innocent homeowners completely unchecked. This bill repeals commonsense requirements that require financial advisers to act in the best interests of their clients. It will allow bad actors to push bad products on working people and seniors in exchange for paybacks. This bill protects forced arbitration clauses and allows companies to require their customers to waive their right to a jury trial, and deny them their day in court when their rights are violated. By the way, that includes servicemembers, brave men and women who have worn the uniform of the American Armed Forces. Unfortunately, servicemembers and veterans are often targeted for financial fraud and unscrupulous creditors because they are held to a higher standard of debt repayment. In addition, their frequent time away from home makes it harder for our servicemembers to identify scams. The CFPB has already taken at least 12 major enforcement actions directly protecting servicemembers and their families. In 2016, the CFPB fined Navy Federal Credit Union $28 million for illegal debt collection tactics. The CFPB took action against two forprofit colleges, ITT Technical Institute and Corinthian Colleges, both of which have been linked to predatory treatment of servicemembers and veterans. The nowdefunct Corinthian was ordered to provide $480 million in debt relief to defrauded students, including servicemembers. In 2013, the CFPB ordered highcost, smalldollar lender Cash America to pay up to $14 million in restitution and a $5 million penalty for violations of the Military Lending Act. Just 2 months ago, CFPB sanctioned an auto lender that harassed and 
preyed on servicemembers. Security National Automotive Acceptance Company threatened that they would contact commanding officers about debts that our veterans incurred, and lied to our brave men and women in uniform about their obligations, and they have been held accountable because of the CFPB. The CFPB was created to protect families and small businesses, and since 2010, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has returned nearly $12 billion to 29 million consumers in all 50 States. More than 1 million consumers have used the CFPB’s complaint database, and nearly all of them have received a timely resolution to their issues. b1015 The CFPB held Wells Fargo accountable to the tune of $100 million after they opened millions of fraudulent accounts for customers without telling them. Wells Fargo surreptitiously collected fees from these victims, and every dime was returned to consumers because the CFPB was on the job. The sole purpose of CFPB’s existence is to ensure that bank loans, mortgages, and credit cards are fair, affordable, understandable, and transparent. That is exactly what it is doing. Republicans want nothing more than to kill it. No honest, hardworking American should be exploited when they are taking out a mortgage, trying to pay off their college debt, buying a car, or opening a bank account, but that is what is going to happen if Republicans get their way today. Passage of this bill will confirm what so many Americans believe: that Washington works for big business, the very rich, and powerful special interests, but not for them. Let’s remind ourselves that the American people sent us to Washington to work for them. They didn’t send us here to fight for the big banks and credit card companies that already have too much power here in Washington. Reject this bad bill. Vote for the American people. Protect consumers, and very strongly vote ‘‘no.’’ 
RESCUING AMERICA’S HEALTHCARE SYSTEM The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK ) for 5 minutes. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, when ObamaCare was imposed on the Nation, we were promised lower premiums, increased choices, and improved care, but exactly the opposite has happened. Last year, premiums increased an average of 25 percent, and this year we are warned they will increase another 40 percent. Last year, only one provider remained in a third of American counties. This year, entire regions have no providers at all. In 2015, American life expectancies actually declined. The Senate now has before it the American Health Care Act. It goes a long way toward replacing ObamaCare’s compulsory onesizefits all bureaucratic mess with a consumer friendly, patientcentered system. The AHCA repeals the employer mandate that has trapped many Americans in parttime jobs. It repeals the individual mandate that forces Americans to buy plans they don’t want, don’t need, and can’t afford. It changes the premium structure that forced young families to subsidize premiums for those in their peak earning years. It repeals nearly $1 trillion of taxes on the American economy. It repeals the mandates that force an older couple to maintain pediatric coverage, and it maintains the safety net for those with preexisting conditions. It assures that these plans are within the financial reach of every family. Well, despite the obvious failure of ObamaCare and the urgent need to rescue our healthcare system, opponents have gone into overdrive to frighten people and to distort the facts. The most lurid claim comes from the Congressional Budget Office: that 23 million Americans will lose their health insurance. Now, we should first remember that this is the same office that predicted that ObamaCare exchanges would cover 26 million Americans by 2017. The actual number was 10 million. It predicted that ObamaCare would result in slight premium increases between 10 and 13 percent by 2016. The actual figure was 105 percent. So how did the CBO come up with its latest claim? Well, much is based on assuming that people won’t buy health insurance unless we force them. In reality, more people are already choosing not to purchase ObamaCare policies, and they are paying a steep tax penalty to boot. The CBO ignored provisions that allow people to tailor plans to best meet their own needs, which is a powerful market incentive for them to purchase plans. Second, the CBO predicts that in future years Medicaid recipients will leave due to changes that restrain the growth in this program, yet it is precisely these changes that focus resources on services and not on waste and fraud. Third, the CBO predicts that lowincome, older Americans in the individual market will lose nearly $13,000 of subsidies and be priced out of that market, yet it ignores the $90 billion that were freed up in the final House version with the express understanding that the Senate would redirect these funds to replace these ObamaCare subsidies. Fourth, the CBO predicts some people will choose less expensive plans without all the bells and whistles required under ObamaCare. Well, this, of course, is exactly what choice is all about: people making their own decisions based on their own needs and wants. Yet the CBO classifies them as uninsured. The other major and false claim is that people with preexisting conditions will lose coverage, despite explicit language in the AHCA that nothing in this act shall be construed as permitting health insurers to limit access to health coverage for individuals with preexisting conditions. There is one exception. If you are one of the 7 percent of patients in the individual market, and if you have a preexisting condition, and if you live in a State that has requested and received a waiver based on having an alternative program to assure your coverage, and if you have let your insurance lapse for more than 62 days in the past year, then, and only then, can you be charged a higher rate than the general population for your health plan, and then only for the first year. This year, entire regions of the country will be unable to obtain policies on ObamaCare exchanges; premiums are spiraling out of reach for families that don’t qualify for subsidies; and taxpayer costs are skyrocketing. The AHCA offers a way out of this nightmare, restoring a healthy, competitive market, where patients will have the widest range of choices and the freedom to choose a plan that best meets their own needs, along with a supportive tax system to assure that these plans are within their financial reach. If the Senate can come up with a better plan, let’s see it. But one thing should be clear: inaction is not an option. f 
LOYALTY OF COMMANDER IN CHIEF The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. KENNEDY ) for 5 minutes. Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, amidst the breaking news alerts and tweets that have overwhelmed our Nation over the past several days, and as our Nation tunes in to a hearing taking place on the other side of the Capitol as I speak, lies a simple question: Did the President of the United States put his own personal and political interests above the interests of the American people? Congress cannot allow itself to become desensitized to the gravity of those accusations or be deterred from an aggressive, expeditious, and fully independent investigation conducted in full view of the American public, because the real victims of this investigation’s ‘‘cloud’’ are our constituents: Americans who wake up every morning praying that their monthly budget won’t be compromised by the unexpected; who walk into their office hoping that today isn’t the day that that layoff notice arrives; who tuck their son or daughter into bed at night knowing that, despite working two jobs, their kid won’t be afforded the 
same luxuries as their friend down the street; who look to Washington for a hand and instead see us forced to wrestle with an almost unbelievable question: whether the leader of the free world compromised the security of his citizens and our democracy to a foreign adversary. Mr. Speaker, there has been an awful lot of talk about loyalty in the past 24 hours. Let’s be very, very clear. The American people should never have to be reassured of the loyalty of their Commander in Chief. 
IN MEMORY OF GREGG ALLMAN The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER ) for 5 minutes. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life of Mr. Gregg Allman, awardwinning rock and roll singer and songwriter who passed away in Savannah, Georgia, on Sunday May 27, 2017, at the age of 69. Mr. Allman will be remembered as the keyboardist and distinctly soulful voice of the Allman Brothers, a three time Grammy Awardwinning Southern rock band whose popularity has spawned generations of dedicated followers throughout the world. Born in Nashville, Tennessee, in 1947, Mr. Allman and his brother, Duane, were skilled guitarists and keyboardists by the time they graduated from high school. The brothers went on to perform with a number of small West Coast sound rock bands throughout the 1960s, moving between Los Angeles and Jacksonville, before establishing the Allman Brothers Band in 1969. The band’s most popular songs included ‘‘Midnight Rider,’’ ‘‘Whipping Post,’’ and ‘‘Ramblin’ Man,’’ which references Macon’s Highway 41, where Mr. Allman was laid to rest. These songs will span the test of time and continue to live on, even as the music industry has drastically changed. In 1973, Mr. Allman began a solo career and enjoyed a great deal of success as both a member of the Allman Brothers and a solo act. In 1995, Allman and the other members of the band were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. I am proud that Mr. Allman chose to call Savannah home, and I am honored to have the opportunity to represent such an outstanding artist. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the groundbreaking and altruistic life of Mr. Frank Chappell, who passed away on Saturday, May 27, 2017, at the age of 85. Originally from Quitman, Georgia, Mr. Chappell always had a passion for serving others. He grew up as an integral member of his church and joined the Army directly after high school to serve his country and fight in the Korean war. In the Army, he gained the motivation he needed to continue his education, enrolling in Savannah State University upon his return home from Korea. He moved to Savannah permanently after graduation and continued using his passion for service to make Savannah a better place to live. In 1957, he joined the Savannah police department. Mr. Chappell was in the second group of AfricanAmerican police officers the department had ever hired. However, at that time, these officers were still unable to drive in police cars or arrest potential criminals. Nevertheless, Mr. Chappell’s personable nature created a connection with neighbors around Savannah that, before 1957, had felt underrepresented. He retired from the police force after 35 years but, subsequently, embarked on another service position as a member of the city council for Thunderbolt, Georgia. During his term there, he was instrumental in building a new town hall and senior citizen building. I am proud to thank Mr. Chappell, as well as his family, for all of his outstanding work in the Savannah community. He certainly will be missed. AMERICAN PATRIOT AWARD WINNER JUDGE J . 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding career of Judge Alex Atwood, who received the American Patriot Award from the Glynn County Veterans Council on May 29, 2017. Each year, one individual that has exhibited leadership that positively impacts Glynn County receives this award. Mr. Atwood is certainly worthy of this title. He started his career as a local law enforcement officer before he transitioned his knowledge of the law into a career as a special agent with the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, where he educated thousands on the role of public defenders. In Glynn County, Judge Atwood is well known for his extraordinary legal career, serving as a magistrate judge for Glynn County and as a representative for Georgia’s 179th District in the Georgia General Assembly. In this capacity, Judge Atwood has been a champion for Georgians. He introduced legislation that set parameters for illegal immigration, provides protections against human trafficking, and generates structured legal reform. Judge Atwood has found the time to devote himself to a number of Glynn County organizations, working with each to make Glynn County a better place. Judge Atwood is a beaming example of leadership, and his career serves as an important lesson in fulfilling our civic duty as Americans. 
THANKING HOWARD P. MARGULEAS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. RUIZ) for 5 minutes. Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Howard Marguleas, a talented businessman, incredible father and friend, and blessing to those who knew him. He made a tremendous positive impact on so many lives, including my own. His list of achievements and contributions to our Nation is long. Sadly, he passed away June 1, 2017. His spirit of service and leadership will live for generations to come. As a business leader, he took the produce industry by storm as the principal founder of Sun World International. He brought many new products to American consumer markets, like the delicious new seedless watermelon, various new types of grapes, and the Hawaiian pineapple. b1030 Sun World International became a powerhouse produce company under his watch, one of the largest in the Nation. His business leadership was well recognized. He served on the California State Board of Food and Agriculture as a key adviser to Governor Pat Brown on issues important to the many farmers, ranchers, and consumers in California. He was named as one of the most influential produce leaders of the past 100 years by the industry publication, The Packer. Mr. Marguleas was a genuinely good man. His incredible heart of gold was shown through his generosity as a philanthropist. He championed healthcare access and education, issues near and dear to my own heart. He was vice chair at the University of California at Riverside, and served as a trustee at the Eisenhower Medical Center for more than 15 years. He also helped found the Coachella Valley Boys and Girls Club, which has grown to five clubhouses serving thousands of children across the valley. This is just a small part of the incredible work he did as a philanthropist and community leader throughout his life. Mr. Marguleas was very special to me and my family in a very deeply personal way. He gave my father, Gilbert, the chance in life that transformed our entire family. He gave my dad, who didn’t finish high school, a good job working at Sun World packing in Thermal and a ticket to the middle class. He promoted my dad to eventually manage the plant. That allowed my family to move from our trailer and into our home in Coachella. He used to give us Angels and Dodgers baseball tickets and giant Hershey chocolate bars for Christmas. For a kid who loves chocolate, those giant bars were like a gift from God Himself. What really moves me is that he paid for a full year of my undergrad studies at UCLA, when my dad couldn’t afford it. Imagine that. He helped a boy from a trailer park, son of farmworkers, achieve his dreams to be a doctor and serve the community. He did so without fanfare, headlines, or public recognition. He did it because he cared for 
my dad, my family, and me. Without him, I wouldn’t be where I am today. The amazing thing is that I am not the sole person touched and transformed by his kindness. There are so many more. His generosity and kindness are an inspiration. My thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Ardith, his four children, and nine grandchildren. I know that Howard’s legacy will live on because his work touched so many across California and the Nation. So on behalf of the people of California’s 36th Congressional District; my wife, Monica; my girls, Sky and Sage; my mother, Blanca; my brother, Robbin; and my sister, Star, thank you, Mr. Marguleas. You will forever be in our hearts. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF PHILLIP D. LEDFORD The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. MCSALLY ) for 5 minutes. Ms. MCSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Phillip D. Ledford, Navy veteran, dog lover, patriot, and husband to Helene, his wife of 41 years. I was blessed to be Phil’s nextdoor neighbor in Tucson for the last 20 years. Having lost my father at the age of 12, Phil became a father figure to me, and I loved him deeply. Phil was born in Ohio and joined the Navy in 1963, at the age of 17, requiring his father to approve his enlistment. After 4 years serving as a boilerman and traveling the world, he transitioned to civilian life. After working in Ohio as a commercial refrigerator technician, Phil, Helene, and their beloved English Setter named Molley moved to Tucson. Phil and his best friend and brother inlaw Mike would go on adventures in the desert and mountains, exploring old mines, gold prospecting, and hiking the beautiful landscapes of Arizona. After Molley passed away, Phil and Helene couldn’t imagine bringing another dog into their broken hearts for a while. Slowly, my Golden Retriever, Penelope, started to melt his heart, and soon they were spending their days together. Phil and Helene cared for Penelope when I was deployed to Afghanistan, then drove across the country to help me move when I got orders to Alabama. Phil came out to babysit Penelope and even drove her all the way back to Tucson to be at home for a while with Helene. Phil volunteered to be a foster for the local Golden Retriever rescue organizations. He took this responsibility seriously, caring for many goldens coming out of difficult circumstances. One golden named Rudy had cancer, and Phil agreed to care for him until he passed. Rudy was deathly afraid of thunder, but Phil discovered that Rudy’s fears were cured if he was riding in a car. So every time storms came, Phil would load Rudy up—even borrowing Mike’s van so that Rudy could enter more easily—and drive him around so he wasn’t afraid during the storm, even if the storm lasted all night—no complaints and no questions asked. When I returned home to Tucson, we cut a hole in the wall between the two houses, and we had doggy doors, food bowls, toys, and treats in both places. Penelope happily lived in both of her homes again, roaming freely. What a life. What love. Phil was with me when Penelope passed in 2014. Within a few weeks, Phil’s best friend Mike went to be with the Lord after battling Agent Orange caused cancer for years. It was a rough spring for Phil, losing his best guy friend and furry friend so quickly. Despite our grief, we soon welcomed a rescue golden named Boomer into our lives and hearts. Boomer was a 10 monthold, energetic handful, and Phil got to work with his training, coaching, and love. Phil was a patriot, who loved his country, God, and valued a hard day’s work. He was a skilled tradesman, who was always eager to pull out his tools and try to fix literally anything that broke in the house or car. Those of us who knew him best and loved him called him our favorite curmudgeon. He was stubborn and opinionated but would literally give you the shirt off his back or the last dollar in his wallet. He used to scold me on my lack of discipline with the dogs. Boomer would get rambunctious with me and not listen but was perfectly well behaved with Phil. I realized, finally, that Boomer saw me as a litter mate and Phil as the pet parent. In November 2015, Phil was diagnosed with head and neck cancer. The last year and a half, he navigated an extremely difficult journey. He channeled his stubbornness towards his fight against cancer and refused to give up or get down. His deep character traits of selflessness, faith, love, courage, and humility were tested and purified on this walk. He was a hero and example to all of us in the face of extreme pain, suffering, adversity, and eventually the end of his physical life. In midApril, the cancer came back with a vengeance and rapidly spread. The pain was unbearable at times, and it was so difficult for us to watch him suffer. Two weeks ago yesterday, he took a turn for the worse. I flew home from D.C. to be with him. After a long night, Helene, Boomer, and I were by his side, praying he would be willing to let go and be received into God’s holy embrace. He was unconscious for over 24 hours, but in that prayer, he scrunched his eyes closed twice, took his last breath, and went to be with the Lord, finally free of all the suffering and fully restored. We could all learn a lot from Phil Ledford. He did not live a complicated life and found pure joy in simple and beautiful things: a walk with a beloved dog; exploring with his best friend Mike; watching football with his adored bride, Helene; tinkering with the furnace or his Jeep; a walk and casual dinner at our local favorite restaurant, Papa Locos; driving me to the airport or events with constituents; taking care of and protecting those whom he loved. He didn’t seek glory, fame, or riches, but humanity, integrity, loyalty, and service. Phil Ledford was a good man with a large heart and a selfless spirit. I truly could not have served in my calling in uniform and in Congress without his love and support. He directed us to not have a memorial service or funeral, but he never said anything about a speech on the floor of the House of Representatives. It is the least I could do to honor his impact on my life and all those blessed to know him and love him, human and furry. We love you and miss you, Phil. As the song says: ‘‘Go rest high on that mountain. Son, your work on Earth is done.’’ f 
UNDERPAYMENT OF EMPLOYEES The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. KHANNA ) for 5 minutes. Mr. KHANNA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express a simple principle: People who are working to bag groceries should not have to rely on government assistance, on nutrition assistance, to be able to buy groceries. Yet, across this country, there are thousands of workers who go and put in a full day’s work yet can’t afford the basic necessities of food and clothing. And it is the taxpayers, all of us, that bear the responsibility for the underpayment by large corporations. A Berkeley study has said that this underpayment by large corporations, low wages, is costing the American taxpayers $153 billion a year. I am proud to introduce the Corporate Responsibility and Taxpayer Protection Act with nine other colleagues that would require companies to be responsible for the underpayment of their employees. The idea is simple: If people are putting in a hard day’s work and a full week’s work, they deserve wages that will allow them to be part of the middle class. Too often, what happens is corporations, even if they are paying a $15 minimum wage, will adjust an employee’s hours so that they don’t get more takehome pay for the month. What this bill will do is say that a corporation that isn’t paying a fair wage, where employees are relying on government assistance, the corporation is responsible for that government assistance. It is not the taxpayers who should be paying for that; it is the corporations who should be held responsible for the underpayment of wages. My hope is that none of the corporations will have to pay this tax. That they will do the right thing by working families in the middle class. That they 
will recognize that, in a time of record corporate profits, they can afford to pay a decent wage. I am hopeful that this bill will receive bipartisan support, because it is the very premise of this country that if you work hard, if you play by the rules, you should be able to be part of the middle class. 
CIVILITY The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. BACON ) for 5 minutes. Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues and fellow citizens to elevate our political discourse in which we participate for the good of our country. Some of what I see in America grieves me. The partisan divide grows more volatile, and decency shrinking in our political dialogue. Many on the left continue to say, Mr. Trump is ‘‘not my President.’’ And in the past, some on the right have said, Mr. Obama is ‘‘not my President.’’ Now we have people who think it is comical to be photographed with the depiction of the President’s bloodied head. I can only think of reallife intelligence photos I have viewed of innocent men and women shortly after their decapitation at the hands of a terrorist. Escalating America’s political discussion to actions like what Ms. Griffin is guilty of undermines our Nation’s discourse and weakens the unity of our citizens, and I don’t know where it stops. I fear we are pulling apart. The left and right should not hate each other. As Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., asserted: ‘‘Hate cannot drive out hate: only love can do that.’’ We must be able to disagree, debate, and then strive together for America. When we pull apart, our Nation weakens and our citizens become more vulnerable. I fear that if we continue down this path, the political wedge will be so ugly it will not be so easily repaired. b1045 It is this pulling apart that caused us not to pass a defense spending bill on time for almost a decade. Our military leaders have stated we are back to the hollow force of the 1970s due to this congressional malpractice. Our Navy is unable to fly half of their aircraft; the Army only has 3 of their 58 combat brigades fully ready to deploy; and our Air Force pilots fly less hours today than they did during the hollow force years. In other words, the partisan rancor has undermined our Nation’s defense, and our servicemen and women are paying for this price in readiness. If North Korea, Russia, or another threat tries to take advantage of our weaknesses, our great warriors will pay for it with their blood. I love our country and our representative democracy. We have had our times of extreme divide. At the beginning of our Nation’s history, there were very aggressive debates between the followers of John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, for example. We saw strife during Andrew Jackson’s Presidency, when many of his opponents feared he was going to be America’s Napoleon, and we survived those times. But let us not forget the bitter acrimony leading up to the 1860s, when we saw physical assaults on the floor of Congress. That divide was only solved after over 600,000 Americans died in the Civil War. Let us debate the issues. I have already held five townhalls myself to engage in the essential debates to improve our country, and I will hold more. But when it comes to the vitriol and verbal assaults, let us all take a knee and reflect. Are we taking our Nation to a potential precipice of a disaster if we keep turning up the volume of this partisanship? Earlier this year, the congressional freshman class signed a civility pledge. I again pledge civility, but I also implore our Nation to include our media and entertainment to reflect on the tone and ugliness that we are seeing. Let us rein in the anger and disrespect. I implore our President, our Senate, all of us in the people’s House, all of our citizens, let us raise the bar of our debate and treat each other with respect. Let us not cross the line between criticizing the issues to criticizing the person. I have served in the military next to many great Americans for nearly 30 years, and we all swore to protect and defend every American with our lives, regardless of our party affiliations. In fact, I rarely knew if a person was a Republican or a Democrat during my time in the Air Force. Let us not forget, too, that, during our history, 1.2 million Americans gave their lives in the defense of this country. They were Democrats, Republicans, Independents. Some had no party at all. Some were Federalists. Some were Whigs. They paid the ultimate price so we could have the privilege of a free and open debate that we enjoy today. They fought and died so our citizens could be the sovereigns of our Nation. Let us turn away from the anger, outrage upon outrage, away from the character assassinations. Let us turn toward civil debate and contend for our ideas and values in a manner pursuant to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. When we lose an election, regardless of the party, let us do so gracefully, and respect the will of the voters and the Constitution. Let us agree when we agree, and respectfully disagree when we disagree. But to resist at all costs, on every issue, is damaging to our country. Today, some are calling for impeachment of our President. With the facts that we have, it is wrong and it is putting politics over the wellbeing of our country, and we are better than this. Let us turn down the volume. CONGRATULATING NORTH HALL HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL TEAM The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. COLLINS ) for 5 minutes. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, it is a joy today that I rise to congratulate North Hall High School on winning the State baseball championship in Georgia in their class. This is especially happy for me because I am a Trojan. I graduated from North Hall High School in 1984. It is amazing that it seems that long ago, but it is also looking back as one of the first sports championships in baseball that they have received, and it is a truly exciting time in our community. I have watched these young men grow up, many with my own son playing ball, and it is exciting to see that fulfillment. At the start of the season, the team rallied around the promise of ‘‘Leave No Doubt.’’ It reminded North Hall players and coaches to offer the best effort without exception and to prove wrong anyone who doubted their potential for success. Persevering in the 2017 season was no small task. The team opened the first round of the State playoffs, in fact, with a 6–1 loss. Few people expected the Trojans to recover after that game, but they followed it with 10 straight wins. Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt that North Hall earned the title of State Champion. This victory serves as a testament to the team’s determination and a reminder to us all that dedication, even in the most unlikely circumstances, does pay off. Whenever we give up, we surrender our dreams. To the young men that I have watched grow up, the young men in our community who now hold the title of State Champion, I say congratulations. 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of retired Army Lieutenant Colonel Terry Barron, Georgia’s first female Blackhawk helicopter pilot. My neighbors in the city of Gainesville recently declared May 25 to be Terry Barron Day in honor of this outstanding servicemember. Lieutenant Colonel Barron served in the Georgia National Guard for 30 years and, in 2011, was deployed to Iraq. In addition to her military service, Lieutenant Colonel Barron served as a math professor and the former chair of Brenau University’s math and science department. In this role, she equipped students with the knowledge and skills that allowed them to pursue careers in math and science. As both a soldier and a professor, Lieutenant Colonel Barron has lived a life dedicated to serving and empowering others, making them more confident as they approach the challenges of each new day. I would like to commend Lieutenant Colonel Barron for her service to 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, as I rise today, it is a good day on the floor of the House. It is a good day for those of us who have went before the voters on occasions and said that one of the issues that we have to take up in Washington, D.C., is removing the barriers to letting everyday people get up and be able to access the financial markets, to access their business opportunities, to follow their hopes, dreams, and ambitions. And on the floor of the House today, we will fulfill that. We will take up and pass the Financial CHOICE Act, which repeals Dodd Frank, which takes the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which many of us believe is unconstitutional—how could a body of Congress actually empower an agency that we have no control over, no accountability to us, they do as they want to do and, yet, control so much of our economy? Today we take a step forward. We take a step forward to putting people back in power, to letting our community banks and our credit unions get back to doing what they do best, and that is treating their community and their people with respect, finding loans, opening up possibilities, having that next dream of someone who says, ‘‘I just want to take this opportunity,’’ and being able to fund it. You see, a lot has been said, and there are distractions everywhere, Mr. Speaker. We understand that many say nothing is getting done, but I look back and I say that the Republican majority is moving forward. We have a new Supreme Court Justice. We have passed 14 CRAs, rolling back almost $18 billion in compliance costs of regulations promulgated by the former administration. We have begun the process of doing what we said we are doing by replacing a failed healthcare system in which we have just found out in Ohio, Nebraska, Iowa, Georgia, that premiums have skyrocketed, where markets are no longer viable, where insurance is not there, and even if it is there, there are many places where they can buy it but not use it. That is health insurance, not healthcare. In fact, that is nothing for those who need it. You see, in Congress, we are moving forward. It is an agenda led by the administration, with the House and the Senate working together to say that we believe in the American people. We believe that the spirit of America is found in the individual hometowns, in the individual spirits that live there, not in a government that is controlled completely from Washington, D.C., where Washington says we know best. It is time we unleash the spirit again. Through this House, that process is starting today. The Financial CHOICE Act is a fulfillment of a promise, and there are many more to come. DODDFRANK HINDERS ECONOMIC GROWTH The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. ROTHFUS ) for 5 minutes. Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, for the past 8 years, we have been stuck in the slowest economic recovery in 70 years. With all the debate about the Financial CHOICE Act today, a simple question gets to the heart of the matter: Do we want to grow again? I contend, Mr. Speaker, the answer is—the answer has to be a resounding yes. It has to be yes because there is a moral imperative at play. The Financial CHOICE Act is about ending a stagnant status quo that is crushing our economy and opportunity. Multiple studies show that the Dodd Frank Act has hindered economic growth. One study estimates that, because of the overregulation we have seen since the 2008 financial crisis, there are 650,000 fewer small businesses than there otherwise would be, which would have provided 6.5 million jobs. That is 6.5 million people not utilizing their Godgiven talents for the betterment of society. That is 6.5 million people not paying the Social Security, Medicare, and income taxes that we need to fund critical programs. Some just want to raise taxes on the alreadyburdened taxpayers. I say, let us get new taxpayers into the game. Having more taxpayers helps us to pay for programs for veterans, education, medical research to find cures for diseases like Alzheimer’s and cancer, taxpayers to help fund the national defense. A couple of weeks ago, I visited a senior center in my district and had some very special conversations. Folks told me about the days when there were lots of jobs in factory towns in western Pennsylvania, and one World War II veteran showed me his Bronze Star. These individuals are counting on us to allow an economy to grow that will create the taxpayers who can help pay for the critical programs that support them, that pay for their care. We have a moral obligation, Mr. Speaker, to restore healthy growth to this economy. Today, let us pass the Financial CHOICE Act. Let us move from overregulation to rightsized regulation. Let us unclog the flow of capital to small businesses. Let us unclog consumers’ access to credit. Let us lower the cost of financial services for everyday consumers. Let us bring an end to the antigrowth policies of the last 8 years and move into a much brighter, more prosperous future for everyone. 
b1200 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker at noon. 
PRAYER The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: God of grace and goodness, thank You for giving us another day. We ask Your blessing of strength and perseverance that each Member might best serve their constituents and our entire Nation. May it be their purpose to see to the hopes of so many Americans, so as to authenticate the grandeur and glory of the ideals and principles of our democratic Republic with the work they do. Grant that the men and women of the people’s House find the courage and wisdom to work together to forge solutions to the many needs of our Nation and ease the anxieties of so many. May all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory. Amen. 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. The SPEAKER. The question is on the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. The question was taken; and the Speaker announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present. The SPEAKER. Pursuant to clause 8, rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. CRAWFORD ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. CRAWFORD led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, June is Alzheimer’s Awareness Month. Alzheimer’s is a progressive disease that leads to memory loss and other challenges in brain and physical function. Ultimately, it is fatal. More than 5 million Americans are living with Alzheimer’s, including over 220,000 residents of Illinois. Every 66 seconds, another American is diagnosed with this disease, and the rate of new cases are increasing. It has become our Nation’s sixth leading cause of death. Last year, Congress and the White House worked in a bipartisan manner to enact the 21st Century Cures Act. The legislation transforms our health research system to speed up the fight against Alzheimer’s and other diseases, but that is just the start. Let’s keep working together to end this devastating disease. 
DISMANTLING THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU (Mrs. BEATTY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a member of the Financial Services Committee in strong opposition to the Financial CHOICE Act, or, more appropriately titled, the ‘‘Wrong’’ CHOICE Act. The proponents of this bill claim it is about regulatory relief for our Nation’s community banks, but it is not. This bill guts the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an organization that was developed to protect consumers from unfair, deceptive, abusive practices. Mr. Speaker, I stand here today because the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has done amazing things. This bill would dismantle it, dismantle a Bureau that just in 6 years has recovered almost $12 billion for over 29 million Americans. Mr. Speaker, this is the wrong choice. This bill returns the American economy to the deregulatory state that led us to the great financial crisis and the deepest recession since the Great Depression. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this bill, because the fundamental question is, it does not provide choice or hope or opportunity for investors or for entrepreneurs. IN MEMORY OF STAFF SERGEANT ROBERT DALE VAN FOSSEN (Mr. CRAWFORD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory of Staff Sergeant Robert Dale Van Fossen of the Army National Guard and celebrate his return home after more than half a century. In November 1952, Staff Sergeant Van Fossen boarded an aircraft and took off from McChord Air Base in Tacoma, Washington, to Elmendorf Air Force Base in Alaska. In midflight, the plane disappeared in bad weather near Middleton Island in the Gulf of Alaska. Although some wreckage was found, no remains were recovered, and the Department of Defense notified the victims’ families that they would have no remains to bury. Van Fossen’s parents held a memorial service for their son in Greenbrier at the Macedonia Baptist Church. Though all hope seemed lost, the Van Fossen family kept trying to solve the mystery. For many years, they made efforts to learn about the crash. His sister Wilma Jean shared stories about it with her son Kevin Caid, and Kevin Caid began to seek as much information as he could regarding his late uncle. In June 2012, on a training mission, a Black Hawk Army National Guard unit discovered the wreckage only 12 miles away from the original crash site of the C–124. After closer inspection of the spot, it was determined it was indeed the missing plane from 1952. Finally, in March 2016, Staff Sergeant Robert Dale Van Fossen’s remains were confirmed found in Alaska. Along with the news of his remains being found, the family was informed that he would be returning home. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to say that Staff Sergeant Robert Dale Van Fossen finally returned home last month and is now at last buried next to his sister Wilma Jean Caid at the Cleburne County Memorial Gardens. 
PARIS CLIMATE AGREEMENT (Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, it is with great disgust that I rise in condemnation of President Trump’s withdrawal of the United States from the Paris climate accord. Despite his promise to make America great again, the President’s pullout from this agreement does exactly the opposite. It puts America behind 194 other countries that have placed truth and reality over ignorance. Climate change is real and it is manmade. It is a threat that must be addressed, and it is extremely frustrating that this administration has chosen to withdraw from the global fight against global warming. This pullout sends a message that the United States is no longer interested in leading the efforts to stop global warming, and it is a self inflicted wound and undercuts trust in American leadership. Withdrawal from the Paris Agreement will not save the coal industry, it won’t make America great again, and it is another impulsive and destructive decision by this administration that hurts our future. f 
HABITAT FOR HUMANITY AND DODDFRANK (Mr. TROTT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. TROTT. Mr. Speaker, during my first term in Congress, I had the opportunity to join Habitat for Humanity on one of their builds back in Oakland County, Michigan. It was a lot of fun and time well spent. Earlier this year, I met with Habitat and heard about their struggle to provide affordable homes under the regulations imposed by DoddFrank. Habitat for Humanity relies on the generosity of so many: not just volunteers who build the home or donate to their cause, but those who provide professional services free of charge. Of course a home needs to be appraised before a loan is approved, and many times professional appraisers volunteer their services. Under Dodd Frank, however, that is not allowed. DoddFrank mandates that appraisers receive customary and reasonable compensation for their services. This means Habitat can no longer accept donated services. In fact, Habitat told me that the complex DoddFrank rules have tripled the cost of loans. That is why I introduced the HOME Act; and I urge my colleagues to support the act, as it is part of the CHOICE Act we are considering later today. Let’s make sure Habitat can continue its important mission. 
PULLING OUT OF THE PARIS AGREEMENT (Mr. TONKO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my deep disappointment that President Trump intends to pull the United States out of the historic Paris climate agreement. This agreement is a powerful symbol of America’s strength and global leadership. It promised a bright future for our Nation and the world powered by clean energy. America was poised to lead that clean energy revolution. Instead, the world is now making plans to move ahead without us. Jobs will be created without us. New industries will be born and new innovative technologies manufactured without us. If we stick with this President’s decision, America will be on the outside looking in. I want to make one thing perfectly clear. I am still in, and so are more 
than 1,000 of America’s most forward thinking cities, States, universities, and businesses, including the cities of Albany, Schenectady, and Saratoga Springs, Union and Skidmore Colleges, and SUNY Albany. So are millions of our fellow Americans and communities in every single congressional district across our great Nation. Together, we will embrace the climate economy, even if our President does not. President Trump’s decision is a scar on America’s image, but the American people will continue to demand leadership on reducing carbon pollution. Our children and our grandchildren are counting on us. Let’s not fail them. 
COMMUNITY BANKS AND DODD FRANK (Mrs. ROBY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Mrs. ROBY. Mr. Speaker, since the enactment of DoddFrank in 2010, a total of 357 financial institutions have been forced out of business. Four community banks in Alabama are on that list. That amounts to nearly $7.5 billion less in Alabama’s economy that could be lent to small businesses and farmers. In all, nearly 20 percent of Alabama’s community banks have either closed or been forced to merge under DoddFrank. Why is this happening? Because homegrown banks can’t keep up with the crazy compliance costs that Dodd Frank mandates. Here is an example: One credit union in Alabama’s Wiregrass region, their compliance department size has tripled. They estimate that these new costs have limited their growth by as much as $60 million. That is not right. Hometown lenders in Alabama didn’t cause the financial crisis of 2009, but now they and their customers are paying the price. There is no question we need strong laws to govern our financial markets, but DoddFrank is not the answer. We now have a chance to fix this broken law, untangle this regulatory web, and unleash the capital investment that is so crucial to economic growth. I urge my colleagues to support the CHOICE Act. 
WITHDRAWING FROM THE PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD (Mr. MCNERNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MCNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because the safety and future of the American people is in jeopardy. Last week, the President made the irresponsible decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord. Military and national security leaders have asserted the need to address climate change as an imminent global threat. Removal from the Paris accord abdicates America’s global leadership and increases the likelihood of climate disasters. However, where our President has failed, State and local leaders are stepping up and leading. For example, last week, California’s Governor, Jerry Brown, brokered an agreement with China on reducing emissions. On the campaign trail, the President had a lot to say about China taking American jobs, but when he had the chance to pave the way to create American job growth, he failed. We must combat climate change and continue to deploy clean energy sources across the Nation that benefit our national security and create jobs. f 
NATIONAL HEMP HISTORY WEEK (Mr. COMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, this week is National Hemp History Week. Industrial hemp is a crop that can be used to produce more than 25,000 products, from textiles and fabrics to composites, auto parts, or even food. Hemp is such an industrial crop that, during World War II, the USDA produced a film encouraging farmers to grow hemp to support the war effort because textiles and fibers were in such short supply. George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and James Monroe all grew hemp. Today, however, industrial hemp is largely illegal for widespread production because the Controlled Substances Act does not make the distinction between hemp and marijuana. Both are varieties of the cannabis plant, but that is where the similarities end. Unlike marijuana, hemp is high in fiber that makes it so useful and only has miniscule amounts of PSC. In 2004, Congress began to recognize the differences when it passed the 2014 farm bill, which included language to allow industrial hemp pilot programs. Today, more than 30 States have enacted laws to legalize industrial hemp for research or commercial purposes. I was proud to lead the effort to create a hemp program in Kentucky that has been highly successful, with nearly 250 permitted growers and small businesses today. Now we need to take the next step in bringing hemp into the mainstream as a crop. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to advance legislation to make industrial hemp a legal crop for the farmers of Kentucky and across the United States of America. 
b1215 PROTECT AND EXPAND MONUMENT DESIGNATIONS (Mr. O’ROURKE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. O’ROURKE. Mr. Speaker, today marks the 111th anniversary of the Antiquities Act. Over more than a century, Presidents of both parties have preserved and opened to the public over 157 monuments, like the Grand Canyon by President Theodore Roosevelt, or Zion in Utah by President William Howard Taft, or the Pacific National Monument in Hawaii by President George W. Bush. It is also connected to our economy and jobs, with 7 million jobs in the United States connected to outdoor recreation in our national monuments. While this administration is reviewing certain monuments, we need to protect the ones that we already have, like Organ Mountains National Monument in New Mexico, or Bears Ears National Monument in Utah. We also need to think about expanding national monuments where we have heritage that we want to preserve, like Castner Range, that preserves 10,000 years of human history and civilization in El Paso, Texas, where the United States and Mexico meet. Mr. Speaker, let’s work together to strengthen the Antiquities Act and not diminish its protections. f 
FREE SPEECH (Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, people who are the loudest in proclaiming their tolerance are often the most intolerant people of all. This has been proven in spades this year at the most liberal leftwing college campuses all over this country. Almost all colleges and universities now have programs or offices supposedly promoting diversity. However, this diversity apparently does not apply to conservatives. Probably the least diverse groups in this Nation today are the faculties of our universities. And while almost everyone in higher education will say they are for freedom of speech, conservative students know they can express their views only at the risk of lower grades. In addition, almost no leading conservatives are invited to be college commencements speakers. This year, we have even seen very hateful demonstrations and some violence at universities when conservative speakers have been invited to speak at these supposed bastions of free speech. Some of the young student haters conducting their farleft demonstrations would have fit right in during the bookburning, antifree speech days in Nazi Germany. 
FOOD POLICY IS FOREIGN POLICY (Mr. EVANS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, for years, I have said: Food policy is foreign policy. 
And I will say it again: Our food policy is our foreign policy. Think about it. Food unites family and friends. Food is nutritional. Food is medicine. Food is the cement that sets a foundation for strong, healthy neighborhoods. Just as Senator Dole and Senator McGovern worked together to rebuild SNAP, expand our School Lunch Program, and create WIC to fight hunger 40 years ago, we know food security is a bipartisan issue. In Philadelphia, 20 percent of our population is food insecure, meaning 1 in 5 Philadelphians often don’t know where their next meal will come from. To make our neighborhoods stronger block by block, we need to lay the framework for a strategy that gives our cities the resources to tackle this issue. Believe me when I say that I know our country is facing trying times we have never seen before. From Comey to Russia, to the President’s budget, and the Republican attack on healthcare, I know firsthand that the Nation has a lot to lose under this administration. This is why we need to ensure that we have more tools in our toolbox. It is time to retool to fight hunger. Food is the glue that keeps neighborhoods and nations united. Together, let’s roll up our sleeves and work to retool the way we fight hunger in our cities, our Nation, and around the globe. Our food policy is our foreign policy. 
HONORING AIR FORCE CAPTAIN JOE SMITH (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an American hero, Air Force Captain Joe Smith, as he makes his final flight home. Though it has been nearly half a century since the 25yearold fighter pilot was fatally shot down during the Vietnam war, he will finally be laid to rest in his hometown of Assumption, Illinois. Thanks to the efforts of the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, a group which searches the world for missing American veterans, the remains of Joe Smith were identified, along with his plane, by using DNA analysis. The effort made to bring him home all these years later is a true testament to the military’s motto of no soldier left behind. Those who knew Joe remember him as being a bright, polite young man, who was well educated, earning his master’s degree in business at the University of Notre Dame and Washington University. Though he did not have to, Joe went willingly into the service, where he began as a first lieutenant and quickly worked his way up to the promotion of being a captain. With the help of the Assumption Historical Society, Joe’s widow, Elaine Mills, a native of Decatur, has worked hard to keep his memory alive and honor his service to our Nation. I hope to do the same by recognizing him today on this House floor. Joe is a true hero. This country and this House will long remember his valor. f 
MARSHALL PLAN (Mr. COSTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, 70 years ago this week, Secretary of State George Marshall proposed an ambitious plan to rebuild Europe following the devastation of World War II. Out of the Marshall Plan’s transatlantic spirit of shared interests and economic cooperation, stronger military integration arose in the form of NATO. NATO, alongside the European Union, have formed the pillars of a safe, secure, and strong Europe while promoting the U.S. security and economic interests, our interests. We must be firm in our commitment to article 5 of the NATO treaty. If America’s commitment to the alliance is doubted, either by other NATO countries or adversaries of NATO, the peace secured by the United States and its allies will be threatened, make no mistake about it. This is the longest peacetime period in Europe in over 1,000 years, which is really remarkable, and we should not take it for granted. It is our responsibility in Congress and in the White House to ensure that global order secured by NATO is strengthened, not damaged. So it is important that we recognize this 70th anniversary of the Marshall Plan. 
HONORING STEVE HARDY (Mr. GARAMENDI asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the memory of Mayor Steve Hardy of Vacaville, California, a man who dedicated his life to service, first in the U.S. Navy for 5 years, then as a policeman, and later in the California State Senate, where I had the privilege of working with him when he was the staff director of the Governmental Organization Committee. During his tenure as mayor, he led the city through a very difficult period—the Great Recession—revising the city’s finances, bringing it back to vitality, and also continuing the role of Vacaville as one of the major cities in my district. It was a great pleasure working with him during those years. His marriage of 46 years to his wife, Jerri, is a testament not only to his service to the community, but also to his family. He is survived by his children. I look forward to his memory and to the future of Vacaville. 
DEBBIE’S KIDNAPPING STORY (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Americans once thought that the horrors of human trafficking were a foreign problem. However, traffickers lurk all around us right here in America. Debbie’s mother thought nothing of letting her young daughter meet a friend in front of their yard one night to play. Her mother didn’t realize her 15yearold daughter, who was clad in her cartoon pajamas, was quickly abducted by two men in front of their house. These deviants threw Debbie in the car, drugged her, and gang raped her. They threatened to shoot her if she ever tried to escape. For 60 days she was forced to have sex with countless men. An anonymous tip led police to a hotel room where they found Debbie tied up and stashed under a bed. But many trafficking victims are never rescued. We cannot allow this scourge to 
continue to rage in America. Our children are not for sale, period. And that is just the way it is. 
REPEALING DODDFRANK (Mr. RASKIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise because the majority is expected to vote today to repeal DoddFrank, the legislation that we passed after Wall Street predators in the mortgage meltdown crisis cost the American people 8.7 million jobs and $19 trillion, including $2.7 trillion in retirement savings. Ten million Americans lost their homes and entire communities were devastated. But, amazingly, the majority wants to destroy the most important piece of financial safety legislation passed for the American people in 75 years. They call it the Financial CHOICE Act, but what kind of choice does it give you? It destroys the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which has saved 26 million people nearly $12 billion from scams and ripoffs. It destroys the Volcker rule, which keeps banks from making speculative bets with your money. The Financial CHOICE Act is the wrong choice for America and a very bad choice for Congress. 
CREATING OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL AMERICANS (Mr. YODER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. YODER. Mr. Speaker, today the House will take up and consider an important bill that will help create opportunity for all Americans: the Financial CHOICE Act. The Financial CHOICE Act repeals the most harmful aspects of the Dodd Frank legislation that halted the flow of capital to our constituents, destroyed small community banks, frustrated small businesses, and generally made life harder for Americans. The Financial CHOICE Act provides relief to Main Street businesses that had nothing to do with the 2008 financial crisis, but were slammed with onerous and unnecessary regulations anyway. Mr. Speaker, we need smart regulations that protect consumers and make our markets less risky. In many cases, DoddFrank did the opposite, and this has been a wet blanket on the economy, destroying jobs and opportunities for millions of Americans. Importantly, Mr. Speaker, the bill also ends government bailouts for large banks considered too big to fail once and for all. It will cut our deficits by $25 billion and finally subject the Federal Reserve to a proper audit. Mr. Speaker, above all, our bill promotes economic growth so that all Americans can have the freedom and ability to get the job they want, create the small business they have always dreamed of, and secure their family’s future. f 
PREPARING FOR DISASTER (Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, with hurricane season underway, my constituents in Florida and all Americans living in coastal regions are susceptible to these devastating storms. Disaster can strike at any time, often with little warning. It is never too early to prepare. Know your evacuation routes and have a supply kit ready. Also important, ensure your home is structurally sound to withstand intense winds and rain. Taking steps now to reinforce a roof covering or protect an exterior window could mean the difference between saving money in the long run and dealing with major property damage. That is why I am introducing the SHELTER Act, to provide tax credits to encourage people to stormproof their homes and properties. This legislation is about helping our communities be proactive when it comes to preparing for hurricane season. Our local emergency managers in Pasco, Pinellas, and Hillsborough Counties do an incredible job of ensuring our communities are ready. But preparedness must also begin at home. 
b1230 FRANCISCAN COMMUNITY DEPARTS CONWELLEGAN (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, over the last 60 years, the Franciscan Friars shaped the lives of many students and families that have passed through the halls of ConwellEgan Catholic High School in lower Bucks County. It is with a heavy heart that I rise today to announce the departure of the Franciscan community from ConwellEgan. If you went to Egan like me, then you knew Father Fidelis and Brother Larry. Their service and the service of more than 150 other Friars who have ministered there have brought profound grace and enrichment to the lives of so many young men and women throughout lower Bucks County. The Franciscan Order at Conwell Egan reinforced the school mission of building character through service, achieving academic excellence, and demonstrating a commitment to a life full of learning. Myself, my family, and the entire lower Bucks County community are forever grateful for their continuous guidance and their continuous support. As we say goodbye to these exemplary individuals, true representatives of St. Francis, we wish them the best as they move on to their next mission. f 
REPEAL OF CONSUMER PROTECTIONS IS NOT WHAT AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose the Financial CHOICE Act, which abandons the American people, as well as safety and soundness, in favor of Wall Street. Six megabanks now control two thirds of the financial sector in our country and reaped record profits of over $170 billion in 2016. That is too much power in too few hands. Current law has made progress in protecting consumers from predatory practices. Repeal of these consumer protections is not what the American people want. This week, Congressman JONES and I propose to table the current legislation and replace it with our bipartisan bill, the Prudent Banking Act, which reinstates GlassSteagall protections by separating prudent banking from risky Wall Street speculation that tanked our economy in 2008. The Rules Committee refused to allow our bill a vote. Nevertheless, we remain resolute. GlassSteagall is something President Trump ran on, as did BERNIE  SANDERS , and, in 2016, both the Republican and Democratic platforms enshrined policies to restore Glass Steagall protections. Americans should know there is a growing bipartisan consensus fighting to protect the progress we have made, rein in Wall Street, and keep the wolves at bay and out of your pocketbook. I will be voting ‘‘no’’ on this bill and urge my colleagues to do the same. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF LESLIE SPAETH (Mr. CHABOT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a beloved Warren County, Ohio, icon, Leslie Spaeth, who passed away recently at the age of 92. Mr. Spaeth was a dedicated husband and father and grandfather and great grandfather. What made him so special was his dedication, not only to his family, but also to his community and to his country. Leslie Spaeth first served his Nation as a corporal during World War II. Throughout his life, he continued to serve our community as a volunteer firefighter, as president of the Mason Council, as Warren County Auditor, as a member of the Warren County Board of Elections, and, finally, as the Warren County chairman of the Republican Party. In his personal time, he bettered the lives of those around him, volunteering 
with the American Legion’s Buckeye Boys State program and as an elder at his church. Mr. Speaker, Leslie Spaeth was a patriot and a family man, and it has been my honor to represent him in Congress since Warren County came into my congressional district. I wish his family my sincere condolences as we say goodbye to one of our finest. 
PROVIDING RELIEF TO AMERICA’S COMMUNITY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (Mr. ROYCE of California asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I would like to make the point: I am from the State of California, and that has long been the innovation capital for new ideas in America, for hightech, and a place where a person with an idea and hard work and a little startup capital can grow a business. We have had a major problem with respect to our community banks and our credit unions, the smaller ones, and that is they are going out of business at a very fast, rapid clip. A large percentage of them are struggling under this DoddFrank legislation that was passed in 2010. Now, I think the legislation was well intended, but to put all the regulatory burden and these costs on these smaller institutions has ended up with this onesizefitsall regulation that makes it very, very difficult for them to give credit to entrepreneurs across our State. I think that many of the provisions have been injurious, then, not only to the community banks, the credit unions, the smaller ones, but to the small businesses, to the borrowers, and to the savers that rely on these institutions. We do need to make adjustment in this, and the Financial CHOICE Act will provide, I think, muchneeded relief to the community financial institutions in a responsible and proactive way. I think that the premise is straightforward, which is a banking institution has to be strongly capitalized and wellmanaged to get the offramp from DoddFrank. 
COMMUNICATION FROM THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. FITZPATRICK ) laid before the House the following communication from the Clerk of the House of Representatives: 
Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and submit extraneous materials on the bill, H.R. 10, the Financial CHOICE Act of 2017. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 375 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 10. The Chair appoints the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. WOMACK ) to preside over the Committee of the Whole. b1237 
Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill (H.R. 10) to create hope and opportunity for investors, consumers, and entrepreneurs by ending bailouts and Too Big to Fail, holding Washington and Wall Street accountable, eliminating red tape to increase access to capital and credit, and repealing the provisions of the DoddFrank Act that make America less prosperous, less stable, and less free, and for other purposes, with Mr. WOMACK in the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the first time. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. HENSARLING ) and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. MAXINE WATERS ) each will control 45 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, at this time I proudly yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. RYAN), the distinguished Speaker of the House. Mr. RYAN. Mr. Chairman, I just want to start off by thanking Chairman HENSARLING and the entire Financial Services Committee for their leadership on this vital and important legislation. Job well done. The Financial CHOICE Act answers a deep need at the very heart of our economy. We have heard about this need time and again from our constituents back home. I sure have. Small businesses are struggling. They have been unable to hire, invest, or get the loans that they need to get off the ground. Families looking to keep their money safe are hit with fees that they cannot afford. And why is this? Our community banks are in trouble. They are being crushed by the costly rules imposed on them by the DoddFrank Act. This law may have had good intentions, but its consequences have been dire for Main Street. Let me put it this way: It is more than 1,000 pages long and has more rules and regulations than any other Obamaera law. The burdens created are real and deep. These costs are unsustainable for small community banks who simply cannot afford to meet all the requirements and can’t hire a team of lawyers to decipher the seemingly endless rules. So what do they do? They hunker down. They are unable to loan out money. Or worse, they are shutting down. The CHOICE Act reins in Dodd Frank, and it delivers the regulatory relief these small banks so desperately need. This will change our communities because these banks are the lifeblood of our Main Streets. Where I come from, representing towns small and medium, they are not big companies in big cities getting money from big banks. They are small and mediumsize businesses in small and mediumsize towns hoping the community banker will be able to give them the loan they need to hire some people, to take a risk, to start a small business, to expand their small business. They know the needs of their communities, and they are able to identify the people who can fill those needs successfully. There is a reason why they handle the vast majority of smallbusiness loans in this country: because they are the ones who are the closest to the small businesses. Here is the difference: The people big banks may overlook thinking it is some guy with a pipe dream, the community banker is able to recognize that as a father of four with the drive to make his dream of a bicycle shop into a reality or a woman seeking to rent out retail space to open her dream restaurant using her family recipes, or maybe it is a young farmer with a new idea to integrate the latest technology into the family farm. The big banks don’t pay attention to that; only community banks do. A couple of years later, with the help of these kinds of loans from these local banks, these socalled pipe dreams in these small towns and these rural counties become successful businesses. They become job creators. These are the ultimate success stories that our communities in America are built upon. This is why the Financial CHOICE Act is so important. It helps community banks and the small businesses that absolutely depend on them, it helps them thrive. It protects consumers by increasing accountability and transparency over the wider financial sector, and it also repeals ‘‘too big to fail,’’ the rules codified by Dodd Frank that have left taxpayers on the 
hook for too long. Ultimately, the Financial CHOICE Act is a jobs bill, and it is one that will bring hope back to Main Street. It is easy to talk about the economy and regulations as a series of numbers. It is easy to talk in vague terms about job creators and smallbusiness owners. But what is far more important is identifying the problems that they actually face and actually doing something about those problems to help make a difference to improve their lives. That is what this CHOICE Act is all about. It is why we were sent here: to look out for the people who work hard and who do the right thing. Let’s get this done for them. Let’s get this done for the people who take the risks, who live and breathe their work, for the people who strive and struggle every day for their families. Let’s pass the CHOICE Act today. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. H.R. 10 is being called the ‘‘Wrong’’ CHOICE Act by the American public because this bill is truly the wrong choice for all of us. Indeed, this is one of the worst bills I have seen in my time in Congress. This bill is a vehicle for Donald Trump’s agenda to deregulate and help out Wall Street. It destroys nearly all of the important policies we put in place in the DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act to prevent another financial crisis and protect consumers. This bill would create vast harm and lead us right back to the bad old days. We all remember the suffering that resulted from the Great Recession: $13 trillion in household wealth was lost; 11 million people lost their homes; the unemployment rate hit 10 percent. The impact was enormous and felt by all. This bill would pave the way back to economic damage of the same scale—or worse. The ‘‘Wrong’’ CHOICE Act guts the highly successful Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which works to make sure that hardworking Americans are not subjected to predatory practices in the financial marketplace. Since its creation, the Consumer Bureau has returned nearly $12 billion to more than 29 million consumers who have been ripped off by financial institutions. This bill would foolishly put a stop to the Consumer Bureau’s good work and once again leave consumers vulnerable. That is not all. Across the board, the ‘‘Wrong’’ CHOICE Act removes essential DoddFrank protections for consumers, investors, and our economy. b1245 Despite what Republicans will tell you, banks large and small are doing just fine since the passage of Dodd Frank. Last year, they posted record profits. Here is the bottom line: Donald Trump and Republicans want to open the door to another economic catastrophe like the Great Recession and return us to a financial system where reckless and predatory practices harm our families and communities. We cannot allow that to happen. Mr. Chair, I urge all of my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this catastrophically bad bill. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, it has been 7 years since the DoddFrank Act was passed, a monumental triumph of ideology over compassion and common sense. All of the promises of DoddFrank were broken. They promised us it would lift the economy, Mr. Chairman, but, instead, we are still stymied in the weakest, slowest recovery in the postwar era. They promised us that it would end too big to fail, but, instead, it cynically codified toobigtofail banks in the law and backed it up with a taxpayer bailout fund. It promised us, Mr. Chairman—they promised us that it would lead to a more stable economy, but, instead, the big banks are bigger. The small banks are fewer. We are losing a community bank or credit union a day. Our corporate bond market, a key component of financing of jobs, historic levels of volatility and illiquidity. They promised us, Mr. Chairman, that it would help the consumer, but, instead, we see free checking cut in half at banks, bank fees are up. The ranks of the unbanked have increased. For many creditworthy borrowers, they are paying $500 more for an auto loan. Have you tried getting a mortgage recently? They are harder to come by and cost hundreds of dollars more to close. Every promise of DoddFrank has been broken. And, Mr. Chairman, we hear about it every day. I heard from Julieann, a banker in Massachusetts, and she wrote, ‘‘‘We have experienced a spike in loan declines to women,’ for their investigation identified that women attempting to buy the family home to settle their divorce and stabilize their family were being declined at a high rate due to the DoddFrank Qualified Mortgage rules. . . .’’ DoddFrank is hurting recently divorced women. I heard from Allen in New Hampshire who talked about his need for a new car, but he couldn’t find a loan from a bank, and he said: 
But for my local dealer’s efforts on my behalf, there is no doubt I would not be driving my current car, and this was a desperate situation, for I am the sole income earner for my family. My wife is ill, and we have two young children in school. After my old vehicle broke down, I needed to find reliable, replacement transportation so that I could get to work and continue to provide for my family. Please ensure that financing car and truck dealerships are not stymied by Dodd Frank’s CFPB. 
I heard from Maxine in Salt Lake City, who talked about her company. She said: Last February, we were awarded a major catering contract for all food services in the new performing arts center. The new contract will require us to make a major investment in equipment in small wares. We will be able to hire 50 additional staff. Unfortunately, red tape got in the way, turned what should have been a golden opportunity into an unbelievable headache. Three banks informed us that our rating, according to new bank regulations imposed by DoddFrank, disqualified us from consideration. 
Mr. Chairman, we have letter after letter, email after email, showing how DoddFrank is harming working families, harming small businesses, crushing community banks. Fortunately, Mr. Chairman, there is a better, smarter way, and it is called the Financial CHOICE Act. It is going to create hope and opportunity for investors and consumers, and entrepreneurs, and it stands for economic growth for all, but bank bailouts for none. Contrary to DoddFrank, and what every Democrat will come here today— my friends on the other side of the aisle—and defend, we will end bank bailouts once and for all. We will replace bailout with bankruptcy. We will replace economic stagnation with a growing healthy economy. We will ensure that there will finally be pay increases, wage increases for working Americans who haven’t seen a pay increase since DoddFrank became law. We will replace Washington micromanagement with market discipline. We will ensure that we replace taxpayer money with private money because for every bank who will have a 10 percent simple leverage ratio, which is analogous to having a private insurance policy against bailout, we will let them have that DoddFrank offramp, and that is so important. But, Mr. Chairman, we are also going to hold Wall Street accountable with the toughest penalties that they have seen, and no more bailouts. Perhaps that is one of the reasons they oppose the Financial CHOICE Act and support the status quo of DoddFrank. We will make sure that there is needed regulatory relief for our small banks and credit unions, because it is our small banks who loan to our small businesses, that create the job engine of America, and make sure that the American Dream is not a pipe dream; but, instead, it is a dream and a vision where we will only be limited by our imagination. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chair, the Speaker and Mr. HENSARLING would have you think this is all about community banks being hurt, but let me tell you what this is all about. U.S. and foreign banks have paid more than $160 billion in penalties to resolve cases brought against them by the Justice Department and Federal regulatory agencies for cases involving collusion, fraud against consumers, bribery, and other abuses. 
There were 144 major cases of $100 million or more against 26 large U.S. and foreign banks. Just look at this: Bank of America, $56 billion; J.P.Morgan, $28 billion; Citigroup, $15 billion; Wells Fargo—and you know about Wells Fargo and what they did— $11 billion; Goldman Sachs, $9 billion; Morgan Stanley, $5 billion. This is about ripoffs, so this bill will prevent us from being able to assess these kinds of penalties on those who are ripping off the American public. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. CLAY), ranking member of the Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit Subcommittee. Mr. CLAY. Mr. Chair, I thank the ranking member. I rise today to oppose H.R. 10, a dangerous assault on American consumers that would gut the landmark DoddFrank Wall Street Reform Act. If the ‘‘Wrong’’ CHOICE Act is allowed to be inflicted on working families, the reckless financial speculators who sold out the American people on Wall Street would be given a free pass to perpetrate future financial abuses that will reap billions for them and rob average Americans of their financial security again. The ‘‘Wrong’’ CHOICE Act would take us back to the pre2008 era of unchecked reckless financial abuses that resulted in the worst recession since the Great Depression. Let me remind Members of the crushing cost of that national economic emergency: over 8 million jobs lost, 10 percent unemployment, 7 million home foreclosures, and trillions of dollars of personal institutional wealth wiped out. No proponent of this bill can look the American people in the face and tell them that this is better for consumers, because it is not. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOODLATTE ), chairman of the Judiciary Committee. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chair, I would first like to thank Chairman HENSARLING for introducing this important piece of legislation. The CHOICE Act replaces the orderly liquidation authority under title II of DoddFrank with a new bankruptcy procedure developed by the Committee on the Judiciary in the Financial Institution Bankruptcy Act. In 2008, our economy suffered one of the most significant financial crises in history. In the ensuing years, experts from the financial, regulatory, legal, and academic communities have examined how best to prevent another similar crisis from occurring and to eliminate the possibility of using taxpayer moneys to bail out failing firms. The Judiciary Committee has advanced the review of this issue, with the aim of crafting a solution that will better equip our bankruptcy laws to resolve failing firms, while also encouraging greater private counterparty diligence in order to reduce the likelihood of another financial crisis. The Financial Institution Bankruptcy Act is the culmination of a multiyear, bipartisan process that solicited and incorporated the views of a wide range of leading experts and relevant regulators. The CHOICE Act incorporates all of the provisions of the Financial Institution Bankruptcy Act, providing a balanced approach that increases transparency and predictability in the resolution of a financial firm. Furthermore, it ensures that shareholders and creditors—not taxpayers— bear the losses related to the failure of a financial company. Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. PERLMUTTER ), ranking member of the Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade Subcommittee. Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman from California (Ms. MAXINE WATERS ) for yielding me time. I rise in opposition to H.R. 10, the ‘‘Bad’’ CHOICE Act, which brings back the Wild West to our financial markets and hurts consumers. It is a bad choice because this takes us back to a time when we were losing 800,000 jobs a month—not gaining 200,000 jobs a month. Colorado takes us back to when we had 10 percent unemployment—not 2.5 percent unemployment. It takes us back to a time when the stock market was 6,500—not 21,000. It brings back no discipline. The markets were in chaos. People got hurt. This kind of return to bad legislation and bad regulation is not good for America, and we should all vote ‘‘no.’’ Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. LUETKEMEYER ), a real leader on our committee and chairman of the Financial Institution and Consumer Credit Subcommittee. Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Chairman, I am very proud to stand with Chairman HENSARLING today and offer my support for H.R. 10, the Financial CHOICE Act of 2017. This bill offers a responsible approach to financial regulation that will protect consumers and allow the American economy to flourish. The Financial CHOICE Act makes meaningful reforms that ensure transparency, restore a rule of law, and help consumers and small businesses gain access to the credit they need to move forward towards financial independence, be the entrepreneurs they are, and be able to realize their dreams. Mr. Chairman, we lose one community bank or credit union a day, as the chairman just mentioned, every day. These are the institutions that lend to families and small businesses across America. These institutions are the backbone of each of our communities and something that must be done to reverse this dangerous trend of consolidation and closure. There has been a considerable amount of discussion on both sides of the aisle on the need to help community financial institutions. The legislation we will consider today provides every Member of Congress the opportunity to cast a vote in favor of responsible regulatory relief for credit unions and community banks across the Nation. The Financial CHOICE Act will increase access to credit for consumers by easing rules and regulations that never should have been applied to smaller financial institutions in the first place. H.R. 10 also makes important reforms to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an unaccountable agency that embodies the Washington knowsbest mentality that the Nation is so tired of seeing and, instead, creates a more responsible framework that actually protects consumers instead of special interests. The Financial CHOICE Act offers a new model for financial opportunity and responsible regulation. It is time to take steps to remove the boot from the neck of our Nation’s lenders and their customers. Former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has said about the bill that it would have a tremendous stimulative effect on our economy. The Financial CHOICE Act is the right choice to help our communities grow their economies and our citizens realize their dreams. Mr. Chair, I want to thank Chairman HENSARLING for his unwavering leadership and urge my colleagues to support H.R. 10. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. KILDEE ), the vice ranking member of the Committee on Financial Services. Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member for yielding. I understand the President of the United States himself has no real understanding of American history, but that is no excuse for this body for ignoring even the recent history of this country and returning us to the conditions, to the regulatory environment that not only preceded but contributed to cause the worst financial crisis that I have experienced in my lifetime, the Great Recession. b1300 Millions of people lost their homes. Millions of people lost their job and lost everything they worked for because they were completely unprotected against institutions and organizations that were predators against them. This proposed legislation would take away those very protections and return us to a time when institutions and organizations can use unfair and deceptive practices, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau under this legislation would be barred—would be barred—from going to bat for those people being taken advantage of. This makes no sense. We ought to reject it, and I urge my colleagues to join me in doing so. 
Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT ), the chairman of our Small Business Committee. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for yielding. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 10, the Financial CHOICE Act, and I want to thank Chairman HENSARLING for his leadership on this important issue. For the last 7 years, DoddFrank has blocked small businesses from getting the capital they need to grow and create more jobs. As chairman of the Small Business Committee, it is no surprise that small businesses from all across the country tell me over and over again that this blocking of capital to them by DoddFrank is preventing them from creating more jobs which are needed in this country. Whether to pay employees or to buy new equipment, we need to make it easier for smallbusiness owners to gain access to capital. H.R. 10 is chock full of real reforms, including the Helping Angels Lead Our Startups, or HALOS, Act to encourage and inspire entrepreneurs across the country. The Nation’s 29 million small businesses are working hard to achieve the American Dream. Let’s not let our own government continue to stand in their way. Support this legislation. It is very important. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ ), who is the ranking member of the Small Business Committee. Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the ranking member, MAXINE WATERS . Here they come again, Mr. Chairman. My colleagues seem to suffer from a case of policymaking amnesia. I was here in 2008 as our Nation stood on the edge of financial ruin. I will never forget those dark days. Thanks to Wall Street making reckless bets and inadequate government oversight, millions of Americans lost their homes and jobs. Tell them about market discipline back in 2008. Main Street small businesses shed employees, and many shut their doors for good. Our economy nearly slid into another Depression. Now, my Republican colleagues may have forgotten that sequence of events, but let me tell you something: The American people have not forgotten. DoddFrank has improved accountability in the financial system. It has protected consumers and investors from predatory practices. It stabilizes our markets. And yet here we are talking about gutting this landmark law. The American people are watching. Let’s be clear. If you vote ‘‘yes,’’ you are voting to restore the same conditions that fueled the crisis and collapse of 2008. It is a vote you will regret—and be remembered for. Vote ‘‘no.’’ Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. HUIZENGA ), who is a leader on our Capital Markets, Securities, and Investments Subcommittee. Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Chairman, the economic downturn in 2008 caused Michiganders and folks around the country to lose their jobs, families to lose their savings, and even some to lose their homes. Since that time, folks on the other side of the aisle have been attempting to convince the American people that the DoddFrank Act is ‘‘the answer’’ to the financial crisis, despite the law failing to actually address the root cause of the downturn. In reality, DoddFrank has made it more difficult for hardworking taxpayers to secure a future for themselves and their children by denying them the economic recovery that they deserve. Hardworking Americans rely on capital markets to save for everything from college to retirement. We as Congress must act to eliminate the burdensome and unnecessary red tape created under DoddFrank to ensure U.S. capital markets remain the most effective in the world so that all investors can receive the greatest return on their investments. Since DoddFrank, our capital markets have become less stable, less efficient, and less liquid, which has made it more difficult for small businesses and American job creators around the country to access the necessary financial resources in order to expand and create jobs. In fact, DoddFrank has severed access to the capital markets for Main Street businesses and entrepreneurs who are the heartbeat of the American economy. In order to succeed, small and growing companies need capital and credit—the lifeblood for growth, expansion, and job creation. Yet the government has continued to construct arbitrary walls that cut them off from essential financing as smaller companies are caught in a sea of red tape created by Washington bureaucrats. Enough is enough. In order to increase economic opportunity, we must enact commonsense regulatory reform and restore accountability to Wall Street and to Washington. The House Financial Services Committee achieves this goal through the carefully crafted CHOICE Act, which we are debating here today. The Financial CHOICE Act eliminates DoddFrank’s onesizefitsall regulatory structure which has strangled community financial institutions with overly burdensome regulations that were meant for the largest banks here in America. The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentleman from Michigan an additional 30 seconds. Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Chairman, by enacting the CHOICE Act, community banks and credit unions can utilize their resources to help their individual customers and small businesses achieve financial independence. If we want small businesses to continue to be the engine of economic growth, we must remove the regulatory red tape that is preventing community lenders from supporting these small business job creators. We hold Wall Street accountable. We hold the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau accountable, and we make it more effective to do its job. No government agency should be unaccountable to the American taxpayer. DoddFrank was a larger social agenda waiting for a crisis, and I understand that from my friends on the other side; but today, small businesses and hardworking Americans continue to pay the price. The Financial CHOICE Act enacts progrowth reforms, restores accountability, and provides opportunity. I encourage a ‘‘yes’’ vote. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. ALGREEN ), who is the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member. Mr. Chairman, this bill is a setback because it allows the American public to be subject to ripoffs. It allows you to be ripped off when you get your auto loan. Without your knowing it, it will allow you to pay a higher amount than you should be paying. It allows you to, without your consent, have the money that you place in the bank be taken away from your account, moved over to another place, and used to gamble; if they win, they keep the profits—all done without your consent. It allows, without your knowledge, the person that you are working with to invest your pension and to put his interests ahead of your interests. This is a ripoff bill. We should not support it. The American consumers are placed at risk. This is the time to stand. We must say ‘‘no’’ to H.R. 10. It is, indeed, the wrong choice. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. WAGNER ), who is a fighter on our committee. She is the chair of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee. Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Chairman, I am proud to stand before you today to speak on H.R. 10, the Financial CHOICE Act. I would like to thank Chairman HENSARLING and all my colleagues on the House Financial Services Committee for their hard work on this legislation, including holding 145 hearings on Dodd Frank and the CHOICE Act. For nearly 10 years following the financial crisis, our country witnessed one of the weakest recoveries of our lifetimes as DoddFrank held small businesses and families hostage and prevented our economy from growing. Now it is harder for families to qualify for a mortgage, obtain an auto loan, and access other forms of credit that they depend on every single day. 
The only beneficiaries from Dodd Frank have been Washington bureaucrats, who have grown more powerful; and big banks have only grown bigger at the expense of your personal freedoms and your freedom to make your own financial decisions. DoddFrank has failed the American people. Instead, the CHOICE Act, which stands for creating hope and opportunity for investors, consumers, and entrepreneurs, represents a better way from this Republican Congress that will provide Americans with the financial opportunities that they deserve. The CHOICE Act is about helping Main Street, not Wall Street, and will increase lending in our communities, open up our economy, end taxpayer funded bank bailouts, and hold Wall Street and Washington accountable. It will allow us to impose the toughest penalties on Wall Street executives who engage in fraud, deception, and selfdealing. Unlike before, executives who commit financial crimes will be held accountable, rather than innocent taxpayers and shareholders. Americans deserve relief from the regulatory burden and lack of financial options that DoddFrank has created. Americans deserve the ‘‘Right’’ CHOICE Act. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 10. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. MOORE ), who is the ranking member of the Monetary Policy and Trade Subcommittee. Ms. MOORE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the ‘‘Wrong’’ CHOICE Act. This is a bad bill, and I suspect that Republicans are pushing it through with only one hearing because they want to push it past the beleaguered public who lost trillions of dollars of wealth and home value during the last recession. Republicans’ rubric about freedom and community banks is not fooling anyone. This legislation unleashes every bloodthirsty and greedy Wall Street superpredator back into the American people to feast on our misery like they did preDoddFrank. In contrast, you will actually hear the GOP blame predatory borrowers and say that they caused the crisis—like blaming hungry children for famines. If this bill passes with the mere 10 percent capital requirements, the financial system will become brittle, prone to systemic crisis and taxpayer bailouts—a system that is less fair and rife with fraud. Didn’t we learn our lesson in 2008? 2008 taught us that we cannot have sustainable economic growth absent good regulation. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to reject this bad bill. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. BARR), who is the chairman of the Monetary Policy and Trade Subcommittee. Mr. BARR. Mr. Chairman, the Dodd Frank Act is a failure, period. It is estimated to reduce economic output by nearly $1 trillion over the next 10 years, and it contains more regulatory restrictions than all of the other regulations enacted by the previous administration combined, including ObamaCare. The Financial CHOICE Act provides an offramp—muchneeded relief—to DoddFrank’s growthcrushing regulations. Financial institutions like community banks and credit unions will have the choice to stay under the DoddFrank regulatory regime or opt for the relief that they are willing to obtain if they meet a 10 percent simple leverage ratio, a level that ensures that they can weather economic downturns without the help of taxpayer bailouts. This legislation also reins in the primary culprit of the regulatory onslaught that has caused one in five community financial institutions in my State of Kentucky to close: the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. This is done by giving Congress the power of the purse over the Bureau for the first time, making its Director removable by the President, requiring it to conduct costbenefit analysis, and enhancing its mission to focus on consumer protection through competition and choice. This legislation also delivers important regulatory relief to community financial institutions, incorporating the TAILOR Act, which requires Federal regulators to tailor their regulations based on the size of financial institutions instead of using the typical one sizefitsall Washington model. Additionally, the Financial CHOICE Act ends stifling DoddFrank regulations that constrain lending for manufactured homes by including the Preserving Access to Manufactured Housing Act. It also further reduces the chances of a mortgage crisis by giving financial firms an incentive to retain 100 percent of a mortgage’s risk and greater flexibility to lend by including my Portfolio Lending and Mortgage Access Act. Finally, this legislation places the steepest penalties in history on financial firms that actually break our laws. So it ends too big to fail, it includes tough penalties—the toughest penalties in history—for financial fraud and other misdeeds, but it preserves consumer protections through competition, choice, and access to the credit Americans need to build our economy. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairman HENSARLING for his leadership on this issue. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I have just got to stop some of this misrepresentation. Exempt from CFPB’s supervision and enforcement, Wall Street reform—that is DoddFrank—recognizes community banks and credit unions have a small number of employees and a better consumer protection track record; thus, they are carved out from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s supervision. b1315 The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s supervision and enforcement focuses on the largest banks that they won’t talk about here today and non banks that compete with small banks and credit unions. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr. MEEKS ), a senior member of the Financial Services Committee. Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Chair, how soon do we forget? The bill before us today is an affront to the American people. This bill is fatally flawed. It would set America up for more severe financial crises in the future. It is plain and simply the wrong choice. Let me give you one example. Under the ‘‘Wrong’’ CHOICE Act, many banks would be free from regulatory oversight if they merely maintain a 10 percent leverage ratio. Let’s break that down for the American people. If this bill was law in 2008, onethird of the banks that eventually failed would be free from regulatory oversight altogether. To be clear, 125 banks that failed during the crisis would meet the bill’s low requirement for regulatory relief, not according to me, but to an independent clearinghouse analysis. You don’t have to be a financier to realize that this proposal is dangerous and an insult to American families who lost nearly everything. I am talking about those families in rural and urban America who saw their household net worth drop $10 million, the largest loss of wealth in the history of the United States of America. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCARTHY ), a gentleman on leave from the Financial Services Committee and one we proudly call our own. Mr. MCCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Chair, I first want to thank Chairman HENSARLING and the entire Financial Services Committee for the work they have done on this bill. They have listened to Members and they have listened to constituents throughout this country. They studied the issue and they found the very best policy. We all know we need economic growth, but we also know that growth means little if wages will not rise, if jobs do not return, and if more businesses close than open. If a rising tide lifts all boats, we need to make sure every American is in the boat. Repealing DoddFrank with the Financial CHOICE Act lifts people back in so they can participate in America’s economy. It will reestablish the severed ties that link communities to the money they need to start businesses and hire employees. 
Bringing back the community banks that DoddFrank destroyed means that more people, not just the wealthy, will have access to credit. But if we want everyone to be part of the American economy, we don’t want people to face the same risks they did before. We want people to be treated fairly. In 2008, people lost everything. Aided by misguided Washington policies, some played fast and loose and put almost everyone else at risk. So it is only natural that people looked around and asked: Why do we have a system where, when things go wrong, banks need to get bailouts, but the American people get nothing? It is not a fair system. DoddFrank made it worse. It actually codified bailouts into law and made a taxpayer slush fund. On top of all that, we all know the regulations it created were just ridiculous. Why is it that the rich and powerful get to game the complicated rules produced by their friends in the bureaucracy while everyone else faces a mountain of paperwork and regulations that no human being has a chance of understanding? We all know that is not fair. All this ends up boxing out smallbusiness owners and normal Americans who can’t hire lawyers to sift through it all. The Financial CHOICE Act levels the playing field. It makes both Wall Street and Washington accountable so that their bad decisions don’t cost the taxpayers money. It makes things simple so that you don’t need an Ivy League law degree to understand the rules that govern our lives. America is a nation for the people. Everyone has a shot. Everyone should be treated the same. Everyone has a chance to succeed. The Financial CHOICE Act brings us a little closer to that America one more time. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. DAVID SCOTT), one of our senior members of the Financial Services Committee. Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I love this country. The heart and soul of our country is our financial system. This bill is a dangerous bill to our economy. Let me tell you why. First of all, it takes away all of our consumer protections. I want to give you an example. Before we had DoddFrank, a bank that is insured by the taxpayers could go in and use their customer’s money. They could take their customer’s money out to invest in risky bets, and then when the bets go south, it is the taxpayers that have to pick up the freight. Secondly, let us use this example. Because of the impact and the complexities of our financial system, so much of the cause and effect of the downturn were the big banks. What DoddFrank did was provide a test to be able to go in and simulate and confer with the bank to prevent it from going overboard. Wake up, America. I have talked with our Senators and they have assured me that this bill is dead on arrival in the Senate. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. PEARCE ), who is the chairman of the Terrorism and Illicit Finance Subcommittee. Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chair, credit is one of the most powerful devices of our financial system. It was designed over time by modern societies. In some countries, credit is simply not available to those who need it the most: people at the bottom of the ladder. In the United States, we have got a welldeveloped system where credit is available no matter how bad their credit rating might be. That is, it was available until the DoddFrank regulation created the CFPB. In the Second District of New Mexico, 50 percent of the homes are mobile homes or manufactured housing. Dodd Frank immediately began to show that they had no clue about how rural societies worked, and put into place regulations that choked off the access of most of our homeowners to manufactured housing. That wasn’t enough for the CFPB. They began then to set forward qualified mortgages, which then choked off traditional mortgages to many people in the Second District of New Mexico. Many people in New Mexico will buy their first mobile home and they will live in that. Then, over their life, they will buy 8 or 10 more. Then they sell those one at a time, usually to people who can’t get credit any other way. The CFPB simply shut that down. Now, seniors with less income, but people who need the loans the most, have one more source of credit dried up to them. The rules that affect the rural mortgages and small businesses were so punitive that the economy in New Mexico has never come back. It is not just that the Financial CHOICE Act is the right choice in the rural areas, in our areas; it is the only choice. I support H.R. 10, and I ask my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on the bill. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chair, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT), the ranking member of the Education and the Workforce Committee. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I rise in opposition to the ‘‘Wrong’’ CHOICE Act. In addition to what else is wrong with the bill, there are two significant problems with it impacting the jurisdiction of the Education and the Workforce Committee, where I serve as the ranking Democratic member. First, the bill essentially eliminates the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The Bureau has played a crucial role in making sure student loan borrowers are treated fairly and receive the protections that they deserve. It has shut down fraudulent student loan debt relief scams, resolved countless consumer complaints, and secured hundreds of millions of dollars in loan forgiveness for borrowers tricked into taking out costly private loans. The bill also repeals the Department of Labor’s fiduciary rule, which simply ensures that financial advisers put their retirement clients’ interests first. Workers getting ready to retire often seek assistance in making what would be the biggest financial decision in their life. Let’s be clear: many of these just set aside a few hundred dollars a month throughout their career, and now have hundreds of thousands of dollars to invest. They are counting on their financial adviser to do right by them and their families. This rule simply says that they have to do right for the families and the workers, not what may generate the highest fees. Mr. Chairman, this bill undermines key policy priorities impacting student loans and retirement savings. We should stand up for students and retirees and reject this bill. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. DUFFY ), the chairman of the Housing and Insurance Subcommittee. Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Chairman, this debate oftentimes can become confusing because banking law is confusing. We hear both sides take different positions on the Financial CHOICE Act and on DoddFrank, but I think the way you cut to the fat about whether DoddFrank was great law and does the Financial CHOICE Act actually make this law way better, I think we have to look at a couple simple factors. Big banks brought us to the crisis in 2008. The question for my friends across the aisle and people watching this debate is: Because of DoddFrank, have big banks gotten smaller or have big banks gotten bigger? The answer is: Big banks have gotten bigger. If you go to rural Wisconsin, small community banks and credit unions that help grow businesses and help provide to capital to our families are going out of business. Big Wall Street banks don’t set up shop in rural Wisconsin. So the little guy is getting hurt and the big guys are doing really well. You have got to ask yourself: Who supports the Financial CHOICE Act? You have the NFIB protecting small businesses, the Independent Community Bankers of America, the National Association of FederallyInsured Credit Unions, and the Credit Union National Association. Credit unions and small banks support this bill. Who doesn’t support this bill? Well, if you look to The Washington Post: HENSARLING , our chairman, faces opposition from bigbank CEOs that like DoddFrank. They hate the Financial CHOICE Act. Another quote from The Wall Street Journal: ‘‘Big banks have an unexpected message for Presidentelect Trump: Don’t trash the DoddFrank Act.’’ 
Big banks hate this bill, and little banks and little credit unions love it. If you want to know where people stand on this, go to your small community banker, go to your credit union, ask them about DoddFrank, and they will give you an earful. Then ask them: Do you like the Financial CHOICE Act? They will sit back and give you a small, slow clap. Let’s do what is right for the American people and the small banks and small credit unions. Let’s join together, pass H.R. 10, and give a win to the little guy. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, the gentleman asked: Who does not support this bill? Let me tell him: advocates, experts, civil rights groups, labor groups, veterans groups, pension plans, and company shareholders. We also received a petition urging a ‘‘no’’ vote from more than 220,000 concerned Americans. Let me just say that AARP hates this bill. That is who opposes this bill. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. SHERMAN), a senior member of the committee on Financial Services. b1330 Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Chairman, this bill contains 12 measures that have wide Democratic support. Unfortunately, they have been held hostage and added to a bill that contains a pharmacy of poison pills. The gentleman from New Mexico points out that we need to do something with manufactured housing. I support that bill. Liberate that bill. Don’t put it in a bill that is going to die in the Senate. The gentleman from Wisconsin talks about too big to fail. Please cosponsor the SandersSherman bill to break up the too big to fail rather than this bill that lets them stay too big and takes away the regulation. I look forward to working in a bipartisan way to support the Financial Accounting Foundation’s efforts to have independently funded standards for governmentissued debt. This bill takes that away. I look forward to working in a bipartisan way to have different and lesser standards for community financial institutions like credit unions and local banks. Instead, this highly partisan bill takes us down the wrong highway. It is a highway to a bill that will go nowhere in the Senate, and then we will resume our efforts to improve financial regulation in this country. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. HULTGREN ). Mr. HULTGREN. Mr. Chairman, I especially want to thank Chairman HENSARLING and the entire committee for all their hard work in getting us to this point to be able to pass H.R. 10, the Financial CHOICE Act, a very important bill to reform significant parts of DoddFrank that are failing. The Financial CHOICE Act is an important recognition of the many mistakes that policymakers made leading up to and responding to the financial crisis. There is no doubt that the American people demanded changes from Washington when the financial crash led to higher unemployment, huge drops in home values, and lost hope and opportunities; but instead of reforms that would increase competition and decrease systemic risk, the DoddFrank Act grew government and piled new regulations on community banks and credit units and enshrined too big to fail into law. Fortytwo community banks and 106 Illinois credit unions have closed their doors since DoddFrank was signed in 2007. This is unacceptable. I am grateful that regulatory relief legislation that I have championed is included in the Financial CHOICE Act, things like the Community Bank Reporting Relief Act and many other provisions that will provide great relief to our local financial institutions. That is what the Financial CHOICE Act is all about: giving opportunities back to local communities to make good financial decisions for their future. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, continuing to remind Mr. Duffy who opposes this bill, the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States of America opposes this bill. I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER ), the distinguished Democratic whip. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this legislation, which I know does not surprise the chairman. I have been here for some time. I was here in the 1990s. I was here in the 2000s. Frankly, we took the referee off the field in the 2000s, and we didn’t put the referee as toughly on the field in the late 1990s as we should have. Brooksley Born warned us about that, and we kept our eyes shut, and keeping our eyes shut cost millions and millions and millions of people their jobs, their homes, and their security. Let us not return to the time of taking the referee off the field. This bill does that. It is a dangerous piece of legislation. The bill which my Republican colleagues have put forward would put the American people at risk once again of having to bail out institutions if they lose money on risky investments. Let me say to my Republican friends: I share their view that community banks should not be treated as toobig tofail banks. However, having said that, this bill takes the referee off the field one more time. It would effectively eliminate the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that is now the American people’s watchdog. We have spent a lot of time this year in the last 5 months passing bills under the Congressional Review Act that have reduced consumer protections, civil rights protections, teacher protections, environmental protections. All we are doing is spending our time taking away protections for the American people and their futures. Have we learned nothing, Mr. Chairman? Those who fail to learn from history, it is often said, are doomed to repeat it. Let us not doom our citizens to repeat it. Let us not fail to learn the lessons of 2008. Let us not doom ourselves to repeating the mistakes of the past. The American people, average investors, and retirees, along with those who use our markets to save for college and purchase a home, deserve, and now have, commonsense protections. Nobody is seeking to punish or limit what financial firms do well, and that is create and raise capital, but we must ensure that there are referees on the field to protect investors and taxpayers and citizens and, yes, our families and our children. This bill does the opposite. I urge my colleagues to reject it. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 10 seconds just to say that perhaps the gentlewoman from California is unaware that the VFW has tweeted that it lauds Representative HENSARLING for a commitment to protect veterans, and then: 
We are so happy that the Financial CHOICE Act has been endorsed by over 100 groups, including the Concerned Veterans for America, because of what we do to protect their freedoms. 
At this point, I am very happy to yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. ROSS), a proud member of our committee. Mr. ROSS. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the Financial CHOICE Act, a bill that will provide the muchneeded relief from the harmful, complex, and excessive regulatory environment created by the Dodd Frank Act. In the 7 years since the passage of the DoddFrank Act, our Nation has suffered from anemic economic growth, increasingly limited financial choices for consumers, and an unprecedented level of jobkilling regulations. All the while, big banks have grown larger, and small banks and credit unions have suffered. In fact, community banks are closing at the rate of one per day. Many of my constituents in small and rural towns in the Tampa Bay area rely heavily on their community banks for financial services. When those banks are forced to close their doors or raise their fees due to excessive regulation, my constituents lose access to essential services and opportunities. Simply put, DoddFrank has failed. The Financial CHOICE Act represents an alternative and effective approach to financial regulation, which will protect taxpayers and bank bailouts, empower investors, and hold government bureaucracies accountable. This legislation makes it easier for hardworking Americans to save and invest for retirement, college, and their future. It will also increase access to and reduce the cost of credit for families that want to purchase a home or start a business. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting passage of this bill and helping Washington get off the backs of hardworking taxpayers. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. CAPUANO ), a senior member of the Financial Services Committee. Mr. CAPUANO. Mr. Chairman, you know, I was going to talk about leveraged buyouts, and I was going to talk about CDOs and CDO squared and Volcker rules and all those other things, but the truth is that is not what this is about. It is not about the details of the bill. It is about the concept. It is about Main Street versus Wall Street. Now, I am not opposed to Wall Street, but if you make me make a choice, I am with Main Street. And I know that the radicals are against this bill, the radicals like the VFW, and I will just read what they said. 
If enacted, the Financial CHOICE Act of 2017 would put those who have taken an oath to defend this country and our way of life in financial harm’s way. 
In light of this and on behalf of the nearly 1.7 million members of the VFW and its auxiliary, I call on you to oppose H.R. 10. The other radical group that opposes this bill is the AARP, representing 38 million Americans; and the Communications Workers of America, with 700,000 members; and the Brotherhood of Teamsters, representing, I think, 900,000; and, of course, the California Teachers Association, which represents 900,000 people, who also invest $202 billion in our country. All that being said, I am shocked that I am sitting here thinking that the DoddFrank Act is some kind of a failure. Bottom line is we put an end to the Wild West of Wall Street and we are on to a nice, steady playing field. We should be able to adjust it, but we should not throw it out. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, apparently the gentleman forgot that the big Wall Street banks also oppose this, according to the Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, and New York Times. And I am now very happy to yield 1 minute to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. PITTENGER ). Mr. PITTENGER. Mr. Chairman, I am here to support the Financial CHOICE Act, and for good reasons. Under DoddFrank, North Carolina has lost 50 percent of our banks since 2010, while three community banks have consolidated just in the last month. Monthly banking fees have increased 111 percent. As well, DoddFrank created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which even the liberal D.C. Court of Appeals calls unconstitutional and a threat to individual liberty. DoddFrank has made the Wall Street banks even bigger and more powerful; and DoddFrank has contributed to the slowest, weakest economic recovery in 70 years, impeding access to capital and credit in the market for small business. Maintaining the status quo is not acceptable. The Financial CHOICE Act will impose the toughest penalties in history for fraud on Wall Street. It will end taxpayer bailouts for Wall Street and allow your community banks and credit unions to focus on serving you and your local business, which will help create jobs and grow the economy. The Financial CHOICE Act means opportunity for all Americans and bailouts for none. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, continuing to answer Mr. DUFFY about who opposes this bill, the Fleet Reserve Association, which includes the Navy, the Marine Corps, and the Coast Guard. With that, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. LYNCH ), a senior member of the Financial Services Committee. Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Chairman, I have to say that this is the single worst piece of legislation that I have seen in my time here in Congress, and I have been here awhile. So I have to congratulate the gentleman from Texas for putting this amalgamation of terrible ideas together. This bill basically destroys the work that we did to try to secure the banks after the financial crisis of 2008. It harms consumers, it lets off bad actors, it hamstrings our financial regulators, and I believe it will lead to the next financial crisis. This bill will destroy the only consumer protection agency in the United States Government by handing over the ability to defund the operation to the people who were committed to opposing its very creation. It also repeals the Department of Labor’s fiduciary rule that simply requires that financial advisers put the interests of its clients first rather than its own. And finally, it is important to emphasize that the Financial CHOICE Act rolls back the accountability and reporting standards for credit rating agencies, as Gretchen Morgenson discussed in a New York Times ‘‘Fair Game’’ column on May 7. Mr. Chairman, to sum up, this is an awful bill. This is a real stinker. I hope that my colleagues here vote against it. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I am happy to yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. ROTHFUS ). Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Chairman, today is a good day. It is yet another day where we turn the page on the antigrowth policies of the last 8 years that have given us the slowest economic recovery in 70 years. I urge my colleagues to vote against the stagnant status quo with a vote for the Financial CHOICE Act. With all the debate we are hearing, understand this: The heart of this bill is about right regulation, accountability, and growth, restoring healthy, robust growth that will create jobs, lift wages, and, through the creation of new taxpayers, will increase revenues to the Federal Treasury that will help pay for critical programs like Social Security, Medicare, veterans benefits, and national defense. We have a moral obligation to restore healthy economic growth. The opponents of this bill, the status quo defenders, are seemingly okay with slow growth and fewer opportunities. Mr. Chairman, take a stand for stronger growth. Take a stand for young people who want more job opportunities. Take a stand for young families who want a new home. Take a stand for seniors and veterans who rely on programs funded through a growing, healthy economy. Take a stand for a better way. Take a stand for a brighter future. Vote for H.R. 10. Vote for the Financial CHOICE Act. b1345 Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. DELANEY ), a member of the Financial Services Committee. Mr. DELANEY. Mr. Chair, I want to thank the gentlewoman for yielding me time. Mr. Chairman, during the financial crisis, 19 of the 20 largest financial institutions in the United States either required a bailout or a significant investment by the taxpayers. Clearly, reform was needed, and DoddFrank was that reform. Since DoddFrank was put in place, consumer protections have improved materially, the banking system is safer and more sound, and our banks and our markets have far outpaced their international competitors. DoddFrank is working. Is it a perfect piece of legislation? Of course not. Anytime Congress does something large and transforms an entire industry, we should sign up as a body for 10 years of fixes, which is what we have not done, and we have let the American people down. Are we fixing DoddFrank today? No. We are pursuing a misguided and time consuming and wasteful repeal effort. I urge my colleagues to reject the CHOICE Act, and I urge my Republican colleagues to work with Democrats on bipartisan reforms to DoddFrank that build on its strength and solve and improve weaknesses in the legislation. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LANCE ). Mr. LANCE. Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of the Financial CHOICE Act. In response to the Great Recession, Congress passed the DoddFrank law. While well intentioned, various DoddFrank provisions and regulations are actually encouraging some of the behavior that led to the financial crisis. The law permits Wall Street to receive bailouts and has constricted credit lending for consumers and small 
businesses. It has drastically hurt community banks throughout this country, and they had absolutely nothing to do with the financial crisis. Two thousand community banks have closed nationwide since DoddFrank, including 42 in New Jersey. DoddFrank has institutionalized too big to fail for Wall Street, while telling community banks on Main Street that they are too small to succeed. Congress agrees on the need for strong regulation of our financial system. The Financial CHOICE Act will bring balanced reform to our Nation’s financial institutions. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. BEATTY ), a member of the Financial Services Committee. Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Chair, I thank Ranking Member WATERS for yielding me time. I stand here and I join my colleagues in opposition to the Financial CHOICE Act. It is the wrong act. And let me just say this to you: Certainly, it does not provide choice nor does it create hope and opportunity for investors and for consumers and for entrepreneurs. I am from the great State of Ohio, and you may have a sign that says people are for it; I have letters from ProgressOhio; I have letters from Policy Matters Ohio; I also have a letter here from the National Consumer Law Center, Advancing Fairness In The Marketplace For All. Let me just tell you what they are saying. They are saying that it is breathtaking—the assault on hardworking Americans, the assault on businesses that want to level the playing field to improve the economy. Mr. Chair, this is ridiculous that we stand here. If it was such a good choice, we would have had more meetings on it. If it was such a good choice for hardworking Americans, then we would have worked with Republicans and Democrats to make it a fair choice, to make it a right choice. But I stand here today and tell you it is the wrong choice for consumers. It is the wrong choice because it eviscerates the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. It is against the people, and it is not for hardworking Americans. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. MESSER ), a member of our committee and chairman of the Republican Policy Committee. Mr. MESSER. Mr. Chairman, despite the rhetoric and whatever its intentions, since DoddFrank’s passage, big bank profits are shattering records, and home ownership is down, way down, to the lowest level seen in over 20 years. Car loans and smallbusiness loans are much harder to get, too. Simply put, DoddFrank has been great for Federal regulators and even big banks but very bad for Hoosier consumers. The Financial CHOICE Act changes that. It ends too big to fail and enables Hoosier financial institutions to escape the onesizefitsall regulatory regime of DoddFrank. That will help hardworking Hoosiers get more affordable loans. The Financial CHOICE Act also includes my bill, the RIGHTS at the CFPB Act, which ensures that anyone pursued by this Federal agency will have their rights protected and get their day in court. I urge support of the Financial CHOICE Act. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chair, we have already debunked what we have been told by the opposition about the oversight, CFPB’s supervision and enforcement. Of course, we have told you about that. Let’s take a moment to tell you that community banks have showed strength in residential, commercial, industrial loans, and smallbusiness lending. In fact, overall loan growth at community banks has been faster than at bigger banks. In the fourth quarter of 2016, lending was up 8.3 percent for community banks and 4.8 percent for larger banks. Mr. Chair, with that, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. FOSTER ), a member of the Financial Services Committee. Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Chair, I thank Ranking Member WATERS for yielding me time and for her leadership on this. Nine years ago, I was there, in 2008, when our financial system collapsed, as a new Member of Congress, the sole scientist on the Financial Services Committee. And as we surveyed the wreckage of our economy, I wondered how we ever could have gotten into a place like that with our financial system clogged with toxic assets based on trillions of dollars of mortgages that never had any realistic chance of being repaid by their homeowners. We saw giant banks and trading firms leveraged beyond belief, huge financial corporations so complex that they had thousands of business units that even their CEOs were unaware of, and risk management software that was being ignored, if it existed at all. How could we have gotten there? But when I look at the CHOICE Act that Republicans are about to ram through on a partyline vote, I understand perfectly how we got there. I see all the same forces of mindless deregulation and free market ideology, an overriding mania for tax cuts for the rich, while stripping financial protection for ordinary American families; the same refusal to learn the lessons of financial history and to replace them with alternative facts that fit their ideology. Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to stand up for working families and protect our economy by opposing this bill today. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. TIPTON ). Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Chair, I also want to thank Chairman HENSARLING for offering the legislation under consideration today. The Financial CHOICE Act takes the necessary steps in reforming the supervision of our financial system that the DoddFrank Act failed to do. Among other provisions, this legislation requires financial regulatory agencies to tailor regulatory actions to fit the risk profile and business model of supervised institutions. Not only will this ensure appropriately tailored compliance obligations for banks and credit unions of various risk profiles, but it saves valuable time and resources for bank examiners. As it stands now, community banks are facing an everincreasing regulatory burden that they can no longer shoulder. This has had a devastating impact on small banks, forcing consolidation or failure and stifling the creation of new banks in areas that need access to credit. In December 2015, a report by the Dallas Fed highlighted this problem, noting that the regulatory environment tends to be onesizefitsall and concluding that the regulatory oversight should match the risk level an institution poses to the financial system and the economy at large. The CHOICE Act will stop the trend of increasing compliance costs and decreasing financial services. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. HENSARLING ) for his tireless efforts on this legislation and urge my colleagues to support it. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much time I have remaining? The ACTING CHAIR (Mr. RODNEY  DAVIS of Illinois). The gentlewoman from California has 21 minutes remaining, and the gentleman from Texas has 15 minutes remaining. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, since it has been asked about who opposes this bill, I wanted to make sure that we include in our information to them the religious organizations. The Congregation of St. Joseph, the Seventh Generation Interfaith Coalition for Responsible Investment, the Dominican Sisters of Houston, the Sisters of Mercy, the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, the Christian Brothers Investment Services, the National Association of Evangelicals, the American Baptist Home Mission Society, and the Mercy Investment Services all urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on this terrible bill. Mr. Chairman, with that, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. HECK), a senior member now—he has been there for a while—of the Financial Services Committee. Mr. HECK. Mr. Chair, I am voting ‘‘no’’ on the ‘‘Wrong’’ CHOICE Act. All of us are. Just like healthcare, this legislation takes the approach that the best way to proceed is with the most extreme bill possible, a bill that attracts no Democrats and even makes moderate Republicans deeply uncomfortable. One reason, the DoddFrank Act set up an office at CFPB to protect servicemembers. That office, initially led by Holly Petraeus, has done great work 
in educating and fighting for servicemember families. I have worked with Republicans for years to support and enhance it. This bill makes that office optional. And it specifically strips the funding for its financial counseling project. That is appalling. It hurts my constituents, and, again, it makes my Republican friends deeply uncomfortable. It is one of scores of provisions that make clear this isn’t a bill designed to help Americans. It is an ideological document. It hurts men and women in uniform. And oh, by the way, millions of others. It is a terrible approach. Please vote ‘‘no’’ on the ‘‘Wrong’’ CHOICE Act. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. WILLIAMS ), my friend and neighbor. Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman HENSARLING for his leadership on this issue. Mr. Chair, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has cost American small businesses, American entrepreneurs, and the American taxpayers millions of dollars in regulatory costs since the inception. I actually own a business. I am a smallbusiness owner, and I can tell you it is horrible legislation. And although this rouge and unaccountable agency hides behind the false pretense that its actions protect consumers, there could be nothing further from the truth. Take, for example, the ability to exempt small community financial institutions from any rule they impose. In fact, DoddFrank gives them explicit authority to do so. Yet because they lack congressional oversight, because they have a director who cannot be removed at will, they simply do absolutely nothing. Mr. Chair, if my colleagues are looking for a reason to vote for this bill, they should look no further than the reforms that helped rein in the CFPB. Specifically, I am happy to see the committeeincorporated provision I introduced last Congress which would apply the REINS Act to all financial agencies, including the CFPB. Over the last 12 years, $55 billion in regulatory costs have been levied by our financial agencies, and this must end, and it must end now. Again, the Financial CHOICE Act is a win for American taxpayers. It is purely a win for Americans who are sick and tired of the heavy hand of Washington. Mr. Chair, I urge all my colleagues to support this bill. In God we trust. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, the Members on the opposite side of the aisle have come here talking about what they are doing for small banks and how they are against the big banks. Let me tell you about a letter that was sent yesterday, June 7, from the American Bankers Association. They said: ‘‘We are pleased that this legislation contains provisions that ABA and our member banks have long supported.’’ Who are their members? JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Bank of America. Wall Street loves this bad bill. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. ELLISON ), a senior progressive champion of the Financial Services Committee. b1400 Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member for yielding. Since DoddFrank’s passage, the economy has created over 16 million jobs over 85 consecutive months. Business lending has increased 75 percent. Banks, large and small, are posting all time record profits, community banks are outperforming larger banks, and credit unions are expanding their membership. And because of the work of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 29 million people have seen $12 billion back into their pocket and not into those of improper and illegal practicing financial services firms. Do you want to know why we have the ‘‘Wrong’’ CHOICE Act before us today? Because they want the money. Not the $12 billion that went back to the 29 million veterans and farmers and students and citizens and people who need that kind of help for their families. They want that money going back to the big financial interests. And that is the purpose of the ‘‘Wrong’’ CHOICE Act. It is between the many and the money, and the ‘‘Wrong’’ CHOICE Act stands firmly on the side of those who would line their pockets in the top 1 percent. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Maine (Mr. POLIQUIN ), a real workhorse of the Financial Services Committee. Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for yielding. Mr. Chairman, I represent the most honest, hardworking families in this country, in the great State of Maine. I also represent tens of thousands of smallbusiness owners in our State that create thousands of jobs for our families. In the State of Maine, Mr. Chairman, we know the difference between right and wrong, and it is wrong to force taxpayers to bail out huge Wall Street banks that take too much risk when it goes wrong. Now, the small community banks and credit unions that dot our landscape in Maine did not cause the most recent recession. These reforms that we are passing today in the Financial CHOICE Act reduce unnecessary paperwork and costs that will help our small community banks and credit unions lend money to small businesses and our families so they can live better lives with more freedom and have better job opportunities. Also, I am proud to say that the Financial CHOICE Act keeps in place very strong protections, Mr. Chairman, for consumers of financial services while at the same time imposing the toughest penalties ever for fraud and inside dealings for folks that participate in this industry. It is no wonder, Mr. Chairman, that huge money center banks and Wall Street are not for the Financial CHOICE Act. But I am, and I encourage everybody to vote for this Financial CHOICE Act. It is a great bill for rural America. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GONZALEZ ), a new member of the Financial Services Committee. Mr. GONZALEZ of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I thank Ranking Member WATERS  for yielding. Mr. Chairman, today I rise in opposition to H.R. 10. While this bill may contain some language that I would agree with and that is helpful to our community banks, as well as some of our credit unions, it would be very harmful to our seniors and the elderly. Additionally, the Financial CHOICE Act, as written, would be dead on arrival in the U.S. Senate and a monumental waste of time for this Chamber. As a public servant, we are called to serve the citizens of our great Nation, those who raised us; those who consistently told us, ‘‘it is more important to have the will than to have mere ability,’’ ‘‘hace mas el que quiere que el que puede;’’ those who forged a new path and a better way of life. One of the best measures of a nation is how it cares for its elderly. As a country, we made a promise to our elderly, to protect them and ensure that they would have reliable access to resources, and the support they need to live a dignified life in their later years. In my book, a promise made should be a promise kept. Today, my colleagues in support of the ‘‘Wrong’’ CHOICE Act seek to renege on this promise and leave millions of elderly Americans vulnerable to financial exploitation schemes. One in every five Americans have been victims of financial abuse, accounting for a cost of over $36 billion annually. We cannot abandon our elderly when their resources and, ultimately, their independence is threatened. We must stand with them and enable the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to continue to protect our elderly. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Utah (Mrs. LOVE), an incredibly talented member of the Financial Services Committee. Mrs. LOVE. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support for the Financial CHOICE Act, and I urge a vote for it. America’s workers, farmers, businesses, households, savers, and investors all deserve the flexibility and access to credit that the Financial CHOICE Act puts in place for our financial system. 
As a former mayor, I know that families, cities, and counties need access to credit. Whether it is a city that wants to build a library or a community park, or a family that wants to buy a house, or the farmer that needs a new tractor to plow her field, we need a financial system that is strong, innovative, but, most of all, accessible. Right now, under DoddFrank, that isn’t the case. For example, one of my constituents in Utah owns a catering business that is very successful, but the growth of her company has been stunted because she ran into red tape and delays after applying for a small business loan. That is not how things should work. Community banks, which provide the majority of small bank loans, are closing at the rate of one per day. Middle to lowincome Americans are getting higher fees, less consumer service, and less access to credit than ever before. Everyone deserves a chance to realize their version of the American Dream, and the Financial CHOICE Act is a bold step toward achieving that dream. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. CRIST), a new member of the Financial Services Committee. Mr. CRIST. Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member for her strong leadership in this fight against the ‘‘Wrong’’ CHOICE Act. The bill before us is broken. I was Governor of Florida when the financial crisis and foreclosure crisis rolled through my State like a hurricane. Unrestrained greed on Wall Street caused a preventable disaster because at no point did anyone say: This is simply wrong. I remember 2008 and 2009: the bailouts, the foreclosures, and the long, painful road to recovery. The financial crisis exposed a broken regulatory system, allowing Wall Street to gamble with Main Street’s future. With this bill, Members are being asked to again trust the very people who brought us to this financial crisis. Don’t put them back in charge. Do not let them do it again. Please vote ‘‘no.’’ Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. HILL), the Financial Services Committee whip. Mr. HILL. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for his leadership in guiding the Financial CHOICE Act through the Financial Services Committee and the House. Mr. Chairman, I include in the RECORD a letter from the Arkansas State Bank Department, and an article by the Arkansas Bankers Association entitled ‘‘Disappearing Community Banks.’’ ARKANSAS STATE  BANKDEPARTMENT , May 1, 2017. Hon. JEBHENSARLING , Chairman, House Committee on Financial Services, Washington, DC. Hon. MAXINE WATERS , Ranking Member, House Committee on Financial Services, Washington, DC. DEARCHAIRMAN HENSARLING AND RANKING  MEMBER WATERS : I am writing in support of H.R. 10, the ‘‘Financial CHOICE Act of 2017.’’ As a state bank regulator, I have seen the huge burden DoddFrank Act of 2010 has placed on community banks. Since the financial crisis, several community banks in Arkansas have curtailed or discontinued lending activities—particularly, residential mortgages—which has been detrimental to the consumers they serve. In addition, the number of small community banks in our state and across the country has decreased, primarily through mergers with larger banks better equipped to handle DoddFrank’s onerous compliance regimen. I believe the Financial CHOICE Act will address a number of issues which will improve the business climate for community banks. In particular, providing broad regulatory relief to banks with an average leverage capital ratio of at least 10 percent will enhance our community banks ability to serve the public. With fewer financial and employee resources allocated to compliance issues, community banks will be able to increase lending to businesses and individuals, which will stimulate muchneeded economic growth in their communities. Additionally, I strongly believe the leverage capital ratio is a better standard by which to assess a bank’s health than riskbased measures. Thank you for your work in advancing the Financial CHOICE Act. I greatly appreciate your efforts to help community banks. Sincerely, CANDACE A. F RANKS , Commissioner. 
[From the Arkansas Banker Association] DISAPPEARING COMMUNITY BANKS  (By Bill Holmes, President & CEO, Arkansas Bankers Association) In 1994 I was working for the original Twin City Bank. We were in a bank wide campaign to break a billion dollars in assets. There were 260 banks headquartered in Arkansas. Today, there are 103. If we continue to lose community banks at the same pace our small businesses, home buyers and farmers will have only a third of the bank choices they enjoyed in 1994. This is a problem for our mostly rural state. And it is not just a local problem, it is happening across the country. There are any number of reasons for this decline in community banks. For the last ten years, the reason I hear more than any other is the increasing cost of the federal regulatory burden. The costs of complying with regulations that should never have been intended for rural banks, the costs of training more and more staff for compliance issues, the cost of newly required software to feed a never ending appetite for data. I will grant you that after the financial crisis some regulatory changes were necessary to improve financial stability. But ten years later we’ve ended up with too many regs that don’t improve our banks, but do limit our bankers’ discretion and look to drive credit decisions to a score sheet designed inside the beltway. Our community bankers have decades of history on their customers, and have always been a key to the economic growth in their communities. I don’t think the intent of these regulations was to limit the growth, or limit the home buyers, in our state. But the fact is it does. And, it is time to fix this. Chairman Hensarling’s The Financial CHOICE Act was recently sent to the floor for a vote. It includes multiple changes that our banking industry endorses, and we feel we need these changes to help spur the economy. This legislation would ease some requirements on mortgages that banks hold in their own portfolios. This would let our bankers make many more loans to selfemployed businessmen, or entrepreneurs with unstable incomes. The Act looks to tailor the regs and requirements based on the risks and business types of each bank. We need this to continue to give our customers more diversity and more choices of where and how to bank. The U.S. economy is unique. We need a healthy and broad mix of banks to meet our customers’ needs. From international corporations, to the startup food truck, our bankers are involved and are integral parts of our economy. If we cannot get sensible reform in Washington, Arkansas’s banking sector will continue to shrink and become less diverse. Arkansans, and all Americans, will pay the price in terms of less lending and fewer opportunities for growth. Mr. HILL. Mr. Chairman, in this debate today, let’s hear what a commissioner of banking from Arkansas says: ‘‘I am writing in support of H.R. 10, the ‘Financial CHOICE Act of 2017.’ As a State bank regulator, I have seen the huge burden DoddFrank Act of 2010 has placed on community banks. Since the financial crisis, several community banks in Arkansas have curtailed or discontinued lending activities—particularly, residential mortgages— which has been detrimental to the consumers they serve.’’ That is a compelling endorsement of this bill from a regulator, Mr. Chairman, not from a Member of Congress. And when you look at working families in Arkansas, recently I was told about an Army National Guard member from north Little Rock, in my district, who was informed that he would not receive a home to purchase a manufactured home that would have been twice as large and less expensive than the 60yearold house he was renting for his family. Or a hairstylist from Nevada County, who I received a letter from. She and her husband, a welder, were denied a loan to purchase a new home, despite having verifiable income. That is why we need to repeal, replace, and pass the Financial CHOICE Act. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. KIHUEN ), a new member of the Financial Services Committee. Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member for yielding me time and for her tireless work on behalf of working families in America. Mr. Chairman, the Financial CHOICE Act is nothing more than a misguided attempt to return to the days where bad actors could put the entire financial system at risk. There is bipartisan support to provide regulatory relief for community banks and credit unions. Just last 
week, I met with credit unions in my district, and they talked about the need for thoughtful, tailored regulation. Unfortunately, that kind of thoughtful reform is not what is before us today. Instead, we have a bill before us that is a fundamental attack on working families in America. This bill will make it harder to go after bad actors in the financial markets by hamstringing regulators, and would completely gut the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. It would eliminate important programs that ensure that taxpayers will not be on the hook for future bailouts. And it makes our financial system a whole lot less secure. The district that I represent was one of the hardest hit in the entire country during the financial crisis. My constituents sent me here to ensure that we don’t repeat the mistakes of the past, which is exactly what this bill does. Mr. Chairman, this bill has been named the Financial CHOICE Act, and I think it is a fitting name. Each of us here today has a simple choice to make: Do we side with the working families of America? Or do we side with the big corporations and the special interests? Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. EMMER ), another hardworking member of the Financial Services Committee. Mr. EMMER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for yielding. Nearly 7 years ago, the American people were promised that the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act would end Washington bailouts, protect consumers, and lead to a more prosperous economy. Instead, the big banks and the influence of the Federal Government have continued to get bigger while smaller, local community banks and credit unions are closing up shop and our country continues to struggle with anemic levels of economic growth. This is why the Financial CHOICE Act is so important. This legislation gives us an opportunity to return the power to the ‘‘little guy or gal’’ who wants to create a better life for themselves and, by doing so, for all of us. It takes steps to end the failure of excessive and redundant bureaucracy, and it will give our entrepreneurs the opportunity to access the startup capital they need to grow and thrive once again. I am especially pleased that this bill includes provisions from my Micro Offering Safe Harbor Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Adjustment Act, and the Financial Stability Oversight Council Reform Act. These three bills are important components of the Financial Services Committee’s broader intent of improving opportunity and accountability for all. I appreciate the chairman’s continued efforts to make this goal a reality. Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman HENSARLING for all of his work. I look forward to supporting the Financial CHOICE Act, and I hope all of us will do the same. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. DEMINGS ). Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Chairman, do we have a role as Congress to protect American families? In my home State of Florida, it is hard to go anywhere without meeting a family who was affected by the foreclosure crisis. Many not only lost their homes, but their life savings. Through DoddFrank, Congress created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to go after the bad actors that made tough times worse for homeowners in Florida by giving the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau the authority to go after mortgage companies for deceptive practices, threatening people who were behind on payments and putting them into debt collection when they were eligible for loan modification programs. DoddFrank also allowed state attorneys general to file consumer protection lawsuits against bad actors on behalf of families in their States. The Financial CHOICE Act would repeal these important consumer protections and return us to a time when families were being unfairly forced into foreclosure. Mr. Chairman, we can’t go back. This is America, where we take care of our own, don’t we? If Congress doesn’t protect American families, who will? I urge my colleagues to do the right thing and to reject this bill. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. TROTT ), a new and very knowledgeable member of the Financial Services Committee. Mr. TROTT. Mr. Chairman, one of the consequences of the financial crisis is the government had to step in with taxpayer dollars and bail out the financial industry. Once DoddFrank was enacted, however, we were told: Don’t worry. There will never be another bailout. Rest assured, the orderly liquidation authority under title II will give the FDIC all the tools it needs to resolve a failed financial institution. Indeed, title II does give the FDIC the ability to borrow from the Treasury all of the taxpayer dollars it needs to reorganize a failed financial institution. That kind of sounds like a bailout to me. The Financial CHOICE Act truly ends the risk of taxpayerfunded bailout. Under the Financial CHOICE Act, a failed bank will go through bankruptcy. Bankruptcy is a tested, transparent process. Judges sitting in open court instead of unelected bureaucrats sitting behind closed doors will make consistent, predictable decisions based on decades of case law. More importantly, bankruptcy puts the risk of failure on the bank’s shareholders and creditors, not the taxpayers. I urge my colleagues to support the Financial CHOICE Act, and truly put an end to the possibility of yet another taxpayerfunded bailout. b1415 Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. CARTWRIGHT ). Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Chairman, my colleagues have already done a good job of talking in great detail about why this bill is really a festival of bad choices, of wrong choices for America, but I want to focus on one issue in particular: executive pay. This ‘‘Wrong’’ CHOICE Act actually takes away provisions that rein in irresponsible pay to executives, the very people who decide decisions that get us into this entire mess in the first place. Number one, this bill eliminates a rule barring incentivebased executive pay that encourages ‘‘inappropriate risks.’’ It puts the average American in danger of having to pay for another bank bailout. Giving out bonuses for putting our national financial stability at risk is flat wrong. Number two, it eliminates a requirement for corporations to disclose how their CEO’s pay compares to the average employee’s salary. This bill eliminates transparency. And number three, if you can believe it, this bill even abolishes a rule requiring companies to disclose whether executives and board directors are allowed to bet against their own stock. This bill takes us back to the days of Enron. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this irresponsible legislation. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I am happy to yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. LOUDERMILK ), a new member of our committee. Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Chairman, today we know that a major factor leading up to the worst economic crisis in our lifetime was the heavyhanded and meddlesome politics of the Federal Government. Unfortunately, the previous administration responded to that crisis not by limiting the intrusion of the Federal bureaucracy, but by increasing it. They implemented DoddFrank under the guise of protecting the consumer, but, in reality, this bill empowered government, created new bureaucracies, made the big banks bigger, and virtually ended the creation of new community banks. In the wake of the financial crisis, Georgia lost more banks than any other State in the Nation. Unemployment skyrocketed, and hundreds of businesses went under. But instead of creating opportunities for Georgians to pick themselves up and start again, DoddFrank continued to suppress our economic recovery, and today, nearly a decade after the end of the recession, 
there are still 47 counties in Georgia without a local community bank, and 3 counties without a single bank branch at all. The Financial CHOICE Act will reverse these burdensome regulations and, once again, sow the seeds of prosperity on Main Street, not just Wall Street. The bill will end bailouts of big banks by taxpayers and unleash our economic potential by opening the economy to everyone. I urge my colleagues to support the Financial CHOICE Act. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DOGGETT ). Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Chairman, this bill is all about obstructing effective law enforcement that challenges predatory payday lending, that protects military families from unjustified foreclosures, and addresses the burden of mounting student debt. Republicans give Trump new power to fire the chief cop on the beat who protects consumers against wrongful financial practices. We have seen how well that worked with Trump and the FBI. Have you learned nothing about giving Trump more power? Without the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Wells Fargo would never have been penalized for its multimilliondollar fraud. Republicans here want to shield Wall Street, granting it free rein to run over people across America and later reward it with even more tax breaks. They tolerate almost any wrongdoing, any crazy Trump tweet, so long as they can get more tax breaks and less consumer protection. Enough is enough. It is time to say no to this sorry bill and offer protection to the people of America from financial wrongdoing. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time is remaining on either side? The Acting CHAIR (Mr. SIMPSON ). The gentleman from Texas has 8 minutes remaining. The gentlewoman from California has 12 minutes remaining. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, to better balance the time, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY ). Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Senior citizens, beware of the Financial CHOICE Act. This bill repeals the best interest rule, which ensures that Americans that are saving for retirement get financial advice in their best interest. Bad advice has real costs. Steven, a 69yearold Vietnam veteran in Illinois, lost $147,000 in retirement savings when he got advice that handsomely profited his socalled investment adviser but devastated him. This bill guts the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which prevents financial exploitation of senior citizens. In December, the CFPB took an action against three crooked reverse mortgage companies that deliberately failed to tell seniors that they could lose their homes. The Financial CHOICE Act is dangerous. It is dangerous for older Americans, it is dangerous for all Americans, and it is dangerous for our entire economy. It puts us all at risk. It is the wrong choice for America, and I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’ Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. BONAMICI ). Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member for yielding. I rise today in strong opposition to the Financial CHOICE Act because it will gut the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and roll back important protections for seniors, for students, and for hardworking families across the country. The CFPB protects Americans from unscrupulous financial practices and deceitful debt collectors. Since its creation, it has assisted more than 29 million consumers, many of them seniors, with mortgages, credit cards, and debt collection. Unfortunately, seniors are especially vulnerable to financial fraud and abuse. This bill would roll back the CFPB’s ability to identify and stop unfair and abusive debt collection and telemarketing practices; and this harmful bill would also prevent the CFPB from cracking down on predatory payday lenders who take advantage of struggling families by issuing loans at exorbitant rates. I worked as a consumer protection attorney, and I worked with too many families there who lost their homes, too many seniors who were harassed by debt collectors, too many people who were victims of predatory payday lending and got into the quicksand and were not able to get out. We cannot allow this shortsighted bill to stop the good work of the CFPB. This bill is called the CHOICE Act, but it is the wrong choice, and I urge my colleagues to oppose it. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. BARRAGA ´N). Ms. BARRAGA´N. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in opposition to the ‘‘Wrong’’ CHOICE Act. This bill has a hidden provision that strips away oversight for payday lenders. Payday lenders are like loan sharks, charging upwards of 400 percent interest on loans. It is outrageous. They prey on vulnerable, lowincome borrowers who are already struggling to get by. That is how Yesenia from California got trapped in a cycle of debt. Her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer and lost her job, so Yesenia had to take out a loan just to buy food. The payday lender garnished her wages and charged skyhigh interest rates and fees. She ended up paying back thousands more than she borrowed, all because she needed food for her and her mother. Let’s protect our workers and families. Let’s not take away oversight of this abusive loan industry. I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 10. It is the wrong choice. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, at this time I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr. ZELDIN ), a new member of our committee. Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the CHOICE Act, and I thank Chairman HENSARLING for his strong leadership. Imposing regulations meant for large, transnational firms on community banks and credit unions may make sense to bureaucrats in Washington, but to hardworking families on Long Island, it means you can’t buy that first home or you can’t get that smallbusiness loan. Today we have the opportunity to remove the barriers to job creation and prosperity that have given us the weakest economic recovery in American history. The CHOICE Act will end taxpayerfunded bailouts, restore accountability, and jumpstart innovation and job creation. I strongly support this legislation, and I urge its adoption. Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. SARBANES ). Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Chairman, in 2008 our financial system cratered, bringing the broader world economy to its knees. Millions of Americans lost their homes; millions more lost their jobs by no fault of their own; and $13 trillion in wealth and savings was lost. We went to work fixing the glaring holes in our Nation’s financial regulatory system. Among other things, we enacted tougher mortgage standards; we brought the derivatives market out of the shadows; we stopped the casino like bets at our investment banks; and we created a consumerfocused protection bureau. Unfortunately, what we couldn’t do was eradicate greed; and, sadly, today greed is rearing its ugly head once again. The Republicancontrolled Congress is about to pass H.R. 10, the ‘‘Wrong’’ CHOICE Act, a bill that would throw away the lessons of the 2008 financial crash and unleash the demons that nearly took down the world economy. I urge the House to reject this bill. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I am happy to yield 1 minute to the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. MOONEY), another new member of our committee. Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 10, the Financial CHOICE Act. This critical piece of legislation rolls back onerous Obamaera regulations on the financial services industry 
10, the Financial CHOICE Act. For 7 years now, DoddFrank has stalled our economic growth. While community banks and credit unions did not cause the recession, they have carried most of the burden following the crisis. These smaller financial institutions are the lifeline of local businesses, farmers, entrepreneurs, and anyone striving for true financial independence. The Financial CHOICE Act will bring relief from onerous rules and regulations that have hamstrung the ability to loan and to borrow money. Once businesses can access more capital, they will be able to grow, hire more employees, contribute more to their communities. I want to thank Chairman HENSARLING and this committee for working tirelessly to bring the American people the relief that they need. Mr. Chair, I urge all of my colleagues to support this important legislation. Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. LEE). Ms. LEE. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman for yielding and for his most diligent work on behalf of the American people, and also to our ranking member, Congresswoman MAXINEWATERS . I just want to thank her for really educating this House and the public of the dangers to consumers of this horrible bill, of course, which I stand in opposition to. It really is a wrong choice for American families. Shamefully, this bill gives Wall Street a handout while stealing from the pockets of everyday Americans. It would drag us back to the days where Wall Street and billionaires get richer, while struggling families are left out in the cold. The bill significantly undermines both the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the rules it put in place to prevent predatory lending and subprime loans, particularly in communities of color. Families lost a generation of wealth prior to DoddFrank and have yet been able to recover. But this bill also, I must say, puts Wall Street recklessness back in charge, and it will leave consumers out in the cold again. So it will take us back to where we were before, and we cannot go back. That is why we are asking for a ‘‘no’’ vote. It destroys protections for seniors and jeopardizes their financial safety. So I hope that Members vote ‘‘no’’ on this bill. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. TENNEY ), another new member of the committee. Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman HENSARLING for this important bill. I rise today in support of H.R. 10, the Financial CHOICE Act. As a single parent and smallbusiness owner, I know from my own experience that the only way for hardworking Americans to achieve financial independence is by building an economy from Main Street up, not Wall Street down. The CHOICE Act not only imposes the toughest penalties in history for financial fraud on Wall Street, it saves taxpayers $30 billion. The CHOICE Act also eliminates taxpayerfunded bailouts while providing choices for consumers and a real opportunity for economic growth. As an upstate New Yorker, our region suffers from economic challenges caused by excessive regulations, such as the DoddFrank Act, that have crushed small businesses. Yet small businesses create nearly 70 percent of the new jobs. This bill will increase access to capital for small businesses and startups—our job creators. It will increase job opportunities and positively benefit New York’s 22nd District. Mr. Chair, I urge all of my colleagues to vote to support our job creators and to vote for the Financial CHOICE Act. Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chair, does it make sense that, after 8 years of a piece of regulation, DoddFrank, that has brought us increases in GDP, increases in jobs, and stability in financial markets, that we would now repeal that piece of legislation to go back to a time when we saw that deregulation strategy bring us the Great Recession? It just doesn’t make any sense to take the position that what we need is more wide open, Wild West, you are on your own kind of financial rules and laws in our country. The fact is, before DoddFrank was passed, we had an abysmal consumer protection system. We really had seven or eight different agencies that were sort of responsible, but not really. Consumer protection was not a priority of the Federal Government. And as a result of it, we saw a proliferation of mortgages that got people who really couldn’t handle that particular mortgage that they got, or the products were just fraudulent, get into a situation where they ended up going into foreclosure. We saw the secondary market package up some of these bad mortgages. We saw rating agencies say that these were good equity products, and when these products started to fail, what we saw is that those big banks that trafficked in those equities get bailed out, and we saw citizens lose their homes. The fact is, going back to those bad old days is just a bad idea—to bring us back to a time when we didn’t have any consumer protection, when we didn’t have any responsibility placed on the shoulders of management, when we didn’t say that we were going to look after these rating agencies, and we didn’t say that these systemically important large institutions were going to get a little bit more scrutiny. Before the time that we did that, we saw ruin in the economy. Let me just remind the American people: we had many States with unemployment above 10 percent because of the deregulation, laissezfaire attitude that prevailed in the American financial services legal system. Those bad old days nearly ruined so many families, and they are just now starting to recover. But under Dodd Frank, we have seen month after month of private sector job growth. We have seen economic activity increase. Fast enough for me? No. I think we need much more. But with over $170 billion in record profits from 2016, I can tell you one thing: this claim on the other side that the banks and financial services sector is being crushed simply isn’t a true statement. It is just not right. Business lending is up 75 percent since DoddFrank. Data from the Federal Reserve shows aggregate bank lending has increased from about $1.2 trillion, in 2010, to $2 trillion in outstanding business loans. Vote ‘‘no’’ on the ‘‘Wrong’’ CHOICE Act. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. We have now had 7 years of history with DoddFrank, and what do we know? We know that the big banks are bigger. We know that the small banks are fewer. The gentleman cites some statistics about lending, but what he left out is, we are losing a community bank or credit union a day, and they are not dying of natural causes. They are dying of the dreaded DoddFrank disease. Our small businesses continue to suffer. It takes small banks to lend to small businesses. The job engine of America and small bank business lending isn’t recovering, and it can’t recover, as long as DoddFrank is on the rolls of the Federal Register. I got to tell you, Mr. Chairman, it is time. It is time for a better way. It is time to help our struggling families. That is really what this is all about. We have had 7 years of DoddFrank, and yet working Americans haven’t received a pay increase. Their small businesses can’t get loans. Struggling families have not seen their savings recover from the great financial panic which, oh, by the way, was brought about by government in the first place, with dumb regulation to put people into homes they couldn’t afford to keep. And let’s also remember that Dodd Frank is actually hurting the consumers it claims to help. Free checking was cut in half. Credit cards, there are fewer of them. They cost 200 to 300 basis points more. Have you tried to get a mortgage lately? They are harder to come by. They cost hundreds of more dollars to close. Instead, what we have is, Washington elites now making the decision on whether or not we get to put a credit card in our wallet, whether we get to put a mortgage on our home. No, Mr. Chairman, there is a better way. It is why we must enact the Financial CHOICE Act. There will be economic growth for all, bank bailouts for none, and we will, once again, have an America that is only limited by the size of its dreams. 
Mr. Chair, I encourage all to support the Financial CHOICE Act. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chair, prior to 2010, banks lending to consumers operated with too little oversight and often exploited the lack of rules to turn a profit at any cost. We saw the dire consequences in the 2008 financial crisis. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was created to enforce laws and protect consumers in the marketplace. Their mission is to root out deceptive and abusive practices. And so far, the agency has returned $11.8 billion to consumers from enforcement against abusive practices from banks, lenders, and financial companies. I challenge any member of this body to go to one of their constituents and ask whether or not they would like a consumer watchdog to stand up for them against abuses from big banks, or if they’d like us to leave them to go it alone. The CFPB has already returned $11.8 billion to more than 29 million consumers. That is $11.8 billion dollars that went back into the pockets of 29 million of our constituents. A vote for this legislation is a vote against those 29 million consumers who have been helped by the CFPB’s actions. In my home state of New Jersey, one resident held a mortgage with Citibank, who failed to report accurately the status of a closed account and incorrectly reported it as late. A complaint was submitted to the CFPB and when they intervened, the issue was resolved and the late mark removed. Stories like these are not uncommon. Decisions like these can impact a consumer’s credit for life and cause tremendous distress. Before the CFPB, consumers facing deceptive practices could go ignored by megabanks and lending institutions. But when a government agency with enforcement powers gets involved, these banks pay attention. They can’t ignore the CFPB. When the cards are stacked against the everyday consumer, the need for the CFPB is a nobrainer. The New York Times this morning reported that the President’s pick to oversee the nation’s largest banks, Joseph Otting, formerly ran OneWest, which has been criticized for ‘‘robosigning’’ foreclosure documents in the wake of the financial crisis. If Mr. Otting didn’t protect consumers when he ran a mortgage lender, why would he protect them as Comptroller of the Currency? Especially in this Administration, we need an independent consumer watchdog that can act without the influence of politics on behalf of consumers. Some would choose to erode this bulwark of protection against the big banks but it is needed now more than ever. Mr. Chair, this vote is a clear marker of who you stand with: I stand on the side of my constituents in urging a no vote. Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Chair, In 2008, Wall Street’s criminal behavior drove the economy into the greatest financial crisis since the Great Depression, creating the grossly unbalanced playing field that is our economy today. In response, Congress passed the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd Frank) in 2010. While DoddFrank fell short on major banking reforms, I supported it because it was better than no reforms at all. I am appalled that House Republicans pushed through the Financial CHOICE Act, which would gut major provisions of Dodd Frank and allow Wall Street to return to the same reckless practices that occurred before the law was passed. The Financial CHOICE Act removes the watchdog from Wall Street, opening the door to destructive trading at the expense of pension funds, value investors, and average Americans. Additionally, those on Wall Street who broke the law and used Americans’ investments as a casino should be held accountable for their deceptive actions, including jail time. Yet, to this day, no Wall Street executive has seen jail time for the damage they did on our financial system. Instead, Wall Street executives are being rewarded with powerful jobs in the Trump administration. It is outrageous that Republicans want to allow the banking sector to return to ‘‘business as usual’’ with dangerous financial products and highspeed speculation. We need stronger, not weaker, financial reforms, which is why I’m taking on reckless Wall Street trading with my ‘Putting Main Street FIRST Act’ legislation to discourage speculative trading by imposing a tax of a fraction of a percent on stock, bond, and derivative trades. Congress should be fighting for the interests of the American people, not Wall Street. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I rise today to speak in opposition to H.R. 10, the ‘‘Financial CHOICE Act of 2017’’. I agree with Ranking Member MAXINE  WATERS by calling this bill the ‘‘Wrong’’ CHOICE Act. H.R. 10 is a misguided antiregulatory bill that will only diminish national efforts to protect and secure the financial stability of our nation. H.R. 10 is illconceived, destroying key financial regulations and consumer protections put in place by the DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. H.R. 10 aims to deregulate a financial system that has failed to regulate itself in the past leading to the financial crash of 2008. The nation still feels the reverberations of that crisis to this day. We all remember the foreclosures, the neighborhoods and communities financially devastated, the jobs lost, and the retirements deferred. Americans lost $13 trillion in household wealth, 11 million Americans lost their homes, and the unemployment rate climbed to 10 percent. This bill is inherently paradoxical because it claims to promote selfaccountability on Wall Street, by taking away governmental regulations on financial institutions, but that is not the nature of the beast. As evidenced by a very recent past, if given the opportunity, Wall Street runs rampant with greed and disregard for the citizens of our country. After the 2008 financial crash, Congress enacted legislation to protect those that are most vulnerable and to help the country regain its rightful place in the economic system. H.R. 10 attempts to halt the progress made to protect our economy and puts our entire nation’s economy at risk of another crisis by launching an attack against the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), an institution designed to ensure a financial crash such as the 2008 crisis does not occur again. CFPB is an effective government institution that has returned nearly $12 billion to consumers cheated by banks and other financial institutions. This bill strips the bureau’s ability to stop unfair and abusive practices perpetuated by financial institutions by removing the bureau’s political independence, threatening its funding and crippling its ability to ensure Americans’ financial welfare. Taking away CFPB’s power is harmful to consumers and small investors, those whose life savings and futures depend on the protections that Congress provides. People of color and lowincome families remain especially vulnerable to the abuse perpetuated by financial institutions. Houston, home to some of the most diverse population in the nation, would see direct consequences. H.R. 10 would risk the livelihood of many living in Houston. The ‘‘Wrong’’ CHOICE Act abandons hard working people and aids Wall Street in the abuse of hard working Americans, jeopardizing the financial stability of the entire nation. The ‘‘Wrong’’ CHOICE Act will drag us back to the days when lax lending, predatory practices and profiteers on Wall Street take advantage of vulnerable American families. We must not return to the days when massive taxpayer bailouts were the norm. We must not put our financial stability in jeopardy of another financial meltdown. b1445 The Acting CHAIR.

AMENDMENT NO . 1 OFFERED BY MR . HENSARLING  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 printed in part B of House Report 115–163. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 375, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. HENSARLING ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, this is an amendment that is purely technical in nature that addresses a few discrete issues in the amendment in the nature of a substitute. Specifically, it clarifies the noninsurancerelated functions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the National Credit Union Administration subject to congressional appropriations. This amendment will not—not—affect the ability of the NCUA to determine the appropriate allocation of expenses between their insurance and other functions for purpose of their overall funding, but it will, for the first time, give Congress the power of the purse—our constitutional power of the purse—over many of the FDIC and NCUA’s operating expenses. Additionally, the amendment revises the vesting of the appointment power for certain positions and clarifies congressional access to nonpublic meetings of the Financial Stability Oversight Council. 
Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment and to support the underlying bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chairman, this amendment, which was filed late, should be viewed as the first admission by the Republicans that H.R. 10 would be bad for our financial markets and our economy. The amendment recognizes that it would be inappropriate for Members of Congress to attend nonpublic meetings of the council charged with reviewing sensitive financial information and discussing potential threats to our economy. I agree with the sponsor that this was one of many harmful provisions in the ‘‘Wrong’’ CHOICE Act. Here are a few more: the ‘‘Wrong’’ CHOICE Act eliminates the Office of Financial Research, which is tasked with studying emerging risks to our economy and informing the Financial Stability Oversight Council. The ‘‘Wrong’’ CHOICE Act stops the council from taking actions to prevent firms like AIG from threatening our economy. The ‘‘Wrong’’ CHOICE Act allows banks to choose the regulatory system that best suits their bottom line, even if doing so is bad for the economy and taxpayers. Mr. Chairman, the amendment also recognizes the dangers of subjecting our independent financial regulators to the partisan appropriations process, by restoring the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s and the National Credit Union Administration’s independent funding when it comes to their responsibilities for unwinding failed banks and credit unions. I agree, this is important, but do you know what is also important and needing to be independent? The authority to supervise those entities before they fail. The bank and credit union regulators, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, have important yet sensitive responsibilities to make sure that financial institutions follow rules that are good for the economy, good for consumers, but which some institutions would rather ignore. Subjecting these decisions to the appropriations process will result in fewer cops on the beat, weaker guardrails, and a greater likelihood of financial catastrophe. We have seen this happen before. One of the reasons for the failure of the housing giants, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, was that they had a woefully underfunded regulator without independent funding. Democrats fixed this when we created the independently funded Federal Housing Finance Agency in 2008. Since then, this agency has successfully made tough decisions to right both GSEs by putting them into conservatorship and cleaning up their businesses. Ignoring this success and history, H.R. 10 would once again strip away the independent funding of the GSE’s regulator, as it would for all of the financial regulators. I am pleased that this amendment has recognized the problems taking away independent funding for our regulators, but, unfortunately, it doesn’t go far enough. I oppose this amendment and I urge my colleagues to reject it and the entire ‘‘Wrong’’ CHOICE Act. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. DAVIDSON ). Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman and the work of the committee for doing the work of the American people. Prior to coming to Congress, as a smallbusiness owner and smallbusiness leader, I was feeling the pain of the DoddFrank Act, wondering whether anyone in Washington, D.C., was listening. Now that I have had the opportunity to serve just this 1 year now in Congress, I have gone around the district. I have gone around and talked to businessowners, to farmers, and to community bankers who have been suffering under this law. One of the things that hasn’t been talked about is how the DoddFrank Act has harmed the SEC, how it has deprived people of due process. All but the wealthiest Americans are trapped in a system where the SEC has quasi judicial hearings using administrative law judges. They have a 90 percent win rate because they have all the keys. They can block discretion, they can block discovery, and they can limit the facts and limit the debate. So one of the good things that the DoddFrank reform—known as the CHOICE Act—accomplishes is ending this process so that people do have the right to due process in our courts. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 10 and to end the abuses of the previous era. Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chairman, the late poet Maya Angelou had a saying: ‘‘When people show you who they really are, believe them.’’ So when the chief lobbyist for the American Bankers Association leads a pep rally before 1,500 bankers, we should pay attention. He probably means what he is saying. In March, he told ABA members about all the opportunities for banking with a Republican Congress, he crowed: ‘‘I don’t want a seat at the table. I want the table.’’ If we read this bill, we know what it looks like to give the financial services sector the whole table. We know they want the whole table. H.R. 10 is clever at undermining financial regulators, emboldening Wall Street, and making it incredibly easy to delay regulators at every step of the rulemaking process. It is important for the people of America to understand that when Republicans say they want to kill regulations, usually what they are talking about is safety regulations, regulations that make the water clean, the meat safe, and that financial product that you just bought not blow up in your face. They don’t like regulations because regulations mean that the people who control some of these products can’t just do whatever they want to do. But for the people in the United States, you should know that financial regulators are going to keep money in your pocket, they are going to stop people with way more resources than you have from picking your pocket. That is why we oppose this amendment. I think it is particularly important for people to realize that the rhetoric that we use denigrating regulation all the time is the same regulation that protects us, and that includes in the financial services sector. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining? The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Minnesota has 15 seconds remaining. Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time I have remaining? The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas has 3 minutes remaining. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Chairman, I know that my friend and colleague from the other side of the aisle spoke about rhetoric. Unfortunately, that is pretty well all we have heard from my friends on the other side of the aisle. I am absolutely fascinated, Mr. Chairman, how often Members on the other side of the aisle say: I care so much about community banks; I care so much about small business. But, Mr. Chairman, do you know how many amendments that they filed on H.R. 10? Let me count them. Zero. Zero amendments. Where is their bill to help small banks? Where is their bill to help credit unions? They don’t have one, and they didn’t offer any amendments, so that is all we hear. We hear the rhetoric about Wall Street, Mr. Chairman, but it is fascinating to me—don’t take my word for it, but according to The Washington Post, The New York Times, and The Wall Street Journal, three of the largest publications in our country, they all say the same thing: Large, Wall Street banks support DoddFrank, and they oppose the Financial CHOICE Act. Now, why do they do that? Maybe it is because my friends on the other side of the aisle are only all too happy to preserve Wall Street bailouts. They wrote it into the law. They codified it into the law; and then they took 
the rest of us and created this thing called the orderly liquidation authority, which is nothing more than a taxpayerfunded bailout system. Trillions of dollars can be taken from taxpayers to bail out large banks. And they defend it. No wonder the large banks, seemingly, are satisfied with the Dodd Frank Act. But who supports the Financial CHOICE Act? The credit unions support it and the community banks support it because they are suffering and dying under the weight of the load of the DoddFrank Act. Again, if we want to get this economy moving again, if we want to ensure that our hardworking constituents finally get the pay increase they deserve, that they finally get the future that they deserve, we must reject DoddFrank, and we must support not only this amendment, but the underlying Financial CHOICE Act. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. HENSARLING ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas will be postponed. 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 printed in part B of House Report 115–163. Mr. HOLLINGSWORTH. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of title IV, insert the following: Subtitle X—Modernized Offering and Proxy Rules for ClosedEnd Funds 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 375, the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. HOLLINGSWORTH ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Indiana. Mr. HOLLINGSWORTH. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I would like to commend the chairman of the Financial Services Committee for his hard work, and the entire Financial Services Committee for all the effort they have undertaken in today’s debate of the Financial CHOICE Act. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment to the Financial CHOICE Act of 2017. This amendment would allow for certain closedend funds to be considered wellknown seasoned issuers. Ultimately, the proposed amendment is built upon the foundation of lowering costs and increasing access for investors by allowing companies that meet certain criteria to have the same equivalence as bigger companies that also have access to capital markets by making them available to those fast lanes that allow them to issue shares. In 2005, the SEC put in place significant reforms that sought to modernize registration, communication, and offering processes for traditional operating companies. These reforms were designed to streamline the registration process, especially those for large reporting issuers or wellknown seasoned issuers. Unfortunately, the SEC excluded registered closedend funds from those reforms. A closedend fund is nothing more than a pooled investment fund with a fixed number of shares that is structured, listed, and traded just like a stock on the stock exchange. Closed end funds are crucial to retirement 
savings and investment vehicles that many retail investors use. About 3 million momandpop investors rely on closedend funds to meet their investment needs. These funds serve as a longterm source of capital, which, in turn, promotes job creation—something we can all agree needs to happen more in this country. Closedend funds, though, are currently under attack by unfair onerous filing and offering regulations. This commonsense amendment would provide parity for these certain closedend funds by streamlining their registration process, offering and communications processes that are currently available to other publicly traded companies. This unfair exclusion of closed end funds has created an unlevel playing field. Giving qualifying closedend funds the ability to enjoy wellknown seasoned issuer status would help those funds better evaluate and assess the market for their offerings and would enable them to more quickly access capital markets. Those closedend funds, an important vehicle for retail investors, would allow them to get capital to more job creators. There has been a steady decline in the number of closedend funds and the number of new closedend funds offerings because of this unlevel playing field. Since 2007, the number of closed end funds has dropped by 20 percent. b1500 In 2007, there were 42 new closedend fund issuances; in 2016, there were only 8. That is an 81 percent decline. What we can all agree on is that Americans need access to capital. They need access to the capital markets that will provide them the capital to thrive as they have created new products. Retail investors also need access to those investments in order to meet their particular needs. These closedend funds should not have been hamstrung in their ability to access the advantages afforded to operating companies. It is time we provide parity in this marketplace by leveling the playing field. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chair, the Hollingsworth amendment seeks to insert a totally new and unvetted set of exemptions from the security laws for closedend funds. These are the type of pooled investment vehicles that typically issue a fixed number of shares that, unlike mutual funds, are not redeemable on a daily basis by the fund, making them harder for investors to sell. The Financial Services Committee has had no hearings, no markups, no debate on these issues until now. Perhaps that is why the amendment has been mislabeled as only benefiting closedend funds traded on an exchange with wellknown seasoned issuer status. In fact, the amendment is much broader, as it would allow even illiquid, nontraded funds to claim multiple exemptions. This effort would make it harder for the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, to police these products for investors. This lastminute, partisan approach is not the way that Congress should proceed in making laws, but it is consistent with this bill. Although Democrats conducted 41 hearings to develop DoddFrank, Republicans planned only 1 hearing on this bill. It is not surprising, then, that the ‘‘Wrong’’ CHOICE Act is a 600page bill chock full of bad partisan ideas and special interest wish lists that will harm our Nation’s investors, consumers, and taxpayers. For example, the bill would severely undermine the ability of the SEC, our Wall Street cop on the beat, to protect investors and hold bad actors accountable. Specifically, it would remove valuable law enforcement tools, burden the SEC with onerous costbenefit analysis, and generate more and more endless litigation, tying the agency up. Worse, the bill repeals the Department of Labor’s fiduciary rule and effectively prevents the DOL or the SEC from ever moving forward to protect our Nation’s investors and seniors from conflicted advice by unscrupulous financial advisers. I will say, most financial advisers are not unscrupulous, but for the ones that are, there needs to be authority in the law to stop them. We need the fiduciary rule. The ‘‘Wrong’’ CHOICE Act takes it away. But this should come as no surprise, since the Republicans in Congress have been relentless in their opposition to the DOL’s commonsense requirement that financial advisers put their clients’ interests ahead of their own when providing investment advice about retirement products. Their extreme partisan efforts to kill the fiduciary rule ignore the facts that 9 in 10 Americans reportedly agree with the rule. An overwhelming majority— 65 percent—of Americans who voted for President Trump appear to support the regulation. Tellingly, just last week, after robust bipartisan debate, the Republican Governor of Nevada signed into law a bill requiring financial advisers to act in their clients’ best interests. The ‘‘Wrong’’ CHOICE Act continues this partisan slant by also rolling back bipartisan efforts from this and past Congresses to craft legislation that helps grow small business and protect investors. Mr. Chair, we owe it to our constituents and the American people to work together to address real problems with real solutions that are thoroughly vetted. For that reason, I must oppose this bill and this amendment. I will add, my colleague on other side of the aisle, Mr. Chairman, said: Where is our bill? That would be DoddFrank. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HOLLINGSWORTH. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time I have left? The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Indiana has 2 minutes remaining. Mr. HOLLINGSWORTH. Mr. Chair, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. HUIZENGA ), the subcommittee chair. Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Chair, I support this amendment offered by Congressman HOLLINGSWORTH , who is a great member of our committee. But folks watching this, you have to understand what is going on. You just heard about how we are trying to roll back things, roll back bipartisan consensus. We have bipartisan consensus on this. This very issue was in a bill that was proposed by current OMB Director Mick Mulvaney. In fact, when it came out of committee, there were 4 ‘‘no’’ votes against it. The ranking member herself voted for this very issue in a Business Development Corporation bill, a BDC bill, that had been sponsored the last Congress. In addition, the omnibus bill that had passed had this very provision in it as well. So what you are seeing is hypocrisy, at best. Gamesmanship and politics really is probably what is going on. This amendment builds upon a bipartisan provision in the CHOICE Act that directs the SEC to do something that had been an oversight. It is streamlining these securitiesoffering provisions. I know it is complicated and very esoteric, but these wellknown, seasoned issuers, or WKSIs as they are known, really have been a secure and safe way of investing for Joe and Janet retirement investor. That is what I like to the call them. It is my mom and dad and your mom and dad, us, and our brothers and sisters. It is retail investors. What this amendment does is conforms the filing and offering regulations for closedend funds to those traditional operating companies. With that, I offer my support and encourage support. Let’s stop the hypocrisy and politics. Mr. HOLLINGSWORTH. Mr. Chair, I would just build on that to say that every WKSI goes through the SEC review and comment period. What we are doing here is removing the duplicative SEC review and comment period, which only serves to delay capital getting out to businesses, which only serves to add cost to retail investors that use these pools. So I support the amendment, and I support the Financial CHOICE Act of 2017. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chairman, we have discussed business development 
funds. We have not talked about closedend funds in committee. This amendment introduces a new idea which has not been debated. For that reason alone, we should vote it down. We have got to have regular order around here. This is a complicated issue. All the avenues and all the different perspectives that need to be brought to bear should be done in committee, not right here. Mr. Chairman, for those reasons alone, I would ask for a strong ‘‘no’’ vote on this particular amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. HOLLINGS WORTH ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Indiana will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO . 3 OFFERED BY MR . SMUCKER  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 printed in part B of House Report 115–163. Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Add at the end of title V the following new subtitle: Subtitle T—Protection of Consumer Information by Consumer Reporting Agencies 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 375, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. SMUCKER ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania. Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Chairman, I start by thanking Chairman HENSARLING and the committee and the staff for all the hard work that they have done on this very important bill. Mr. Chairman, protecting the personal information of Americans is critical to maintaining financial stability. Many of our families, friends, neighbors, and constituents have suffered from the threat of their personal information. While private industry works hard to implement strong protections for our online information, I believe that Congress has the responsibility to stay informed on the threats facing constituents in order to help protect those we represent from identity theft and IRS fraud. As you are aware, over the past few years, consumer reporting agencies have experienced numerous breaches of information. Highprofile data breaches occurred in 2017, 2015, 2013, and 2011, among others. A recent cyber attack on a CRA subsidiary allowed thieves to access taxpayer W–2s, giving them the ability to file fraudulent tax returns. Another attack exposed the Social Security numbers of an estimated 200 million Americans. Protecting consumers and the constituents I serve in Pennsylvania’s 16th District is my duty in Congress, and this includes cyber activity. In 2015, the IRS paid out $5.8 billion in fraudulent refunds to identity thieves. While it is important to clarify that that is not attributable fully to the hacks that I have already referenced, we should work to improve consumer protections and help stop the wasteful abuse of taxpayer dollars. Our constituents rely on consumer reporting agencies to monitor their credit for theft or nefarious activities. My amendment simply encourages these agencies collecting our highly sensitive financial information to do everything they deem feasible to adequately protect our constituents from identity fraud that can wreak havoc on their financial stability and personal matters. CRAs collect large amounts of personal, confidential data. The facts show these companies are under constant attack by cyber thieves. Therefore, this language merely encourages them to use the strongest protection for consumer data. H.R. 10 takes critical steps to improving our consumer protections while improving our economic and regulatory environment. My amendment is about signaling our shared desire to protect our constituents and their data. Again, I would like to thank Chairman HENSARLING for his work on this bill and for his support of this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chairman, I believe that there might be some merit to this amendment, but I still claim time in opposition. Because it wasn’t brought up in committee, I think that there is a lot of hashing out of this particular amendment that could have happened and we might have been able to agree, but at this point in the process I have to claim time in opposition and I will explain why. I will say that, if we can work on it later, we will see what happens, but as now for now, we are urging a strong ‘‘no.’’ I think the amendment is wellintentioned because it purports to address the growing problem of identity theft, something we all need to be concerned about. However, I am concerned that it may make it harder for some consumers who want to obtain their own reports, particularly those using the website annualcreditreport.com, to access their free annual consumer reports from nationwide credit reporting agencies, or CRAs. Also, the amendment purports to combat identity theft, but solely focuses on tougher authentication requirements for consumers who want to access their own files, not on all users who have access to consumer reports like landlords or employers. I think that is a weakness. The website annualcreditreport.com and reports maintained by the big three require consumers to provide personally identifiable information and to successfully answer several questions about information on the consumer files before giving them access to reports online. In a 2017 report, the Consumer Bureau noted that credit reporting complaints are consistently among the top three types of consumer complaints it handles. When consumers are denied online access, they have to mail copies of sensitive identifying documents in order to obtain their reports, which consumers note is time consuming as well as potentially not secure. This amendment could make that situation even worse. I also find it a little confusing that the House is considering this amendment to a bill that will hamstring the only Federal agency, the Consumer Bureau, that has rulemaking, supervisory, and enforcement authority over most consumer reporting agencies and has actually addressed many credit reporting problems. If Members support this amendment, then it simply does not make sense to me for the same Members to support H.R. 10, which will gut the Consumer Bureau’s capacity to effectively address problems like identity theft. Before DoddFrank, the Federal Trade Commission was the only Federal agency with enforcement authority over the CRAs, but there was no entity with supervising authority. Dodd Frank closed that gap by giving the Consumer Bureau the supervisory power to monitor CRAs’ operations. Just this year, through the good work of the Consumer Bureau’s examiners, the Consumer Bureau issued enforcement orders against all of the big three CRAs for misleading practices that harm consumers. I urge colleagues to oppose the amendment and reject the ‘‘Wrong’’ 
CHOICE Act. I hope next time we can talk about this legislation before it gets to the floor. That would be better and more proper. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. LUETKEMEYER ). Mr. LUETKEMEYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Chair, it is not my intent today to oppose the amendment; however, I do want to express my reservations over the amendment from the gentleman from Pennsylvania. I think it is important that we set the record straight on a few points. The credit reporting agencies are not required to adhere to any sort of thorough data security standard. Unlike many other industries, the financial services industry has had Federal security requirements in place for nearly 20 years. b1515 The amendment sponsor’s press release last week said credit reporting agencies do not have any Federal requirements for cybersecurity practices. That is news to the House Banking Services Committee, which has authored some of those requirements. So it simply isn’t the case. Credit reporting agencies are required to adhere to numerous data and consumer protection laws, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act and GrammLeachBliley Act, along with several Federal rules and standards on data security. I have some concerns that Congress should not be in the business of dictating specific security methodologies. The multifactor authentication procedures specified in the gentleman’s amendment could be right sometimes, even many times, but circumstances, innovation, and the passage of time may indicate otherwise. As chairman of the Financial Services Subcommittee on Financial Institutions, we want to spend some time on trying to look at this issue and hope that the gentleman works with our committee. Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chairman, I would like to talk about an issue somewhat related that is critical in this debate and would go a long way toward improving our economy and the chances of consumers. I have a bill, H.R. 435, the Credit Access and Inclusion Act. My amendment would help solve problems the Financial Services Committee has been discussing for more than a decade. This is not an amendment that I have submitted for disposition today, but I would like to bring to the attention of the body that this Credit Access and Inclusion Act was good legislation and should be taken up. It would address a problem of access to credit that the leader of this bill says he wants to solve. My bill would allow utility, telecom, public and Section 8 housing residents to build a credit score without debt. It provides affirmative permission for utility, telecom, and housing providers to report ontime payment information to credit reporting agencies. I have introduced this bill in four consecutive Congresses. I introduced this bill with Mr. PITTENGER as a lead. It has the support of many members of the committee, including Representatives MALONEY , DUFFY , GREEN , STIVERS, MEEKS , LOVE, CAPUANO , and more, a truly bipartisan piece of legislation. Why am I committed to passing the bill? Because 1 in 10 Americans do not have a credit score. These 26 million people are credit invisible, and they can have trouble getting an apartment and might pay more for insurance, and they will have a very hard time qualifying for a loan to buy a car or a home. Another 19 million are not scorable because there is too little information in their files. One in four African Americans and one in four Latinos are credit invisible and not scorable. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. HENSARLING ). Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for yielding me the time, and I thank him for his leadership. Indeed, the whole issue of data security is so vital to our constituents, so many of them have been victimized by identity theft. So I appreciate his leadership on this issue, and I know that Chairman LUETKEMEYER in our committee will be leading on this issue. I support this underlying amendment. I do have some outstanding questions on what type of multifactor authentication would be required. I want to ensure that we do not specify the technology, that this is a sense of Congress provision. But I look forward to working very closely with Congressman SMUCKER to refine the concept as it goes forward, and I thank him for his leadership. Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Chair, I thank both chairmen. This does not, obviously, replace any work that they are doing. This is a very, very important issue. This is a sense of Congress simply saying that we are very concerned about the security of the data of our constituents, and we are asking that to be looked at. But certainly there is a lot of work to be done, and I look forward to working with both the chairmen on this issue. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. SMUCKER ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 4 OFFERED BY MR . FASO  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4 printed in part B of House Report 115–163. Mr. FASO. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Add at the end of title V the following new subtitle: Subtitle T—Dividend Waiver Authority for Mutual Holding Companies 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 375, the gentleman from New York (Mr. FASO) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. Mr. FASO. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chair, I rise today to express my support for the Financial CHOICE Act, to express my appreciation to Chairman HENSARLING and the committee for all their fine work, and to offer an amendment that will help small community banks, organized as mutual holding companies, attract investors and maintain longevity in communities across America and in upstate New York, which I represent. Seven years since its enactment, it has become glaringly apparent that DoddFrank has worked to advantage big banks on Wall Street; but for many of my constituents, the most detrimental aspects of DoddFrank to upstate New York aren’t necessarily what is going on on Wall Street but, rather, the damage it has inflicted upon small community banks and Main Street. As has been highlighted here today, the U.S. is losing community banks at a rate of one per day. These disappearing institutions are neighborhood banks that are willing to make loans to families for mortgages or home equity, to small businesses to cover payroll and investment, investing in our communities, sponsoring our kids’ baseball teams, and understanding the core principles of the communities that they serve. 
Mr. Chairman, my amendment is quite simple. It seeks to help all community banks that elect to raise capital through a mutual holding company, or an MHC, charter. DoddFrank and the implementing Federal Reserve regulations came down hard on these mutual holding companies, putting onerous, expensive regulations on these mutual holding companies just for them to waive the receipts of dividends, a practice which was common preDoddFrank, and it worked very well. In New York State, banks such as the Bank of Greene County, NorthEast Community Bank, Lake Shore Savings Bank, and many others throughout the Empire State and throughout the country have been burdened by Dodd Frank’s nonsensical dividend waiver rules. My amendment cuts the red tape, restores the dividend waiver process to what it was prior to DoddFrank, and frees up capital to be reinvested in our communities. I ask my colleagues to support my amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is another example of Republicans choosing to prioritize the interests of corporate insiders over consumers, which is what the ‘‘Wrong’’ CHOICE Act really symbolizes. We should not prevent regulators from addressing potential conflicts of interest but, instead, let all shareholders have their voice be heard. While Democrats stand ready to work on targeted reforms to help responsible community banks and credit unions, we will reject any ideological legislation that puts our financial system and economy at risk of another crash and that gives a leg up to Wall Street and predatory lenders to rip off consumers all over again. Republicans like to pretend that Wall Street reform destroyed our financial system and economy, but the alternative facts have no basis in reality. Thanks to Wall Street reform and other Democratic policies, our economy has made significant gains since the depths of the financial crisis. Since DoddFrank became law, we have set a record, with 86 consecutive months of private sector job growth, during which the economy created more than 16 million private sector jobs. Let me assure you, much more work needs to be done, but this record is important and must be noted. Financial institutions are thriving since the passage of DoddFrank. According to the FDIC, banks are posting record profits since the crisis. Profits for community banks increased more than 10 percent in the past year. In 2010, the banking industry set an all time record with $171 billion in profits. Business lending has increased 75 percent since DoddFrank became law. Credit union membership has expanded by more than 16 million members since 2010, an increase of 18 percent. This has happened in part because we have a system that is fairer, because bad actors are held accountable. The highly successful Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was established and has returned nearly $12 billion to 29 million consumers who were ripped off by unfair, deceptive, and abusive practices of bad actors. This tough consumer enforcement approach has put the entire financial industry on notice to follow the law and treat their consumers fairly or suffer the consequences. So the economy is doing well, financial institutions are doing well, and consumers are finally being protected. The last thing we should do is go back to a failed, weak regulatory model that gave us bank bailouts and the Great Recession. But that is what the Republicans are offering the American people with this bill. I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment and the ‘‘Wrong’’ CHOICE Act, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. FASO. Mr. Chair, how much time do I have remaining? The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New York has 3 minutes remaining. Mr. FASO. Mr. Chair, I have listened to the statement of the gentleman from Minnesota, and I have to say I am reminded of what former Senator Moynihan said about we are all entitled to our own opinion, but not our own facts, and here are the facts. The banks that are organized as mutual holding companies organize that way. They are owned by their depositors, and they have also been able to sell publicly traded stock, but they keep a majority position in the mutual holding company. Why? Because they want to maintain the community involvement. They want to maintain the community ownership and not have their bank taken over by a distanced series of investors. That is what is exactly happening with the Bank of Greene County, for instance, in my district. The Bank of Greene County, as a mutual holding company, they own 55 percent of the bank. So it is owned by the depositors, the public shareholders, 45 percent; but because of DoddFrank and because of the change in the regulatory process that was eliminated in DoddFrank, every time the mutual holding company has dividends, annually, to waive, they must send a notice to every depositor. A depositor who might have $5 in the account or $50,000, they have to mail a notice to them. It costs them $150,000 a year that is simply wasted, and that money can’t be reinvested in our community. Mr. Chair, I regret that the minority is misrepresenting what we are trying to do here. We are defending the interests of small community banks organized as mutual holding companies that want to keep their ownership of their bank local. In fact, the bank that I am talking about, they don’t even securitize their mortgages. They underwrite and they keep all their mortgages locally in their portfolio. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ELLISON. I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. PELOSI ), the minority leader. Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I thank Mr. ELLISON and our ranking member, Congresswoman WATERS , for their great leadership on behalf of American consumers, American investors, and American taxpayers. I rise in opposition to the amendment and to the bill. Mr. Chair, today House Republicans are pushing a dangerous Wall Street first bill that would drag us right back to the days of the Great Recession. Eight years ago, unchecked recklessness on Wall Street ignited a financial meltdown that devastated families in every State in the Union: hundreds of thousands of people lost their jobs every month, and the unemployment rate soared to 10 percent; more than 11 million Americans lost their homes through foreclosure; $13 trillion in wealth, including families’ hardearned retirement savings and college savings, was destroyed. On the night of Thursday, September 18, 2008, the Treasury Secretary came to the Capitol for an emergency meeting with congressional leaders, Democrats and Republicans from the House and the Senate, to inform us of the financial meltdown. Secretary Paulson described the financial meltdown, which was horrific. When I asked the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Mr. Bernanke, what he thought of what he was telling us, Chairman Bernanke told us that, if we did not act immediately, we would not have an economy by Monday. We would not have an economy by Monday. Tens of millions of middle class families across America still bear the scars. You saw on the right the rise of the Tea Party, on the left, Occupy Wall Street. The Democratic Congress vowed that Main Street taxpayers must never again pay the price for the recklessness of some on Wall Street. I don’t paint everybody there with the same brush, but many on Wall Street, the predatory lenders and profiteers, had abused American families for far too long. With DoddFrank, Democrats enacted the strongest Wall Street consumer financial protections in history, critical reforms to protect hardworking Americans and to insist on accountability from Wall Street. 
b1530 The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that the law created has returned nearly $12 billion worth of compensation to 29 million wronged Americans—many of them seniors, many of them servicemembers. But with this bill, the Republicans will undo these safeguards, eviscerate the Consumer Bureau, and take our country back to the days of massive taxpayer bailouts. We cannot let that happen. Our Republican colleagues have named this dreadful and dangerous legislation, this Wall Streetfirst legislation, the Financial CHOICE Act. The Financial CHOICE Act to prey on investors, to prey on consumers, to prey on taxpayers. That is the choice they want to give the financial institutions. But let’s look at the appalling choices it represents. Instead of protecting consumers, Republicans choose to help those who try to cheat consumers. Instead of protecting seniors, Republicans choose to help those who prey on retirement savings. Instead of protecting men and women in uniform, Republicans choose to help those who take advantage of our servicemembers’ families while our heroes are defending our freedom on the battlefield. Instead of advancing an economy that works for everyone, Republicans choose to help the special interests get richer and to stick working people with a bill for a bailout when it goes wrong. They have always been handmaidens of the special interests. We know that. But even for them, when we think we have seen it all, this really takes them to a new low. So they call it the Financial CHOICE Act, but these are not the choices that the American people want. They are choices of the Republican Party that puts Wall Street first, that are handmaidens of special interests. So while Director Comey testified in the Senate earlier today, on this side of the Capitol, House Republicans are feeding working families to the wolves on Wall Street. As I said, I don’t paint all on Wall Street with the same brush. The pervasive incentives baked into the Republican bill will enable the predatory to punish the honest. Now, here we go. Think of it. We have a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 29 million Americans benefitting from $12 billion in compensation. Oh, they don’t like that. They want to do away with that. The Volcker Rule, which would prevent the financial institutions from taking risk at taxpayers’ expense, the classic Republican: privatize the gain, nationalize the risk. If we win, the private sector and these banks benefit. If we lose, the taxpayer pays the tab. Something that had nothing to do with the DoddFrank bill, the fiduciary rule, which only simply said that financial advisers should have the interest of the investor they are advising at heart. This bill says no. We are doing away with the very compromised, I might say, fiduciary rule to protect investors. So as I say, I don’t paint all of Wall Street with the same brush. The American people want to know who stands with them. I know you want me not to talk about this because it is the truth about what you are doing to the American people, but as the minority leader, I have the right to speak on the floor. You had plenty of time to spread your malicious legislation to hurt the American people. I am using my time to speak the truth to them about what this bill does to their financial stability. The American people want to know who stands with them and who stands with the special interests. My Republican colleagues, in the name of hardworking American families, I use my time on behalf of America’s hardworking families, not on behalf of special interests. I urge my colleagues to make the choice to reject this dastardly Wall Streetfirst bill and to vote in support of our men and women in uniform, our seniors who have built our country, in support of those hardworking Americans who are saving for their children’s education, hoping to achieve the American Dream of homeownership, and do not want to be preyed upon by Republicans in Congress. Mr. FASO. Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. HENSARLING ), the distinguished chairman of the committee. Mr. HENSARLING. May I inquire how much time is remaining, Mr. Chairman? The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New York has 1 minute remaining. The gentleman from Minnesota has 1
1⁄2minutes remaining, and the gentleman from Minnesota has the right to close. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, the last time this body listened to the minority leader and enacted Dodd Frank, permanent Wall Street bailouts were enshrined into law. That is what the gentlewoman represents, but somehow we did not hear that in her speech. The last time we listened to the gentlewoman from California, what we see is that working Americans have not received a pay increase. Their paychecks are stagnant and their savings remain decimated the last time we listened to the gentlewoman from California, the minority leader. Since we listened to her, we have seen that free checking has been cut in half, bank fees have gone up, mortgages are more difficult to come by and they are more expensive to close. That is the last time we listened to the gentlewoman from California, the minority leader. Her counsel must be rejected, as should the Washington elitism that is represented by her philosophy must be rejected as well. It is why DoddFrank must be rejected and why the Financial CHOICE Act must be enacted. Mr. Chairman, I support the amendment from the gentleman from New York. Mr. FASO. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chair, I don’t know if it was the last time, but one of the many times that we listened to NANCY PELOSI , we passed the Dodd Frank Act, which protected consumers to the tune of 29 million of them to return $11.5 billion to $12 billion back to their families. I think that NANCY  PELOSI has a pretty good record of helping out consumers. I think consumers of America would appreciate $11.5 billion returned to their family budgets. The last time we listened to NANCY  PELOSI , we saw a DoddFrank which has stabilized markets, which gave us 85 consecutive months of private sector job growth. But the last time we heard from these freemarket, Ayn Randian conservatives, oh, boy, these guys ran the economy straight into the ditch with their deregulatory schemes and their hostility to any kind of regulation on Big Business. We saw unemployment rates well north of 10 percent in many parts of this country; we saw home values plummet; and we saw mass foreclosures, all because of the failed Ayn Randian, freemarket fundamentalist attitudes that we see so often on the other side of the aisle. I will just note to my freshman friend that the minority leader can talk as long as she wants. You might want to check the rules on that one. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. FASO). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO . 5 OFFERED BY MS . MCSALLY  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5 printed in part B of House Report 115–163. Ms. MCSALLY . Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of title V, add the following: Subtitle T—Legitimate Financial Transactions Report 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 375, the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. MCSALLY ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Arizona. Ms. MCSALLY. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of my amendment to H.R. 10, the Financial CHOICE Act. Since DoddFrank was signed into law, we have seen more than 1,900 community financial institutions in the U.S. close. Additionally, rules promulgated to combat money laundering in transnational organizations have had unintended consequences on legitimate businesses along the border. In my home State of Arizona, banks and legitimate businesses along the U.S.Mexico border have been particularly hard hit by ambiguous and onerous regulations. In the last decade, Arizona has lost 70 percent of its community banks. These regulations, which were meant to minimize risk and combat money laundering, have actually contributed to high transaction costs and imposed substantial difficulties for legitimate companies engaged in cashintensive types of businesses, like ranchers and farmers. Many banking institutions have closed their doors, and others have dropped customers participating in crossborder commerce. As a result, individuals and local businesses, some of them familyowned who have been operating in the region for generations, have since lost access to banking services and the capital they rely on. I strongly support Federal efforts to combat money laundering and illicit activities, and I understand how transnational criminal organizations can exploit vulnerabilities in the financial system for their own gain. However, limiting the availability of banking services and hampering crossborder transactions to legitimate businesses has negative impacts on communities in my district. Should this be the result of regulations handed down by Washington, the Treasury Department should examine ways to remove these unintended consequences. As such, my amendment simply asks the Department of Treasury to review existing regulations and submit a report to Congress regarding its efforts to work with Federal bank regulators, financial institutions, and money service businesses to ensure that legitimate financial transactions can move freely and globally. It is critical that the new administration engage with small businesses and local stakeholders in the Southwest to ensure legitimate crossborder commerce can continue to be a major contributor to our economy. It is imperative we do everything we can to find a balance between economic needs of border communities while maintaining strong safeguards against illicit activities. This amendment is supported by the Fresh Produce Association, the Electronic Transactions Association, and the Arizona Bankers Association. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chair, let me recognize that the problem that Representative MCSALLY is trying to address here is a legitimate problem that we think needs to be focused on. I must oppose it because it is inadequate and simply not enough. It would be good if we could get together and try to come up with a bipartisan solution to this problem that she has, I think, identified as a legitimate issue. But ensuring that legitimate financial transactions move freely and globally, particularly key remittance channels for vulnerable populations, is a subject of great importance and one on which I and my Democratic colleagues remain focused. Many of us represent districts with significant immigrant populations from Central and South America, the Caribbean, Africa, all across the globe. We have heard just how critical it is for immigrants here in the United States to be able to send money that sustain their loved ones back home. While I am pleased that there is a bipartisan recognition about the need to preserve critical remittance channels for legitimate transactions, I must say that I am deeply concerned by some of the rhetoric and proposals that we have seen from the Trump administration, which make me fear that access to remittances, particularly for vulnerable populations, may be in jeopardy. Not only has the President been overtly antiimmigrant in his rhetoric during the 2016 campaign and since, he put out an alarming proposal about how he would force Mexico to pay for a wall on our Southern border. He proposed cutting off access to remittance transfers for anyone who couldn’t document their immigration status until Mexico agreed to pay an extortion payment of between $5 billion and $10 billion. I also note that while it is essential that legitimate financial transactions move freely and globally, it is equally important that illegitimate and illicit transactions do not. For this reason, I am concerned that the amendment before us falls short in that it fails to call the administration to disclose how it plans to curtail the flow of illicit funds, particularly funds which may be coming from key adversaries like the Russian Federation. One doesn’t have to look far to see that, despite record fines and numerous enforcement actions, global megabanks have continued to facilitate shady transactions even when such transactions are highly suspicious, have no economic rationale, and even likely involve money laundering and tax evasion. One example of concern, Deutsche Bank, which operates in the U.S. and around the globe, was found by the Federal Reserve, New York State, and the United Kingdom to have facilitated a massive fraudulent trading scheme that allowed $10 billion to flow out of Russia to unknown locales. b1545 In order to better understand the scheme, I recently joined with a number of my colleagues in writing to the Treasury Secretary to ask for any and all records of suspicious activity related to Deutsche Bank’s 2011 scheme in the Department’s possession, including the names and identities of all parties who participated in, or benefited from, the scheme. But, like much of the oversight Democrats are conducting on this administration, this request has apparently fallen on deaf ears. So, again, I do appreciate the intent of the amendment—I even commend Representative MCSALLY for identifying this is an important issue—it should have gone further in demanding that this administration disclose how it will curtail wellknown schemes being used to facilitate fraud. So I must urge a ‘‘no’’ vote, but I look forward to working with Representative MCSALLY on this important issue. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. MCSALLY. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate my colleague recognizing that this is a problem and saying he agrees with it, but then doesn’t support the amendment because it is not enough. I don’t understand that. I had hoped that he would support the amendment, and then we could continue to work together on other initiatives as well. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. MCSALLY ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 6 OFFERED BY MR . BUCK  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6 printed in part B of House Report 115–163. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 375, the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. BUCK) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to explain my amendment to the Financial CHOICE Act. Since the passage of DoddFrank, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has been unaccountable to Congress and harmed small businesses across this country. I am thankful for the work done by Chairman HENSARLING to rein in this outofcontrol agency. With the United States nearly $20 trillion in debt, we must do everything possible to bring financial accountability to our Federal Government. Spending at this rate will leave us not only financially bankrupt but morally bankrupt as well. It is immoral to spend money we don’t have today and force our children to pay in the future. Despite this, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau decided it was necessary to renovate their headquarters, estimated at more than $200 million, over $50 million more than the building is worth. Even in their initial designs, a lavish twostory waterfall and four story glass staircase were more important than the financial prosperity of our children. The Financial CHOICE Act makes changes to the CFPB, which will likely result in different real estate needs for the agency. My amendment is simple: it will require an assessment of whether the current CFPB building is a good use of taxpayer dollars. If not, it authorizes the General Services Administration to sell the building to the highest bidder, generating hundreds of millions of dollars by offloading a property that is unnecessary for the Federal Government to own. Just a few months ago, my first grandchild, nicknamed Bear, was born. When he grows older, I want to tell him I did everything in my power to fight the outofcontrol spending that plagues our generation. This amendment is part of that fight for Bear and all of our grandchildren. This amendment requires our government to use taxpayer dollars efficiently, and it reinforces a culture of fiscal restraint and bureaucratic decisionmaking. I encourage all of my colleagues to support this commonsense and fiscally responsible amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chairman, as if the CHOICE Act was not bad enough, this amendment piles on to the Republicans’ misguided attacks on the highly successful Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. I don’t understand why my Republican friends don’t get—29 million people got $11.5 billion of their money back because unscrupulous financial services firms unlawfully took their money. I would think we could get together on that. I would think we could agree that that is an important thing to work on. And now we are trying to mess with their building, for the sake of the children, no less. The Bureau’s inspector general conducted a thorough investigation of the Republican’s madeup suggestion that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s building renovations were inappropriate. The inspector general released an audit back in 2015, that stated: 
We determined that construction costs appear reasonable based on comparisons to an independent cost estimate and the costs of two comparable building renovations identified by the U.S. General Services Administration. We also determined that potential renovation costs are below the amount previously budgeted and obligated for the renovation. . . . Current controls for approving, managing, and documenting renovation costs and project decisions are designed appropriately. . . . 
May we put this issue to bed that there is some nefarious plot going on with the building? It wasn’t legitimate when they first raised it. It is not legitimate now. And trying to bring a big deal up about their building, which is an issue that has been resolved, is not going to benefit the children of tomorrow. I think it will benefit the children for those 29 million families to get $12 billion back. Now, that might help some kids. That might pay for some lunches, some school fees, and a whole bunch of other things to help families. But just messing with the CFPB over their building will not help anyone. Even if the House Republicans are not willing to thank the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for all it has done, I am. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has been a tough independent watchdog, has done a great job on behalf of American consumers, and has done a great job for American financial firms which do honest work. Imagine, Mr. Chairman, being a financial services firm that is actually selling a good product at a fair price and you have somebody down the street cutting corners, ripping off consumers, and you are losing your competitive advantage because you are honest. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau helps keep good financial firms good and not create this pervasive sentence to drag them in the wrong direction. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau maintains a transparent database that has collected over 1.1 million consumer complaints about financial institutions, and 97 percent of those have received a timely response. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has demystified financial transactions by requiring simple knowbeforeyouowe disclosures, and providing educational and comparison shopping tools so that consumers are empowered to make the right choice for them and their families. Perhaps one of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s most notable accomplishments to date was its investigation of Wells Fargo’s fraudulent account scandal. Let me tell you, Wells Fargo’s fraudulent account scandal definitely hurt families and kids in those families, and the CFPB’s good work helped those families. Last September, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau fined Wells Fargo $100 million for secretly opening up 2 million unauthorized accounts on behalf of its consumers and ordered the bank to compensate customers it harmed. This marks the largest penalty the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has imposed to date. And that, Mr. Chairman, has helped families and children. I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment, to stop the petty stuff about the building. This has been reviewed by independent people. It is really just a waste of time. Mr. Chairman, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet on Monday, June 12, 2017, when it shall convene at noon for morninghour debate and 2 p.m. for legislative business. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Wisconsin? There was no objection. 
NUTRITION SUBCOMMITTEE EXAMINES SNAP TECHNOLOGY (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, earlier this morning, the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Nutrition hosted a hearing to examine SNAP technology and modernization. SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, was formerly known as food stamps. The Agriculture Committee has conducted a thorough review of SNAP over the past 30 months. This program is critically important to 42 million Americans who utilize it each month. It is the largest domestic hunger safety net program in the country, and it is imperative that it remains viable so we can continue to serve so many who are struggling. That is why, at today’s hearing, we discussed technology and modernization 
of SNAP, including areas to enhance program integrity, streamline delivery of services, improve the customer experience, and ease administrative burdens. In just 2004, EBT, or electronic benefit transfer, was completed. This is the electronic system that allows a recipient to authorize transfer of their supplemental benefits to a retailer to pay for products. This was a tremendous step forward toward improving the program. As chairman of the Nutrition Subcommittee, I look forward to continuing to improve the efficiency of SNAP. 
b1645 DARK DAYS OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS (Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Madam Speaker, in the wake of the financial crisis, 7.8 million American consumers lost their homes through foreclosure. The failure to have a responsible regulatory environment also resulted in taxpayers paying $7 trillion to bail out financial institutions through loans and, according to some reports, an additional $22 trillion through the Federal Government’s purchase of assets. My home State of New Jersey was severely impacted by this crisis and still feeling the effects. So this is personal. The Financial CHOICE Act is the wrong choice for Americans. This bill guts many of the commonsense protections that are outlined in DoddFrank and severely restricts the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau from doing its job. The ‘‘Wrong’’ CHOICE Act gives Wall Street a hand while ignoring the needs of hardworking Americans. It will allow predatory lending practices to go unchecked and profiteers on Wall Street to skirt consequences. Wall Street reform and other Democratic policies have given our country the strongest consumer protections in history. I will continue to stand up for hardworking Americans and reject the ‘‘Wrong’’ CHOICE Act before Republicans pave the way back to the dark days of the financial crisis. 
HONORING JOHN DEEDER ON HIS RETIREMENT (Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the career of John Deeder, a valued member of the community in southwest Washington. John spent 48 years in education and announced his retirement earlier this year. Throughout his life, John has been a coach, counselor, teacher, principal, superintendent, and more. More recently, he served as superintendent of the Evergreen Public Schools, the fifth largest in Washington State, for 11 years. His career in teaching exhibits how much he values educating students and setting them up to succeed. Those who have worked with John know that he has been dedicated to improving the learning experiences for kids in southwest Washington for just shy of 5 decades. Under his innovative leadership, an incredible bioscience high school called the Henrietta Lacks Health and Bioscience High School was built. HeLa High School places an emphasis on workforce development in health sciences and biotechnology that is an investment in our future leaders. It took a decade to research, plan, and build this transformational school, but John remained committed to the vision of this school. Though John’s formal career has ended, the legacy of his persistent leadership can be seen throughout HeLa High School and its students. While John has extensive involvement in education, his community engagement also spans well beyond his career as superintendent. He has taken every opportunity to serve, and is a shining example of what makes this expansive and populated region feel like a tightknit and caring community. He is an inspiration to all in southwest Washington, and I am confident he will continue working to improve education here and beyond. I congratulate John on his retirement and wish him all the best in his future endeavors. f 
RECOGNIZING THE CALVARY CHRISTIAN WARRIORS BOYS BASEBALL TEAM (Mr. CRIST asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. CRIST. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Clearwater, Florida’s Calvary Christian High School Warriors boys baseball team on their impressive State championship win. Coach Greg Olsen and the Warriors clinched an 11–1 victory against Pensacola Catholic High School to lead them to the Class 4A title, clinching the school’s first State championship and capping off a perfect season of 30 wins and no losses. Such an achievement takes more than skill and talent. It takes steely determination, unwavering focus, and perhaps, most importantly, the ability to work together. These skills are invaluable both on and off the field. What they have learned as teammates will enable their success not just as athletes, but as good citizens. Our entire community is proud of their outstanding sportsmanship and achievements. On behalf of Pinellas County, congratulations Warriors. 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF 1ST INFANTRY DIVISION (Mr. MARSHALL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. MARSHALL. Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the 100th anniversary of the Army’s 1st Infantry Division, or the ‘‘Big Red One.’’ From their heroic start, the 1st Infantry Division has played a vital role in our Nation’s history, serving in almost every American war since 1917. Today, the Big Red One has over 5,000 soldiers deployed worldwide, with an additional 10,000 in my district at Fort Riley. They are preparing to deploy in support of ongoing operations. Since 1917, more than 13,000 soldiers of the 1st Infantry Division have paid the ultimate sacrifice. We honor those who have worn the patch of the Big Red One and those that do so today. I cannot be more proud of our troops at Fort Riley. I am honored to represent them. I thank them all for their service. f 
CONGRATULATING THE WEST SIDE HIGH SCHOOL TRACK TEAMS (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the girls and boys track teams at West Side High School in Newark, New Jersey, for winning gold in their respective 4x400 meter relay heats at the Penn Relays this year. The oldest and largest track and field competition in the world, the Penn Relays is also one of the most prestigious, drawing nearly 20,000 athletes from across the globe. There is some really tough competition at the Penn Relays, but both West Side teams stood out. The boys relay team, made up of James Bell, Jarrett Gentle, Jakai Coker, and Shaquan Williams, won their heat in an impressive 3 minutes 28 seconds, more than a second faster than the second place team. The girls relay team, made up of Aminah Muhammad, Fatima Sannor, Tiyauna Evans, and Jahne Slocum, won their heat in an impressive 4 minutes and 7 seconds, more than 3 seconds faster than the second place finishers. Madam Speaker, again, I congratulate the West Side High School track team and their coaches, Rickey Meekins and Eddie Greene, for bringing home the gold—a testament to their skill, dedication, and teamwork. Go, Roughriders. 
TROUP COUNTY DRUG TREATMENT COURT (Mr. FERGUSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. FERGUSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today to commend the work of the 
Troup County Drug Court in LaGrange, Georgia. I had the opportunity to speak at their commencement ceremony last week while I was back in the district. This program holds offenders with substance abuse and mental health disorders accountable through strict supervision and treatment, and allows them to get their lives back on track. As a dentist, I have had the opportunity to work with those suffering from substance abuse problems through my work with Hope Harbor, a Christian recovery center in my district. I have seen firsthand that, for every addiction, there is a real human being behind the statistic. These men and women have the potential to live long, productive lives serving their families and communities, and programs like this help them do just that. The success rate of these programs speaks volumes about their value to the community and those that graduate from the program. Seventyfive percent of drug court graduates never reoffend. This is almost 2
1⁄2times higher than the 30 percent success rate of those who serve a prison sentence and receive no treatment. I commend the hard work of the men and women of the Troup County Drug Court. 
TWO IMPORTANT ISSUES (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise to discuss two issues and to speak on their impact to the American people. The first one is the Financial CHOICE Act, which we just debated. I oppose it for the very reason that we passed DoddFrank. We passed it to respond to the greatest recession in 80 years, which saw a financial crisis that caused working men and women to lose the greatest amount of wealth they have ever lost. Yet, our colleagues here believe that it is important to choose large corporate interests over working men and women. At the same time, today we heard the testimony of Director Comey under oath. He gave a list of very troublesome acts and words offered by the President of the United States. Shortly thereafter, the President’s lawyer, who was not under oath, came forward to deny, disparage, and suggest that Director Comey was not telling the truth. That is clearly an indication that the Judiciary Committee should begin an inquiry. That is our jurisdictional duty: to begin an inquiry to discern who is telling the truth. The FBI is under our jurisdiction. It is time for the House to hold hearings now. The truth must be known by the American people. 
REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF PAUL W. PAINTER, JR. (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember the life of the respected Savannah lawyer and gentleman, Paul W. Painter, Jr., who passed away on Saturday, May 27, 2017, at the age of 71. Mr. Painter comes from a family that has worked tirelessly to serve our country both in the Armed Forces as well as our judiciary system. His father, Paul Painter, Sr., served during World War II, and then created a successful law practice. Paul Painter, Jr., followed in his father’s footsteps, graduating from Georgia Tech, and then serving in the Navy for 4 years. After that, Mr. Painter attended law school at the University of Georgia, beginning a career that would benefit and serve many Savannahians for years to come. Mr. Painter started his own firm in Savannah, now known as the Ellis, Painter, Ratterree, & Adams Law Firm, with which he practiced for nearly 30 years. By the end of his law career, he was known as one of the best lawyers in the entire State of Georgia and was named to the list of Georgia’s Top 10 lawyers in 2014. The Paul W. Painter, Jr., Civility and Professional Award was also created in his honor to remember his fantastic work and to reward other outstanding lawyers in Georgia. Mr. Painter was an honorable person who did everything possible to improve our judicial system, and he gained respect from lawyers all over. He will certainly be missed as an asset to our community and the entire legal field. f 
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE (Mr. TED LIEU of California asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. TED LIEU of California. Madam Speaker, as a former prosecutor, I rise to state the obvious: President Trump committed obstruction of justice. We have direct evidence that the President asked the FBI Director for loyalty. He demanded it. He asked the FBI Director to drop an investigation into Michael Flynn. The President fired the FBI Director. Then, on national TV, he said he did it because of the Russian probe. Then he told the Russians in the Oval Office that he did it to relieve great pressure because of the FBI investigation. That is classic obstruction of justice. The Washington Post today has a quote from one of the prosecutors of Watergate. He says: ‘‘I helped prosecute Watergate. Comey’s statement is sufficient evidence for an obstruction of justice case.’’ I call on Special Counsel Mueller to investigate the President of the United States for violating the obstruction of justice statute, which is a felony. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. CHENEY). Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. PUTTING THE AMERICAN DREAM BACK INTO REACH (Mr. TAYLOR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, my generation has known two very profound events: war and recession. To some folks, a decade seems like forever ago, but for most Virginians, most Americans, the events of the financial collapse 10 years ago still haunt their memories today. Financial devastation hit the poor and middle class in this country unlike anything we have witnessed in our lifetimes: businesses shuttered, retirement plans halted, families losing many homes. In response, Congress passed Dodd Frank, a bill with more regulations than all other bills passed during the Obama administration. DoddFrank regulations have pushed many community banks out of business. We lose one of them or a credit union every single day. Smallbusiness lending, the driver of jobs in this country, has declined; everyday banking services have been reduced; and homeownership is increasingly out of reach. The Financial CHOICE Act provides more accountability over unelected bodies, unlocks smallbusiness lending, allows community banks to survive, stops bigbank bailouts with our tax dollars, will increase homeownership, and it imposes the toughest penalties ever for financial fraud. This bill puts the American Dream into reach for millions of Americans. f 
b1700 HECTOR BARAJASVARELA (Ms. BARRAGA´N asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. BARRAGA´N. Madam Speaker, veterans shouldn’t have to come home in a body bag to be recognized as Americans. Last weekend, I went, along with some of my colleagues, to Tijuana, Mexico, where we visited veterans who have served this country, who have picked up a weapon to go and fight in war to protect our freedoms. They survived, came home, and some of them were deported. Do you know that if you go and you fight overseas and you are not a citizen and you die, you get automatic citizenship? One of those people we saw this weekend is my constituent, Hector Barajas, from Compton. This is a photo of him. He was proudly still wearing his uniform. He was deported to Mexico after serving 5
1⁄2years in the U.S. Army, receiving two commendations. I am proud to cosponsor H.R. 1405, which would allow noncitizen veterans who have been deported to come home and come back to the United States. I hope that he gets to come back, too. 
IN RECOGNITION OF LIEUTENANT COLONEL LISA L.A. EPPERSON (Mr. BACON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. BACON. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Lieutenant Colonel Lisa L.A. Epperson on the occasion of her retirement from the United States Air Force, the best Air Force in the world. Colonel Epperson has given a great deal to this Nation through her service. Her assignments include WrightPatterson, Tyndall, Los Angeles, Hill, and Nellis Air Force Bases, and finally here at the Pentagon. Colonel Epperson has influenced mission systems from Defense Satellite Communications System and Minuteman III, an ICBM, to the F–15 and F–22. Most importantly, she impacted our warfighting operations in Operations Noble Eagle, Enduring Freedom, and Iraqi Freedom. Throughout her distinguished career, Colonel Epperson represented our country with honor, and I am privileged to pay tribute to her. On behalf of Congress and the United States, I want to thank Colonel Epperson; her husband, David; and their children, Trevor and Cassidy, for their 20 years of service. I wish them Godspeed and continued happiness as they start this new chapter. 
CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. SMUCKER ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. 
Mr. SMUCKER. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the topic of this Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Pennsylvania? There was no objection. Mr. SMUCKER. Madam Speaker, tonight I am honored to lead a bipartisan Special Order on career and technical education. We have several Members joining us here this evening to highlight CTE programs in their districts and the upcoming reauthorization of the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act. I would like to start the order by yielding to my colleague and colead, Congressman KRISHNAMOORTHI , who has been working hard with my Pennsylvania colleague, Congressman THOMPSON , on H.R. 2353, the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act. Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Madam Speaker, I thank Representative SMUCKER for yielding. I really appreciate his leadership. I thank Congressman G.T. THOMPSON from Pennsylvania as well for his leadership. It is an honor to be here. Madam Speaker, in recent years, global economic trends have led to an evergrowing skills gap. While unemployment has fallen to 4.4 percent in my home State of Illinois, there is still a widening gap between the jobs that are open and the skills workers need. This has become apparent as I have traveled throughout my district listening to community representatives, businesses, parents, students, and higher education officials discuss the local state of the economy. I have been particularly concerned with the feedback I have received from businesses, who continue to report that there is a gap between the talent and skills they need in employees and what they can actually find. Shortages in skilled fields like machinists, technicians, operators, cybersecurity, and healthcare are impairing their ability to grow their businesses. There is much Congress can do to improve the skills of our labor force, which is why I was proud to partner with my good friend and fellow member of the Education and the Workforce Committee, Congressman G.T. THOMP SON, in introducing H.R. 2353. Our bill reauthorizes the Carl D. Perkins grant program through fiscal year 2023 and gives States and local governments the tools to better equip workers for higher paying middle class jobs in the 21st century. The Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act addresses one of the underlying causes of the skills gap: what is being taught in classes does not necessarily sync up with what is needed to get a job. H.R. 2353 requires a strong buyin from local businesses in developing State plans. With more local stakeholders involved in the process, it will better equip students with the technical skills they need to find success in local indemand careers. Finally, I believe it is important that we start to shift the culture surrounding career and technical education. Every student, no matter his or her career goals, should participate in some form of career education. I believe that every student needs to graduate, not just with a diploma but with another piece of paper, namely an offer letter. Some students will find success in a traditional 4year college program; others, however, will learn the skills they need through a 2year community college or onthejob training. I look forward to working with my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to ensure its passage, and I look forward to sending this bill to the President later this year for signing. Mr. SMUCKER. Madam Speaker, I would like to thank Congressman KRISHNAMOORTHI for his leadership on this issue. The Congressman is a fellow member of the freshman class. I really appreciate the opportunity to work with him, particularly on this very important topic. Madam Speaker, I yield to Congressman THOMPSON , the sponsor of H.R. 2353, who, for many years, has been leading the charge here in the House to strengthen career technical education. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend from Pennsylvania, Representative SMUCKER —he is doing a great job representing his congressional district and being a strong voice for Pennsylvania—for hosting this important Special Order tonight focused on career and technical education. I appreciate my good friend, Representative KRISHNAMOORTHI , who is with me and is leading the charge with the piece of legislation that I hope we will see on the House floor in the weeks to come. As cochair of the House Career and Technical Education Caucus, I often say that a high quality career in technical education can help restore rungs on the ladder of opportunity. Now, this statement is one I truly believe in. For many Americans, those rungs have been displaced for different reasons, whether it is training that they have had, access to training, access to quality, effective training; whether it has been poverty; whether it has been unemployment, underemployment, all things that take away rungs on the ladder of opportunity, this career and technical education can truly restore rungs on the ladder of opportunity. It is undeniable that career and technological education has helped many Americans obtain the knowledge and skills they need to break the cycle of poverty and achieve a lifetime of success. The first step to increasing access to CTE programs, as we refer to them, across the United States is modernizing the Federal investment in these programs, and it has been more than a decade since Congress has updated the Federal law governing CTE programs. This is problematic, due to the fact that so much about our society and our Nation’s workforce has changed during this time. Since the last time the Perkins Act was reauthorized, we have new skill sets, new jobs, new industry, new opportunities, new technology. So, for example, today, more than 1 million positions remain open in the trade, transportation, utility sectors, and an additional 315,000 manufacturing positions are currently unfilled. If we are to embark on a new era of American manufacturing and improved infrastructure, we need a qualified and well trained workforce to fill these positions. That is the number one asset of any business. It is not the location; it is not the compliance; it is not the marketing. It really is a qualified and trained workforce. With all this in mind, I have worked with my colleagues in introducing the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act 
once again this Congress. Last Congress, this bill did pass unanimously out of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce and was widely supported on the House floor by a vote of 405–5. Unfortunately, things bogged down in the Senate, with a lot of good legislation at the end of the last congressional cycle, and so here we are again, which is okay, because we have taken the opportunity to make this just a little bit better, too. We had some small refinements, but some improvements. We used our time effectively. Now, this robust reauthorization of the Perkins Act will help ensure that Federal policies accurately reflect the challenges and realities facing today’s students, workers, and employers. Additionally, the bill supports innovative learning opportunities and stronger engagements with employers. By promoting workbased learning at the Federal level, more employers will build relationships with students through handson experience. This type of learning is invaluable to students with a wide range of interests and learning styles. I am proud to see this bill pass out of the committee unanimously once again last month. I am looking forward to its consideration on the House floor and in the Senate in the future. Now, if we are serious about improving our Nation’s workforce and providing greater opportunities for all Americans, we will work together to move this bill through the legislative process. After all, this new bill, as I have said before, does restore rungs on the ladder of opportunity. The impact of increasing access and quality of career and technical education is farreaching. Take, for example, maybe a 15yearold girl who when in school was uninspired, her head is on her desk. She doesn’t learn in the typical way that many of us do, where people talk at you and teach, but if you can put something in her hands, the tools of career and technical education, that could be a welder, a set of wrenches, it could be a paint brush, it could be a stethoscope, farm implements, she is inspired, and she does great, she excels. I just heard about a young boy today, who is a young man now, but as a young boy was on the spectrum scale, he had some issues of autism. I was so inspired to hear this today. This young man went into career and technical education as a welder. And today, he is making a significant amount of money, more than what his teacher was making, right out of high school, as a welder because of what career and technical education did. The young couple facing unemployment and underemployment who is at the kitchen table trying to decide how to make ends meet, and this is an opportunity to get back into the workforce. The middleaged worker who has been working the line manufacturing who would like a promotion, do a little better by his family, bring more money home, it provides and serves that person. The family who is stuck in poverty maybe for generations, stuck in poverty so long, they don’t even remember what was the incident that put them into poverty generations ago, but this is a way to break that cycle of poverty. And certainly the successful business owner, who is doing all the right things, and she is invested in her business and has grown the business and has a great product and a great location and a great marketing plan, great compliance plan, because of regulation issues, but she is closing her business, because, Madam Speaker, she can’t find qualified and trained workers to keep that business going, let alone grow it. These are all examples of folks who will benefit from this. I really want to thank my colleagues for their enthusiastic support of career and technical education. On a day when I know there are other places where there are pressures to be this evening, you are right here on the House floor and leading the cause for career and technical education, and I am very thankful for that. Once again, thanks to Representative SMUCKER for his leadership and tonight’s Special Order. Mr. SMUCKER. Madam Speaker, I would like to again thank the Congressman for his leadership on this very important issue. I very much enjoyed, in the 5 months I have been here, working with Congressman THOMPSON , a fellow member of the Pennsylvania delegation, but I have seen his passion for this issue. So, again, I look forward to continuing to work with you on this and really appreciate your leadership. b1715 You mentioned the critical need of businesses to fill spots that are available today. We see the unemployment rate today. We know this is a problem today and will continue to be a problem. My background is in construction. We owned a construction firm. We had about 150 employees. Our biggest problem always was finding qualified people to fill the spots that are available. At the same time, I saw the opportunities that were available to people who decided to take up a career in construction. It is not, as many people think, neither construction nor manufacturing nor many jobs that require technical trade skills today. Construction uses technology, and it is not a dirty job that people once thought it was. The manufacturing is the same way. At the same time, there are greatpaying jobs, familysustaining jobs available in these fields. I think we need to do a better job of enlightening, essentially, the opportunities and talking about the opportunities that are available through career and technical education. To your point again, Congressman, there is no better way to help people out of poverty than to connect them with a goodpaying job and the self worth that is achieved from finding a job. We know those jobs are available today. What career and technical education does is prepare people for great paying jobs that are available. Again, thank you so much for your leadership on this. Now I would like to yield to another freshman colleague of mine on the Education and Workforce Committee, Mr. MITCHELL , who has an extensive background in higher education and brings that expertise to the committee. Mr. MITCHELL. I thank Mr. SMUCKER for yielding to me. Madam Speaker, I rise today to talk about education and workforce preparedness. Prior to serving in Congress, I dedicated my 35year career to workforce education, helping people develop skills necessary to get a job and start a career path. There is something about the pride that comes when someone builds the skills necessary to start a career. Their whole world changes when they see what they can achieve and the difference that makes for their family. I ran for Congress with the desire to make that opportunity possible for all Americans; to help all Americans succeed, as I and so many others in this Chamber have. For some people, pursuing their desired career means a 4year college degree. I have also seen that that is not the right path for many others. Yet, too often, those that wish to pursue careers in technical areas lack the skills to gain the employment and access the skills training necessary to move forward. This leads to a problem we have all heard of, the skills gap. People, young and mature, are unable to find jobs because they lack the necessary skills, and employers are unable to find qualified staff to fill their jobs. We are seeing this repeatedly in my home State of Michigan. Several companies that have been awarded incentives to grow and expand through the Michigan Strategic Fund have had to dial back planned expansions due to hiring challenges. The Pure Michigan Talent Connect website lists nearly 100,000 open jobs and positions across a range of industries. Businesses simply cannot find qualified individuals to fill their open jobs. It threatens our Nation, and we must address it. In efforts to assess the needs of our education system over the last 5 months, I have met with students, administrators, teachers, and employers throughout my congressional district. Every single employer I have met since I started office have told me the same thing, believe it or not. They need more employees with the skills necessary, the core technical skills necessary, to contribute in the workforce. Despite expensive and extensive recruitment efforts, they can’t find them. It is creating a real problem. 
They are turning down work and turning down opportunity and growth across this Nation and in my district because they cannot find skilled employees. Schools in my community recognize this problem, but too often their hands are tied, needing to ensure that students meet arbitrary standards and testing metrics. Here is the irony: rather than ensuring that they are prepared for employment in the community, we worry about test scores. School leaders throughout my district have asked for one thing: more flexibility to offer choices to students and families to develop skills to meet the needs of employers and, frankly, the needs of the 21st century. The Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act would give additional flexibility to the community that education leaders are asking for. It will also allow States to better accommodate the local workforce needs. Schools, parents, employers, and teachers have made it clear: career and technical education can be improved by making it more relevant to students and employers, ensuring programs are accountable, involving all stakeholders, and granting more flexibility. The bipartisan Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act achieves those goals. I am proud to support it as one step to expand the educational opportunities in choice in this country. Mr. SMUCKER. I thank Representative MITCHELL for his comments. Again, I appreciate not only his passion for this issue, but the wealth of experience in this field that he brings to the table, and I look forward as well to continuing to work with him on this issue. I now would like to yield to, once again, another freshman Member of the class who I very much enjoy working with, Mr. FERGUSON . Mr. FERGUSON. I thank Mr. SMUCKER for yielding to me. I, too, would like to express my appreciation for Representative THOMP SONfor taking the lead on this on our side of aisle. He did a great job. I also appreciate Representative KRISHNAMOORTHI from Illinois, who worked tirelessly to make this a real solid bill. So thanks to both of them. Thank you for taking time to lead these Special Orders tonight. In my district and throughout Georgia, our school systems, technical colleges, and communities are creating innovative career tech opportunities to help transition students into a workforce through dual enrollment with the Technical College System of Georgia, workbased learning apprenticeships, and Career Academies like the THINC Academy in LaGrange, the Central Education Center in Newnan, and 12 for Life in Carrollton, Georgia. These programs are helping our young people make the transition from high school directly into the workforce, and they are also helping adult learners transition into new careers. I visited these centers and learned about these education programs, and they provide a meaningful transition for these students. They rely heavily on the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Eduction Act. This is a pivotal workforce development tool. It enables our education leaders to develop tailored programs that reflect the workforce needs, leveraging small dollars for very large outcomes. Travelling throughout my district, the number one issue I hear from business and education leaders is workforce development. I have seen examples across the Third District of how community stakeholders are pulling together to do their part to develop career tech education and, in turn, create opportunities for young people to climb the ladder of success. I am so impressed by the emerging partnerships that have naturally come about as these groups work to close the skills gap that we have in this country. They know the urgent need we have to educate students and develop these skills to fill the demands of a 21st century job. This is a story of so many of our communities across the country and the reason why I support the effort to move forward and reauthorize the Perkins CTE. Reauthorizing Perkins CTE will upgrade the law and more accurately reflect the needs and work being done by States and local communities, providing flexibility, streamlined application processes, promoting partnerships, accountability, and a limited Federal role. It is time to make these reforms, and I proudly support H.R. 2353. Mr. SMUCKER. I thank Mr. FERGUSON for his comments. As he mentioned, this is about familysustaining jobs. Mr. FERGUSON has a lot of experience bringing jobs to his town of West Point in Georgia, where he was mayor, creating thousands of new jobs there through innovative policies. I look forward to continuing to work with him on this as well. Now I yield to another colleague on the Education and Workforce Committee who has been a leading voice as well on CTE, Mr. WILSON . Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. I thank Congressman LLOYD SMUCKER  for yielding to me. I appreciate his dedicated leadership to the people of Pennsylvania. Students and businesses in South Carolina know firsthand the importance of an educated workforce to promote jobs. They also know that quality education doesn’t have to come at the time and expense of a traditional 4 year college degree to achieve fulfilling jobs. While visiting these schools and businesses across the Second District of South Carolina, I regularly learn how they have positively benefited from career and technical education programs that create jobs and lead to fulfilling lives. With career and technical education, students can incorporate practical skills and training into their educational experience; skills that are valuable to the workforce to create jobs. Businesses in South Carolina especially appreciate the opportunity to work with the technical colleges to work to close the skills gap and hire trained, experienced employees for highly technical jobs. I have been grateful to have the opportunity to visit Midlands Technical College, Aiken Technical College, and OrangeburgCalhoun Technical College, along with the extraordinary programs at their area high schools. I am grateful for the work of the Apprenticeship Carolina, readySC, and the South Carolina Technical College System for their role in connecting students with employers. I also appreciate the countless businesses in South Carolina, like Boeing, Michelin, MTU, Fluor, and others that support the career and technical education programs and hire students from the programs or facilitate apprenticeship programs for meaningful jobs. In fact, these programs have been the basis for establishing the tire industry in South Carolina where, in the district I represent, Michelin is the largest single tire manufacturer in the world at that location. Additionally, with Bridgestone, which is Japanese; Continental, which is German; Michelin, which is French; Giti, which is GT, which is Singapore; and soon a Chinese tire manufacturer, because of the training programs we have, South Carolina now is the leading manufacturer and exporter of tires of any State in the United States. Additionally, with BMW, South Carolina is the leading exporter of cars of any State in the United States. In fact, last year, $9.4 billion worth of BMWs were exported out of Charleston for worldwide distribution. While South Carolina has been highly successful in promoting career and technical education programs, I hope all communities across the country can experience the success that we have achieved creating jobs. The Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act will reduce regulations and allow State and local leaders to create career and technical education programs best for their communities. As the House of Representatives will consider the bipartisan Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act soon, I urge all of my colleagues to support this jobcreating legislation for meaningful and productive families. Mr. SMUCKER. I thank Mr. WILSON  for his comments. I am happy to say that I am one of those who supports the economy in South Carolina by buying those Bridgestone and Firestone tires for my vehicles. Mr. WILSON has been a strong advocate, obviously, for the people of his 
district, the people of his State, and has been a leader in regards to CTE. I look forward to working with him on this bill as well. I think I will have one more speaker, who is on the way. As I wait for him, Mr. WILSON talked about some of the schools in his area that have been doing a great job in connecting people, training people, educating people for the kind of jobs that are available in our workforces. Pennsylvania’s 16th Congressional District is home to Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology, and it is an incredible story and similar to stories of many of the other institutions that are providing career and technical education. There was a job fair recently at Thaddeus Stevens College, and for just a few hundred graduates, there were about 450 companies essentially competing for those individuals, competing to fill spots they had. So it goes without saying that the placement rate at many of these schools—I know certainly at Thaddeus Stevens College—is almost 100 percent placement rate. They have a problem, in fact, sometimes keeping people until graduation because students are offered jobs even before they graduate, and they are hired away. b1730 Some of the students coming out of Thaddeus Stevens College are earning, on average, $45,000 annually. We have the Marcellus shale drilling in our area, welders, some of them are earning up to six figures, $100,000 or more in the first or second year of employment. So, again, the kind of jobs that we are talking about here are greatpaying, familysustaining jobs. My district is also home to Reading Area Community College and the Pennsylvania College of Health Sciences, both of which offer CTE programs. We have spoken with, as a part of leading up to this bill being introduced, their faculty, students, and staff about how some of these programs can be improved. Harrisburg Area Community College has a campus in my district in Lancaster. They do something that I think we will be seeing more of and should be seeing more of: they run an innovative apprenticeship program. They brought together private businesses that work with the school to help prepare skilled workers to fill available jobs. It is a very innovative program. The program has been very, very successful. Future initiatives there include expanding the program into our local high schools to ensure that graduates are college or career ready. It is an opportunity that I think we have across the country. If you look at some other models, some of the European countries—for instance, I just had a long, extensive conversation with the Swiss Ambassador about the apprenticeship program in Switzerland. Here, we often think of apprenticeship in what we may refer to as blue collar workers, construction and manufacturing. In Switzerland, I was told that they have apprenticeship programs in up to 230 careers. So it is bankers and insurers. Many, many different companies are taking advantage of the apprenticeship program there. It gets to the student debt problem that we hear so much about. Here, students are earning a degree. In an apprenticeship program, students are earning a degree while earning dollars, so it sort of does away with that, if you think about it. You are earning dollars as you are learning. So it is a great model that I hope to see more of here. Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. LANGEVIN ). Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank Representative SMUCKER for holding this Special Order. Madam Speaker, as cochair of the Career and Technical Education Caucus, I rise to highlight the importance of career and technical education for our Nation’s workforce. I really appreciate all of the comments that the gentleman just mentioned, and I concur. Madam Speaker, across Rhode Island, I continue to hear from employers struggling to find skilled workers to fill open jobs in fields such as manufacturing, IT, and other trades. Hundreds of thousands of high skilled, highpaying jobs are right now unfulfilled in our country, and this number is continuing to grow. Especially as we hear about bringing jobs back from overseas, manufacturing, just by way of example, has changed dramatically. These factories are no longer the old, dirty, noisy manufacturing factories of old that, say, our fathers or grandfathers were used to. They are now all hightech. You see robots doing a lot of the manufacturing that require both programming and sophisticated knowledge how to run this advanced equipment. So the jobs are coming back, but they are coming back in different ways, needing different skills. And right now we need to ensure that our workforce is equipped with the tools to meet the demands of the economy to close our Nation’s skills gap. We can do this by better aligning education and industry. Our students, Madam Speaker, should be learning the skills they need to succeed in growing economic sectors. This is one of the most important investments that we can make in our Nation’s future. The Governor of Rhode Island, Governor Raimondo, likes to say: We need to give our workers the skills that matter for jobs that pay. In the Ocean State, the newly opened Westerly Education Center right now is working to promote CTE, providing a range of courses to help Rhode Islanders to meet the current and projected needs of the region’s economy. The Westerly Education Center effectively brings together higher education, industry, and community partners to ensure students of all ages are prepared for workforce opportunities in Rhode Island. Classes range from industry specific skills training to courses in critical thinking, management, and also soft skills. CTE courses, Madam Speaker, are in demand. Approximately 12.5 million high school and college students are enrolled in CTE across the Nation. But Federal investment in this area has decreased, actually, since 2011, and the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act hasn’t been authorized since 2006. I am hoping that we are going to be able to see this act reauthorized very soon. Perkins is the primary Federal investment in CTE, and the most important thing that we can do to support CTE across the country, to support students and businesses across the country, is to reauthorize this legislation. It needs to be updated for our changing economy, and funding for CTE programs must be increased to support growing programs across the Nation. Last Congress, I know that the House overwhelmingly passed the bipartisan Strengthening Career and Technical Education Act, and I call on my colleagues to do the same in this Congress as well. It was, in some ways, a rare moment of bipartisanship in the Congress and a great example of how we can work together. Hopefully, that will lead to other things as well. H.R. 2353 recently passed unanimously by the Education and the Workforce Committee, and it is, again, the product of an inclusive and thoughtful process. I commend the chairman of the Education and the Workforce Committee and the ranking member and all of the members on both sides of the aisle for working so closely together—again, a very complicated piece of legislation that passed unanimously out of committee. So, again, I thank my fellow CTE Caucus cochair as well, Representative THOMPSON from Pennsylvania, for all of his great work on this bill. He is a member of the Education and the Workforce Committee, and he is the cochair of the CTE Caucus. We work in lockstep on these matters. It has been a pleasure to work with him. I am grateful for his leadership, along with many other colleagues. It makes many necessary updates to Perkins, with an emphasis on training students for the skills that they will need in highgrowth economic sectors. The bill contains several important reforms, including increasing collaboration between education and industry, expanding student access to apprenticeships, supporting career counselors, and aligning State performance indicators with local labor markets, among other things. Unfortunately, at a time when it is more crucial than ever to invest in CTE, the President’s budget has proposed, though, a budget for fiscal year 
2018 that cuts Perkins State grants by 15 percent. That is more than $168 million across the country. In Rhode Island, that Perkins funding cut would mean a cut of more than $800,000. If enacted, the President’s budget would not only slash a crucial investment in our students, but it would deeply hurt businesses. If we want businesses to come back to the country from overseas, if we want to relocate those jobs here, we need to make sure that we have the workforce that can actually do the jobs that would be available and that are, in fact, available right now. This is the time to invest in workforce development, not undermine it. Demand for CTE is growing from students and industry, and our economy desperately needs it. Madam Speaker, in closing, let me just say that I encourage my colleagues to prioritize CTE. It matters for your constituents, and it yields big returns for our States’ economies and for our Nation’s economy as a whole. Put simply, providing workers with the skills necessary to thrive in the economy is essential to our economic prosperity. It is the right thing to do, giving our workers the skills they need for jobs that pay. Mr. SMUCKER. Madam Speaker, I thank Representative LANGEVIN . His points are very good. We appreciate his leadership as cochair of the CTE Caucus and for the work that he has done in bringing this bill to the point where it is now. He is right. It was passed unanimously out of the Education and the Workforce Committee. We thank the chair of the committee for making that a priority. We hope it passes the floor of the House—it did, of course, last session—and then we hope it becomes a priority for the Senate as well. It is important. He has mentioned some of the schools, the institutions, in his district. I have talked about some in mine. I have heard from all of them. Not only have they given input into the bill itself and how we can improve the entire system across the country, but they have also talked about the importance of the grants that are provided to them through the Perkins Act. Reauthorization will be very beneficial in keeping those grants going, in providing the help that we can from the Federal level. So I thank him. Madam Speaker, as I conclude with my remarks, I would first, again, like to thank all of my colleagues who have participated in this bipartisan Special Order. It is really, as we have seen, a bipartisan issue here. I thank Congressman KRISHNAMOORTHI for helping to colead this and for cosponsoring the bill, along with Congressman THOMPSON . In my own background, I was someone with a nontraditional education. I recognize the importance of providing our constituents with educational pathways that provide them the skills necessary to launch successful careers. In my experience, I know firsthand what it is like to work a fulltime job while attending school, and I believe that it is important that we accommodate the needs of many different types of students that are ready to learn and willing to work. So, again, I am excited and very happy to cosponsor and support the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act. This bill empowers State and local community leaders. It improves alignment with indemand jobs, those jobs that we have been talking about. It increases transparency and accountability, and it ensures a limited Federal role, putting the decisionmaking where it should be. Madam Speaker, I mentioned before, but, in closing, I thank my Pennsylvania colleague, Representative G.T. THOMPSON , for his leadership on this critically important legislation. The level of support for strengthening career and technical education among my colleagues in the House and on a bipartisan basis is absolutely outstanding, and I am very eager to continue finding new ways in which we can grow CTE and apprenticeship programs and expand access for Pennsylvania’s working people to allow them to help achieve the American Dream. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
PROGRESSIVE CAUCUS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I am delighted to be here on behalf of the Progressive Caucus. This is our Special Order hour. We have decided to devote our remarks this evening to the testimony of former FBI Director Comey, who testified in the U.S. Senate today. 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Maryland? There was no objection. Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, today, America watched former FBI Director Comey offer his testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. It was a dramatic and serious moment in the history of our country and in the unfolding of the crisis related to the investigation of Russia’s involvement in the U.S. election and then the firing of General Flynn by President Trump. b1745 This was the first time that Director Comey spoke publicly about his firing by President Trump and the investigation since he left the FBI, and his testimony confirmed much of what has been reported about the matter. Now, what any reasonableminded observer would have to conclude after watching the testimony today, after reading Mr. Comey’s testimony, is that President Trump was trying mightily to use his office and his influence to get Director Comey to drop the investigation of General Flynn, his former National Security Advisor. Indeed, President Trump as much as said so when he said that he had fired Director Comey because he was unhappy about the Russian investigation and, presumably, the Russian investigation into General Flynn. Now, Madam Speaker, distinguished colleagues, look how far we have come over the last several months. The President of the United States hired a National Security Advisor after being warned not to by the former President of the United States, by thenPresident Obama. That National Security Advisor lasted a total of 24 days in office, when it was determined that he had lied to Vice President PENCE about his dealings with Russia. And then later we learned that he was a registered foreign agent, or he registered retroactively as a foreign agent, an agent for a foreign government. Now, think how dramatic this sequence of events is. Imagine, if you will, if President Barack Obama had met with Attorney General Eric Holder and Vice President Joe Biden and FBI Director Comey in his office and then asked Vice President Biden and Attorney General Holder to leave his office, saying that he wanted to speak alone to the FBI Director, and then proceeded, essentially, to tell FBI Director Comey that he wanted him to drop the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails, saying, you know, ‘‘Hillary Clinton’s a good woman. She’s a good person, and I hope you can just let the investigation into her emails go. Just let it go,’’ and to demand repeatedly for absolute personal loyalty. Now, as it happened, Director Comey refused to take a vow of absolute loyalty to the President. After all, he takes an oath of office to the Constitution of the United States and the people of the country, so he couldn’t say that he would give absolute loyalty to the President of the United States. That is not consistent with our constitutional form of government. But imagine that this had happened under the Obama administration. Obama had made a similar demand of FBI Director Comey who was investigating, after all, Hillary Clinton’s emails, had dismissed the Vice President and the Attorney General to have a oneonone conversation, and then said, ‘‘I really hope that you let this go,’’ using the full trappings of his office and his influence to try to get the FBI Director to drop the investigation. 
If that happened, I dare say that every Member of this body, every Member would have recognized that as an attempt to obstruct justice by the President of the United States, and lots of Members certainly would have been calling for impeachment of President Obama for interfering with an ongoing investigation by the FBI. Well, what is happening now in Congress? Well, lots of our colleagues are murmuring a defense of President Trump saying: Well, it doesn’t look good and maybe he shouldn’t have done it, but he is new to government. Trump is new to Washington. He is not schooled in the ways of Washington, it is being said. He is actually a breath of fresh air that he doesn’t know how Washington operates. I think that that completely confuses the question. Dear colleagues, Madam Speaker, the law against obstruction of justice in the United States, which is a felony criminal offense, 18 U.S.C. 1503, applies against experienced government officials and inexperienced government officials. It applies to all citizens of the United States. It applies to people who have worked in Washington their whole life and people who have worked in Washington for several months. In fact, it applies to people across the country. It is not a law that applies just in the District of Columbia. It applies in New York. It applies in MaraLago. It applies in California. It applies everywhere. No American citizen can interfere with the due administration of justice, whether it is trying to persuade a juror to do a certain thing, whether it is trying to influence a judge in a particular case, or whether it is trying to get a prosecutor to drop an investigation into a particular person or into an entire subject matter. No one has the right to interfere with the due administration of justice in America. That is both a criminal statutory principle in 18 U.S. Code. It is also a constitutional principle, which is well recognized because democracy, our constitutional democracy, depends upon the rule of law; and there is no rule of law if there is no evenhandedness and no impartiality in the administration of justice. No one has the right to interfere with justice. Now what should be done about this? Nobody quite knows what to do at this point. We do have a special counsel, Mr. Mueller, who has been appointed, and that is good, but what he is looking for is counterintelligence information, and he is looking for possible criminal activity. But if we take a step back, what is all of this really about? I was very pleased that former Director Comey talked about this in his testimony today. What this is about was a concerted, deliberate, comprehensive effort, orchestrated from the very top of the Russian Government, to interfere with the U.S. election. That is something now that former FBI Director Comey has spoken about publicly, and it is something that 18 of our intelligence agencies have reported to Congress and the American people in a public report with a high degree of certainty that there was an orchestrated campaign to undermine and subvert our campaign, starting at the highest levels of the Russian Government. That took place, okay? So the criminal or counterintelligence investigation doesn’t go to the question that has got to concern us in Congress, which is the threat to our democratic form of government. As FBI Director Comey restated today, 2016 could just be a dress rehearsal for what is coming at us in 2018 and 2020. The intelligence agencies said that they would try to do it again. Russia is no match for the military might of the United States of America. Russia is no match for the economic might of the United States of America. Russia’s autocratic, kleptocratic, dictatorialstyle government is no match for the constitutional democracy that we have built up in the United States of America. But the Russians have figured out a way to use the internet to try to penetrate the democracies of the world on the cheap. It is not that expensive to have paid trolls to orchestrate fake news and propaganda and to try to distort the electoral process in the United States of America—or in the Netherlands, or in France, or in other countries around the world. Now, we don’t have all of the facts. That is why what we need is an independent, outside investigation by a commission that we set up outside of Congress—no Democratic Members of Congress, no Republican Members of Congress, no elected officials. What we will put on there are statesmen and stateswomen who are experienced in questions of democracy and foreign policy, who are trusted, and we will ask them to give us the kind of report that the 9/11 Commission gave to us but about what happened in the 2016 election and how do we prepare to stop it from happening again to us in the future. Now, notice that you can support this, and I think you should support this, whether or not there was any collusion by anybody within the Trump administration. You can be completely convinced that there was collusion between particular members of the Trump administration or Trump campaign and Russia or you could be completely convinced that there was no collusion at all, that they knew nothing about those efforts. It doesn’t make any difference. There was still a massive assault on American democracy, and we have got to respond to it. That is why I think the pathway forward for us now is for both sides in Congress, both parties, to come together and to act in a patriotic way, not in a partisan way, to say let’s create an objective, disinterested, outside commission to get to the bottom of what happened to us in this election. And we will let, for the time being, the Department of Justice and Special Counselor Mueller deal with the question of criminal culpability and criminal deeds, but that is of less importance, in truth, than the integrity of our political institution and the future of American democracy. There is the question which remains unresolved and, at this point, still relatively untouched, about what is so special about Michael Flynn. We have a President who is unafraid to offend anybody. He told our best allies in the world in NATO that NATO is obsolete. I think he has changed course on that, but he was very willing to basically wave off the importance of NATO. He was willing to tell one of our biggest trade partners in the world, Mexico, that he was going to force them to build a wall on the border, force them to pay for it. And again, I think he seems to have backtracked from that. I don’t know where he stands on that now. He was willing to insult and affront the Government of Australia, which has been a great ally of America. He had a TV show called ‘‘You’re Fired,’’ so he is not afraid of offending people, and we see him offend people all of the time and pick fights with people all of the time. He picked a fight with Meryl Streep. He is willing to tweet at anybody. But suddenly, with Michael Flynn, this disgraced National Security Advisor whom he fired, President Trump goes to great lengths to try to interfere in an ongoing investigation which I think everybody can recognize is obstruction or attempted an obstruction of justice. He interferes with the FBI Director in a really astonishing and unprecedented way to try to get Flynn carved out of the investigation. Why? What does Flynn know? What is the nature of their relationship such that the President goes to such extraordinary lengths to carve him out from the investigation? That is something that we are going to need to get to the bottom of because democracies operate on the truth. Truth is built into our system. That is why we have judges and we have juries. That is why we have due process. That is why we have congressional oversight over the President of the United States. That is why all of us in public service swear an oath to the Constitution. The truth means something in a democracy, so we are going to have to get to the bottom of that. But, in the meantime, Congress can act effectively and in a unified way. And I was encouraged by what both Republican and Democratic Senators on the Senate committee today were saying, which is that everybody agreed, or at least a lot of them agreed, that there had been this unacceptable assault on the electoral institution of our political democracy in 2016, and we have got to prevent it from happening again. 
We need to have a bipartisan, or nonpartisan, independent commission outside of Congress to study exactly what happened and to report back to us about what we need to do to build up our defenses so our democracy is as strong as our economy and as our military. So our democratic institutions need to be fortified against subversion, against hacking, against cyber propaganda and fake news and so on. Madam Speaker, I am going to call up and invite the very distinguished Congresswoman from Seattle, Washington, PRAMILA JAYAPAL , who has been a terrific leader for human rights and for democracy in the U.S. House of Representatives since her arrival in January. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
b1800 FORMER FBI DIRECTOR COMEY’S TESTIMONY The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. HOLLINGSWORTH ). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. JAYAPAL ) is recognized for the remainder of the hour as the designee of the minority leader. Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative RASKIN for his leadership in the House. It has been a great honor to cochair the CPC Special Order hour here every week on the floor. Since I have just been elected the first vice chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, I, unfortunately, won’t be continuing to do that. But I am still going to be right here for these Special Order hours, because I do think that they are an important opportunity for Members to talk about issues all at once, and to kind of pick an issue, and then to focus on it. Obviously, today, we are talking about the testimony from former FBI Director James Comey. This was highly anticipated testimony, and I would be willing to guess that a lot more people, perhaps, even watched the testimony than watched the inauguration. But I think we learned a great deal from former Director Comey. I appreciate that he was willing to come and testify, and he said some very important things. In that testimony, Mr. Comey confirmed that President Trump sought to influence the FBI investigation into his campaign’s ties to Russia, including that of Michael Flynn. While the President had claimed that he did not ask former Director Comey to drop the investigation, Mr. Comey actually testified under oath that Trump’s directive was clear, and that this was apparently so offputting that he began to memorialize their meetings. Every single meeting he had with President Trump, he would have the meeting and then go back to the car and immediately take notes on the meeting, and that is troubling. That was something that former Director Comey never did with previous administrations. And one of the things that stuck out to me in his testimony is that he had actually asked—he felt so uncomfortable with the interactions that he was having with the President, because I think the American people need to understand, the FBI is built to be an independent organization. The reason that the term of the FBI Director is 10 years is because it was a signal from Congress that even though the FBI Director does serve at the pleasure of the President—and Mr. Comey was clear about that in his testimony today—the President has the ability to hire and fire the FBI Director. But the reason Congress signaled through legislation that the term of the FBI Director should be 10 years was because they wanted to send a signal that this body is incredibly important, and the independence of this body is incredibly important. The fact that Mr. Comey, as FBI Director, felt so uncomfortable about these interactions with the President— nine interactions with the President. I think he had only two interactions with President Obama during his entire term, and yet, in just the first few months, he had nine interactions with President Trump. He actually asked Attorney General Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein not to leave him alone with the President. That is really a remarkable, scary thing that he would have to ask for that, and it certainly should have raised some red flags and should have triggered some action from the Attorney General, or the Deputy Attorney General. It did not. He never received an answer to that. Mr. Comey also said that he expects the special counsel’s investigation to look into the possibility that Trump’s actions were an obstruction of justice. He said that this did fall within the investigation scope. So while he didn’t directly say that Trump was directly under investigation, he did say that the President’s behavior does fall within the investigation’s scope. That, frankly, does nothing to dispel any concerns that are out there amongst the American people, and many of us in Congress, that President Trump’s campaign did not collude with Russia. Apparently, he did not seem particularly concerned about whether or not Russia did interfere in the elections but was more interested in whether or not his circle of friends, Michael Flynn, was under threat. Former Director Comey also confirmed that Michael Flynn is under criminal investigation, and he raised more questions about Attorney General Jeff Sessions. As I have spoken about on the floor before, Attorney General Sessions should not have been involved in the firing of James Comey in the first place. He had recused himself from all things related to the investigation into the campaign’s ties to Russia because of his involvement with the Trump campaign, and so that was good. We thought that was a very good move that he made to recuse himself, but then he immediately went and was directly involved in the decisionmaking around the person who was leading the investigation, in fact, involved in the decision to fire the person who was leading the investigation. Mr. Comey also hinted that Jeff Sessions had more contact with the Russians than maybe we even knew about. He could not speak to that in a public setting. He said that is for a classified setting, but, obviously, that raises a lot more questions, and the American people certainly deserve the truth. One of the biggest takeaways from the testimony was this: President Trump gave many changing reasons as to why former Director Comey was fired. And former Director Comey spoke to this today. He said, at first, it was because it was the handling—it was because of Comey’s handling of the Clinton emails. Then it was that he had lost the support of the FBI agents, something that James Comey responded to, and said: ‘‘Those were lies, plain and simple.’’ Actually, Mr. Comey spent quite some time really acknowledging the work of the organization, the FBI organization, and the agents, and everything that he has done. I certainly got the impression that he felt very deeply upset by any indication that perhaps it was because his agents didn’t want him to be there. What Mr. Comey pointed to is that eventually the President, in his own words, admitted that he fired James Comey over the Russian investigation, and then, right after that, actually said to the Russians that the pressure has now been taken off now that Comey has been fired. Those are all incredibly disturbing. And I am sad, Mr. Speaker, that the Republicans—some Republican colleagues, not all, but some—have tried to dismiss the President’s actions as ‘‘mistakes made by a new President who is learning how to do his job.’’ Speaker PAULRYAN went so far as to say: ‘‘He is new at government. Therefore, I think he is learning as he goes.’’ This is just 1 day after the Speaker said that it is obviously—that was his word—not appropriate for the President to ask for Mr. Comey’s loyalty. So which one is it, Mr. Speaker? It is unacceptable to excuse the President’s actions simply because he is not a career professional, especially when we are talking about something of this magnitude—the magnitude of interference in our election process in the United States of America by a foreign government. We do not have any information still about all of the ways in which a President of the United States, this President of the United States, may be indebted to some foreign government because of their actions with the election. 
It has been repeatedly reported that the President does not sit for briefings, does not read the reports that are provided to him, does not stick to speeches on policies that are written for him, and, frankly, shows very little interest in participating in the administrative responsibilities that most Presidents go through in order to learn what is a very big job. Yes, the job of the President of the United States is a very big job, and anybody who gets into that job, just as I do in this body as a new Member of Congress, we try to learn the rules. We go to the people who know the most. We ask them to give us briefings. We suck up as much information as we possibly can so that we understand both content and process. But, unfortunately, this President has not done any of that, and he has made many unforced errors. Frankly, he has put our national security at risk by giving secrets away to Russia, insulting key allies who have now said that they won’t share information with us because they don’t trust that we are going to be able to keep it secret. NATO and our allies in the European Union, where I just came back from, everybody around the world is unsure of what leadership, if any, to expect from the United States of America. Angela Merkel said it the best when she said: We can’t rely on anybody else anymore. And she said: We, as a European Union, have to just come together and rely on ourselves. And while that is great for the European Union, I am glad that there is something that has happened here that has drawn the European Union together. It is an incredibly important entity for the world and has been doing remarkable work. But what I would hope, Mr. Speaker, is that countries around the world know that the United States is going to continue to take global leadership, is going to continue to demonstrate that global leadership, and, most of all, is going to be trusted to make relationships and respect the rules of those relationships. The American people are aware that the President’s background is not in politics. However, the White House is not ‘‘The Apprentice.’’ Had a new employee in The Trump Organization made as many errors as have been made in this administration, he would have been fired a long time ago. The American people deserve better. And not only do we demand that the President not intervene in any negative way in Director Mueller’s investigation—and we are very pleased that Director Mueller has been appointed. I believe that was an incredibly important step that Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein took to appoint somebody with the credibility that Mueller has—but we hope that this investigation will continue, because I think it is important for the American people to understand that this is not an independent investigator, or prosecutor. This is special counsel. So that still means that anything that Director Mueller finds in his findings, his reports, they do get run up the chain of command at the Department of Justice. So if you watched yesterday’s Senate Intelligence Committee hearings, you might have seen Senator KAMALA HARRIS discuss this and ask Rod Rosenstein if he could assure that there really would be independence, that neither Rosenstein nor Jeff Sessions would get involved in trying to change or influence, in any way, whatever Director Mueller comes up with. She was not given that assurance yesterday, unfortunately, and so we still don’t know. But we have to hope and believe that the President and this administration will preserve the independence of the special counsel and will take all of the findings and the recommendations as to what they are presented and not try to change them. I really believe, Mr. Speaker, at this point, that while the special counsel is an important step forward, I join my colleague Mr. RASKIN and many others in this caucus, in our Democratic Caucus, in calling for a special commission, an independent commission, similar to the 9/11 Commission, filled with citizens—not with Members of Congress but with respected citizens—and people with expertise, as well as those citizens, to actually come together and think not only about the immediate impact of how we get to the bottom of what has happened, but, really, how do we prevent this going forward? What we are talking about is the sanctity of our democracy; we are talking about whether our elections can be free of influence from other countries; we are talking about if an American citizen casts a vote here in the United States for the President of the United States, that that vote is not being influenced by a foreign government who has hacked our elections, or worked in collusion with a campaign for the President of the United States; and that ultimately, whoever we select, whether it is this President or any President in the future, that that President must be responsible to the American people. That is what democracy is about. We don’t want any President, now or in the future, to ever be in a situation where there is information that can be used against them, where they could be blackmailed, leveraged, or where they are actively colluding with any government outside of this country. These are our elections. It is what makes this country great. It is why so many people from all around the world look at America with tremendous gratitude, with tremendous respect, even awe for the way in which we have constructed our democracy. That is part of what goes on in this Chamber, and we need to know that the election of the President of this great country is always an election that the American people have faith in, and that democracy is preserved. Mr. Speaker, I think what James Comey’s testimony showed us today is, we got a lot of answers, but we didn’t get enough answers. There is still more information that we need to find. There is more information that the Senate Intelligence Committee needs to find. There is more information that the President may have to provide, and there is more information that the American people are going to demand in order to ensure that we get to the bottom of where we are, that we get an independent commission established, and that we allow Director Mueller, in his investigation, to proceed without any interference. That is the least that we have to be willing to do, and we have to be willing to put country above party as we try to ensure that we understand exactly what has happened. The American people deserve that. Mr. Speaker, I yield back. f 
b1815 FORMER FBI DIRECTOR COMEY’S SENATE TESTIMONY The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT ) for 30 minutes. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, it is indeed an honor to come before and stand before the Speaker and stand on this floor where so much great debate has occurred over the decades, even back to 150 years ago. Now, I have been heard to say over the last few days a number of times that I thought the Comey testimony was ultimately the most overhyped event since Y2K, much ado about nothing, but one thing came through very, very, very clearly. I didn’t watch the testimony. I was busy presiding over a hearing involving the Justice Department and grants to local communities and how that money is being spent, but I have gone back and been reviewing the testimony. The thing that strikes me most clearly is that our President, Donald J. Trump, is one of the most perceptive, intuitive leaders this country has ever had. He wasn’t sure, apparently, if he could trust Comey. Now, we have heard from a lot of other people in the administration, some still there, some not. This issue about the President’s concern for loyalty with Comey indicates our President’s gut instinct was right on. He was dealing with an FBI Director who was such a political animal that he would listen to the Attorney General of the United States and instruct him to change his testimony to—I would submit, when you know it is an investigation that you are engaged in, looking at the emails and the potential criminality of Hillary Clinton, and your boss, the Attorney General, said: No, no, no—obviously it is an investigation—call it a matter. Nobody calls the FBI investigations matters. So he has no problem changing his statement from the truth to political manipulation to cover for Hillary Clinton and to immediately do 
what his boss tells him to do: Lie about it. You know it is an investigation and I know it is an investigation, but we need you to lie about it. Just call it a matter. I have dealt with some of the finest people I have known in my life that happened to work for the FBI at the time we were working together. I worked with them, and I have never, ever in any Federal court setting or Federal investigation setting heard any FBI agent in charge—field agent, leader in the FBI, the Justice Department—call an investigation a matter. But Mr. Comey is such a political animal that he was willing to salute not the flag, but Hillary Clinton and Loretta Lynch and change what he knew to be the truth so that his answer was more misleading. So it is really interesting. Comey used the word, or said that Trump used the word, hoped that he would let it go. Let’s visit the Constitution briefly here. The Constitution does not mention an Attorney General. The Constitution does not mention the Federal Bureau of Investigation and does not mention a Federal Bureau of Investigation Director. It mentions Congress, it mentions the courts, and it mentions the executive branch, the President. It doesn’t mention FBI Director, Attorney General. It is the President, under our Constitution, who is charged with seeing to the prosecution or the failure to prosecute as he believes is appropriate. So, of course, somebody had to have been committing crimes in the Fast and Furious project, whatever you want to call it. I am not sure what it was. It sure appeared to be a criminal enterprise with people involved from DOJ conspiring to make sure that weapons got into the hands of criminals, which, in and of itself, was a crime. We also know that by the Department of Justice’s representatives getting involved during the Obama administration as part of this Fast and Furious effort, they called it, guns got into the hands of criminals, and Brian Terry was killed, a Federal agent doing his job. There is no indication that if the Department of Justice had not forced those guns to be sold and to get into the hands of criminals that Brian Terry would not be dead. If the Department of Justice had not forced this issue, forced guns into criminals’ hands, we may very well have been hearing Brian Terry testify a number of times instead of pointing back toward his murder at the hands of criminals who our Department of Justice representatives under Eric Holder got guns to. It might have been good to have a special counsel in the Fast and Furious investigation—or, as Loretta Lynch and Mr. Comey liked to use to deceive people, matter, Fast and Furious matter—because the truth is they didn’t do much of an investigation. We saw emails indicating that there was an effort to try to use getting those guns into the hands of criminals, drug cartels, as an excuse to take away lawabiding Americans’ Second Amendment rights and continue to pursue that effort. We also know that the IRS had people who were working to prevent conservatives from having an effect in the 2012 election the way they did in 2010. As the movement was growing, the Obama administration used the IRS as a political weapon to disarm those who would bring together funds and try to defeat President Obama in a second term. That certainly deserved a special counsel since all we seemed to get in our investigations from Congress’ angle was a coverup. It harkens us back to the Clinton administration when this tactic was discovered by people within the Clinton administration: Just cover things up. Just deny, obfuscate, and refuse to allow people to see the documentation. Destroy it after somebody dies. Get the records out of their office before anyone else has a chance to properly investigate what happened. Somebody is alleged to have killed themselves at Fort Marcy Park. Then as I heard from my friend Dan Burton, they were questioning the person that supposedly found the body out there: Well, that is not where it was. That is not where the gun was. Everything appears to be changed. Well, the Clinton administration discovered this wonderful tactic of obfuscating: just keep denying and denying the ability to get information and records, and if you do it long enough, you run out the clock and people don’t get prosecuted. We have seen that occur for 8 years. There were very, very serious matters in which somebody committed crimes. We didn’t get a special investigator. We didn’t get a proper investigation. We got a stonewall protecting those who must have done wrong. I am hoping the current Attorney General will dig and people that are responsible for crimes will be held to account. But the fact is it is the President’s obligation under the Constitution to either pursue people or not pursue people. That is why, even though many of us were extremely upset that President Obama kept pardoning people who were convicted felons, and as much as it upset us that he, in a literal sense, not only obstructed justice, he destroyed it, unfortunately, the President has authority to demand people not be prosecuted. So we heard new priorities around the country when President Obama took office. He didn’t want his Justice Department spending a lot of time on enforcing drug laws. It turns out they hardly ever prosecuted. Compared to other administrations, they hardly ever prosecuted criminal gun violations—far fewer than past administrations—because what they wanted to do was allow the gun crimes to continue to ratchet out of control and then use that to demand more gun control when they weren’t even using the laws that were in effect. Instead of enforcing the laws in effect, they continued to demand more gun control. Just enforce what we had. Most all the crimes that were brought up during that period were crimes already without any other gun control laws needing to be passed and signed into law. Just enforce what we have. But that wasn’t happening. Nobody stood up and said President Obama should be prosecuted for obstruction of justice, because as distasteful as it was to me and so many others, the President has a right to set priorities as to what his prosecutors will pursue and what will be left alone. So it is interesting on the Flynn matter. President Trump had every right to say: Look, I am giving a pardon, a pass, to this person and to that person. Let’s move on. I hope you will find something else to do. Trump didn’t even do that. President Trump said he hoped, an aspiration, but there was no obstruction of justice. How do we know that? Because we have found, through the testimony of former Director Comey, an incredibly innate ability to see everything through a political lens instead of a lawandorder lens. That is why he could have one Attorney General telling him, ‘‘Change what you are going to say so it deceives the public,’’ and that is not a problem, we don’t do a memo about that, but another President indicates: He is concerned about my loyalty and he brings it up, so I better do memos so that I can take him down later because he doesn’t trust me. b1830 Well, for good reason. The loyalty was to Loretta Lynch, the loyalty was to Hillary Clinton, the loyalty was to Barack Obama. And Trump, what an incredible innate ability. He knew Comey was not a loyal, lawandorder man. He would twist the truth, as he was directed by someone else, but he would also twist an untruth through, hurting the current President. It appears President Donald J. Trump was exactly right in firing Comey. We didn’t need to continue to have a politically astute diplomat wannabe running our FBI. We needed somebody that was law and order, no matter what. Alan Dershowitz is a staunch Democrat, but through the years and with the things I disagreed with him on, I know he is a smart man. Here are some of the things he tweeted out: ‘‘Comey says he understood word ‘hope’ to be a direction. If so, why didn’t he tell the President that such a direction would be violation of DOJ rules?’’ Well, here, again, the fact is, if Directoratthetime Comey believed there was any effort to obstruct justice, then he was committing a crime, a felony, by not reporting it. I was surprised that he went as far as he did today—because he did—by pushing as hard as he did on this idea that 
saying ‘‘hope’’ might have been a direction. The more he pushed that, the more he exposed himself to prosecution for a felony because he didn’t report it. But the truth is, even though he wrongly believed that there was something—a violation of law or obstruction—it wasn’t. If he honestly believed that, he had to report it, and he didn’t. Oh, yeah, he did a memo. I wonder if we would have ever seen that memo if he had not been fired. I can guarantee if he had not been fired, from what we have now learned today, you can count on the fact that he, as Director of the FBI, would make memos any time it might help him harm President Donald Trump, but he would continue not to do memos when somebody, a Democrat, told him to mislead the public. Alan Dershowitz said: If President commits independent crimes, for example, Nixon telling the staff to lie to the FBI, that is a crime. You can’t tell somebody to commit a crime, even if you are President. Alan Dershowitz said: Paying dollars to silence witnesses is a crime. You can’t commit a crime or tell somebody to commit a crime even though you are President. That is obstruction. You should be prosecuted. Mr. Dershowitz said: ‘‘Comey confirmed my view that, under the Constitution, the President would have the authority to order FBI Director to stop investigating Flynn.’’ He would. Just as Barack Obama says: I pardon you, I am taking away the justice that has been done in your case. I am obstructing justice. In pardon after pardon, he obstructed justice. But when a President does it, as Obama did being President Obama, it was not a crime when he pardoned people. Now, if you have a President that has somebody rich, whether that is their name or just their monetary status, and they give you a bunch of their richness and you pardon them, then you may have sold part of your office, which could very well be a crime, and probably is. But in the case of President Obama, there is no indication anybody paid him to pardon people. If nobody paid him, he just did it because he thought it was a good idea to have people involved with drugs out on the street again, or people at Guantanamo Bay back killing Americans. If he thinks that is a good idea, then he can legally obstruct justice, which President Obama legally did time and time again. Alan Dershowitz also says, talking about Comey: ‘‘He confirmed that the President can order anyone to be investigated or not be investigated.’’ Dershowitz also said: ‘‘Comey stated the constitutional principle: President has authority to direct FBI to end a criminal investigation. Can also pardon anyone, ending investigation.’’ There is somebody on the internet that goes by the pseudonym ‘‘Ace of Spades.’’ This guy has a wicked wit. Ace of Spades sent out this tweet as if he is quoting Comey. These are Ace of Spades’ words—an interpretation of the testimony today—he says, Comey: Loretta Lynch told me to lie and I didn’t write that down, but I wrote down Trump’s stuff because I was afraid he would lie. Wow. It has got the networks all stirred up that former FBI Director Comey came in today and actually exposed the disloyalty to the President of the United States, to the Constitution, to the things he swore to uphold and protect. Let’s look at one other thing I hadn’t heard anybody else mention. When you have an attorney as the FBI Director and he is talking to the President of the United States, there is a privilege involved there. Even the least modicum of loyalty and honor and integrity would cause someone who is taking an oath as an attorney, someone who has taken an oath as Director of the FBI, someone that knows their boss is the President and that all power is in the President for the executive branch and the FBI Director entirely gets his power from the President, it would be some smidgeon of honor to want to protect those private conversations. As far as we know, they weren’t classified, but it is something called privilege, it is something called loyalty, and it is something called honor. The testimony we heard today was the former FBI Director saying: When it came to President Trump, I wasn’t going to honor our privileged conversations. I wasn’t going to honor the executive privilege. I wasn’t going to honor the fact that my power as FBI Director and the authority to investigate someone or not investigate someone is derived entirely from the President of the United States. I will honor a person that tells me to misrepresent the truth, but I am not going to honor someone who is concerned about fairness. Even though the FBI Director knows better than most anyone else there is no evidence of collusion between the Russians and Donald Trump, there is no evidence of collusion with anybody in the Trump administration at this time, yet there was no sense of loyalty there. Think of Shakespeare’s words and the sarcasm of Marc Antony. Brutus says he is an honorable man. They are all honorable men. These are honorable people who told me to misrepresent the truth to the American people and to the press. These are people that love me because I leak things. I was hoping for one question that I should have contacted one of my Senator friends and told them to ask, because I would like to know the truth. I know that my Democratic friends were so furious, just livid at Comey when, just days before the election, he announces he is reopening the investigation. The rumor around here was that there were FBI agents who had been investigating and they knew that Hillary Clinton had violated the law all kinds of ways. Intent was not an issue. She had taken classified material into an unclassified computer and sent it to unclassified computers. Comey said: Clean bill of health. Everything is good. And they knew it wasn’t good. So when they saw this was the rumor floating around, I would like to know the truth. You know some FBI agents had to have found Anthony Weiner’s computer and found tens of thousands of emails that we were told had been destroyed. Oh, we can’t get those tens of thousands of emails. They are gone. And then they found them. Not only were they not in a classified area, not in a SCIF, not in a classified connection, laptop, not even in a government employee’s laptop. They were on the laptop of someone who had shown the worst judgment in the world. You want to talk about the potential for blackmailing—although, probably by this time, I don’t know what you would have to come up with to blackmail him, because it is pretty well all out there. Nonetheless, all of these emails were found that were supposed to be gone. There is absolutely no question that some of them came to Hillary Clinton, were sent to an unclassified setting, and now, not only that, they are in the hands of Anthony Weiner, who has had his own criminal justice issues. The rumor continued that we had such honorable FBI agents that they said, in essence: Mr. Director, clearly, this is criminal material and evidence. If you don’t announce you are reopening the investigation, we are going to resign, have a press conference, and show the world that you have been covering for Hillary Clinton the whole time. Now, that was the rumor. If that were true, and, under those type circumstances, Director Comey then rushes out just days before the election and said, I am reopening the investigation because we found these emails, then that would make sense. He certainly would want FBI agents to completely destroy any election chances just days before the election of Hillary Clinton. If Director Comey went out and said: I am reopening the investigation, even though Republicans were rejoicing and Democrats were livid, as I pointed out to someone back at the time in the media, I guess it could hurt Hillary Clinton. But if Director Comey comes out a day or two before the election and says there is nothing here, clean bill of health, Hillary Clinton is great, no problems, when we knew he didn’t have time, nobody had time to adequately review the tens of thousands of emails, you could run a few algorithms. Real law enforcement means looking at the evidence line by line—I have known people who did it; I have done it in a civil setting—until you find the smoking gun. But you have got to go 
through the monotony of reviewing each of those. b1845 They had no time to do that, and yet former Director Comey came out, clean bill of health. It could not have been discerned in that amount of time like that. So it appeared pretty clearly the reason he said we are reopening the case was so he could say we closed it, to eliminate any chance of even a non FBI person who comes forward and says, you know, there are classified emails that ended up on Anthony Weiner’s computer that came from Hillary Clinton, to Huma, and to Weiner. There were crimes here, and the FBI Director is covering for him. That would likely have brought down Hillary Clinton much worse than the defeat she suffered. So it is just interesting, but, Mr. Speaker, the irony with which former Director Comey’s testimony drips this evening is that our President, Donald J. Trump, he has got good gut instincts. He had concerns that former Director Comey was disloyal, was manipulative, that he may be someone that the United States Government should not trust, and it turns out President Trump’s gut instincts were exactly right. He committed no crime. That has become clear. And so now we expect we will see the media and my friends on the other side of the aisle quit talking about Russia—there is nothing there, there has been nothing there—unless we start looking at potential prosecution for taking millions and millions of dollars from owners of Uranium One, who gave those to the Clinton Foundation, which then again ended up benefiting the Clinton family, and Hillary Clinton then approves Russia getting around 25 percent of our uranium production, to the potential detriment and, possibly in future altercations, death of Americans at the hands of the uranium that Hillary Clinton profited from potentially mightily, even if it wasn’t directly, and yet America suffered. Look, it is time to talk about real crimes, investigate real crimes, investigate racketeer influence of corrupt organizations that would pay for people to commit violence at Trump events. Now we are talking. America deserves better, and thank God we are going to have a new FBI Director. Former Director Comey did some good things while at the FBI, but, unfortunately, we saw the extent that politics tainted the Director today. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
