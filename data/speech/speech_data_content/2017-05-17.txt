Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, the House of Representatives is a separate and coequal branch of government. We don’t work for Donald Trump; we work for the people of this great Nation. The events of the last few months have been deeply troubling. I am trying to figure out when will my colleagues on the other side of the aisle decide that it is time to do your jobs and hold the White House accountable for its actions. When will you do your job? Seventeen different intelligence agencies concluded that Russia interfered with our election for the purpose of helping to elect Donald Trump, but that was not enough. Highlevel Trump allies such as Carter Page, his foreign policy adviser; Michael Flynn, his first National Security Advisor; Jeff Sessions, his Attorney General; Paul Manafort, his campaign chairman; Michael Cohen, his personal attorney; Roger Stone, his longtime political confidant; Jared Kushner, his senior adviser and soninlaw—top Trump allies were having communications with the Russians at the same time that they were hacking into our election. But apparently, that was not enough. b1015 Michael Flynn, the first National Security Advisor, was demonstrated to have had an illegal conversation with the Russian Ambassador in December of 2016. He then lied about it to the Vice President, who then delivered misleading information to the American people. But guess what. For my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, that was not enough. The Attorney General testified under oath before Congress, and he said he had no communications with the Russians during the campaign. It was subsequently proven that he communicated with them twice at the Republican National Convention and then a few months later in his office. He either lied under oath, committed perjury, or delivered misleading information to Congress, which would be a misdemeanor. Either way, he likely committed a crime. Silence from the other side. Apparently that was not enough. 
Donald Trump refuses to release his tax returns, unlike every other President since Gerald Ford, Republicans and Democrats. What is the President hiding? We can’t figure it out. And apparently for the other side, that is not enough. The Deputy Attorney General, Sally Yates, was fired by the President shortly after she went to the White House and revealed her suspicion that Michael Flynn may be a Russian asset. But apparently that was not enough. The President fired Preet Bharara, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, shortly after it was publically revealed that his office was investigating one of Trump’s Cabinet Secretaries and close allies at FOX News. But for my Republican colleagues on the other side of the aisle, that was not enough. The former FBI Director revealed that the Trump campaign was under criminal investigation for possible collusion with the Russians. But for my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, even that was not enough. Then the President fires the FBI Director who is leading the investigation into his campaign after it appears he urged the FBI Director to drop the case against his buddy Michael Flynn. But even for my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, that is not enough. Mr. Speaker, there is a cloud of corruption hanging over 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. We are in the midst of a constitutional crisis. It is time for the Speaker to get his head out of the sand. It is time for House Republicans to do the right thing. Support our demand for a special prosecutor. Support our legislation for an independent commission. It is time for House Republicans to put their country ahead of their party. 
SAUK RAPIDS’ CITIZEN OF THE YEAR, JODI SPEICHER The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. EMMER ) for 5 minutes. Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Sauk Rapids’ Citizen of the Year, Jodi Speicher. The Sauk Rapids Chamber of Commerce started this award in 1986 to recognize individuals who have influenced the community for the better. Jodi, a resident of Sauk Rapids over the past 15 years, is known for her many contributions to this wonderful community. Whether she is striving for economic prosperity by working with the Sauk Rapids Chamber of Commerce, fighting to end disease through her work with the Alzheimer’s Association and the Walk to End Alzheimer’s, helping to put on St. Cloud’s Expo for Seniors, or advocating for our children by serving on the Community Education board for the Sauk RapidsRice School District, Jodi is always putting her community first. It takes a very special person to dedicate so much of their time to helping and supporting others. I am proud to recognize that kind of accomplishment here today. Mr. Speaker, I thank Jodi for all she does for our community. She is truly deserving of this award. Keep up the great work. TEACHING LIFE LESSONS THROUGH ART  
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate an educator in my district who was recently named Minnesota’s Middle Level Art Teacher of the Year by the Art Educators of Minnesota. Pam Schwandt began her teaching career 31 years ago at Lincoln Elementary School for the Arts in Anoka, Minnesota, where she was a favorite teacher of one of my staffers. After 13 years in Anoka, Pam moved to Roosevelt Middle School, where she has been for the past 18 years. While Pam recognizes that not all of her students will become artists, she believes many life lessons can be taught through art. Pam has been helping students learn how to find joy, in addition to nurturing their creative thinking and problemsolving skills through art. Mr. Speaker, I speak for all Minnesotans when I say: Thank you, Pam. The best teachers are the ones who go above and beyond just teaching a subject. The best teachers are the ones like Pam, who teach lessons and skills that our students will carry with them for the rest of their lives. Pam’s award is well deserved. 
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to praise the strength and resolve of Forest Lake Patrol Officer Troy Meyer for not only overcoming adversity over the past 3 years, but for his amazing perseverance. Troy has escaped death not just once, not twice, but three times by overcoming a severe brain infection, a lung infection, and a double lung transplant a year later. He also had surgery to repair a hole in his heart just 6 months after that. Despite his challenges, Troy always moved ahead, determined to live life to the fullest and to help as many people as possible. He has done that by returning to his job on the police force only 13 months after his third surgery. Mr. Speaker, Officer Meyer is an example of the resiliency of the human spirit. We are so thankful that he has made a full and miraculous recovery. Forest Lake, the police department, and the State of Minnesota are fortunate to have an individual like Troy Meyer in our community. 
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend several police officers in my district for receiving the U.S. Department of Defense’s Patriot Award. Police Chief Todd Schwieger and Police Reserve Captain Richard Johnson both received the distinguished Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve’s Patriot Award for their efforts helping an ActiveDuty soldier work in their department while continuing his service to our country through the Army Reserve. Created in 1972, the Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve was created to help employers understand the obligations of their ActiveDuty employees and how to meet any challenges that may arise for those employees. St. Francis Reserve Officer and Army Reserve Staff Sergeant Richard Sieber, whom they had been helping, nominated Chief Schwieger and Captain Johnson for this award. Serving in our Nation’s Armed Forces is one of the most noble ways one can assist our Nation, and it is imperative that we help the brave individuals who choose to serve our country in any way that we can. Mr. Speaker, I thank both Todd Schwieger and Richard Johnson for their dedication to our servicemembers, as well as their own service to our community through their work in the St. Francis Police Department. Their work hasn’t gone unnoticed. f 
WE CANNOT ‘‘LET THIS GO’’ The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia). The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DOGGETT ) for 5 minutes. Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, this is a very troubling time in American history. Our national security is endangered, the very future of our democracy is at stake, and without the continued engagement of millions of people across this country, this troubling time could become much worse. There is an old adage: ‘‘Loose lips sink ships.’’ But it is also true that when it comes to the abuse of Presidential power, sealed lips can sink a democracy. We have gone through a period where it would appear that some of our Republican colleagues are in a witness protection program because they have been unable to come forward with any words to comment on the continued abuse of power that we see played out each day, with one being more incredible than the one before. All United States intelligence services agree that the Russians interfered in our last election. Russia deserves sanctions, not secrets, not rewards. A President of the United States invited Putin’s gang right into the Oval Office. We don’t know what they left behind to listen to the rest of the conversations, although they may not need to learn them surreptitiously since President Trump, in such a cavalier way, proceeded to share secrets with them. At long last we wonder, what will awaken these Republicans from their partisan stupor? We need them to speak out as well. Last night we learned that Trump asked FBI Director James Comey, before firing him, to drop the investigation into National Security Advisor 
Michael Flynn, whom Trump had been advised before he fired him that he was subject to being compromised by the Russians in his operations. Our Republican colleagues need to decide whether they want to be accessories to Trump’s obstruction of justice as he continues to endanger our national security. Trump’s firing of Director Comey is a shocking example of incredible duplicity that threatens the very fabric of the future of American democracy. It is a Nixonian dismissal that is designed to obstruct further inquiry into collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Trump even said himself during his NBC interview with Lester Holt that, ‘‘regardless of the recommendation from the Department of Justice,’’ he was prepared and planning to fire the FBI Director because of what he was doing with the Russian investigation. And that is part of a pattern: he fired the U.S. Attorney in New York City, he fired Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates, and he then fired Mr. Comey. If you are perceived as crossing the line with President Trump, it is like an episode out of that old TV series ‘‘The Apprentice:’’ You are fired. But this is not makebelieve. This is the future of American democracy. Every day we hear new coverup evidence. What could possibly explain the continued Republican silence, the callous indifference? Well, Trump is the Republican’s golden ticket to denying healthcare coverage to 24 million Americans and, at the same time, already showering, with a bill passed in this House, almost $1 trillion of tax breaks to the superrich and a handful of special interests. He is their winning ticket to awarding multinational tax dodgers more tax breaks while blowing a hole in the deficit that can change Medicare and Social Security forever. Trump reportedly told Comey: ‘‘I hope you can let this go.’’ My fellow Americans, FBI Director Comey could not let it go; and now that he is gone. We cannot let this go. This is not business as usual. This is not just more tax breaks for the superrich, as Republicans are urging at a hearing tomorrow in this House. We cannot let this go. History will be unkind to those who could not find their voice at this critical time in American history. I say it is time to truly put America first. Reject Putin. Reject partisanship. Help restore confidence in our democracy by supporting an independent special counsel and the type of independent, nonpartisan, nonpolitical inquiry that I have been calling for since last November into this Russian interference. Mr. Speaker, too much is at stake to remain silent. We must join together to address this challenge to our future. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. TEACHER APPRECIATION WEEK The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK ) for 5 minutes. Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of our Nation’s teachers. Teachers change lives every day across our Nation and around the world, shaping our students and our communities. Each of us can remember a teacher who made an impression on our life as an educator, a coach, or a mentor, often beyond the walls of the classroom. Last week, in honor of Teacher Appreciation Week 2017, I had the opportunity to travel the Eighth District to see firsthand the amazing work that teachers do across Bucks and Montgomery Counties. Throughout the week, I had the opportunity to read to preschool students at the Elbow Lane School in Warrington to discuss our national debt with eighth graders in Newtown Middle School, marked the Sanctuary Model accreditation of the Valley Day School in Morrisville, and held a student townhall with the AP government class students at Bensalem High School. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to recognize Teacher Appreciation Week, and I call on every American to carry out that appreciation for our teachers all year long. b1030 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because this week marks the 1year anniversary since the EPA established the health advisory level of 70 parts per trillion to limit the lifetime exposure to perfluorinated compounds like PFOA and PFOS. To some, these acronyms and this anniversary may mean nothing, but to me and my constituents—more than 70,000 Pennsylvanians in Bucks and Montgomery Counties—it has been a year of confusion, concern, and anger sparked by the rightful fear that their health has been endangered by these PFCs. The use of firefighting foam at military bases in and around our district has contaminated dozens of public wells and over 140 private wells with these compounds, leaving many residents scared and municipalities and local governments looking for answers. Mr. Speaker, every American deserves access to clean, safe drinking water. Yet, for too many of my constituents, these elevated levels of PFCs have put them and their families at risk. While work has been done, there is still far more work to do; and I am pleased that the recent government funding measure included directions for the Secretary of Defense to continue addressing these pressing issues, specifically by requiring all military services to establish procedures for prompt and costeffective remediation of PFC contamination, and also by delivering a report to Congress by the end of the summer assessing the number of military installations across the country impacted and the effect on drinking water in the surrounding communities, as well as departmentwide plans for community notification of contamination and procedures for timely remediation. However, our work cannot stop here. Not only should a health study be executed to know if PFOS and PFOA have compromised my constituents’ long term health, other issues must be addressed, including interacting with the Department of Veterans Affairs regarding serviceconnected condition care for military veterans potentially impacted and finding ways to offset trickledown costs for those forced to connect to public water in impacted areas. After a year, my constituents deserve more answers, and we will give them to them. They demand action. I will fight for both. f 
QUESTIONS FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR ) for 5 minutes. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, let me raise several questions for President Donald Trump. The American people and Members of Congress would like to know the answers. I am deeply concerned the President is compromising the national security of our Nation. Why would a President share intelligence information with the highest ranking operatives of Russia close to President Vladimir Putin? Though the President’s cavalier and, frankly, outrageous behavior conveniently sucked up the airwaves last week, Americans cannot be distracted from his simultaneous firing of FBI Director James Comey, an official who spent his life protecting and defending the Constitution of our country on liberty’s behalf. Let me ask: Why were no U.S. journalists allowed into the President’s historic meeting with the Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov and Russia’s Ambassador to the United States for many years, Ambassador Kislyak, one of probably the highest ranking intelligence officers as well as Ambassador from Russia to the United States? To my knowledge, no U.S. President has ever received officials from Russia in the Oval Office and then brought only Russian journalists with digital recording equipment into that office. Let me repeat that. We don’t know who they were, but they brought equipment, digital recording equipment. Think about that. Think about that. Meanwhile, the President excluded American press. Not a single journalist from this country was allowed in. He replaced them with Russian state media operatives. Today, CNN reports that, how conveniently, President Vladimir Putin has now said he will 
make available to America the transcript of that meeting. He is willing to share it. Well, isn’t that nice? It is further alarming that his National Security Advisor, General McMaster, said that, despite the President being unaware of the source of the information, at that meeting he made a spurofthemoment decision to tell the Russians what he knew about very important intelligence we received from an ally. It is starting to pile up, Mr. President: more and more reckless and cavalier behavior every day with America’s security stakes very high. I don’t have to remind my colleagues, it is on the record. Russia has been buzzing into U.S. airspace over Alaska. Her submarines are along the East Coast. This isn’t exactly a friend to us. If you want to make America great again, you do not compromise America’s national security. Not only is the President struggling for a coherent foreign policy that keeps Americans safe and secure and doesn’t make our allies quizzical, he fails to keep his attention on promises to working Americans here on home turf, particularly on trade and jobs. Let’s take the promises he made to our steelworkers in Ohio, that they will not lose their jobs, that America will be great again, that the coalfields will just boom; right? Well, in Lorain, Ohio, thousands of steelworkers are losing their jobs, with hundreds more, as I stand here today, being pinkslipped and getting termination notices unless the President takes action by the end of the first week in June. This is not the only community in America facing this, but it is not getting any publicity because all this other stuff is all over the front pages. We know we need direct and immediate action to save America’s steel industry that has been dumped on by Chinese, Russian, and South Korean steel for years now. We need to stop foreigndumped steel. These workers’ jobs are directly impacted by what is happening at our borders with all that stuff coming in here. I have invited the President and his Commerce Secretary, Wilbur Ross, to Lorain, Ohio, to witness firsthand this unfolding tragedy. Well, no promises are firm yet, not getting any acceptances while our workers need to be thrown a life raft in the typhoon that they are enduring. Perhaps it is hard to make America great again if you are moving from one selfmade crisis to another and losing attention on the homeland. Lorain County carried for Hillary Clinton, but only by 104 votes. It is a Democratic county. They were hoping jobs might actually begin to be increased in that area, not zeroed out. So let’s recap: a roller coaster foreign policy confusing not just us, but our allies, and broken promises regarding jobs. How about healthcare? Well, let’s take this—more confusion. We can be certain TrumpCare removes—removes—protections for our seniors and does not address the rising costs of medications. His bill will take away assistance that closed the Medicare prescription drug hole after seniors reach a level of $2,500, costing them over $1,000 more a year. Mr. Speaker, the American people deserve security, they deserve jobs, they deserve affordable education, and there is no better time to start than today. 
HABITAT FOR HUMANITY HELPS VETERANS The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. FITZPATRICK ). The Chair recognizes the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. JENKINS ) for 5 minutes. Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, too many men and women who have served our Nation in uniform find themselves without stable, secure housing. Statistics show a veteran is almost twice as likely as a civilian to experience homelessness. I rise today to recognize the work the Huntington, West Virginia, Area Habitat for Humanity is doing to reduce veterans’ homelessness thanks to its Veterans Housing Initiative. Because of this Habitat initiative and support from the Huntington VA Medical Center’s Homeless Veterans Resource Center, veterans can now make down payments and complete volunteer hours to buy their homes. I recently toured some of the homes built through this program in the historic Fairfield neighborhood in my hometown of Huntington. So far, 10 homes have been built, and 5 are now called home by veterans and their families. The housing not only helps veterans, but it also helps the community. These homes will help revitalize the neighborhood, an area filled with possibilities. It also frees up more housing for other veterans in need. As a veteran moves into one of these homes, his or her previous rental or apartment or room is now available to someone else in need. I am grateful to all the Habitat volunteers and staff who are part of this lifechanging project. Thank you for what you are doing to give back to those who gave so much for our Nation. Veterans in Huntington now have a brighter future and a path to homeownership. 
NATIONAL POLICE WEEK The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. BACON ) for 5 minutes. Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor May 15 as Peace Officers Memorial Day and May 14 through 20 as National Police Week. I stand in support of those who put their lives on the line day in and day out for the protection of those within the State of Nebraska and all over the United States. My district is home to two sheriff’s offices, a large urban police force, numerous community police departments, the Nebraska State Patrol, and a handful of Federal agencies. They have unique differences in their responsibilities, yet they are strikingly similar in how they function. The different shapes of the badges they wear on their chests proudly proclaim their distinct alliance to their home agency, but it is also a symbol that binds them all together into one brotherhood. These gallant law enforcement professionals are driven to serve the public of their jurisdictions. They protect the life, limb, and property in their assigned patrol areas during their long hours for which they have this solemn duty. To those on the front line of our safety, it is not about the pay, the hours, or the conditions they work in. What is of importance to them is the satisfaction of making the world a better and safer place. They are the thin blue line that stands between us and some of the darkest parts of our society. When one of these brave individuals puts on the uniform and departs their home for the streets, they are not worried about their own safety. They know their fellow officer has their back when needed. At great personal sacrifice, they are pained by missing the baseball games or recitals of beloved children, the birthdays and the holidays that they have worked instead of being home with their family. I, like so many other members of the military, have a very personal connection and appreciation for those who choose this profession. I spent nearly 30 years in the military, and much of that time was deployed with combat forces protecting our freedoms overseas. The men and women in the military uniform depend on those back home in the blue uniform. Like so many others in the military, when I was overseas, I left my wife and children in the U.S. As a fivetime former commander, I can tell you that the fastest way to negatively affect a soldier, sailor, airman, or marine within a combat situation was to have them worry about their family back home. Our great police officers allow the military to be a success. I am in awe of the dedication that each officer displays daily. When our military is reunited with their family after a deployment, they can relax knowing their fellow public servants provide a shield of protection. This is a profession that takes a different type of individual: someone who is consistently putting their life on the line, someone that I have always looked up to, and a group of individuals that I cannot thank enough for the blanket of security they provide. There are members of the law enforcement community who serve, retire, and move on with their lives. Eventually they go home, lay down their badge in retirement, but they will no longer miss those family functions and events. These professionals have the gratitude of the constituents of my 
district, and I want to thank them for their dedication to protect and serve. I would like to honor some of these courageous people who have long, distinguished careers or who have recently retired: Sergeant Joe Eaton from the Sarpy County Sheriff’s Office, 38 years and retired; Sergeant Troy Kister, Omaha Police Department, 29 years and retired; Captain Kevin Pokorny, LaVista Police Department, 32 years and retired; Deputy Stephanie Squiers, Sarpy County Sheriff’s Office, 32 years and retired; Sergeant Don Voss, Sarpy County Sheriff’s Office, 39 years and will soon retire; Deputy Dennis Yeaman, Douglas County Sheriff’s Office, 42 years and still serving, nearing retirement. I want to thank these officers and all others for their service and sacrifice. b1045 Mr. Speaker, before I close, I am often asked, as a 30year, retired military officer, to pay tribute to our law enforcement and to compare. And what strikes me is I used to operate or train in the safety of home, but we would deploy into harm’s way. Our law enforcement, every single day, put themselves in harm’s way. So we love our law enforcement, we respect them, and we thank them. 
REMEMBERING AND HONORING ENDY EKPANYA The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. OLSON ) for 5 minutes. Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, as National Police Week ends, the 800,000 Texans I work for back home want to say ‘‘thank you’’ to all of the Americans who came to Washington, D.C., and all those that rose up in hometowns all across America to support our police officers—our sheriffs, our JPs, our consuls—and to join our heroes on that thin blue line. In Pearland, Texas, we want to thank all Americans for remembering and honoring one of our own: Pearland Police Officer Endy Ekpanya. In 2016, 145 police officers were killed all across America. Endy, sadly, joined that group. Endy was killed at 3:15 in the morning on Sunday, June 12, 2016, end of watch, 339 days ago. He was killed on a nonemergency call by a driver who was high on drugs or booze. She Tboned his car. He was 30 young years old. Endy left behind the love of his life, his fiance, Lucy, and his 2yearold son, Julian. They mourned in front of Endy’s flagdraped coffin at his service back home the week of his death. Endy’s loss brought out the best in Pearland, Brazoria County, in southeast Texas. They shared tears with Lucy and Julian. They swarmed them with love. Every single Pearland police officer left duty on that day to be there, but Pearland was protected by police officers all over southeast Texas rising to the occasion. We continue working to ensure the woman who killed Endy goes to prison for a long time. The people of Pearland are building a memorial at their police station with Endy’s life on one wall. He will be there with two others who lost their lives in Pearland, Texas: Officer Henry Wendell, Jr., end of watch, November 6, 1967; and Officer James Cassidy, Jr., end of watch, May 16, 1973. I have kept up with Lucy. The last time we talked was early January. I called to tell her that the entire Texas House delegation—36 strong, Republicans and Democrats—signed my bill to name the post office in Pearland after Endy. She was happy, but she still felt pain. That was the first Christmas back home with Endy’s parents in New York. Sadly, losses like Endy are still happening. This week, we learned that a deputy sheriff in Montana was shot and killed during a routine traffic stop; and a police chief was shot in response to a domestic violence incident in upstate New York. And that was just yesterday. This violence against our law enforcement officials must end. During National Police Week, we honor these heroes, the ones we have lost, and we say a humble ‘‘thank you’’ to their families. We will never, ever forget their sacrifice. We pray for the day that Lucy and Julian can join Endy in Heaven. God bless Endy Ekpanya and all of the heroes who gave their lives on duty. f 
HONORING PETER CYBULSKI AND HAMEED ARMANI The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York (Mr. ZELDIN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, many Americans, when faced with that split second decision to act in a crisis with selfless valor, or to flee, answer the call of duty in service to their fellow man. In June 2016, NYPD Officers Peter Cybulski and Hameed Armani, both of whom I had the privilege to meet last month, were on patrol in Times Square when a suspected bomb was thrown into their vehicle. Rather than vacating their vehicle in place, these officers selflessly drove their car one andahalf blocks away from the public in a crowded Times Square. In that moment, when others might have simply fled the scene to save their own lives, Officers Cybulski and Armani were prepared to sacrifice everything to save the people they were sworn to protect. This selfless act of bravery is just one of so many acts of heroism by our police officers every single day. This week is National Police Week, where we honor our members of law enforcement and remember the sacrifices of those who have lost their lives in the line of duty. The brave men and women protecting our communities deserve recognition for their selfless acts of courage and commitment to serving our Union. This special week began in 1962, when President John F. Kennedy signed a proclamation which designated May 15 as Peace Officers Memorial Day. Every year, the week on which that date falls is designated as National Police Week. Since then, thousands of our officers and their families from all across our great Nation come to Washington, D.C., during this week to be recognized for their selfless duty and to honor those who have fallen in service to their community. I have always believed that our Nation has a perennial obligation to provide our police officers with every ounce of support that we have to offer. These heroes deserve to know that the people of this Nation, for whom they have given so much, are forever grateful. It really is the least that we can do for these brave men and women. As a Member of Congress, I have committed myself to ensuring law enforcement is given all of the support necessary, and more, to carry out their selfless mission. Last year, around this time, we passed five key pieces of legislation which both honor our police and ensure those still serving possess the tools and equipment needed to carry out this responsibility. Some of these bills included the Fallen Heroes Flag Act of 2016, the Federal Law Enforcement SelfDefense and Protection Act, and the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program and Reauthorization Act. And again this year, this week, we are doing the same: passing legislation to protect our law enforcement who sacrifice so much to protect us. In recent years, our Nation has become fractured, and our police have been subject to acts of violence and hatred. It is more important now than ever before that law enforcement receives our unwavering appreciation, support, and respect. Courage, leadership, and a commitment to service, these are the qualities embedded within our members of law enforcement, the traits by which they uphold deeply with dignity and honor. This week, and every week, it is so important to honor those who have put themselves into harm’s way to protect us, our families, and our communities. Their sacrifices will, and should, be revered for generations to come. 
RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess until noon today. Accordingly (at 10 o’clock and 54 minutes a.m.), the House stood in recess. 
b1200 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker at noon. 
PRAYER Rabbi Thomas A. Louchheim, Congregation Or Chadash, Tucson, Arizona, offered the following prayer: Loving God, each day raise up these good women and men who are serving our country with honor. Renew in them the faith, hope, and love that brought them to this vital work. Rekindle in them the passion that first called them to serve. May you, our elected Representatives from every State in our great Nation, be granted today the courage of your convictions; and may your eyes, your ears, and your hearts be open to the possibilities not yet imagined. Compassionate God, may our fellow Americans remember that these, Your servants, are each made in the divine image. They are our brothers and sisters in a family bridging all philosophical lines. May we treat them with respect, for we know not the hard battles they must fight. May Your blessings be on our military and diplomats serving overseas. Keep them safe from harm. Keep their souls strong, and strengthen them to serve with honor and courage. May our prayers for kindness, justice, freedom, and peace, be answered in our own day. Amen. 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman from Texas (Mr. WILLIAMS ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. WILLIAMS led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
WELCOMING RABBI THOMAS A. LOUCCHEIM The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. MCSALLY ) is recognized for 1 minute. There was no objection. Ms. MCSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Rabbi Thomas Louccheim, who led us in the opening prayer. He is a rabbi at the Congregation Or Chadash in Tucson, Arizona. Rabbi Louccheim moved to Tucson with his wife, Marcia, in 1989 and has been a pillar in our community ever since. Having served as a rabbi at Temple EmanuEl and as an executive for Handmaker Hospice, he is a strong advocate for peace and religious harmony. He worked closely with the Muslim community in the aftermath of September 11 and has continued to promote understanding by organizing annual MuslimJewish peace walks. He founded the first JewishChristianMuslim Scriptural study group in our community and has contributed to interfaith literature. In a world where religion too often divides us, Rabbi Louccheim has shown that we are all stronger together. Rabbi Louchheim’s influence extends past southeastern Arizona. In fact, his influence reaches beyond this Earth. The rabbi is a namesake for the only space object in the universe named after a rabbi, Asteroid 9584 Louccheim. I was honored to join Rabbi Louccheim in a Holocaust Remembrance walk last year. I have personally witnessed his compassion and leadership in the faith community in southeastern Arizona. I am honored to welcome him to the House of Representatives today and to personally thank him for offering this morning’s prayer. f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. SUOZZI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce bipartisan H. Res. 328 with my colleague from Florida, FRANCIS ROONEY , celebrating the 50th anniversary of the reunification of Jerusalem. For centuries, the Jewish people yearned to pray at the Western Wall, the only remaining connection to the Great Temple destroyed in 70 A.D., a cry that infused their daily prayers. Fifty years ago, in 1967, this mere hope became a reality when Jerusalem was finally reunified at the conclusion of the SixDay War. Of that precious moment, Yitzhak Rabin recounted: ‘‘We stood among a tangle of rugged, battleweary men who were unable to believe their eyes or restrain their emotions. Their eyes were moist with tears, their speech incoherent. The overwhelming desire was to cling to the Wall, to hold on to that great moment as long as possible.’’ The reunification of Jerusalem restored the city as a beacon of religious freedom for all of the Abrahamic religions and the rights of Jews, Muslims, and Christians to pray at their respective holy sites. We share the joy of our brothers and sisters as we celebrate this special milestone and as we continue to strive for a twostate solution between Israelis and Palestinians. In a world of increasing instability, our enduring relationship with Israel was never more 
vital, and I am honored to stand with our close friend and ally. 
HONORING BRANCH COUNTY SHERIFF POSSE DEPUTY MICHAEL WINTER (Mr. WALBERG asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember Branch County, Michigan, Sheriff Posse Deputy Michael Winter, who lost his life in the line of duty. He is survived by his wife, Connie, and two daughters, Cheyenne and Sierra. Deputy Winter was known as a committed family man with a sense of humor and a big smile. He loved being around horses and loved the posse. From his time in the United States Navy to the Branch County Sheriff’s Posse, Deputy Winter was the type of person who put his community and country before himself. He is a hero in every sense of the word. This week, during National Police Week, his name was carved into the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial here in Washington, D.C. It is a lasting tribute to those who paid the ultimate sacrifice to protect us. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of a grateful nation, we honor Deputy Winter’s memory and his service to Branch County and our country. He will not be forgotten. 
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SHOULD APPOINT AN INDEPENDENT PROSECUTOR (Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, last night we learned that President Trump may have tried to interfere with an ongoing investigation, asking the FBI Director to end an investigation into his former National Security Adviser’s ties to Russia. The Justice Department today should appoint an independent prosecutor to aggressively pursue the truth. There are a lot of informational dots. They either connect or they don’t. There is no dispute that Russia interfered with the United States’ Presidential election. The question is: Did Russia interfere with the Presidential election in coordination with the Trump campaign? It is deeply troubling that the Attorney General recused himself—a selfdeclared conflict—from the Russian investigation and then played a role in firing the man leading it. The American people rightfully suspect the decision to fire the FBI Director is part of a coverup. Appoint a special prosecutor to pursue the truth. Despots all over the world like Putin want to discredit American democracy to keep their own people from wanting it. We as Americans, Republicans and Democrats all, cannot allow this to happen, ever. f 
RECOGNITION OF NATIONAL POLICE WEEK (Mr. WILLIAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on behalf of law enforcement not only in my district, but around the Nation. This week is National Police Week, and it marks an important time for our country. These men and women are an elite group worthy of our praise and recognition. They are true American patriots whose acts of courage must be honored and acknowledged. Too many heroes lost their lives in the line of duty last year. Multiple of them were in my home State of Texas, as well as in my district. Every single day, Federal, State, and local police officers around the country put their lives on the line to protect their fellow Americans. Mr. Speaker, I came up here to speak on behalf of all Americans and express our appreciation for our law enforcement. These are the men and women who dedicate their lives to keeping the peace and carrying out justice. Congress has worked and will continue to work hard to guarantee that these brave men and women are provided with the tools needed to do their jobs and maintain public safety. We will also remain persistent to ensure those who harm law enforcement officers are brought to justice. I applaud those in law enforcement who have voluntarily put their lives on the line for all of us. In God we trust. 
IT IS TIME TO PUT COUNTRY BEFORE PARTY (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, it seems like, with this White House, there is a new crisis every single day. On Monday, it was reported that the President revealed classified information in the Oval Office to Russians, compromising our national security, compromising our ability to gather intelligence on ISIS, compromising our ability to keep America safe. Now we learn that the President tried to interfere with an ongoing investigation, asking the head of the FBI to lay off his National Security Adviser, Mr. Flynn, to leave it alone, to let it go. This is an abuse of power, there is no two ways about it, and Democrats and Republicans have to stand up and do our constitutional duty to protect this democracy. Partisanship has to be set aside. We have to do our job. We have to serve the American people, and we have to protect this precious democracy and do our constitutional duty. Democrats and Republicans both have to stand together on this. We need an independent commission to investigate this problem, and we need to do it now. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President of the United States. f 
HONORING KIRKERSVILLE POLICE CHIEF STEVEN DISARIO (Mr. TIBERI asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. TIBERI. Mr. Speaker, this week is Police Week, a time we honor all our officers, especially those who have fallen in the line of duty keeping us safe. So today I rise in honor and remember Kirkersville, Ohio, Police Chief Steven DiSario. Chief DiSario, a father of six with a baby on the way, was killed in the line of duty on May 12, 2017. He died at the hands of a gunman who also killed two employees at a local nursing home, Marlina Medrano and Cindy Krantz. This is a tragedy that truly tests the strength of a community, the strength of neighbors, and the strength of our law enforcement community. To Chief DiSario’s family: I can’t imagine the grief and the anguish you must be feeling. We are heartbroken for your loss. Please know that your husband, your father, your son, was an American hero. His memory will never be forgotten, and it is there that I pray you find hope. Today and every day, may God bless you and all our police officers and their families. 
b1215 AMERICA’S DRINKING WATER INFRASTRUCTURE (Mr. TONKO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to call urgent attention to America’s drinking water infrastructure. Every day, more than 700 water mains break in cities, towns, and villages across our great country. Every day, 7 billion gallons of clean drinking water are lost due to leaks and breaks in our water infrastructure. That is treated water and our tax dollars down the drain. With as many as 10 million lead service lines in use today and dozens of new unregulated contaminants, the threat to public health goes far beyond Flint, Michigan, and Hoosick Falls, New York. Our Federal Government has a duty to protect the people of this country. We must act decisively to address this growing challenge. We maintain roads and bridges and ports and railways and so much more, but our investment in our water systems has not kept up, and now these systems are failing. Many State and local governments can’t keep up. They 
need our help. This job needs to get done now, this year, in this budget. Mr. Speaker, I urge you to join me in supporting H.R. 1071, the AQUA Act. Let’s respond to these great Nation’s drinking water challenges with strength, compassion, and passion. 
IVY FRANCES SHOEMAKER AKA NUMBER 12 (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, she was born at evening time as a full Moon rose over Texas. Ivy Frances Shoemaker joined the world weighing 7 pounds and was 20 inches long. Her birth was on May 9 in Dallas. The miracle of birth is God’s blessing to the rest of us. It is a blessing to Ivy’s parents, Kellee and Anthony, and her sisters, Olivia and Rosalyn. Ivy, of course, is a beautiful, smart looking baby. She has the privilege to be born to wonderful parents who will raise her to grow in widsom and stature in the Lord. My wife, Carol, and I are the proud grandparents of Ivy, whom I will call from time to time, number 12. Mr. Speaker, you see, I refer to my other grandchildren by their birth numbers as well. There are 11 of them. My hope for Ivy is that she sees the importance of being good to others; that she makes the world a better place; that she is faithful to the Lord; that she appreciates her heritage; and that, of course, she always lives in Texas. And that is just the way it is. 
THE OPIOID CRISIS (Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, our Nation is in the middle of a public health crisis. Drug overdoses are now killing more Americans each year than car accidents. And 336 Rhode Islanders died last year as a result of a drug overdose. That is up from 290 in 2015 and 238 deaths in 2014. Nationwide, overdose deaths involving prescription and illicit opioids have quadrupled since 1999. This is a crisis that threatens Americans of all different backgrounds—young and old, Black and White, urban and rural. It is a crisis, plain and simple. All of us who serve the government have a responsibility to stop it. That is why I was so alarmed earlier this month when I learned that President Trump is considering slashing funding for the Office of National Drug Control Policy by 95 percent. Slashing funding for the lead Federal agency in this fight would have a devastating impact on families in Rhode Island and all across our country. Let’s work together. Let’s work across the aisle, Democrats and Republicans, to defeat this shortsighted proposal and, instead, advance real, comprehensive solutions to this public health epidemic. f 
THE UNITED STATES AND TAIWAN (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, the mutual relationship between the United States and Taiwan—enshrined in the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 and reinforced by the Six Assurances of 1982—has endured, due to our shared beliefs in democratic government, freedom of expression, the rule of law, and a market economy. It is my hope that this relationship will continue to deepen and strengthen in all areas. I hope the Trump administration will move expeditiously with a military sales package that will help to guarantee Taiwan’s security and freedom for the future. The people of Taiwan have great friends in the people of the United States. I know many of my colleagues will join me in expressing our shared desire to work together with our friends on the old and new challenges that Taiwan faces. Mr. Speaker, I wish President Tsai and the people of Taiwan all the best on their first anniversary of her administration. 
HONORING LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS (Mrs. MURPHY of Florida asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, it is National Police Week, and I rise to honor law enforcement officials who protect our communities. I also pay tribute to the thousands of men and women who have died in the line of duty. There are few jobs more important or more perilous than that of a police officer. Since I took office in January, there have been at least four incidents in or near my central Florida district where a police office was shot. In one of those cases, an officer, Orlando Police Lieutenant Debra Clayton, lost her life. Because they run towards danger, police officers face unimaginable challenges. Last June, an armed attacker entered the Pulse nightclub in Orlando and opened fire, killing 49 people. Showing no regard for their own safety, Orlando officers charged into the club, eventually bringing that long, dark night to an end. Mr. Speaker, despite the risks, they put on their uniforms every day. So to all the brave officers around this country, I say: Thank you. 
RECOGNIZING NATIONAL POLICE WEEK (Mr. LAHOOD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of National Police Week, a time to honor and thank law enforcement officers for all they do in service to our communities. As a former State and Federal prosecutor, I have worked with law enforcement officers at every level: local, State, and Federal. I watched as they tirelessly worked to carry out justice and keep our communities safe. As a Member of Congress, I have the privilege of representing a district that is both rural and urban. I have seen the different challenges that our officers have faced. They have done it in a tremendous way, both at the local police level and at the sheriff level. The work and effort put in by the officers in each community never ceases to amaze me. It is a big reason why our district has continued to thrive with vibrant and safe communities. This work does not come without its risks. Far too many officers pay the ultimate price. Last year in South Jacksonville, Illinois, in my district, one of its own was killed in the line of duty. Losses like this are devastating for both the families and our communities. We must never forget their sacrifices and we must continue to work to keep our officers protected. Mr. Speaker, I am proud of the work the House is doing this week to do just that. I thank every law enforcement officer for their commitment and dedication towards keeping America safe. 
OUR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE (Mr. MCNERNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MCNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, today we are talking about infrastructure. I want to focus on one aspect of infrastructure that touches the lives of all Americans, especially in my home State of California, and that is water. I know firsthand the urgent challenges facing our water infrastructure. The crippling recent drought and subsequent record rainfall has prompted more discussion on a need for a smart water management strategy to improve drinking water, water reuse, and recycled water systems for communities across the United States. We must take meaningful steps to increase our water conservation, reduce unnecessary energy use, and cut costs for Americans. Let’s commit to investing in technology and sciencebased solutions that will address the weaknesses in our water drinking systems from threats like climate change, crumbling pipes, and water source contamination. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to focus on legislation that will put Americans back to work building the systems we need to support the future of this great country. 
NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE WEEK (Mrs. LAWRENCE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join my colleagues in celebrating the fifth annual National Infrastructure Week and to highlight the urgent need for Congress to pass a comprehensive transportation and infrastructure bill. Mr. Speaker, in the summer of 2003, a power outage swamped the Eastern United States and Canada, including Detroit, which I represent, and left 50 million people without power for several days. In 2007, a bridge on I–35 West in Minneapolis collapsed into the Mississippi River. Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, these are not isolated incidents. In my home State of Michigan, our cities are home to some of the worst roads in the country. A recent study by a nonprofit ranked Detroit’s roads the fourth worst in the country. Mr. Speaker, Michigan deserves better, and Americans across the country deserve and demand more. I, as an excited member of the Congressional Infrastructure Committee, stand ready to work on future infrastructure bills and to work for the needs of the people. 
FOCUSING ON OUR INFRASTRUCTURE (Mrs. BUSTOS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, on the first day of this month, President Trump promised an infrastructure package ‘‘in the next 2 to 3 weeks, maybe sooner.’’ Here we are into week three and in the middle of National Infrastructure Week. So, Mr. President, where is the plan? I wish we were spending today working together to create jobs by making meaningful investments in our roads, our bridges, our rail, and our airports. That is what the hardworking men and women I represent wish Washington would focus on, too. But, instead, at breakfast tables all over the country, moms and dads turn on the morning news and have to explain to their kids what is an obstruction of justice before putting their kids on the school bus and traverse our bumpy and potholed roads. This is a dark moment in our Nation’s history. History demands that we rise to the occasion. Nobody is above the law, not even the President of the United States of America. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to do the right thing for the good of our country. Join us in demanding a true and independent investigation to get to the bottom of the President’s ties to Vladimir Putin and any possible attempted coverup. THE NEED FOR INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT (Ms. ESTY of Connecticut asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. ESTY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize National Infrastructure Week and to urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to work together and pass a bipartisan infrastructure bill. The fact is, Mr. Speaker, we cannot run a 21st century economy on a mid 20th century infrastructure. Our roads are filled with potholes, costing commuters, on average, $520 a year in repairs. Traffic congestion adds another $960 per year in fuel and lost productivity. Too many of our bridges are structurally deficient and past their 50year lifespan. As the Flint lead crisis painfully demonstrated, our water infrastructure is failing to provide too many Americans with water that is safe to drink. It is time to stop talking about infrastructure. It is time for Congress to act. The systems that allow us to travel from place to place, provide us with clean drinking water, and dispose of waste are not luxuries; they are essentials. Mr. Speaker, let’s pass a bipartisan infrastructure plan. Let’s invest in safety, jobs, and the competitiveness of American businesses. f 
INVESTING IN OUR NATION’S INFRASTRUCTURE (Ms. JAYAPAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize National Infrastructure Week. In my first few months in Congress, I made it a priority to meet with elected officials from every municipality and jurisdiction in my Washington State congressional district. I met with them to understand their critical transportation and infrastructure needs. Today I am releasing a report on those needs. I am proud that my district continues to draw in more and more people and that we have assets like a natural deep water port that facilitates commerce from across our State. Unfortunately, between 1990 and 2015, as our State’s population increased by 45 percent, Seattle has now got the second worst evening rush hour traffic in the country. We have failed to invest in our infrastructure. This administration made promises but has done nothing to actually fulfill those promises to invest in infrastructure and to ensure that our country actually moves forward. Instead, it has just been lurching from crisis to crisis. Investing in infrastructure is not only essential, it creates jobs. I intend to do everything I can to make sure that I fight for my district’s priorities and to ensure that Congress invests in our infrastructure. f 
b1230 COMPROMISING SENSITIVE INFORMATION (Ms. ROSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. ROSEN. Mr. Speaker, I find it deeply disturbing that highly classified intelligence information from Israel, our indispensable ally, was carelessly compromised by President Trump in a meeting with Russian officials. By recklessly sharing this sensitive intelligence, the President has not only endangered our troops, intelligence officials, and sources who risk their lives every day to keep us safe, but he has jeopardized the relationship we have with our most important ally in the Middle East, Israel. If we wish to defeat ISIS, the President must rectify this unacceptable blunder. The American people must receive immediate assurances that this administration is doing everything necessary to repair any damage caused by the President’s reckless actions. The role of Commander in Chief is one that must be taken seriously and should never result in the compromising of our most sensitive information, especially to a foreign adversary at the expense of one of our strongest allies. 
HONORING JONATHAN DE GUZMAN AND ALL OFFICERS DURING NATIONAL POLICE WEEK (Mrs. DAVIS of California asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, every day men and women in the police force put their lives on the line to keep us safe. Let me tell you about one of these extraordinary heroes: San Diego Police Department Officer Jonathan De Guzman, or JD, as his friends knew him. JD dedicated his life to protecting the San Diego community he loved. His bravery shows the kind of unique selflessness found in police officers. After suffering a brutal stabbing from a suspect, JD went back to the force, and that same year he won the San Diego Police Department Purple Heart award for bravery in the line of duty. Tragically, on July 28, 2016, Officer De Guzman, a 16year veteran of the force, was shot and killed, a hero taken from us too early. There is a special honor in representing those who serve us every single day, those like San Diego’s own JD, Officer De Guzman. Thank you to the brave men and women of our police force. Your sacrifice and your strength keep us safe. 
NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE WEEK (Mr. CARBAJAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, today I urge President Trump again to make good on his promise of partnering with Congress to invest $1 trillion in America’s infrastructure. This week marks National Infrastructure Week; and yet, disappointingly, little action has been taken by this President and the majority in Congress to provide substantive funds for our Nation’s crumbling infrastructure. Easing congestion on our highways is just one investment that will have a significant return, getting central coast residents to their jobs and back home to their families faster. This is also an issue of safety for our constituents. California currently has over 1,300 structurally deficient bridges, 678 highhazard dams, and 50 percent of its nearly 200,000 miles of public roads are in poor condition. I urge my colleagues to work together in a bipartisan way to address the infrastructure crisis in our country. 
HONORING BEN AND DAN MATHESON (Mr. BARTON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BARTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise to bring to the House’s attention two fine Texans who are sitting up in the House gallery, Ben and Dan Matheson. Ben has been on my Air Force advisory committee down in Texas for the entire 32 years that I have been in Congress. He and the other two members of that nominating committee have recommended to me over 100 young men and women whom we have nominated to the Air Force Academy and who are now serving, defending our Nation. His son is Dan Matheson, one of my best friends, a proud graduate of the University of Texas Law School, former head of the Texas State Fed office, and a successful practicing attorney in Austin, Texas. I am very proud to have their friendship, and I am glad to bring to the attention of the House these two fine Americans. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair reminds Members not to refer to persons in the gallery. 
NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE WEEK (Mr. CA´RDENAS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CA´RDENAS. Mr. Speaker, this is National Infrastructure Week; yet, at the same time, our current President promised that, as soon as he took office, he was going to put forth a trilliondollar infrastructure package. Where is that package? We haven’t seen it. The economy is the number one thing we should all be focusing on. Everything else should fall into place after that. Yet this White House is too busy in turmoil to take care of the core business of this country. It is actually White House crisis week again. That is a sad comment, but it is the truth. Once again we hear about a President who is not respecting the fact that we have allies around the world who are there sharing information that should not be shared with the Russians, and yet, at the same time, this President chooses to violate that responsibility. The American people and economy are losing confidence in our President and our White House. They shouldn’t be given these disturbing reports that come out almost every day. The actions are undermining our economy. It is undermining the confidence in our infrastructure, and it is undermining our confidence of the United States around the world. f 
COMMUNICATION FROM THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following communication from the Clerk of the House of Representatives: 
OFFICE OF THE CLERK , HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , Washington, DC, May 17, 2017. Hon. PAULD. R YAN, The Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR MR. SPEAKER : Pursuant to the permission granted in Clause 2(h) of Rule II of the Rules of the U.S. House of Representatives, the Clerk received the following message from the Secretary of the Senate on May 17, 2017, at 9:20 a.m.: That the Senate passed S. 419. That the Senate passed S. 583. That the Senate passed S. 867. That the Senate agreed to S.J. Res. 22. Appointments: Alyce Spotted Bear and Walter Soboleff Commission on Native Children. With best wishes, I am, Sincerely, KAREN L. H AAS. f 
PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 115, THIN BLUE LINE ACT Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 323 and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: 
H. R ES. 323 Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 115) to amend title 18, United States Code, to provide additional aggravating factors for the imposition of the death penalty based on the status of the victim. All points of order against consideration of the bill are waived. In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the Committee on the Judiciary now printed in the bill, an amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 115–17 shall be considered as adopted. The bill, as amended, shall be considered as read. All points of order against provisions in the bill, as amended, are waived. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and on any further amendment thereto, to final passage without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary; and (2) one motion to recommit with or without instructions. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Colorado is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. HASTINGS ), my friend, pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. 
Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Colorado? There was no objection. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the underlying legislation. As a former Federal and State prosecutor, I often hear how Americans value and respect our law enforcement officers, firefighters, and first responders. We talk about their heroism, their selflessness, their willingness to protect and serve no matter the cost. These fearless individuals truly are the fabric that holds our communities together. However, in recent years, a violent and disturbing trend has developed. Law enforcement officers, firefighters, and first responders are increasingly being targeted for violence and cruelty based solely on the uniform they wear. According to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, there were 64 police shooting deaths in 2016. That number is 56 percent higher than the previous year. The National Association of Police Organizations also notes that ambushstyle killings of law enforcement officers increased by 167 percent in 2016. Allowing this appalling trend to continue unchecked is not only unacceptable, it is indefensible. Congress must take concrete steps to address this deadly problem. Current Federal law provides 16 aggravating factors that a jury must consider when deciding whether a death sentence is warranted. These factors include whether the defendant acted in an especially heinous, cruel, or depraved manner; whether the defendant engaged in substantial planning and premeditation; whether the victim was 
particularly vulnerable; whether the victim was a high public official, which includes highranking public persons, from the President to a foreign head of state, to a judge or a Federal law enforcement officer. However, State and local police officers, firefighters, prosecutors, and first responders are excluded from these protections. In response, my friend, Mr. BUCHANAN , introduced H.R. 115, the Thin Blue Line Act. This legislation amends Federal law to include murdering, attempting to murder, or targeting of State and local law enforcement officers, firefighters, prosecutors, and first responders as an aggravating factor a jury must consider when determining whether a death sentence is justified. Furthermore, these protections extend to all public safety officers who are murdered or targeted while engaging in their official duties, because of the performance of their duties, or because of their status as a public official or employee. This bill sends a clear message: Those who target our police officers, firefighters, or first responders with violence will be met with an equally harsh punishment. We offer our thoughts and prayers to the families of our fallen officers, but we must do more to protect these brave individuals. We can’t stand idly by as the individuals who protect our homes and communities are targeted because of the uniform they wear. We must act to ensure those individuals who would commit an act of violence against our public safety officers know they will face the gravest of sentences if they go through with their heinous plot. We must send the message that Congress stands with those fearless individuals who dedicate their lives to protecting our communities, no matter the cost. We can’t continue allowing them to suffer the price of our inaction. I support this effort and thank Chairman GOODLATTE and the Committee on the Judiciary for bringing this bill to the floor. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I thank my friend, the gentleman from Colorado, for yielding me the customary 30 minutes for debate. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to debate the rule for consideration of H.R. 115, the Thin Blue Line Act. Mr. Speaker, law enforcement and first responders play an important role in the safety and security of our communities. I know about that because of the reason that, when I was a lawyer, I had the privilege of representing a firefighters association and a police officers association. I have represented police officers in court, and I have been in situations where I have interfaced with them as a lawyer in other circumstances. They are an invaluable resource represented by the hard work of dedicated men and women across our Nation. Most importantly, our admiration for police officers is not a partisan issue. We universally agree that those officers who diligently work to protect our communities warrant our praise as we honor them on this National Police Week. b1245 They are our friends, our neighbors, our family, and they are even our colleagues. I am honored to serve in this institution with a number of persons who, in their other activities, were either police officers or police chiefs that served in that capacity in law enforcement. We have a new Member here from my State, my good friend, Representative VALDEMINGS , a career law enforcement officer herself—27 years she served—serving as Orlando’s first female chief of police. I have just a footnote to add to that. Val’s husband is the sheriff of Orange County. It is because of this admiration and bipartisan support that, in some respects, I was dismayed to see that, as we celebrate National Police Week, my Republican colleagues decided now was the time to bring this, in my view, unnecessary messaging bill to the floor simply to score political points. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 115 would add the murder, attempted murder, or targeting of a law enforcement official, first responder, or firefighter as an aggravating factor when determining if a death sentence is warranted for a defendant convicted of murder in Federal court. The problem, Mr. Speaker, is this bill is unnecessary. It is, in short, really good messaging, but bad policy. Under current law, there is already an exhaustive list of 16 statutory aggravating factors for homicide for a jury or court to consider. Having been involved in the justice system for a protracted time in my career, I am trying to think of a time that a police officer was killed and a person was tried and convicted; and I ask my colleagues to answer that question, that anybody that was convicted for killing a police officer didn’t get the death penalty. I know in my State, in every instance that that occurred— and they were too numerous, and I regret that they occurred at all—all of those people got the death penalty. We also remember that Federal prosecutors can and do seek the death penalty in the killing of law enforcement or first responders, as our friends from Massachusetts are well aware after a death sentence was handed down in the case involving the Boston Marathon bomber. And that was in Massachusetts, a nondeath penalty State. Mr. Speaker, on this front, the system is working. Federal prosecutors already have the tools to seek the death penalty in cases where a first responder or law enforcement official was murdered. What’s more, they are using these tools. Given this duplicity, it is a shame that we are here today debating the need for a seventeenth new aggravating factor to keep members of the law enforcement community safe when we could be considering measures that would actually keep them and their communities they protect far safer. Let’s be clear. This legislation does nothing to keep law enforcement officers and first responders safe. By its own purported purpose, this bill addresses the tragic scenario in which the officer has already been killed. We need to be working together to create legislation that has a real impact on keeping our communities and police safer, as opposed to slapping a catchy name on an unnecessary bill and pretend we are doing something. If my Republican colleagues were serious about advancing protections for law enforcement during National Police Week, we would be discussing providing them with the tools, the resources, and the training to engage in beneficial community policing initiatives. Our law enforcement officers and the communities they police deserve more than messaging. They deserve real action. I ask one more question. Ask police officers what their attitude is about assault weapons. I think you would find that, if we passed an assault weapons measure, we would be pleasing police officers a great deal more than messaging to them our concern for their safety. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, we are here because we are making sure that local police officers, sheriff’s deputies, prosecutors, first responders, and firefighters have the same protections that those in the Federal system have. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. BUCSHON ). Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Speaker, law enforcement officers across this country go to work every day to serve and protect our communities. These brave men and women risk everything to keep our communities and our families safe and secure, and they do it selflessly. I recently attended a ceremony in Putnam County, Indiana, honoring the service and sacrifice of the Indiana State Police officers who have given their lives in the line of duty. Yesterday I was at the White House with Vice President PENCE to recognize the dedication of the Indiana Fraternal Order of Police and to remember the service of the late sheriff’s deputy of Howard County, Carl Koontz, who was killed in the line of duty. Events like these are somber reminders of what these heroes who stand on the thin blue line, and their families, sacrifice on our behalf. We should all be grateful. Mr. Speaker, this legislation ensures that officers who fall in the line of duty, and their families, receive the justice they deserve. I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation that confirms the United States Congress stands behind our law enforcement. 
Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and then I will yield to a speaker to speak for the previous question. Mr. Speaker, it may sound like we are getting ready to change the subject; and, to a relative degree, we are. We are in very interesting and troubling times in this Nation, and we have some concerns that need to be addressed. One of the things that is allowed to the minority is an opportunity to present a previous question. In this particular instance, we are deeply concerned by last night’s revelations that, earlier this year, President Trump may have attempted to obstruct justice when he asked thenFBI Director James Comey to end the Bureau’s investigation of former National Security Advisor Flynn’s ties to Russia. This news came only days after the President acknowledged that he later fired Director Comey over the Bureau’s investigation into the links between the Trump campaign and Russia, and only a day after we learned the President shared highly classified intelligence with Russian officials last week. I served for 8 years on the Intelligence Committee in this Congress, and the kind of information that the President shared with the Russians— even as an Intelligence member, I saw secret, I saw top secret, I saw high secret, but I did not see code word information, the highest that is only shared with a few people in the congressional body—that is what was allowed to be transmitted. It is time that the Republicancontrolled Congress does its job and acts to defend our democracy. Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I am going to offer an amendment to the rule to bring up a bipartisan bill, H.R. 356, which would create a nonpartisan commission to investigate Russian interference in our 2016 election. This marks the seventh time we tried to bring this bill to the House floor. On the previous six occasions, the Republican majority regrettably refused the House to even debate this important legislation. As more and more facts have come to light, I hope my colleagues will finally put country ahead of party and get serious about this investigation. My goodness, the allegation here is that people impacted our fundamental premise of our existence: our elections. We need to create this commission with legislation rather than just tweeting about the need for facts. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the amendment in the RECORD , along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from California, (Mr. SWALWELL ), a member of the Intelligence Committee of the House, to discuss our proposal. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Before recognizing the gentleman from California, Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. 
Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I have a parliamentary inquiry. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I have heard that often. Will the Speaker direct me to what I said that was anything more than what is a fact here. Can the Chair tell me what I said that was dealing with the personality of the President. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman may have, perhaps not in words, but perhaps gave some indication of illegal activities by the President. Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida for yielding. I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question and allow an amendment to come forward so that we can debate having an independent commission on Russia’s interference in our past election. The events over the past few weeks have demonstrated that there is a high cost—a cost that is too high to bear with regard to the White House and its ties with Russia. What is the cost exactly? What is the cost of alleged abuses and the President’s firing of Acting Attorney General Sally Yates and Director James Comey? What is the cost of the question swirling around the President’s ties to Russia? Well, the cost, clearly, with the leaking that occurred in the Oval Office, is now our national security. The cost is our democracy has been left in ruins. It is a mess right now here in Washington. The cost is that this House is unable to bring forward legislation to do anything to help people put food on the table, to seek to put a roof over their home, and to provide opportunity to their children. It is a high cost that we are paying right now for all these questions. It is too much for us to bear. The best thing we can do is to charter an independent commission to take this outside of Congress so that they can follow the facts and the evidence and report back to the American people just exactly how we were so vulnerable this last election. What was our response? Were any U.S. persons involved? And, most importantly, what are we going to do? What reforms can we make? What awareness should we all have so that we never find ourselves in a mess like this again? It is not disputed, Russia attacked our democracy. It was ordered by Vladimir Putin. They used a multifaceted campaign of social media trolls, the dissemination of fake news, the hacking of Democratic emails, and the breaking into State voter registration systems. They had a preferred candidate in mind in Donald Trump. And they didn’t do it because they were bored. They didn’t do it because they were testing software. They did it because they wanted something in return. They saw a candidate who admired their President, they wanted sanctions rolled back, and they wanted to reduce the role of NATO. But the most disturbing and the most bonechilling finding that the intelligence community made was that Russia intends to do it again. And by the looks of things, they will be more successful next time because, since this past attack, we have done nothing to improve the structural integrity of our elections. We have done nothing to have a frank conversation with the American people about how we all need to be more aware about what a foreign adversary’s intent is when they hack emails and then disseminate fake news. This is a time for Republicans and Democrats to unite. Democrats may have been the victim of this most recent attack. If history has its way, another adversary perhaps could attack us and Republicans may be the victim. b1300 But the constant should always be that both parties say we will never tolerate foreign interference. The first step to doing that is to defeat this previous question, allow an amendment to take place so we can debate having an independent commission, a commission that would be bipartisan appointed, have a wide mandate to follow the evidence, explore all the facts, and then report to the American people recommendations so that this never happens again. We have a discharge petition right now to also do that. There are a number of names on it. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. HASTINGS. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute. Mr. SWALWELL of California. I saw how our country responded after the last serious attack that occurred on September 11. Outside, on the Capitol steps, Republicans and Democrats joined hands. They sang ‘‘God Bless America.’’ But more importantly were the reforms that they undertook over the next few years to understand the vulnerability, to put policies in place to make sure we were never vulnerable again, and report to the American people what they had done. We have an opportunity again to unite. Our constituents are counting on us to show that unity, to wear the same uniform, and make sure that this democracy is still one we protect. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. KNIGHT ) to get this debate 
back on track and to protect local law enforcement officials. Mr. KNIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I come to you, not just as a Representative from my district today but someone who served for 18 years as a Los Angeles police officer on the streets, someone who has been in uniform, at attention, at several police officer and deputy funerals as tears were rolling down my face, and looking side to side and seeing the same of my brothers and sisters in law enforcement. I am sure that everyone who speaks today will have a story, a horrible story that affected their community. On October 5 of last year, one such story happened in our community. Sergeant Steve Owen was basically executed. He was shot from a far distance, and then the killer came up and put four more shots into him at close range to make sure that he was dead. These are the types of things that we are seeing in our communities across this country at an alarmingly high rate over the last few years. I think that the Thin Blue Line Act is one more of those types of issues that we can do to protect our first responders, our police officers, our firefighters, to give these people justice, to give their families justice, so I urge you to support the Thin Blue Line Act. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, would the Chair be so kind as to advise my good friend and I what amount of time remains? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Florida has 14
1⁄2minutes remaining. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I would advise my friend that I anticipate one more speaker, but at this time I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE), chairman of the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule to consider H.R. 115, the Thin Blue Line Act, introduced by my friend and colleague from Florida, Mr. VERNBUCHANAN . Mr. Speaker, this week, National Police Week, we take time to honor our Nation’s law enforcement officers for the work they do and the sacrifices they make to keep us safe on a daily basis. It is unconscionable that law enforcement officers are being targeted and are making the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty; and this bill aims to make the killing or attempted killing of a law enforcement officer an aggravating factor for the imposition of the death penalty. Mr. Speaker, I served for 6 years as a city commissioner and two of those as the mayor of my small town of Johnson City, Tennessee, and had the privilege of working with first responders, firemen, and police officers every day. It was a privilege to do it. I put on a scrub suit to go to work. They put on a Kevlar vest and put their lives in danger. I cannot say thank you enough to them and their families for the sacrifices that they make. I commend my colleague on introducing this legislation and for the House considering it today. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation in honor of our law enforcement officers. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. YOHO). Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise in support of H.R. 115, the Thin Blue Line Act, which will act as a deterrent against criminals who seek to harm first responders. Increasing the Federal penalties that can be imposed against those who would kill or attempt to kill policemen, firemen, or first responders is a just response to such heinous crimes. This week is National Police Week, and I am reminded of the words etched on the National Law Enforcement Memorial in Washington, D.C., which states: ‘‘The wicked flee when no man pursueth, but the righteous are bold as a lion.’’ This is from the Book of Proverbs. It takes a special kind of person to willingly run toward danger and to shield the innocent from the wicked. That is what our law enforcement and first responders do every day. I am very grateful for the men and women who serve and protect our communities; and I was honored to be present for Police Week in a small town in our district, Green Cove Springs, in Clay County, Florida, where they had the Police Memorial; and on that was a verse from John 15:13: ‘‘Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one’s life for one’s friends.’’ I hope that God watches over our first responders and keeps them safe to bring them home to their families. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. BROOKS ). Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, as a former Tuscaloosa County prosecutor and Madison County district attorney, I fully understand the importance of the rule of law that, in turn, protects us from anarchy, crime, destruction, and death. Without the rule of law, criminal brute force prevails. Unfortunately, leftist political forces who care more about inciting racial division for political gain and less about crime and terror victims regularly secondguess those who wear the uniform to protect and serve. For emphasis, antipolice, leftist political rhetoric has helped incite ambushstyle attacks against police in places like Dallas, Baton Rouge, Des Moines, and Palm Springs. I support the Thin Blue Line Act because I appreciate the sacrifice of law enforcement officers, and because it is morally right to help protect officers who risk their lives to protect ours. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. BILIRAKIS ). Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in solidarity with our law enforcement officers and in support of the rule and passage of the Thin Blue Line Act. This bill makes sure that anyone who targets and attacks a State or local law enforcement officer is held accountable. The men and women who serve in our local police forces put their lives on the line to keep us safe. They are our everyday heroes, Mr. Speaker. In 2014, Tarpon Springs Police Officer Charles Kondek was shot and killed by a fugitive while on duty. Officer Kondek represented Tarpon Springs. He worked there for 17 years and did a wonderful job keeping us safe. These ambushstyle killings of law enforcement officers have increased across the country by 167 percent. This is unacceptable. The Thin Blue Line Act brings us one step closer to justice for these horrific crimes, so let’s pass this bill. Of course, we have to pass the rule first so that we can pass this good bill. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DUNN). Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Thin Blue Line Act, which will make murder or attempted murder of a law enforcement officer, or first responders, an aggravating factor in death penalty determinations. The officers of the thin blue line put their lives at risk every day and are willing to make the ultimate sacrifice so that we can rest easy at night. Our law enforcement and first responders run into danger so that others can run away from it. They do this despite the rise in violence against them. We have witnessed a 167 percent increase in ambushstyle killings of police officers in 2016 alone. This is tragic, and it is unacceptable. The Thin Blue Line Act will hold cop killers accountable and seek justice for those murdered in the line of duty, and it will show our resolve as citizens to protect the officers who have sworn to protect us. During this week, National Police Week, we can also show our gratitude to law enforcement and their families by passing the Thin Blue Line Act. It is an honor to represent them in Congress. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BABIN). Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, at this time in our Nation, protecting our local law 
enforcement and first responders could not be more important. Tens of thousands of law enforcement and first responders around the country put their lives on the line every single day to serve their communities. Sadly, statistics show that simply doing their jobs has become very dangerous for these individuals. In 2016, police officer shootings increased by 56 percent nationally, with ambushstyle killings of law enforcement officers increasing by a staggering 167 percent. These dramatic numbers demonstrate that more protection is needed for our law enforcement officers. In my home State of Texas, 17 law enforcement officers gave their lives just last year, including five who were killed in the horrible assault that targeted police officers in Dallas, Texas. On Monday, in recognition of National Police Week, we honored fallen law enforcement officers at a memorial ceremony in Deer Park, Texas, in my district. We need the Thin Blue Line Act, which would make the killing of a local or State law enforcement officer or first responder an aggravating factor in Federal death penalty determinations. It is important that our local and State police officers and first responders have the same safeguards that Federal law enforcement officers already have. The local law enforcement and first responders that I know in my district not only serve their communities through their jobs but also give back to their communities in positions such as Little League coaches, City Council members, Sundayschool teachers, and in countless other positions of service. These individuals put their communities first, Mr. Speaker, and they deserve to be protected by much stronger laws. I rise in strong support of the Thin Blue Line Act and encourage my colleagues in the House to support its passage today. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK ), a former special agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague, Mr. BUCK, for his leadership on this important issue, and I rise in strong support. Mr. Speaker, my greatuncle, Phil Fitzpatrick, was a proud patrolman with the NYPD. He was also a poet, often referring to police officers as soldiers of peace. This week, as we recognize Police Week 2017, I find myself thinking of him and a line from one of his poems, where he wrote: ‘‘When he kisses his wife and children goodbye, there’s the chance he will see them no more.’’ Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, these words were true for my family. This month marks 70 years since my great uncle was shot while attempting to disarm a robber in a Manhattan bar, a fatal injury he succumbed to days later. Mr. Speaker, for too long, law enforcement across this country has been forgotten or, worse yet, ostracized. At the same time, their vital mission continues, and it continues to grow more dangerous. Just last year, ambush style killings of law enforcement officers increased by 167 percent, according to the National Association of Police Organizations. Despite all this, each day, tens of thousands of brave women and men continue to put their lives on the line to serve and protect our communities. This week, we recognize Police Week 2017, but the dedication and sacrifice of our blue line deserves to be respected every day. As a former law enforcement officer, I am proud to stand here today in support of those brave women and men. Today, the House has a chance to take decisive action to protect our law enforcement officers by passing the legislation before us. The Thin Blue Line Act sends a clear message to those who intentionally target our police officers. Vicious attacks on law enforcement officers will be met with justice. I urge my colleagues to stand up for law enforcement today, support this rule, and pass H.R. 115, the Thin Blue Line Act. The bipartisan support it deserves must be delivered today. b1315 Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. GRAVES ). Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. BUCK) for his efforts and leadership on this issue. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because I think it is really important that we talk about law enforcement; we talk about what their role is. These are the peacekeepers. The men and women right here on Capitol Hill, the Capitol Police, they are the ones who prevent chaos, that allow for order to stand here in the Capitol complex. In the State of Louisiana, in my hometown of Baton Rouge, back on July 17, we had an extraordinary event. We had five of our law enforcement officers who were responding to a shooter with a long gun; clearly, someone that was dressed and armed in a way to not be helpful to the community. While the rest of us were running away from that shooter, these five men were running toward him. As a result of that, Deputy Brad Garafola lost his life, and his wife, Tonja, is right now a widow. Matthew Gerald lost his life, and Dechia, his wife, is now a widow. Dechia found out 2 weeks after his death that she was pregnant, and he has never seen that baby. That baby doesn’t have a father today. We had Montrell Jackson, another Baton Rouge police officer, who lost his life, and his wife, Trenisha, is now a widow. We had Bruce Simmons who got shot, and while he did survive, he is still struggling with recovery, and he and his wife, Pam, continue to go through that from the July 17 shooting from last year. Nick Tullier was also involved in that shooting, and I have been wearing my ‘‘Pray for Nick’’ band now for months. Nick Tullier continues to be in the hospital even today. This bill allows for the protection of our officers. It clearly distinguishes that these are the peacekeepers, these are the people who are putting their lives on the line to make sure that we have order, no longer chaos. Mr. Speaker, this is an important piece of legislation, and I urge everyone to support this unanimously. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am sure that my friends across the aisle have their hearts in the right place, but we need to be clear that these messaging bills do little to nothing to protect our police officers. If we truly wanted to help our brave officers and first responders, we would pass sensible gun reform legislation. We would take guns out of the hands of the mentally ill and domestic abusers; not make it easier for them to acquire such weapons as my friends across the aisle have done on so many occasions. If we truly wanted to protect our officers and first responders, we would work diligently to provide them with the best mental health and wellness programs money can buy rather than leaving them to mend unseen wounds on their own. If my friends across the aisle truly wanted to help this country’s law enforcement officers, they would champion funding for community policing initiatives because I think we all know that a community that trusts its police officers, and police officers who trust their community, will live a far safer and richer life. I might add, my colleague DEBBIE  WASSERMAN SCHULTZ and I, along with law enforcement officials in south Florida, have been about the business of trying to make that a reality, and funding for those programs is particularly important to all of our communities. Mr. Speaker, we all applaud and thank our law enforcement officers and first responders for the brave and invaluable work that they do, day in and day out, in our communities. But we cannot bury our heads in the sand any longer and believe that, by simply passing messaging bills, we are actually making our communities safer for our officers or the citizens for whom they swear an oath to protect. We have heard outstanding comments from our friends and our colleagues who came to speak today. All of them spoke of heartfelt circumstances regarding fallen officers. 
And toward that end, there is absolutely nothing that I disagree with that has been said. I just simply ask that we take into consideration how we can best help and keep safe law enforcement officers. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I include in the RECORD four letters which I will briefly describe: The first is from the Major County Sheriffs of America, supporting the Thin Blue Line Act; the second is from the National Association of Police Organizations, Inc., again, supporting the Thin Blue Line Act; the third is from the National Fraternal Order of Police, supporting H.R. 115, the Thin Blue Line Act; and then finally, from the Sergeants Benevolent Association in strong support of H.R. 115, the Thin Blue Line Act. 
OFAMERICA , April 25, 2017. Hon. VERNBUCHANAN , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR CONGRESSMAN BUCHANAN : I write to you today on a matter of significant importance to the Major County Sheriffs of America (MCSA) and all of America’s law enforcement professionals. MCSA is an association of elected Sheriffs representing the Nation’s largest counties with populations of 500,000 or more. Collectively, we represent more than 100 million Americans. As Vice President in charge of Government Affairs for the MCSA, I am pleased to express our association’s support of your legislation, the Thin Blue Line Act. This legislation would make the murder of law enforcement officers, firefighters and other first responders an aggravating factor in capital punishment determinations. In 2016, one hundred fortyfour officers died in the line of duty and to date, line of duty deaths are up 10 percent. The targeting of law enforcement officers is unconscionable and those who commit such heinous acts should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Law enforcement officers and other first responders have the right to go home to their families at the end of their shifts. The Thin Blue Line Act is a step in the right direction and your work on this legislation is sincerely appreciated. We value your support and look forward to working with you in the future. MICHAEL J. B OUCHARD , Sheriff, Oakland County (MI), Vice President—Government Affairs. 
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF  POLICE ORGANIZATIONS , INC., Alexandria, VA, January 5, 2017. Hon. VERNBUCHANAN , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR CONGRESSMAN BUCHANAN : On behalf of the National Association of Police Organizations (NAPO), I am writing to you to express our strong support for the Thin Blue Line Act. NAPO is a coalition of police units and associations from across the United States that serves to advance the interests of America’s law enforcement through legislative and legal advocacy, political action, and education. Founded in 1978, NAPO now represents more than 1,000 police units and associations, including the Florida Police Benevolent Association, 241,000 sworn law enforcement officers, and more than 100,000 citizens who share a common dedication to fair and effective crime control and law enforcement. The Thin Blue Line Act increases penalties on those who harm or target for harm public safety officers by making the murder or attempted murder of a local police officer, firefighter, or first responder an aggravating factor in death penalty determinations. This bill is critical, as law enforcement officer assaults, injuries, and deaths have increased sharply in recent years. In 2016 alone, ambushstyle killings of law enforcement officers increased by 167 percent. Establishing stricter penalties for those who harm or target for harm law enforcement officers will deter crime. Any persons contemplating harming an office must know that they will face serious punishments. NAPO strongly believes that increased penalties make important differences in the attitudes of criminals toward public safety officers, and ensure protection for the community. We thank you for your continued support of the law enforcement community and we look forward to working with you to pass this important legislation. If we can provide any assistance, please feel free to contact me. Sincerely, WILLIAM J. JOHNSON , Esq., CAE, Executive Director. 
NATIONAL FRATERNAL  ORDER OF POLICE , Washington, DC, January 9, 2017. Hon. VERNON G. B UCHANAN , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR REPRESENTATIVE BUCHANAN : I am writing on behalf of the members of the Fraternal Order of Police to advise you of our strong support for H.R. 115, the ‘‘Thin Blue Line Act.’’ The ‘‘Thin Blue Line Act’’ increases the penalty for an individual who targets, kills, or attempts to kill a person who is a law enforcement officer, firefighter or any other public safety officer, while he or she was engaged in the performance of his or her official duties, because of the performance of his or her official duties, or because of his or her status as a public official or employee. Law enforcement officers have always faced threats while on duty but within the past few years, officers have become a target for violence solely because of the uniform they wear. As you know, the FOP has called upon Congress to expand the current Federal hate crimes law to include law enforcement officers for this very reason. Of the 63 deaths by gunfire suffered by law enforcement in 2016, 21 of them—that’s 33%— were ambush killings. These were deliberate and sadly successful efforts by individuals who set out to kill a police officer: The ambush attack against the Dallas Police Department; the deadliest day for law enforcement since 9/11 that saw 5 officers killed from gunfire; The ambush attack against members of the Baton Rouge Police Department that saw 3 officers killed from gunfire; The ambush attack against 2 Iowa police officers, Scott Martin and Anthony Beminio who were killed as they sat in their respective patrol cars; Officer Thomas Cottrell of the Danville Police Department (OH) was killed by ambush. All of these officers died because of the uniforms they were wearing. Those in our profession have always been in harm’s way. It is our job to protect others but it should not be ‘‘part of the job’’ to be a target of someone who is looking simply to kill a cop. We do not accept that our uniforms alone make us targets because someone was driven to rage over a perceived injustice or desires to strike a blow against our civil government. On behalf of more than 330,000 members of the Fraternal Order of Police, I want to thank you for introducing this legislation and amendment. If I can be of any further help, please do not hesitate to contact me or Executive Director Jim Pasco in my Washington office. Sincerely, CHUCK CANTERBURY , National President. 
OFNEWYORK, New York, NY, January 17, 2017. Hon. VERNBUCHANAN , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR REPRESENTATIVE BUCHANAN : I am writing on behalf of the more than 13,000 members of the Sergeants Benevolent Association of the New York City Police Department to advise you of our strong support for H.R. 115, the ‘‘Thin Blue Line Act.’’ For too long, members of the NYPD, along with law enforcement officers across this nation, have been targets. There has been a proliferation of groups and pundits impugning the motives and mission of law enforcement. They do so with no regard for the impact it has on our ability to protect life, property, and the freedoms we all hold dear. These constant attacks and the excessive, exaggerated rhetoric of antipolice elements have led some to declare an open season on police officers, and to welcome with cheers and praise the cowardly criminals who target law enforcement officers with acts of violence. We saw this first hand in New York City in December 2014, when Officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos were ambushed and senselessly murdered as they sat in their radio car on a Brooklyn street corner. Unfortunately, they are not alone. According to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, in 2016 there were 21 police officers killed in ambushstyle attacks. Shockingly, 20 of these officers were killed in eight multipleshooting death incidents— such as those that claimed the lives of 8 officers in Baton Rouge, LA and Dallas, TX—the highest total of any year since 1932. It is for these reasons and many others that the legislation you have introduced is so important. The ‘‘Thin Blue Line Act’’ would make the murder or attempted murder of police officers, prosecutors, firefighters, and other first responders at any level of government an aggravating factor in federal death penalty determinations. The bill applies to things like the interstate homicide of an officer, and is applicable whether the officer is murdered on duty, because of the performance of their duty, or because of their status as a public official. While we know that law enforcement officers will continue to be targets, regardless of their uniform and whether they are on duty or off, active or retired, this legislation sends the message that any action to target law enforcement officers for murder or violence will be met with the harshest of penalties. And that is a message that is long overdue. On behalf of the membership of our organization, thank you for your leadership on this important issue. We look forward to working with you to see it swiftly enacted into law. Please do not hesitate to contact me, or our Washington Representatives Andrew Siff and Chris Granberg if we can be of any further assistance. Sincerely, EDMULLINS , President. 
Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, the rule before the House today is simple. It provides for the consideration of the Thin Blue Line Act. We often talk of how resolute our law enforcement officers, firefighters, and first responders are in the face of immense danger. These heroic individuals charge into burning buildings, face down violence, and stand ready to jump into the fray at a moment’s notice. Simply putting on a uniform should not be one of those dangers. It is our duty to ensure that law enforcement officers, firefighters, and first responders have every tool at their disposal to do their job safely and effectively and to ensure they return home to their families. Countless spouses and children kiss their loved ones goodbye as they head to work, praying that it will not be their last day. We must never forget this as we work to ensure our police officers, firefighters, and first responders have every possible protection. There is no greater deterrent than the threat of losing one’s life. It is my hope that this legislation makes individuals who would consider taking the life of an officer stop to consider the consequences before going through with an attack; that we one day reach a point where our Nation’s finest can go to work without worrying about being targeted because of the uniform on their back; that one day our officers’ families have one less reason to worry. But until that day, we must continue standing resolutely against this evil. I ask my colleagues in the House to support our law enforcement community, firefighters, and first responders. Protect them from the heinous acts of violence. Give their families some assurance that we have their backs. Vote ‘‘yes’’ on the resolution, vote ‘‘yes’’ on the underlying bill, vote ‘‘yes’’ to give our law enforcement officers the protections they so desperately need. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman GOODLATTE and Chairman S ESSIONS for bringing this bill before us. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak about the rule for H.R. 115, ‘‘Thin Blue Line Act of 2017.’’ I would like to acknowledge and commend our law enforcement officers in the room today and across this country who have worked tirelessly on our behalf. I know personally the level of stress and challenges posed, because I have many friends that have and are currently serving my Congressional district in Houston and our country very well and with great distinction. I support our policies that are necessary so long as we are doing so with fairness, in accordance with our Constitution, and in a manner that is not duplicative of statutory measures already in place. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 115 imposes the death penalty for the killing or targeting of law enforcement officers, firefighters, and first responders as a 17th aggravated factor for homicide. H.R. 115 is duplicative and unnecessary because under 18 U.S.C. 3592(c), there already exists an aggravated factor that achieves the goal of punishing by death, a defendant who kills a law enforcement officer, thereby, making. This bill does nothing to protect our law enforcement; instead, it raises constitutional questions as to its validity because ‘‘targeting law enforcement’’ is substantially vague language that will subject many innocent lives to death, based purely on their desire to exercise their First Amendment rights about the well documented racial disparity in treatment throughout our communities. We must ensure that we do not create legislation of broad scope and vagueness that will have a chilling effect on an insular group. H.R. 115 is laced with a discriminatory effect that will trigger strict scrutiny under the 14th Amendment, and open the gateway for draconian habeas laws. This bill will create a slippery slope, further adding to recent turbulence caused by Attorney General Jeff Session’s memo and destroying whatever trust remains between law enforcement and communities. This bill sends troubling messages around the world about how we view and measure life in America in this 21st century. It is time to get serious about this epidemic and not hide behind vague language because ‘all’ lives matter, blue, black, brown, white. Mr. Speaker, while some may say that any adverse effects of the bill before us are de minimis, and thus, will not severely impact the racial disparity found in the use of the death penalty, it is neither the amount of words in this bill nor the amount of time used to utter them that is significant; rather, it is the discriminatory effect that will result in communities disproportionately impacted by the death penalty. Let us take for example, the case of Buck v. Davis, 580 U.S. lll (2017) where the death penalty verdict was based merely on ‘whether defendant is likely to commit acts of violence in the future’ and a psychologist opined that being black did increase the probability. The trial court reasoned that ‘‘introduction of any mention of race was de minimis,’’ in other words, insignificant. As Chief Justice John Roberts stated for the Court in reversing the lower court; ‘‘Some toxins can be deadly in small doses.’’ Mr. Speaker, H.R. 115 is extremely deadly because it will undoubtedly contribute to the continuation of welldocumented and pervasive racial disparities in the imposition of the death penalty. Since 1976 only 20 white prisoners have been executed for the murder of an African American victim, while an alarming 286 African American prisoners have been executed for the death of white victims, and 42% of African Americans currently remain on death row. Death penalty generally, has been criticized over the years by legal scholars and by Supreme Court Justices who have opined in several instances, that ‘the death penalty violates the Eighth Amendment, which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment.’ Even in 1958, when the Court first explicitly spoke about the death penalty as having constitutional challenges, it said in Trop v. Dulles, ‘‘the Eighth Amendment’s Cruel and Unusual Punishment clause must draw its meaning from the ‘evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society’ rather than from its original meaning.’’ Mr. Speaker, there is no argument that we have evolved and matured significantly since we first implemented the death penalty in the 1600s and thus, we must evaluate cautiously, laws that seek to further advance this flawed, astronomically costly and unjust practice. Capital punishment does not work; it is discriminatory and is used disproportionately against the poor, minorities and members of racial, ethnic and religious communities. Since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976, 82% of all executions have occurred in the South (37% in Texas alone), which contributed to the United States status as one of five countries in the world to account for the most executions in 2012. FBI data has shown that the death penalty is not a deterrent and in fact, 14 states without capital punishment in 2008, had homicide rates at or below the national rate. Taking another life does not stop violence. Like mandatory minimums, public opinion for the death penalty is currently at its lowest with a 42% opposition, evidenced in a 2016 Pew Research report, which found that the U.S. now dropped to number seven worldwide in countries accountable for the most executions. Mr. Speaker, over twothirds of the world’s countries have abolished the death penalty either in law or practice, and the U.S. is the only Western country that still uses the death penalty. Even family members of murder victims and other individuals who have witnessed live executions of death row inmates, particularly, in the recent botched and questionable executions, have called for a repeal of this practice and ask instead for alternative sentencing. In fact the death penalty solves nothing, and may even perpetuate the suffering of the parents, children, or siblings left behind. We do not need to expand the use of the death penalty where public opinion is at its lowest, but instead, implement sound and practical legislation that will save lives of our officers and the people they serve, where public opinion for this measure is extremely high. The material previously referred to by Mr. HASTINGS is as follows: 
ANAMENDMENT TO H. R ES. 323 O FFERED BY  MR. HASTINGS  At the end of the resolution, add the following new sections: SEC. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. 356) to establish the National Commission on Foreign Interference in the 2016 Election. The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. After general debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the fiveminute rule. All points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole 
rises and reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the bill. SEC. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the consideration of H.R. 356. 
THEVOTE ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION : WHAT ITREALLY MEANS  This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the House of Representatives (VI, 308–311), describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.’’ To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition’’ in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (RIllinois) said: ‘‘The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.’’ The Republican majority may say ‘‘the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.’’ But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here’s how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ‘‘Although it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.’’ In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled ‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ‘‘Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon.’’ Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Republican majority’s agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous question.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOODLATTE ) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. CONYERS ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia. 
Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 2266, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Virginia? There was no objection. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. We are here today to address an imposing threat to one of the foundational aspects of our economy, the national bankruptcy system. A wellfunctioning bankruptcy system provides relief to consumers, allows businesses to reorganize, preserves jobs, maximizes the value of assets, and ensures the proper allocation of resources. Our bankruptcy judiciary is the heartbeat that keeps this system moving. If that judiciary is strained and undermanned, that system will grind to a halt, eliminating the essential benefits it provides and sending repercussions throughout the economy. There are presently 29 temporary bankruptcy judgeships in the bankruptcy system with a lapse date of May 25. These temporary judgeships comprise more than 8 percent of the current bankruptcy judgeships nationwide. After May 25, 2017, these judgeships are at risk of being permanently lost, resulting in larger caseloads shared by fewer judges and causing further strain on our judiciary system. The Bankruptcy Judgeship Act of 2017 converts 14 of the existing temporary judgeships to permanent status and creates 4 new permanent bankruptcy judgeships in districts with some of the highest caseloads in the country. In fact, since the enactment of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, when a majority of the temporary judgeships were created, these districts have seen weighted filings increase by more than 55 percent. This bill is based on a comprehensive study of judicial resource needs conducted by the Judicial Conference and is supported by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. The Conference has assured us that its request comes only after it has taken steps to maximize all other alternatives to reduce judicial workloads. Moreover, the Conference has demonstrated that, while a district may have a permanent judgeship, it will not be filled unless completely necessary. Importantly, this bill will not present any new costs for the taxpayers. The Bankruptcy Judgeship Act includes an increase in the quarterly U.S. Trustee fees for large chapter 11 debtors, excluding small businesses. This fee increase is directly tied to the balance of the United States Trustee System Fund and will only be applied when the balance of the fund falls below a $200 million threshold, thereby ensuring that the Office of the U.S. Trustee is properly funded. These temporary bankruptcy judgeships were first set to lapse in 2010. Most have been extended for over 12 years, and some even longer. Despite this committee’s efforts to address the issue, to date there have been only limited, shortterm fixes. Additional permanent bankruptcy judgeships have not been authorized since 1992. The time has come for Congress to address bankruptcy judgeship needs more permanently. We need a bankruptcy system that has a sufficient number of judges to be able to manage the caseloads in a just, economical, and timely manner. The efficiency of this system is too important to our economy to risk. This bill helps ensure that we have such a system. I would like to thank Ranking Member CONYERS for his efforts on this issue. I would also like to thank Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law Subcommittee Chairman MARINO and Ranking Member C ICILLINE  for joining me as original cosponsors of the bill. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this important legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2266, the Bankruptcy Judgeship Act of 2017, which would make 14 temporary bankruptcy judgeships permanent and authorize four additional bankruptcy judgeships. I introduced this bipartisan legislation together with the support of Judiciary Committee Chairman GOODLATTE , along with Regulatory Reform, 
Commercial and Antitrust Law Subcommittee Chairman MARINO and Ranking Member CICILLINE . H.R. 2266 warrants the support from my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for several reasons. To begin with, this measure reflects the recommendations of the Judicial Conference of the United States with respect to the judicial resource needs of our Nation’s bankruptcy courts. These recommendations are themselves based on a comprehensive survey of all judicial circuits. This analysis consists of two components. The first is premised on a case weight formula devised by the Federal Judicial Center that is intended to provide a more accurate and useful measure of judicial workload than a mere count of case filings. The second component considers a broad array of other factors, including the nature of a court’s caseload, filing trends, demographic considerations, geographic issues, and economic aspects, among other items. Taken together, the resulting analysis provides a reliable basis upon which Congress may assess the necessity of authorizing additional judgeships and extending temporary judgeships. In addition, H.R. 2266 addresses an immediate need. All of the temporary judgeships addressed in H.R. 2266 will lapse as of May 25, which is just a week away. Once a temporary judgeship lapses, any ensuing vacancy may not be filled, which presents a serious concern. As the Judicial Conference warns, these bankruptcy courts would ‘‘face a serious and, in many cases, debilitating workload crisis if their temporary judgeships were to expire.’’ This is particularly true with respect to the Eastern District of Michigan, which has a weighted caseload well in excess of the minimum necessary to trigger additional judicial resources. Although Congress has previously extended temporary bankruptcy judgeships from time to time, some have also lapsed as a result of Congress’ failure to timely act. So to avoid future lapses in judicial resources, my legislation converts 14 of these temporary judgeships to permanent status. Finally, I am pleased to report that H.R. 2266 pays for all of these judgeships without having to require consumer debtors to bear that expense. The cost of this legislation is offset by increasing the quarterly fees that the largest 10 percent of chapter 11 debtors pay to the United States Trustee System Fund, a proposal initially made by the Obama administration as part of the President’s budget request for 2017. Specifically, the fee increase would apply only to chapter 11 debtors that have quarterly disbursements in excess of $1 million and only during the period when the fund has less than $200 million. For all of these various reasons, I support this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Delaware (Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER ). Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD a letter from the Judicial Conference. 
JUDICIAL CONFERENCE OF THE  UNITED STATES , Washington, DC, April 3, 2017. Hon. PAULD. R YAN, Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARMR. SPEAKER : On behalf of the Judicial Conference of the United States, I write to transmit the Conference’s bankruptcy judgeship recommendations and corresponding draft legislation for the 115th Congress. The Conference recommends to Congress that it authorize four additional permanent bankruptcy judgeships and convert 14 existing temporary bankruptcy judgeships to permanent status, as set forth in the enclosures. The preservation of current onboard resources in these courts is of great concern to the Conference. All 14 temporary bankruptcy judgeships included in the Conference’s recommendation have a lapse date of May 25, 2017. These bankruptcy courts would face a serious and, in many cases, debilitating workload crisis if these temporary judgeships were to expire. The U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, for example, would be crippled as five of their six authorized judgeships are temporary, all with the risk of expiring in 2017. Although bankruptcy filings nationwide have been declining in recent years, the districts included in these recommendations generally have experienced an increase in filings resulting in stress on existing judicial resources. Indeed, since the enactment of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act in 2005, Pub. L. No. 109–8—the last time additional judgeship resources were authorized for most of the courts included in the Conference’s recommendation—these districts have seen weighted filings increase by more than 55 percent. Section 152(b)(2) of title 28, United States Code, requires the Judicial Conference to recommend to Congress the authorization of additional bankruptcy judgeships. Following a formal survey of all judicial circuits, the Conference determines where additional resources are needed based upon the circuit councils’ requests and established criteria including each court’s workload and case filing statistics, geographic needs, and pertinent additional factors. As part of this survey, the Judicial Conference also considers requests from the circuits to convert or extend existing temporary bankruptcy judgeships based upon the district’s needs for stable judicial resources. The Judicial Conference respectfully requests that you give your full consideration to the Judiciary’s resource needs as identified in this proposed legislation. Additional caseload information concerning these recommendations is available upon request. If we may be of further assistance to you in this or any other matter, please do not hesitate to contact me or the Office of Legislative Affairs, Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. Sincerely, JAMES C. D UFF, Secretary. 
Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. CONYERS  and my colleagues on the House Judiciary Committee for their work on this important legislation and for bringing this bill to the floor today. An efficient bankruptcy system is important to the smooth functioning of our economy. The preservation and addition of these positions will add needed certainty to our legal system. As the Judicial Conference of the United States highlighted in their report to Congress, these resources will benefit individuals and corporations, and are necessary to keep this system working. I am proud of the work that the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware does to protect jobs, creditors, and economic engines in our communities across the country. This legislation is a perfect example of Congress hearing the needs of independent experts in the judiciary and acting in a bipartisan, collaborative manner to address a looming problem. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on other pressing problems for our constituents in such collaborative ways. I urge all of my colleagues to support the Bankruptcy Judgeship Act of 2017. b1415 Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I am pleased to note that H.R. 2266 is supported by the American Bar Association, the Federal Bar Association, the American College of Bankruptcy, and the National Conference of Bankruptcy Judges. I want to also express appreciation to our Judiciary chairman, Mr. GOODLATTE , to Chairman M ARINO and Ranking Member CICILLINE , as well as their staffs, for their cooperative efforts in working with me on this bipartisan legislation. Mr. Speaker, given the timesensitive nature of the temporary judgeships addressed by H.R. 2266 and the immediate need for additional bankruptcy judgeships to be authorized, it is my hope that our colleagues in the Senate will expeditiously consider this important legislation. I urge all of the Members here to support this measure. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, permanent bankruptcy judgeships have not been authorized since 1992. Over the past 25 years, we have limited our protection of the bankruptcy system to shortterm temporary fixes. A wellfunctioning bankruptcy system, however, is too important to our economy to risk. Now is the time for Congress to address bankruptcy judgeship needs more permanently. The Bankruptcy Judgeship Act is a measured, longterm solution carefully crafted and based on the welldeveloped recommendation of the Administrative Office of the Courts. Not only does it ensure the viability of our bankruptcy 
system, but it also addresses the funding concerns of the Office of the United States Trustee. This bill is a bipartisan measure that enjoys broad support from outside groups, including the American Bar Association, the Federal Bar Association, the National Conference of Bankruptcy Judges, and the American College of Bankruptcy. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this important legislation. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2266, the ‘‘Bankruptcy Judgeship Act of 2017,’’ which authorizes the establishment of four additional permanent bankruptcy judgeships and converts 14 temporary bankruptcy judgeships to permanent status. I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of this legislation, which is a necessary response to alleviate the strain on certain bankruptcy courts that have experienced a significant increase in bankruptcy filings over the past decade or more. Importantly, this legislation adopts the recommendations of the Judicial Conference of the United States, the national policymaking body of the federal courts, and does not impose additional fees on ordinary consumer debtors or small businesses. As the Conference notes in support of this measure, while bankruptcy filings have decreased nationwide, the bankruptcy courts that would receive permanent or new judgeships under this legislation ‘‘have seen weighted filings increase by more than 55 percent.’’ Furthermore, without this legislation, all 14 temporary judgeships covered by this bill will lapse later this month on May 25. Allowing a lapse in these judgeships would have potentially crippling effects on the bankruptcy system. For example, five of the six authorized judgeships of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the District of Delaware—the preferred venue for corporate reorganization under Chapter 11— are temporary. Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation. I thank Ranking Member CONYERS , the bill’s sponsor, for his leadership on this bill, along with Judiciary Committee Chairman GOODLATTE and Subcommittee Chairman M ARINO  for their support. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2266, the ‘‘Bankruptcy Judgeship Act of 2017.’’ H.R. 2266, the ‘‘Bankruptcy Judgeship Act of 2017,’’ would authorize four additional permanent bankruptcy judgeships and convert 14 temporary bankruptcy judgeships to permanent status based on the most recent recommendation of the Judicial Conference of the United States. H.R. 2266 was introduced on May 1, 2017 by Ranking Member JOHN CONYERS , Jr. (D– MI) together with Chairman BOBGOODLATTE  and Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law Chair TOM MARINO (R–PA) and Ranking Member D AVID CICILLINE (D–RI) as original cosponsors. This bipartisan legislation is timesensitive as the temporary judgeships are due to expire on May 25, 2017. No hearing has been held on this legislation. A bankruptcy judge may hear and determine all cases arising under the Bankruptcy Code and certain related proceedings. A district court, however, may withdraw—in whole or in part—any case or proceeding referred to a bankruptcy judge. If designated by the district to exercise such authority, a bankruptcy judge may conduct a jury trial on consent of all the parties. Currently pending before Congress is H.R. 244, the ‘‘Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017,’’ which extends for one year the temporary judgeships for the District of Delaware (two judgeships), the Southern District of Florida (two judgeships); the Eastern District of Michigan; the District of Puerto Rico; and the Eastern District of Virginia. In analyzing bankruptcy judgeship needs, the Judicial Conference employs, as a first step, a case weight formula devised by the Federal Judicial Center that is intended to provide a more accurate and useful measure of judicial workload than a mere count of filings does. Pursuant to Conference policy, ‘‘if a district’s annual weighted caseload per authorized judgeship is 1,500 weighted filings or more, the district will receive consideration for an additional judgeship.’’ With respect to the Conference’s current request for additional bankruptcy judgeships, the weighted case filings have increased by more than 55 percent for most of these districts since the last time additional judgeships were authorized in 2005, according to the Conference. In addition, all 14 of the temporary bankruptcy judgeships that the bill converts to permanent status are set to lapse as of May 25, 2017. To offset the cost of this legislation, H.R. 2266 increases the quarterly fee payable that chapter 11 debtors pay to the United States Trustee System Fund, but only with respect to debtors that have quarterly disbursements in excess of $1 million dollars during the period when the Fund has less than $200 million. This provision is substantively identical to a legislative proposal made by the prior Administration as represented in President Barack Obama’s budget request for 2017. Taken together, the resulting analysis provides a reliable basis upon which Congress may assess the necessity of authorizing additional judgeships and extending temporary judgeships. For all of these reasons, I support this legislation. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOODLATTE ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2266, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICERS’ BENEFITS IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2017 Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 419) to require adequate reporting on the Public Safety Officers’ Benefits program, and for other purposes.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOODLATTE ) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. CONYERS ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia. 
Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on S. 419, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Virginia? There was no objection. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, in 1976 Congress passed and the President signed into law the Public Safety Officers’ Benefits Act. The act was designed to offer peace of mind to men and women seeking careers as public safety officers, namely, that if something happened to them in their dangerous roles, their families would have support. It shows that America places enormous value on those in our communities who protect and serve, those whose response to danger is to face it headon and who put others before themselves daily. The PSOB program, administered by the Department of Justice, provides death benefits in the form of a one time financial payment to eligible survivors of public safety officers who have died in the line of duty. The program also provides benefits to public safety officers who are permanently and totally disabled because of injuries sustained in the line of duty. Finally, the PSOB program provides financial assistance to help pay higher education costs for the spouses and children of public safety officers who have died or been injured in the line of duty. 
It is a program that is meant to help the loved ones of fallen officers move forward in the aftermath of tragedies. Unfortunately, in recent years, the PSOB program has had some incidents of delay, and some families were left in the dark about the status of applications. These families were unable to move forward after their tragic losses, and we recognize that is not acceptable for a family that has sacrificed so much for their communities. Legislation was introduced in the last Congress, and again this Congress as S. 419, to address these regrettable failings. This bill provides for transparency in the processing of claims in the PSOB program and codifies measures to ensure the system is streamlined and operates in a fair manner. Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleagues for their work and strong support of these law enforcement families. I would especially like to commend the gentleman from New York (Mr. KING) for his unwavering support of the families of law enforcement. In his second inaugural address, President Lincoln reminded the American people: ‘‘To care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan.’’ This legislation is designed to do exactly that for the brave men and women in blue who protect and serve all of us every day. Mr. Speaker, yesterday this bill passed the Senate unanimously. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation today. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today also in strong support of S. 419, the Public Safety Officers’ Benefits Improvement Act, a bill which was just passed by the Senate yesterday. Each day, public safety officers put their lives on the line for the greater good of those whom they have taken an oath to serve and protect. Unfortunately, for some of these brave men and women, the ultimate sacrifice is made, and they will die while in the line of duty. The Public Safety Officers’ Benefits program, which is administered by the Justice Department’s Bureau of Justice Assistance, was established in 1976 to provide certain benefits to the families of these officers as well as to officers who are disabled as a result of their service. The death benefit is provided to eligible survivors of public safety officers whose deaths are a direct and proximate result of a traumatic injury sustained in the line of duty or death from certain heart attacks, strokes, and vascular ruptures sustained while on duty. An education benefit is provided to spouses and children of public safety officers killed or disabled while on duty. The program provides disability benefits to officers catastrophically injured in the line of duty. Mr. Speaker, I support S. 419 because it will significantly improve in several respects how benefits claims of fallen and injured officers are processed under the Public Safety Officers’ Benefits program. To begin with, the bill responds to the fact that, all too often, these officers and their families, after experiencing a loss of life or traumatic injury, must then endure months, sometimes years, of uncertainty and delay concerning their benefit claims. S. 419 requires the Bureau to give substantial weight to evidence and facts presented by a Federal, State, or local agency when determining eligibility for death or disability benefits. In addition, the measure authorizes the Bureau of Justice Assistance to establish rules based on standards for the Benefits program. These two requirements will help facilitate and expedite the Benefits program claims processed and, thereby, reduce the backlog of families awaiting a decision on their benefit claims. S. 419 also increases transparency of the Bureau’s claims processing. It requires, for example, the Bureau to publish and update a report with information on the status of pending claims regarding death, disability, and educational claims submitted, which will increase transparency. As we all know, transparency often leads to accountability, and this bill will make the Bureau of Justice Assistance and the Department of Justice more accountable to the families of fallen and traumatically injured officers, Congress, and the public as well. By requiring that updates or pending benefit claims be posted on public websites, Congress and the public will be able to evaluate the performance of the Bureau in timely processing pending claims. Finally, S. 419 will help ensure that families, who are the ultimate victims of those who sacrifice their lives for our protection, are not deprived of benefits they are due under the Public Safety Officers’ Benefits program. We all have a responsibility to take care of surviving family members when a first responder is tragically killed or injured in the line of duty. This bill is a step in the right direction of ensuring that families are not overly burdened and that the public is aware of how the Bureau and the Justice Department are handling claims submitted by family members. Mr. Speaker, the sacrifice of these first responders should not be taken for granted, and their families should not be unduly burdened when applying for benefits under the Public Safety Officers’ Benefits program. Accordingly, I support S. 419. I urge my colleagues to do the same. Mr. Speaker, it is particularly significant to note that S. 419 is being considered in the midst of National Police Week, a period dedicated to honor our Nation’s fallen law enforcement heroes. President John Kennedy, by proclamation signed in 1962, designated May 15 as Peace Officers Memorial Day and the week in which that date falls as National Police Week. S. 419 memorializes our commitment to public safety officers, who daily risk their lives for us, by removing barriers that prevent beneficiaries under the Benefits program from obtaining the benefits they so justly deserve. Families of our first responders deserve timely consideration of benefit claims when their loved ones give the ultimate sacrifice. Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this measure so that it may be sent to the President for signature. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. b1430 Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time only to say that I very much appreciate the work on both sides of the aisle, particularly the gentleman from Michigan. This is a good, bipartisan bill which should be passed today. I urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 419, the ‘‘Public Safety Officers’ Benefits Improvement Act of 2017’’. The Public Safety Officers’ Benefits program or PSOB Program provides death, disability, and education benefits to public safety officers and their survivors. The PSOB Program is administered by the Bureau of Justice Assistance, or BJA, which is a component of the Department of Justice. Under the Program, the death benefit is provided to eligible survivors of public safety officers whose death was a direct and proximate result of a traumatic injury sustained in the line of duty or certain workrelated heart attacks or strokes. The Program provides a disability benefit to public safety officers who have been permanently and totally disabled as the direct and proximate result of a catastrophic injury sustained in the line of duty, if that injury permanently prevents the officer from performing any gainful employment. The education benefit provides assistance to spouses and children of public safety officers killed or disabled in the line of duty who attend an educational program at an eligible education institution. All too often, these first responders and their families needlessly suffer months and years of uncertainty after experiencing a loss of life or a traumatic injury. This bill is a show of appreciation for the brave men and women who have made the ultimate sacrifice while serving in the line of duty as well as an expression of appreciation and support to the families of these first responders. S. 419 improves how the Department of Justice processes claims under the PSOB Program. The measure authorizes the Bureau of Justice Assistance to establish rules based on standards for the PSOB Program and it requires the Bureau of Justice Assistance to give substantial weight to evidence and facts 
presented by a federal, state, or local agency when determining eligibility for death or disability benefits. These two requirements will decrease the time in which claims are processed, thereby reducing the backlog of families awaiting a decision on their benefits claim. S. 419 also increases the level of transparency regarding claims processed by requiring the Bureau of Justice Assistance to publish and update information on the status of pending claims. By requiring that updates on pending benefits claims be posted on public websites, the public will be able to evaluate the performance of the Bureau of Justice Assistance in timely processing claims. As we honor our fallen heroes this week during National Police Week, I think now is as greater a time as any to ensure that we remove barriers that hinder their families from obtaining benefits we promised them when we enacted the Public Safety Officers’ Benefits Act. Accordingly, I strongly support S. 419. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOODLATTE ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 419. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

Freeman, editor of the Richmond NewsLeader newspaper of Richmond, Virginia, to help Virginia Indians obtain proper racial designation on birth records; (20) Collier stated that his office could not officially intervene because it had no responsibility for the Virginia Indians, ‘‘as a matter largely of historical accident’’, but was ‘‘interested in them as descendants of the original inhabitants of the region’’; (21) in 1948, the Veterans’ Education Committee of the Virginia State Board of Education approved Samaria Indian School to provide training to veterans; (22) that school was established and run by the Chickahominy Indian Tribe; (23) in 1950, the Chickahominy Indian Tribe purchased and donated to the Charles City County School Board land to be used to build a modern school for students of the Chickahominy and other Virginia Indian tribes; (24) the Samaria Indian School included students in grades 1 through 8; (25) in 1961, Senator Sam Ervin, Chairman of the Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights of the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate, requested Chickahominy Chief O.O.

Congress finds that— (1) during the initial months after Virginia was settled, the Rappahannock Indians had 3 encounters with Captain John Smith; (2) the first encounter occurred when the Rappahannock weroance (headman)— (A) traveled to Quiyocohannock (a principal town across the James River from Jamestown), where he met with Smith to determine whether Smith had been the ‘‘great man’’ who had previously sailed into the Rappahannock River, killed a Rappahannock weroance, and kidnapped Rappahannock people; and (B) determined that Smith was too short to be that ‘‘great man’’; (3) on a second meeting, during John Smith’s captivity (December 16, 1607, to January 8, 1608), Smith was taken to the Rappahannock principal village to show the people that Smith was not the ‘‘great man’’; (4) a third meeting took place during Smith’s exploration of the Chesapeake Bay (July to September 1608), when, after the Moraughtacund Indians had stolen 3 women from the Rappahannock King, Smith was prevailed upon to facilitate a peaceful truce between the Rappahannock and the Moraughtacund Indians; (5) in the settlement, Smith had the 2 Indian tribes meet on the spot of their first fight; (6) when it was established that both groups wanted peace, Smith told the Rappahannock King to select which of the 3 stolen women he wanted; (7) the Moraughtacund King was given second choice among the 2 remaining women, and Mosco, a Wighcocomoco (on the Potomac River) guide, was given the third woman; (8) in 1645, Captain William Claiborne tried unsuccessfully to establish treaty relations with the Rappahannocks, as the Rappahannocks had not participated in the Pamunkeyled uprising in 1644, and the English wanted to ‘‘treat with the Rappahannocks or any other Indians not in amity with Opechancanough, concerning serving the county against the Pamunkeys’’; (9) in April 1651, the Rappahannocks conveyed a tract of land to an English settler, Colonel Morre Fauntleroy; (10) the deed for the conveyance was signed by Accopatough, weroance of the Rappahannock Indians; (11) in September 1653, Lancaster County signed a treaty with Rappahannock Indians, the terms of which treaty— (A) gave Rappahannocks the rights of Englishmen in the county court; and (B) attempted to make the Rappahannocks more accountable under English law; (12) in September 1653, Lancaster County defined and marked the bounds of its Indian settlements; (13) according to the Lancaster clerk of court, ‘‘the tribe called the great Rappahannocks lived on the Rappahannock Creek just across the river above Tappahannock’’; (14) in September 1656, (Old) Rappahannock County (which, as of the date of enactment of this Act, is comprised of Richmond and Essex Counties, Virginia) signed a treaty with Rappahannock Indians that— (A) mirrored the Lancaster County treaty from 1653; and (B) stated that— (i) Rappahannocks were to be rewarded, in Roanoke, for returning English fugitives; and (ii) the English encouraged the Rappahannocks to send their children to live among the English as servants, who the English promised would be welltreated; (15) in 1658, the Virginia Assembly revised a 1652 Act stating that ‘‘there be no grants of land to any Englishman whatsoever de futuro until the Indians be first served with the proportion of 50 acres of land for each bowman’’; (16) in 1669, the colony conducted a census of Virginia Indians; (17) as of the date of that census— (A) the majority of the Rappahannocks were residing at their hunting village on the north side of the Mattaponi River; and (B) at the time of the visit, censustakers were counting only the Indian tribes along the rivers, which explains why only 30 Rappahannock bowmen were counted on that river; (18) the Rappahannocks used the hunting village on the north side of the Mattaponi River as their primary residence until the Rappahannocks were removed in 1684; (19) in May 1677, the Treaty of Middle Plantation was signed with England; (20) the Pamunkey Queen Cockacoeske signed on behalf of the Rappahannocks, ‘‘who were supposed to be her tributaries’’, but before the treaty could be ratified, the Queen of Pamunkey complained to the Virginia Colonial Council ‘‘that she was having trouble with Rappahannocks and Chickahominies, supposedly tributaries of hers’’; (21) in November 1682, the Virginia Colonial Council established a reservation for the Rappahannock Indians of 3,474 acres ‘‘about the town where they dwelt’’; (22) the Rappahannock ‘‘town’’ was the hunting village on the north side of the Mattaponi River, where the Rappahannocks had lived throughout the 1670s; (23) the acreage allotment of the reservation was based on the 1658 Indian land act, which translates into a bowman population of 70, or an approximate total Rappahannock population of 350; (24) in 1683, following raids by Iroquoian warriors on both Indian and English settlements, the Virginia Colonial Council ordered the Rappahannocks to leave their reservation and unite with the Nanzatico Indians at Nanzatico Indian Town, which was located across and up the Rappahannock River some 30 miles; (25) between 1687 and 1699, the Rappahannocks migrated out of Nanzatico, returning to the south side of the Rappahannock River at Portobacco Indian Town; (26) in 1706, by order of Essex County, Lieutenant Richard Covington ‘‘escorted’’ the Portobaccos and Rappahannocks out of Portobacco Indian Town, out of Essex County, and into King and Queen County where they settled along the ridgeline between the Rappahannock and Mattaponi Rivers, the site of their ancient hunting village and 1682 reservation; (27) during the 1760s, 3 Rappahannock girls were raised on Thomas Nelson’s Bleak Hill Plantation in King William County; (28) of those girls— (A) one married a Saunders man; (B) one married a Johnson man; and (C) one had 2 children, Edmund and Carter Nelson, fathered by Thomas Cary Nelson; (29) in the 19th century, those Saunders, Johnson, and Nelson families are among the core Rappahannock families from which the modern Tribe traces its descent; (30) in 1819 and 1820, Edward Bird, John Bird (and his wife), Carter Nelson, Edmund Nelson, and Carter Spurlock (all Rappahannock ancestors) were listed on the tax roles of King and Queen County and taxed at the county poor rate; (31) Edmund Bird was added to the tax roles in 1821; (32) those tax records are significant documentation because the great majority of pre 1864 records for King and Queen County were destroyed by fire; (33) beginning in 1819, and continuing through the 1880s, there was a solid Rappahannock presence in the membership at Upper Essex Baptist Church; (34) that was the first instance of conversion to Christianity by at least some Rappahannock Indians; (35) while twentysix identifiable and traceable Rappahannock surnames appear on the pre1863 membership list, and twenty eight were listed on the 1863 membership roster, the number of surnames listed had declined to twelve in 1878 and had risen only slightly to fourteen by 1888; (36) a reason for the decline is that in 1870, a Methodist circuit rider, Joseph Mastin, secured funds to purchase land and construct St. Stephens Baptist Church for the Rappahannocks living nearby in Caroline County; (37) Mastin referred to the Rappahannocks during the period of 1850 to 1870 as ‘‘Indians, having a great need for moral and Christian guidance’’; (38) St. Stephens was the dominant tribal church until the Rappahannock Indian Baptist Church was established in 1964; (39) at both churches, the core Rappahannock family names of Bird, Clarke, Fortune, Johnson, Nelson, Parker, and Richardson predominate; (40) during the early 1900s, James Mooney, noted anthropologist, maintained correspondence with the Rappahannocks, surveying them and instructing them on how to formalize their tribal government; (41) in November 1920, Speck visited the Rappahannocks and assisted them in organizing the fight for their sovereign rights; (42) in 1921, the Rappahannocks were granted a charter from the Commonwealth of Virginia formalizing their tribal government; (43) Speck began a professional relationship with the Tribe that would last more than 30 years and document Rappahannock history and traditions as never before; (44) in April 1921, Rappahannock Chief George Nelson asked the Governor of Virginia, Westmoreland Davis, to forward a proclamation to the President of the United States, along with an appended list of tribal members and a handwritten copy of the proclamation itself; (45) the letter concerned Indian freedom of speech and assembly nationwide; (46) in 1922, the Rappahannocks established a formal school at Lloyds, Essex County, Virginia; (47) prior to establishment of the school, Rappahannock children were taught by a tribal member in Central Point, Caroline County, Virginia; (48) in December 1923, Rappahannock Chief George Nelson testified before Congress appealing for a $50,000 appropriation to establish an Indian school in Virginia; (49) in 1930, the Rappahannocks were engaged in an ongoing dispute with the Commonwealth of Virginia and the United States Census Bureau about their classification in the 1930 Federal census; (50) in January 1930, Rappahannock Chief Otho S. Nelson wrote to Leon Truesdell, Chief Statistician of the United States Census Bureau, asking that the 218 enrolled Rappahannocks be listed as Indians; (51) in February 1930, Truesdell replied to Nelson saying that ‘‘special instructions’’ were being given about classifying Indians; (52) in April 1930, Nelson wrote to William M. Steuart at the Census Bureau asking about the enumerators’ failure to classify his 
people as Indians, saying that enumerators had not asked the question about race when they interviewed his people; (53) in a followup letter to Truesdell, Nelson reported that the enumerators were ‘‘flatly denying’’ his people’s request to be listed as Indians and that the race question was completely avoided during interviews; (54) the Rappahannocks had spoken with Caroline and Essex County enumerators, and with John M.W. Green at that point, without success; (55) Nelson asked Truesdell to list people as Indians if he sent a list of members; (56) the matter was settled by William Steuart, who concluded that the Bureau’s rule was that people of Indian descent could be classified as ‘‘Indian’’ only if Indian ‘‘blood’’ predominated and ‘‘Indian’’ identity was accepted in the local community; (57) the Virginia Vital Statistics Bureau classed all nonreservation Indians as ‘‘Negro’’, and it failed to see why ‘‘an exception should be made’’ for the Rappahannocks; (58) therefore, in 1925, the Indian Rights Association took on the Rappahannock case to assist the Rappahannocks in fighting for their recognition and rights as an Indian tribe; (59) during the Second World War, the Pamunkeys, Mattaponis, Chickahominies, and Rappahannocks had to fight the draft boards with respect to their racial identities; (60) the Virginia Vital Statistics Bureau insisted that certain Indian draftees be inducted into Negro units; (61) finally, 3 Rappahannocks were convicted of violating the Federal draft laws and, after spending time in a Federal prison, were granted conscientious objector status and served out the remainder of the war working in military hospitals; (62) in 1943, Frank Speck noted that there were approximately 25 communities of Indians left in the Eastern United States that were entitled to Indian classification, including the Rappahannocks; (63) in the 1940s, Leon Truesdell, Chief Statistician, of the United States Census Bureau, listed 118 members in the Rappahannock Tribe in the Indian population of Virginia; (64) on April 25, 1940, the Office of Indian Affairs of the Department of the Interior included the Rappahannocks on a list of Indian tribes classified by State and by agency; (65) in 1948, the Smithsonian Institution Annual Report included an article by William Harlen Gilbert entitled, ‘‘Surviving Indian Groups of the Eastern United States’’, which included and described the Rappahannock Tribe; (66) in the late 1940s and early 1950s, the Rappahannocks operated a school at Indian Neck; (67) the State agreed to pay a tribal teacher to teach 10 students bused by King and Queen County to Sharon Indian School in King William County, Virginia; (68) in 1965, Rappahannock students entered Marriott High School (a White public school) by Executive order of the Governor of Virginia; (69) in 1972, the Rappahannocks worked with the Coalition of Eastern Native Americans to fight for Federal recognition; (70) in 1979, the Coalition established a pottery and artisans company, operating with other Virginia tribes; (71) in 1980, the Rappahannocks received funding through the Administration for Native Americans of the Department of Health and Human Services to develop an economic program for the Tribe; and (72) in 1983, the Rappahannocks received State recognition as an Indian tribe.

Congress finds that— (1) from 1607 until 1646, Nansemond Indians— (A) lived approximately 30 miles from Jamestown; and (B) were significantly involved in English Indian affairs; (2) after 1646, there were 2 sections of Nansemonds in communication with each other, the Christianized Nansemonds in Norfolk County, who lived as citizens, and the traditionalist Nansemonds, who lived further west; (3) in 1638, according to an entry in a 17th century sermon book still owned by the Chief’s family, a Norfolk County Englishman married a Nansemond woman; (4) that man and woman are lineal ancestors of all of members of the Nansemond Indian tribe alive as of the date of enactment of this Act, as are some of the traditionalist Nansemonds; (5) in 1669, the 2 Nansemond sections appeared in Virginia Colony’s census of Indian bowmen; (6) in 1677, Nansemond Indians were signatories to the Treaty of 1677 with the King of England; (7) in 1700 and 1704, the Nansemonds and other Virginia Indian tribes were prevented by Virginia Colony from making a separate peace with the Iroquois; (8) Virginia represented those Indian tribes in the final Treaty of Albany, 1722; (9) in 1711, a Nansemond boy attended the Indian School at the College of William and Mary; (10) in 1727, Norfolk County granted William Bass and his kinsmen the ‘‘Indian privileges’’ of clearing swamp land and bearing arms (which privileges were forbidden to other nonWhites) because of their Nansemond ancestry, which meant that Bass and his kinsmen were original inhabitants of that land; (11) in 1742, Norfolk County issued a certificate of Nansemond descent to William Bass; (12) from the 1740s to the 1790s, the traditionalist section of the Nansemond tribe, 40 miles west of the Christianized Nansemonds, was dealing with reservation land; (13) the last surviving members of that section sold out in 1792 with the permission of the Commonwealth of Virginia; (14) in 1797, Norfolk County issued a certificate stating that William Bass was of Indian and English descent, and that his Indian line of ancestry ran directly back to the early 18th century elder in a traditionalist section of Nansemonds on the reservation; (15) in 1833, Virginia enacted a law enabling people of European and Indian descent to obtain a special certificate of ancestry; (16) the law originated from the county in which Nansemonds lived, and mostly Nansemonds, with a few people from other counties, took advantage of the new law; (17) a Methodist mission established around 1850 for Nansemonds is currently a standard Methodist congregation with Nansemond members; (18) in 1901, Smithsonian anthropologist James Mooney— (A) visited the Nansemonds; and (B) completed a tribal census that counted 61 households and was later published; (19) in 1922, Nansemonds were given a special Indian school in the segregated school system of Norfolk County; (20) the school survived only a few years; (21) in 1928, University of Pennsylvania anthropologist Frank Speck published a book on modern Virginia Indians that included a section on the Nansemonds; and (22) the Nansemonds were organized formally, with elected officers, in 1984, and later applied for and received State recognition.

Eminent domain may not be used to acquire lands in fee or in trust for an Indian tribe recognized under this Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. WITTMAN ) and the gentleman from Florida (Mr. SOTO) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia. 
Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Virginia? There was no objection. Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. H.R. 984, the Thomasina E. Jordan Indian Tribes of Virginia Federal Recognition Act of 2017 will extend Federal recognition to the Chickahominy Tribe, the Eastern Chickahominy Tribe, the Upper Mattaponi Tribe, the Rappahannock Tribe, the Monacan Indian Nation, and the Nansemond Indian Tribe. My district, the First Congressional District of Virginia, includes the historical tribal areas of several of these tribes. The six tribes are culturally and historically significant to the Commonwealth of Virginia and to the story of America itself. Ancestors from these tribes populated coastal Virginia when Captain John Smith settled at Jamestown in 1607. They were also the first of the American Indian tribes that entered into peace agreements, actually entered into peace agreements with the Crown of England because United States, at that time, was not formally a nation yet. So they were peaceloving even before the United States came of age. Also, the connections that these tribes have with the Nation and the settlement of the Nation are extraordinarily important. If you go back in time, you know that six of these tribes were part of the Powhatan Nation. We know famously that Pocahontas was a member of the Powhatan Nation, and also there in Werowocomoco, there on the shores of the York River, saved the life of Captain John Smith; so we can see the significant impact that these tribes have had on the Nation’s history and where we are today. They are called firstcontact tribes because they were the first tribes to contact the settlers as they came here to America to settle our land. In Jamestown there, the first connection they had was with these Virginia tribes. These firstcontact tribes, as I have said, are intertwined with the birth of our Nation over 400 years ago, and they continue today to preserve a culture and heritage integral to Virginia and to the Nation. They are very proud of their history, and the tribal members today do much for our State in many different ways, as well as for our Nation, and are passionate about making sure that they are recognized, as other tribes are, in their critical nature to the government and Nation that we have today. It is notable that many tribal members have also served our country bravely as part of the United States military. It is unacceptable that these tribal members, who selflessly and proudly served under the American flag during our Nation’s conflicts, from the Revolutionary War to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, have not been officially recognized by the Federal Government. Congressional recognition is also necessary because the record requirements by the Bureau of Indian Affairs administration process unfairly penalizes these Virginia tribes. Tribal records of these tribes were destroyed during the Civil War when many eastern Virginia courthouses were destroyed. Additionally, early 20th century Virginia racial purity laws barred Native Americans from identifying as Indian on State issued birth certificates. It is for these reasons that I am proud to have worked along with several of my Virginia colleagues in the House and the Senate to introduce this legislation that has received wide bipartisan support, including from former and current Virginia Governors who strongly supported this effort to recognize these tribes. During the 114th Congress, the Subcommittee on Indian, Insular, and Alaska Native Affairs held a hearing on Virginia tribal recognition. Most recently, the committee marked up and reported the Virginia tribal recognition as part of Chairman BISHOP ’s Tribal Recognition Act in December. During the legislative hearing, the previous administration’s Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs testified that they did not object to action by Congress to enact the bill, given Congress’ authority under the Constitution to recognize tribes. At the hearing, members of the committee also expressed bipartisan support for recognizing these six firstcontact Virginia tribes. Additionally, this legislation previously passed the House in both the 110th and the 111th Congress. It is clear that there is wide bipartisan support for this issue across the Commonwealth, across our Nation, and here in Congress. Federal recognition would acknowledge and protect historical and cultural identities of these tribes for the benefit of all Americans. It would affirm the governmenttogovernment relationship between the United States and these firstcontact Virginia tribes as a matter of respect out of what they did in working to make this Nation what it is today and also in helping create opportunities to enhance and protect the wellbeing of tribal members. This legislation will also provide certainty and finality on the gaming issue for the six Virginia tribes. H.R. 984 clearly prohibits the tribes from conducting gaming activities under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. The Federal Government’s failure to recognize the Virginia tribes is a serious injustice, but it is one that we here today can correct. Congress retains the authority to recognize Indian tribes, and I believe that it is right and just for us to continue to exercise that authority under the Constitution and recognize these six firstcontact Virginia tribes. These firstcontact tribes deserve equity and parity under the law. It is absolutely long overdue. I urge your support for H.R. 984. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. We are here today, more than 400 years after the first English settlers landed in what became Jamestown, Virginia, to finally establish a governmenttogovernment relationship with the Indian tribes who greeted those settlers. The Virginia tribes that are recognized in this bill have treaties with the King of England that date back to the early 1600s. Their ancestors were there at Jamestown and facilitated the very founding and early development of our Nation. These tribes have been unable to claim their rightful Indian identity in relation to the Federal Government, due in great part to the machinations 
of one man, Walter Ashby Plecker, the State registrar for the Commonwealth in the early 20th century. Plecker, an avowed White supremacist, ran Virginia’s Bureau of Vital Statistics for over 34 years. From 1912 to 1947, Plecker set out to rid the Commonwealth of any documents that recorded the existence of Indians or Indian tribes living therein. He was instrumental in ensuring passage of the Racial Integrity Act in 1924, making it illegal for individuals to classify themselves or their newborn children as Indian. But he went even further and spent decades removing the category of Indian from birth and marriage records. Although this paper genocide, as it has been termed, attempted to erase the Virginia Indians from history, the tribal members held firm to their culture and to their identity. In 1997, State legislation was passed to help correct the records of the Virginia Indians. Soon after, the Virginia Indians began their quest for Federal recognition. Passage of this legislation will finally put to end their 20year struggle. I commend and thank our colleague from Virginia (Mr. WITTMAN ) for bringing forth this bill. I also want to give special thanks to former Congressman Jim Moran, who spent several years in this body championing this legislation and tirelessly working toward its goals. Mr. Speaker, it is time to finally put this issue to rest and correct a historical injustice by extending Federal recognition to these six Virginia tribes. I urge all of my colleagues to join me and support this bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. MCEACHIN ). Mr. MCEACHIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman SOTOfor yielding. I also want to thank the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. WITTMAN ), my friend and colleague, for bringing this legislation forward. I rise, 410 years after the first English settlers landed in what became Jamestown, Virginia, to finally grant Federal recognition to some of the Native American tribes who met those early settlers. Today, with the passage of H.R. 984, we are recognizing the rightful status of Virginia tribes in our national history. It is largely a historical accident that the tribes of Virginia are not recognized. The six tribes have treaties that predate the United States, but because of the systematic destruction of their records, they have been denied Federal recognition for the services that come along with it. We are fixing this injustice today by passing H.R. 984. Federal recognition will provide what the government has long denied: legal protections and financial obligations. Federal recognition will provide financial assistance for the tribes’ social services, their healthcare, their housing needs, educational opportunities, and repatriation of the remains of their ancestors in a respectful manner. These opportunities will allow Virginia’s tribes to flourish culturally and economically. These opportunities will lead to a better, brighter future for the next generation. Federal recognition is an issue I have cared deeply about since my time in the Virginia General Assembly. I am proud and humbled to cosponsor this legislation. We have waited too long, Mr. Speaker, to recognize Virginia tribes. I urge my colleagues to support passage. Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY ). Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Virginia for his leadership on this very important piece of legislation, important not only for the Commonwealth of Virginia but for the rights of all Americans, beginning with the original Americans. When we talk about the Americas, we sometimes talk as if the Americas began in the early 17th century, with Jamestown, with Plymouth, and with the subsequent colonization of the East Coast. But, in fact, there were millions of Native Americans here long before European colonization. They had rich culture. They had incredible artistic expression. They had a way of life. It was disrupted by European colonization. As if some genocidal policies of the 18th and 19th century weren’t bad enough in terms of their terrible impact on this population, the racism my friend from Florida described that went on shamefully in the Commonwealth of Virginia in the early 20th century deeply compounded the problem by denying the identity of individuals and communities as Native American so that the battle for them to have their rights restored that my good friend, Mr. WITTMAN, is trying to right today was made so much more difficult and complex. b1445 If I destroy your identity papers, I destroy your ability to prove who you are. That is the dilemma and that is the catch22 in which we find ourselves today. This is a matter of simple justice. This is a matter of Congress righting a wrong. It is a proud moment to stand shoulder to shoulder, Republican and Democrat from Virginia, to want to right this wrong. And I know we are joined by all of our colleagues and former colleagues, including our friend Jim Moran for his great leadership in this matter. So I am proud to support the efforts of my colleague. I urge all Members of the House to support this legislation, and let’s turn a page in history the right way. Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, it is time to right this wrong injustice and bring truth back into our history. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I would like to also recognize the leaders of our Virginia tribes today. Several of those members are with us here in the gallery today to witness a long overdue action by Congress to formally recognize those Virginia tribes. Those Virginia tribal leaders have been tremendous in their resolve and in their support to make sure that we right this injustice. I want to thank them for what they have done. They have been tireless in their support for the things that they have done to make sure that we all appreciate and understand the great history with these Virginia tribes. I would be remiss if I didn’t mention that those members of the tribes today, a number are getting smaller and smaller. And this is really only about making sure we are doing what is right for those tribes and making sure that they get that formal recognition because of many injustices that have happened in the past. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 984. And I believe with the passage out of the House—and I urge my colleagues in the Senate to do likewise—today will be a very proud day for our Nation in coming about and recognizing these Virginia firstcontact tribes that has been long overdue. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 984, the Thomasina E. Jordan Indian Tribes of Virginia Federal Recognition Act and I want to thank my fellow Virginian, Congressman ROBWITTMAN for intro ducing this bill, and the gentleman from Utah, Chairman Bishop and the gentleman from Arizona, Ranking Member GRIJALVA , for their leadership and cooperation in bringing the bill to the floor. Four hundred ten years ago, the first English settlers founded Jamestown, Virginia. The founding of Jamestown represented a first step in the creation of our great Republic, and the success of this colony is owed to the help of the indigenous people of Virginia. With this assistance, the Jamestown colony weathered a difficult first few years in the New World before expanding, with English colonists pushing further inland. The same Native Americans who had helped those first settlers were pushed from their land without compensation. Treaties, many of which precede our own constitution, were made in an effort to compensate Virginia’s Native Americans. Unfortunately, as history has repeatedly shown, these treaties were not often honored. Like many other Native Americans, and many other groups who were not white, and despite their contributions to the founding of our nation, Virginia’s Indian Tribes were pushed to the fringes of society. They were deprived of their land, prevented from getting an education, and denied a role in our society. Virginia’s Native Americans were denied their 
very fundamental human rights and the very freedoms and liberties enshrined in our Constitution. This bill will finally grant federal recognition to the Chickahominy Tribe, the Eastern Chickahominy Tribe, the Upper Mattaponi Tribe, the Rappahannock Tribe, the Monacan Indian Nation, and the Nansemond Tribe. Federal recognition of Virginia’s Indian Tribes will promote tribal economic development and allow Virginia’s tribes to flourish culturally. Federal recognition, a process that has been ongoing for these tribes for over 30 years, will lead to a bright future for a whole new generation of tribe members. Mr. Speaker, I was a member of the Virginia General Assembly in 1983 when many of these tribes first gained formal recognition from the Commonwealth of Virginia, and I am proud to be here today supporting federal recognition for these tribes. The time has come for this Congress to act, and I therefore urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. MCEACHIN. Mr. Speaker, earlier today, I spoke during debate on H.R. 984, the Thomasina E. Jordan Indian Tribes of Virginia Federal Recognition Act of 2017. I rise, 410 years after the first English settlers landed in what became Jamestown, Virginia, to finally grant federal recognition to some of the Native American tribes who met those early settlers. Today, with passage of H.R. 984, we are recognizing the rightful status of Virginia’s tribes in our national history. These six tribes have treaties that predate the United States but because of the systemic destruction of their records, they have been denied federal recognition and the services that come along with it. We are fixing this injustice by passing H.R. 984. Federal recognition will provide what the government has long denied—legal protections and financial obligations. Federal recognition will provide financial assistance for the tribes’ social services, health care and housing needs, educational opportunities, and repatriation of the remains of their ancestors in a respectful manner. These opportunities will allow Virginia’s tribes to flourish culturally and economically. These opportunities will lead to a better, brighter future for the next generation. Federal recognition is an issue I have cared about deeply since my time in the Virginia General Assembly and I am a proud cosponsor this legislation. We have waited too long to recognize Virginia’s tribes. I urge my colleagues to support passage. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. WITTMAN ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 984. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. MODERNIZING GOVERNMENT TECHNOLOGY ACT OF 2017 Mr. HURD. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2227) to modernize Government information technology, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 2227 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Modernizing Government Technology Act of 2017’’ or the ‘‘MGT Act’’. 
(a) F INDINGS .—The Congress finds the following: (1) The Federal Government spends nearly 75 percent of its annual information technology funding on operating and maintaining existing legacy information technology systems. These systems can pose operational risks, including rising costs and inability to meet mission requirements. These systems also pose security risks, including the inability to use current security best practices, such as data encryption and multifactor authentication, making these systems particularly vulnerable to malicious cyber activity. (2) In 2015, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) designated Improving the Management of IT Acquisitions and Operations to its biannual High Risk List and identified as a particular concern the increasing level of information technology spending on operations and maintenance, making less funding available for development or modernization. The GAO also found the Government has spent billions on failed and poorly performing information technology investments due to a lack of effective oversight. (3) The Federal Government must modernize Federal IT systems to mitigate existing operational and security risks. (4) The efficiencies, cost savings, and greater computing power offered by modernized solutions, such as cloud computing, have the potential to— (A) eliminate inappropriate duplication and reduce costs; (B) address the critical need for cybersecurity by design; and (C) move the Federal Government into a broad, digitalservices delivery model that will transform the ability of the Federal Government to meet mission requirements and deliver services to the American people. (b) PURPOSES .—The purposes of this Act are the following: (1) Assist the Federal Government in modernizing Federal information technology to mitigate current operational and security risks. (2) Incentivize cost savings in Federal information technology through modernization. (3) Accelerate the acquisition and deployment of modernized information technology solutions, such as cloud computing, by addressing impediments in the areas of funding, development, and acquisition practices.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. HURD) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. 
Mr. HURD. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. HURD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in support of my bill, H.R. 2227, the Modernizing Government Technology Act, or the MGT Act. Each year, the Federal Government spends over $80 billion a year on information technology, with nearly 75 percent of that directed just towards operating and maintaining existing IT systems. Couple this with innovation and management strategies that are decades behind the private sector when it comes to IT, and the increasing cost of maintaining these aging and insecure systems, this is unsustainable. These systems pose increasing operational and security risks for the Federal Government, as we saw with the devastating OPM data breach, which impacted over 20 million people. As we see cybersecurity attacks on the rise across the globe, it is imperative that we modernize and protect our information technology systems. The American people deserve better from their government, especially on an issue that is completely solvable. Our government needs to be able to introduce cuttingedge technology into their networks to improve operational efficiency and decrease operational cost. This bipartisan IT reform package is designed to reduce wasteful IT spending and strengthen information security by accelerating the Federal Government’s transition to modern technology, like cloud computing. This legislation is an innovative solution and a tremendous step forward in strengthening our digital infrastructure. This bill passed the House on voice vote last year and passed out of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee by voice this year. Unfortunately, we ran out of time on this bill last Congress with the Senate, but we have an opportunity to act this year with an improved bill. H.R. 2227 authorizes two types of funds to modernize legacy IT and incentivize IT savings in Federal agencies. The bill authorizes funds within individual CFO Act agencies, and it authorizes a centralized fund located within Treasury and overseen by OMB. The two funds will incentivize IT savings and reward costsensitive and responsible chief information officers. Under MGT, savings obtained by Federal agencies, by doing things like streamlining IT systems, replacing legacy products, and transitioning to cloud computing, can be placed in a working capital fund that can be accessed for up to 3 years for further modernization efforts. This approach eliminates the traditional useitorloseit approach that has plagued government technology for decades. This approach to technology investments will transform government technology by keeping our information and digital infrastructure secure from cyber attacks while saving billions of taxpayer dollars. This important bill has enjoyed widespread support from colleagues in the House and the Senate. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member, the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. KELLY ), my friend, for her support on this. I thank the gentleman from the Commonwealth of Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY ) for all he has done. I especially thank Chairman CHAFFETZ  and Ranking Member CUMMINGS for their support. The majority leader, KEVIN MCCARTHY, and the minority whip, S TENY  HOYER , have been vital to the success of getting this bill moving forward. I thank all of the other Members as well who have provided support and leadership for the MGT Act. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  letters of support from a number of industry and trade groups in support of this bill. 
PROFESSIONAL SERVICES COUNCIL , Arlington, VA, April 27, 2017. Hon. JERRY MORAN , U.S. Senator, Washington, DC. Hon. WILLHURD, Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Subcommittee on Information Technology, Washington, DC. Hon. TOMUDALL , U.S. Senator, Washington, DC. Hon. GERRY CONNOLLY , Ranking Member, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Subcommittee on Government Operations, Washington, DC. DEARSENATORS MORAN AND UDALL , CHAIRMAN HURD AND RANKING MEMBER CONNOLLY : On behalf of the over 400 member companies of the Professional Services Council (PSC), I write to convey our association’s strong support for your legislation, the Modernizing Government Technology Act of 2017 (the ‘‘MGT Act’’), and to thank you for your continued leadership to advance policies that will upgrade the government’s legacy IT systems. The MGT Act would establish a critical source of dependable funding for federal agencies to invest in IT system modernization, incentivize agencies to utilize the funds for agency priorities, and accelerate the transition to the cloud. PSC supports the Act because we believe the bill will help make government more effective and its networks more secure, while reducing overall costs. Enactment would be a muchneeded and critical step to begin addressing the immense challenges associated with upgrading federal information technology systems and limiting cybersecurity vulnerabilities inherent in the government’s outdated computer systems. PSC looks forward to working with you to see this legislation enacted. Thank you for your leadership and attention to this important issue. If you or your colleagues have any questions or need additional information, please do not hesitate to reach out to me. Yours Respectfully, DAVID J. B ERTEAU , President and CEO. 
FORPUBLIC SECTOR , Washington, DC, April 28, 2017. Re The Modernizing Government Technology Act of 2017 (MGT Act). Hon. WILLHURD, Chairman, Subcommittee on Information Technology, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. ROBIN KELLY , Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Information Technology, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR CHAIRMAN HURD AND RANKING MEMBERKELLY : On behalf of the member companies of the Information Technology Alliance for Public Sector (ITAPS), I am writing to express our strong support for the Modernizing Government Technology (MGT) Act of 2017. We appreciate all the time, effort, and commitment you have dedicated to reforming how the federal government funds and invests in information technology (IT). This bipartisan, bicameral legislation would enable new means to fund IT solutions, including for IT modernization efforts, and provide 
funding availability to permit government IT to better keep pace with innovation. We commend your staffs for collaborating and working with ITAPS and our members. The time is ripe to transform the way the federal government acquires IT, and this bipartisan legislation is a substantial step toward that transformation. The federal government today spends about $60 billion dollars annually sustaining their existing IT and their funding streams allow them to either continue to sustain those systems or modernize, but they do not have the funding to do both at the same time. The MGT Act creates the necessary new options for agencies to be able to sustain what is necessary for their mission, while investing in modernizing and transforming IT capabilities in the federal government for the digital era. Again, thank you for the engagement you and your staff afforded ITAPS and our members. We look forward to continuing to work with you further as the bill advances through the legislative process. Sincerely, A.R. ‘‘TREY’’ HODGKINS , III, CAE, Senior Vice President, Public Sector. 
Adobe applauds Congressman Will Hurd (Texas) for reintroducing the Modernizing Government Technology Act, H.R. 2227, and urges Congress to move quickly to enact this important piece of legislation. Modernizing the federal IT infrastructure is crucial to ensuring a stronger cyber security foundation. The federal government on average spends nearly 80 percent of its IT budget on servicing and maintaining legacy IT systems, drowning out investments in newer technologies that often deliver better, more secure and less costly services to citizens.— Adobe VP & Public Sector Chief Technology Officer John Landwehr

At Amazon Web Services, we believe in putting our customers first by giving them the right tools to enable success, and similarly this bipartisan and bicameral legislation gives our customers the funding mechanisms they need to move to more modern and secure federal IT systems and services. The MGT Act allows agencies to modernize aging and vulnerable systems and migrate to innovative technologies such as commercial cloud computing. By giving agencies more control over IT investments, the bill creates more strategic, efficient, and commonsense incentives for agency buyers without compromising transparency and oversight. Flexible funding mechanisms like the agency working capital funds in this piece of legislation enable the adoption of the most secure, cuttingedge commercial technologies that the private sector has long adopted. The commitment of both Republican and Democrat members in both the House and the Senate on the MGT Act and previous versions of the legislation represents an acknowledgment that Congress must act to improve and secure federal IT. This bill gives the federal government the chance to provide better constituent services that citizens have grown to expect and deserve. Again, we applaud the introduction of the MGT Act and urge Congress to act this year to pass the legislation. Sincerely, STEVE BLOCK , AWS Public Policy. 
BROCADE , April 27, 2017. Re Modernizing Government Technology Act of 2017. Hon. JASON CHAFFETZ , Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, House of Representatives. Hon.WILLHURD, Chairman, Subcommittee on Information Technology, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, House of Representatives. Hon. ELIJAH CUMMINGS , Ranking Member, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, House of Representatives. Hon. ROBIN KELLY , Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Information Technology, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, House of Representatives. DEAR CHAIRMAN CHAFFETZ , C HAIRMAN  HURD, R ANKING MEMBER CUMMINGS AND  RANKING MEMBER KELLY : On behalf of Brocade, I am writing in support of the Modernizing Government Technology Act of 2017. This bipartisan bill is an important step forward to accelerate the modernization of federal IT networks. The Modernizing Government Technology Act will provide federal agencies with critical and flexible financing mechanisms to help break the cycle of federal IT investment in outdated technologies. By facilitating federal agency IT modernization, the bills will help agencies improve IT effectiveness, bolster security, reduce maintenance spending and better serve citizens, warfighters and veterans. As an active partner in federal agency network modernization, Brocade appreciates your leadership in moving this bill forward this year. Brocade is committed to working with other stakeholders to achieve the objectives of the Modernizing Government Technology Act to help agencies transition to modern networks that leverage open standards, multivendor networks, and software based technologies to achieve their mission. Sincerely, JEFFRANGEL , Senior Director, Corporate Affairs. 
CA T ECHNOLOGIES , May 1, 2017. Hon. WILLHURD, Chairman, Subcommittee on Information Technology, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. GERALD CONNOLLY , Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Government Operations, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR CHAIRMAN HURD AND RANKING MEMBERCONNOLLY : I am writing to express our support for H.R. 2227, the Modernizing Government Technology Act of 2017 (MGT Act). This Act will help address a vital challenge the Federal government faces in providing better services for its citizens. According to the Government Accountability Office, the Federal government spends more than 75 percent of its IT budget on operations and maintenance, rather than on expenditures for new technologies. This limits the ability of the government to provide innovative and efficient services to citizens and it puts federal IT infrastructure at risk. The MGT Act will enable agency officials to acquire and deploy new technologies in ways that will help them provide better services and cost savings to citizens in a more secure fashion. We want to thank you and your staffs for your tireless work and active engagement with industry on this bill. CA Technologies looks forward to continuing to work with Members of the Committees and with House leadership as this bill moves forward in the legislative process. With warmest regards, BRENDAN PETER , Vice President, Global Government Relations. 
[From Ian J. Rayder, Government Affairs, Cisco] Cisco supports the important goals of the Modernizing Government Technology Act of 2017, which was introduced with bipartisan support in both the House and the Senate. If passed, the bill will accelerate a pivot away from outmoded legacy systems to modernized solutions, which should cut costs, improve security and boost operational efficiency. The MGTA can help the federal government change the status quo where nearly 80% of IT spending is used to maintain aging, insecure, and expensive legacy federal IT systems. We thank Information Technology Subcommittee Chairman Hurd, Ranking Member Kelly, Government Operations Subcommittee Ranking Member Connolly, and Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Chaffetz for their leadership on this important issue. 
COMPUWARE , MAY1, 2017. Hon. WILLHURD, Washington, DC. CONGRESSMAN HURD: Compuware, the world’s leading mainframededicated software company, is pleased to see the introduction of the Modernizing Government Technology Act of 2017. As you know, we are headquartered in Detroit, Michigan with 99% of our development team onsite. Our innovative mainframe software assist the world’s largest banks, insurance companies and retail, transportation and government organizations by enabling them to deliver mainframesupported products and services more quickly, costeffectively and with a higher level of quality. A new generation of Federal IT leaders will soon assume responsibility for guiding the agencies through modernization efforts that meet citizens’ increasingly techcentric demands. Having forged their careers in a period of intensive technological innovation, these leaders are by and large wellprepared to do so and the MGT Act provides a viable funding path to support modernization efforts. We are encouraged that the MGT Act suggests that an IT modernization plan should pair the right applications with the right platforms. One of the major platforms being modernized is the mainframe. The reality is, a large percentage of the missioncritical applications and systems that run on the mainframe today will remain there for decades to come. Organizations and agencies should build on what works well and continue to leverage the decades of investment in business rules and intellectual property. 
Mainframe longevity is no accident. No other computing platform comes close to delivering the performance, scalability, reliability and security of the postmodern mainframe. None offers a lower marginal cost. Nor has any other platform come close to demonstrating a similar ability to adapt to the changes in the world around it decade after decade. The correct course of action is to diligently and smartly leverage a post modern mainframe for what it does best. Thank you for the opportunity to submit comments and we look forward to providing additional information for the Committee Report. Compuware is always available to testify. Sincerely, CHRIS O’M ALLEY , CEO, Compuware. 
CSRA, Falls Church, VA, April 28, 2017. Re the Modernizing Government Technology Act of 2017. Hon. JASON CHAFFETZ , Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. Hon. ELIJAH CUMMINGS , Ranking Member, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. Hon. WILLHURD, Chairman, Subcommittee on Information Technology, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. Hon. ROBIN KELLY , Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Information Technology, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS : On behalf of CSRA, I write today to express my strong support for the Modernizing Government Technology Act (MGT Act), which is a shining example of forwardlooking leadership from Congress to help move the government into the 21st century. As one of the leading providers of next generation technology to the federal government, CSRA wants to partner in providing solutions that save taxpayer dollars and facilitate a better customer experience for our citizens. The MGT Act is a crucial step forward in creating our shared future of innovation. Investing in the transformation of aging IT infrastructure, as the MGT Act will do, will help protect networks currently vulnerable to cybersecurity threats and make government more efficient and effective for the American people. We know that investments like these make highest and best use of the taxpayer dollar, saving enormous sums of money down the line. Innovation has long fueled the American economy; technology can now make possible the achievement of national priorities. I salute Congressman Will Hurd, Congresswoman Robin Kelly, Senator Moran, Senator Udall, and the entire bipartisan, bicameral coalition who have brought us to this moment of opportunity. We urge the support of the entire Congress for this legislation, which is a kickstart in creating a government as dynamic and innovative as America itself. Sincerely, LAWRENCE B. P RIOR. 
INTEL CORPORATION , Washington, DC, May 16, 2017. Hon. WILLHURD, Washington, DC. DEAR CONGRESSMAN HURD: Intel Corporation commends your leadership in enabling the Federal Government to upgrade its legacy IT Infrastructure through the Modernizing Government Technology Act of 2017. Your bill would enable the retirement, replacement, and modernization of legacy IT that is difficult to secure and expensive to maintain. This bill would strengthen the incentives and wherewithal of federal agencies and organizations to invest prudently in IT, thereby saving money and increasing the performance of their IT systems. Intel applauds your bipartisan, bicameral effort aimed at making our government work better for all citizens by providing the means to enable it to keep pace with IT innovation. Sincerely, PETER PITSCH , Executive Director, Federal Relations. Associate General Counsel, Intel Corporation.

H UMPHRIES , JR., Corporate Vice President, U.S. Government Affairs (USGA). 
UNISYS, April 28, 2017. Hon. WILLHURD, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. ROBIN KELLY , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR REPRESENTATIVES HURD AND KELLY : On behalf of the Unisys Corporation, thank you for introducing the Modernizing Government Technology Act of 2017 (MGT Act). Unisys strongly supports enactment of the MGT Act because it provides needed flexibility and funding resources to enable the Federal Government to modernize its legacy IT systems and leverage governmentwide resources to gain efficiencies. As a global information technology company that provides leading edge security solutions to the government and commercial markets, Unisys recognizes that one of the major challenges facing clients is how to fund modernization investments while maintaining existing mission critical IT systems. The MGT Act addresses this challenge by authorizing new modernization funding mechanisms for Federal agencies that will allow them to build in cyber security by design, effectively share government data, create longterm savings and eliminate duplication. Thank you again for introducing this much needed legislation. Sincerely, VENKATAPATHI PUVVADA , President, Federal Systems. 
LEVEL 3 STATEMENT ON MGT A CT OF 2017 Today, Representatives Will Hurd (R–TX), Robin Kelly (D–IL) and Gerry Connolly (D– VA), and Senators Jerry Moran (R–KS) and Tom Udall (D–NM), introduced the Modernizing Government Technology Act of 2017 to provide federal agencies additional resources and flexibility to modernize outdated information technology systems. Below is a statement from Level 3 Communications: ‘‘Level 3 Communications applauds Representatives Hurd, Kelly and Connolly, and Senators Moran and Udall, for championing federal IT reform and their commitment to maximizing the value of taxpayer dollars by transforming how the government invests in technology. Level 3 stands ready to continue our collaboration with federal agencies to transform their networks to improve efficiency, reduce costs and maximize security.’’ 
Mr. HURD. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank my friends, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. HURD) and the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. KELLY ), for their leadership in bringing this bill to the floor. Of course, I rise in support of the bill, H.R. 2227, the Modernizing Government Technology Act of 2017. Mr. Speaker, over the past several years, we have all witnessed the chaos and havoc that sophisticated cyber attacks can, and do, wreak on our Nation and around the world. Just this past week, there was a massive ransomware attack that hit 200,000 victims in 150 countries, and those numbers are expected to grow exponentially. This is just the latest in a string of highprofile attacks, including Sony, Yahoo, the OPM data breach, and even efforts to influence our elections and those in Europe. These attacks jeopardize America’s safety, privacy, and cost untold millions of dollars in the private sector and public sector as well. These attacks affect both the public and private sector, and bad actors repeatedly target our Federal Government. Those attacks often succeed because Federal computer systems are so outdated that they cannot implement network defenses as basic as encryption. Some legacy systems go back a half a century. The Federal Government spends nearly $60 billion a year sustaining its existing IT systems. When agencies are forced to spend nearly 80 percent of that to maintain legacy computer systems, they have fewer resources to modernize and reinvest. As a result, agencies cannot afford to invest in the modern technologies that other large enterprises need to survive. Many Federal agencies do not use cloud computing to help secure computer networks and improve our ability to deliver services to the American people. 
The MGT Act we are talking about today and on which I am proud to be one of the lead Democratic cosponsors is a critical step to help improve the Federal Government’s IT systems. The MGT Act of 2017 will help our cyber defenders protect our most important digital resources. This bill marries two bills from the previous Congress, both of which I was proud to be an original cosponsor of— the IT Modernization Act and the MOVE IT Act. The MGT Act establishes a clear role for both of these pieces of legislation to improve Federal IT systems. I was an original cosponsor for Minority Whip STENY HOYER ’s IT Modernization Act, which created a revolving fund using $3 billion appropriations for Treasury to replace legacy systems. I was pleased to join my friend, Ms. KELLY , the ranking member of the Information Technology Subcommittee, and Mr. HURD, on the MOVE IT Act, which revived a proposal first discussed during the consideration of the legislation FITARA, the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act. These two bills were different, but complementary, and worked, ultimately, to join the two to create this act in front of us today, the MGT Act. That act lays the foundation for the future of IT modernization funding and reinvestment and investment by the Federal Government long overdue. The act will authorize an upfront investment to retire minimal largescale legacy systems and affect multiple agencies. This bipartisan, bicameral legislation will provide mechanisms and muchneeded funding for agencies to speed up that slow process of moving from legacy IT systems to cutting edge, 21st century technologies. It would also provide needed reporting requirements to ensure that agencies are acquiring modern technology and that we can measure that it is being done in a costeffective way. It places an emphasis on following the practices of private industry and moving toward cloud computing solutions. The MGT Act language will allow agencies to reinvest those savings, as my friend just indicated, and that is a commonsense proposal, but not one we find commonly in the Federal Government. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the act, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HURD. Mr. Speaker, I know the gentleman from the Commonwealth of Virginia has a few more speakers, so I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER ), my friend, the distinguished whip on the Democratic side. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. HURD for his leadership on this issue. I am pleased to work with him on it. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill. It will not be a controversial bill. It will not make the front page of the paper tomorrow. People will not be seized of this bill passing. But this bill may well have a very great consequence to it and to the efficiency and effectiveness of our Federal Government. Last July, I outlined a series of reforms to renew America’s faith in their government, which included modernizing government technology. Not long after, I introduced the Information Technology Modernization Act to achieve that goal; and, of course, Mr. CONNOLLY was a cosponsor with me on that bill. I am glad that this bill on the floor today includes my legislation. It would be a major step toward ensuring that our government is using the latest technology systems, is well protected from cyber threats, and can serve the American people more effectively. b1500 Mr. HURD came over to me on the floor and we talked about our two ideas. As the gentleman from Virginia has said, they were complementary, and I am pleased that we could work together to put these bills together and that we now have agreement with the Senate. We passed a bill through the House. Last week’s major global cyber attack was yet another reminder of how critical it is that our government’s technology systems are upgraded to the latest and most secure technology. If any lesson was needed, we got it. Americans count on government agencies to protect their personal data, and our security agencies rely on our government systems to safeguard classified and sensitive information. Unfortunately, our government technology systems are now far behind the latest technology and are in desperate need of upgrades. I congratulate the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. KELLY ) for her work on this effort. What this legislation does is authorize the creation of a technology modernization fund to finance rapid upgrades of government technology systems similar to funds that are available in the private sector so they can move quickly and seize the best and latest technology available. It would prioritize the systems that are the most vulnerable, and it would implement best practices from the private sector. In other words, those that are working least well will be the first addressed. Once upgrades are completed, agencies will pay back into the fund from the savings achieved through greater efficiency, i.e., a revolving fund, making it possible then to finance additional projects in a way that is self sustaining after the initial investment. All of this would be done in a way that is transparent and accountable. Once this bill is enacted, we must take the next step and provide, of course, that initial funding. I have been proud to work across the aisle with Majority Leader MCCARTHY , Chairman CHAFFETZ , Mr. H URD, and, of course, my dear, dear friend from Virginia, my colleague in the Washington metropolitan area, Representative CONNOLLY on our side. Representative KELLY , whom I just mentioned, and Congressman TEDLIEU have also been champions of this effort, and I thank them for their input and their strong support as we worked to bring it to the floor in a bipartisan fashion. Again, I want to say how pleased I am to work on these issues with all of my colleagues, but particularly with the majority leader, Mr. MCCARTHY , my friend from California, and thank him for his leadership. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting the Modernizing Government Technology Act, and I hope the Trump administration will include investment to capitalize this new fund in their fiscal 2018 budget. Mr. HURD. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCARTHY ), the distinguished majority leader. Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, before the minority whip departs, I want to thank him for his work on this. This has really been a bipartisan effort, and it is really putting the country first. The gentleman is correct: This might not make headlines, but this will have a greater effect on our government being more efficient, effective, and accountable. We thank him for his work on it. Mr. Speaker, there are some things we get used to hearing, but when you think about it, it is amazing just how much things have changed. I hear a friend say that all of the photos he took on his phone automatically updated to his cloud—not surprising there. But how long ago was it that we couldn’t even take pictures on our phone, much less have them saved automatically on a cloud? Nowadays, it is not uncommon to cash your checks online, manage your accounts on Mint, pay individuals back online. Many millennials don’t even carry cash anymore. That is a revolution in money management that just happened in a matter of years. So, Mr. Speaker, why in the world would the Department of Defense use a 54yearold system as a backup to send and receive emergency messages for our nuclear forces, a 54yearold system that relies on floppy disks? Why would the master file of the public’s taxes at the IRS run on a 1950s code? Eighty percent of the $80 billion we spend each year on IT is used to maintain legacy systems, to buy expensive parts that nobody uses anymore for a 54yearold system we shouldn’t even have. We would expect more from the private sector. We would expect mobile cameras, cloud computing, online banking. Heck, we would even expect to upgrade our phones and apps and 
technology on a rolling basis every single week. Well, why should we expect less from the Federal Government? I would say this is about more than expectations. We all saw what happened over the weekend with the massive global cyber attack: hospitals shut down, transportation systems. This is a government service issue. It is a government waste issue. It is a national security issue. Now, government may never be like Silicon Valley, but it should not be stuck in the age of ‘‘Mad Men.’’ That is not only costly, it is dangerous. WILLHURD, an individual that has served his Nation in some of the most dangerous parts of the world, an individual who worked in the private sector when it came to technology, an individual who serves in this body and, I will say this based upon everybody else I have served, probably has the most bipartisan approach of anyone I have ever seen serve in that position—he doesn’t care about party. It is just as the time when he worked in the CIA. He cares about his country. He has seen the most deadly things happen, and, through his technology company, he has seen that people fight wars new ways. So he took it upon himself—it is not the issue that people would campaign upon, but it is an issue that he saw needed a solution. He worked with both sides of the aisle, and he said: Why can’t we modernize our own technology? The Veterans Administration was created in 1921, and if somebody that was a veteran had a problem and a claim, they would write it on a piece of paper. In 1921, on a warm day like today, we would have fans going to try to cool ourselves down. We would rush, after we got done voting, to turn on our radios to see what the news was saying. Well, the world all changed. We can look at our phones and get the news instantaneously. We got central air to cool ourselves down. And if you have a claim with the VA, lots of times they write it on a piece of paper. Well, do you know what? That is all going to stop today. That is going to stop because we are going to make a smart investment. We are going to make the Federal Government have the same accountability that we expect in business or anywhere else. And do you know what will happen? Government will become more effective, more efficient, more accountable, and more transparent. So I want to tip my hat to both sides of the aisle, and especially to Congressman WILLHURD. He took the leadership, had the tenacity to stay with it and the ability to work with all on, really, the issue that people wouldn’t talk about but expect to happen, and he was the right person at the right time to make the push. That is why I support this bill. Mr. CONNOLLY. May I inquire of the Speaker how much time is left on this side? The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky). The gentleman from Virginia has 11
1⁄2minutes remaining. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield 5
1⁄2minutes to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. KELLY ), my good friend. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support this commonsense, bipartisan bill that updates our woefully outdated IT infrastructure. I want to say thank you to my good friend and partner on the IT subcommittee, Chairman HURD, for his leadership on this very important measure and to my colleagues who worked so hard on this bill: Chairman CHAFFETZ , Ranking Member C UMMINGS , our House leadership stewards—Democratic Whip HOYER from the majority, Mr. MCCARTHY —and Mr. C ONNOLLY of Virginia for his energy and work in dealing with this bill. I also want to give a special thanks to all of the staff and a special shoutout to my staff: Jay Cho and Zach Ostro. The Modernizing Government Technology Act has come a long way from the early days when it was called MOVE IT. It has been a tough and sometimes frustrating journey, but we have made it, and we have a good bill in front of us. Last year, the House passed this bill only to have it die in the Senate. Despite these roadblocks, we kept working because it is worth it. This bill will revolutionize and upgrade our outdated IT fractured while bringing costsaving innovation and greater security to government agencies. In my years serving as the ranking member of the Oversight Committee’s IT Subcommittee, I have learned one thing: We need to get back to basics, and this bill does just that. Our current useitorloseit approach to Federal IT just isn’t working. It is no secret that Federal agencies are struggling to stay up to date, especially when compared to the private sector. Each year, we spend $80 billion in taxpayer dollars to maintain legacy IT systems that are vulnerable to cyber attacks; and each year that we don’t upgrade these systems, they become even more difficult and expensive to secure. This is unacceptable and a waste of taxpayer dollars. For too long, we have kicked the can down the road and left our outdated IT systems vulnerable to costly attacks. The dangers of our system are clear. Every day we are reminded of the importance of having modern IT systems and robust cybersecurity practices in place. In 2015, hackers made off with the personal information of more than 20 million Americans, including congressional staffers, in the OPM data breach. Just this past week, as you have heard, a global ransomware attack, WannaCry or WannaCrypt, wreaked havoc worldwide, paralyzing businesses and governments alike. These attacks will only grow more frequent and more difficult to combat. The MGT Act is a major step in the right direction. It will cut costs and enhance our security. It builds on prior work like ClingerCohen and FITARA, and it gives agencies the flexibility needed to modernize vulnerable systems and develop cost savings for taxpayers. Under this bill, agencies can take the savings from upgrading their systems and reinvest them into their working capital fund for future IT modernization. We are going to go from an outdated method of purchasing IT to one that empowers CIOs to make smart, strategic investments in innovative technologies; and as an end result, our data will be more secure and our government more efficient. I am proud of this bill, and I am proud of the bipartisan work that made it possible, proud of what we accomplished by working together on the IT Subcommittee. The MGT Act is a necessary component to strengthening our cybersecurity that saves taxpayers money. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. HURD. Mr. Speaker, I would like to inform my friend from the Commonwealth that I have no further speakers and am prepared to close. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. In closing, I think this is an important piece in the information technology modernization effort that our committee and this body has undertaken for the last 5 or 6 years. One of the key pieces of legislation undergirding today’s bill is the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act I was proud to cowrite and coauthor with thenChairman DARRELL  ISSA. I am equally proud today to have worked with my friend Mr. HURDfrom Texas, my friend Ms. KELLY from Illinois, and, of course, Mr. STENY HOYER , the Democratic whip, in forging this additional piece that we believe will bring the Federal Government into the 21st century—technologically literate and protecting the databases that protect the American people. Hundreds of millions of pieces of data are at risk in the current cyber environment, and some simple but critical investments can make all the difference. That is what we are voting for today. I urge passage of the legislation and, again, congratulate my colleagues and friends for working together in a bipartisan way to bring this bill to fruition. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HURD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, we have some young folks in the Chamber right now, and I hope they recognize that this is how their government is supposed to work: people working together, putting their differences past them for the betterment of our great Nation. 
It is an honor for me to have this opportunity to do this with so many of my friends that I have grown to love and respect over these last 2 years. And we get to save government money, protect our digital infrastructure, and make sure that our government is providing the kind of services we should and that the American people demand. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the MGT Act and of continued efforts to improve the federal government’s cybersecurity posture. I would like to thank Mr. HURD for his tireless efforts advocating for this bill and his partners on the Oversight Committee, Mr. CONNOLLY and Ms. K ELLY for their cybersecurity leadership. I also must acknowledge the House’s Minority Whip and my good friend, Mr. HOYER , for his work pushing for IT modernization. The idea for the kind of revolving fund included as part of the MGT Act grew out of President Obama’s Cybersecurity National Action Plan, itself issued in direct response to the massive breach of the Office of Personnel Management. OPM was yet another wake up call to the government about the lax attitude toward security present at many agencies, but, to the prior administration’s credit, the CNAP contained a number of needed policy shifts, including the creation of a federal Chief Information Security Officer and the use of DHS’s authority to conduct a governmentwide review of high value assets. Central to the CNAP, though, was the realization that attempting to secure antiquated federal IT systems was a losing proposition. Just as the Internet—developed in the 1970s—was not created with security in mind, so, too, are many older government systems devoid of even basic security controls. When we think about the fact that the iPhone turns ten next month and the huge improvements that have been made from the first generation model to today’s, it’s easy to see how systems that are two or three decades old can hamper security. Using outdated software also compromises efficiency. There’s a reason businesses keep up to date with technology—it saves them money. The cleverness of the revolving fund approach is that it uses these savings to drive further upgrades in a virtuous cycle. I hope that the MGT Act is viewed as a pilot program, as there is a lot more technical debt we have incurred than will be solved by $250 million per year. But it is a very important first step, and I commend the sponsors for their work. And I hope that federal agencies view this bill as license to be innovative in their upgrade planning and to bring us a more efficient—and secure—government. b1515 The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. RUSSELL ) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oklahoma. 
Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material in the RECORD on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Oklahoma? There was no objection. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I present today H.R. 194, the Federal Agency Mail Management Act of 2017. Approximately 2 years ago, President Obama signed into law the Presidential and Federal Records Act Amendments of 2014. The law modernized and improved Federal recordkeeping statutes by codifying agency responsibilities that have been in practice for decades. Once the law was enacted, the General Services Administration, or GSA, identified technical provisions in the law that the agency interpreted as limiting its ability to regulate Federal agency mailroom operations. 
The GSA has been responsible for the regulation and oversight of Federal agency mail management for many years. Congress did not intend for the 2014 law to change the mail management structure. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 194 provides clarification to ensure that the GSA is responsible for mailroom management oversight, and not the National Archives and Records Administration. Both GSA and the National Archives have worked with Congress to make the correction, and both entities support H.R. 194. Mr. Speaker, an identical bill was passed by the House with unanimous voice vote near the end of last Congress. We hope that this legislation will be signed into law this Congress to correct the unintended consequences of a previous law. This corrective measure has bipartisan support, and I appreciate having my friend and colleague, Mr. CONNOLLY  of Virginia, join me as a cosponsor. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Federal Agency Mail Management Act, which I introduced along with, of course, the author of the bill, Representative STEVE RUSSELL . I want to thank Representative RUSSELL for working in a bipartisan manner on this legislation. The bill would make a technical correction to clarify that the Administrator of the General Services Administration is responsible for managing mail in the executive branch. The Administrator of GSA has historically had this responsibility, but when the Federal Records Act was updated in 2014, changes made to the statute left it unclear whether the Administrator’s role had changed. You would think it is a simple commonsense measure, but it requires an act of Congress to clarify. Congress never intended to take away the Administrator’s authority to manage mail. The bill was approved by the House without opposition last year. We are hoping the same will pertain this year. The Congressional Budget Office estimates this bill would cost the Federal Government nothing, because GSA already processes mail for Federal agencies. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support the bill and give clarity to the GSA and the National Archives, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. RUSSELL ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 194. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. f 
FEDERAL REGISTER PRINTING SAVINGS ACT OF 2017 Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 195) to amend title 44, United States Code, to restrict the distribution of free printed copies of the Federal Register to Members of Congress and other officers and employees of the United States, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 195 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Federal Register Printing Savings Act of 2017’’. 
SEC. 2. RESTRICTIONS ON DISTRIBUTION OF FREE PRINTED COPIES OF FEDERAL REGISTER TO MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND FEDERAL EMPLOYEES. 
(a) R ESTRICTIONS .—Section 1506 of title 44, United States Code, is amended— (1) by striking ‘‘The Administrative Committee’’ and inserting ‘‘(a) COMPOSITION ; DUTIES.—The Administrative Committee’’; (2) in subsection (a)(4), by striking ‘‘the number of copies’’ and inserting ‘‘subject to subsection (b), the number of copies’’; and (3) by adding at the end the following new subsection: ‘‘(b) RESTRICTIONS ON DISTRIBUTION OF  FREE PRINTED COPIES TO MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES OF THE  UNITED STATES .— ‘‘(1) PROHIBITING SUBSCRIPTION TO PRINTED  
COPIES WITHOUT REQUEST .—Under the regulations prescribed to carry out subsection (a)(4), the Director of the Government Publishing Office may not provide a printed copy of the Federal Register without charge to any Member of Congress or any other office of the United States during a year unless— ‘‘(A) the Member or office requests a printed copy of a specific issue of the Federal Register; or ‘‘(B) during that year or during the previous year, the Member or office requested a subscription to printed copies of the Federal Register for that year, as described in paragraph (2). ‘‘(2) ADMINISTRATION OF SUBSCRIPTIONS .— The regulations prescribed to carry out subsection (a)(4) shall include— ‘‘(A) provisions regarding notifications to offices of Members of Congress and other offices of the United States of the restrictions of paragraph (1); ‘‘(B) provisions describing the process by which Members and other offices may request a specific issue of the Federal Register for purposes of paragraph (1)(A); and ‘‘(C) provisions describing the process by which Members and other offices may request a subscription to the Federal Register for purposes of paragraph (1)(B), except that such regulations shall limit the period for such a subscription to not longer than 1 year.’’. (b) EFFECTIVE DATE.—The amendment made by subsection (a) shall take effect January 1, 2018. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. RUSSELL ) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oklahoma. GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material in the RECORD on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Oklahoma? There was no objection. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. My bill, H.R. 195, the Federal Register Printing Savings Act of 2017, will save taxpayers dollars while providing needed reform in how we conduct day today business in Congress. The Federal Register contains a large amount of information, including proposed rules and public notices, regulations, executive orders, and Presidential documents. This information is compiled by the National Archives and published daily by the Government Publishing Office, or the GPO. Often described by the National Archives as ‘‘the daily newspaper of the Federal Government,’’ this service enables Members, staffs, and agencies to keep track of activity across government. In 1994, the GPO began publishing the Federal Register online. To improve user experience, the digital version has been enhanced over time to provide navigational aids that include links to related content. The Federal Register is now fully searchable and downloadable, making for quick access to any document. But sadly, Mr. Speaker, despite the advance of technology, Members of Congress and Federal offices across the entire government still receive printed copies of the Federal Register every day. In the course of a year, this stack of Registers would be 16feet high. This results in thousands of copies going directly into the trash each week, unless occasionally used as doorstops. Subscriptions to the Federal Register cost about $1,000 annually, meaning hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars are wasted each year. This same money could pay for the salaries of 50 soldiers who defend our Republic in a given year. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 195 makes a small but significant change to fix the problem and ensure that we operate in the 21st century. Instead of automatically receiving printed copies, Members or offices of the Federal Government who want to continue to receive copies need only submit a request. There will be an optin, instead of an optout. Current print and ondemand technologies make this possible. The subscriptions will last for 1 year to ensure Members and offices are able to evaluate if they want to continue the service. For Members in offices that do not use or want the printed version, they will not receive it and will still have full access to the searchable digital version which most Members use. 
This change will reduce unnecessary printing and, in context, will prevent 96 Americans from having to work each year so that we can throw Registers in the trash. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this efficient bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 195, the Federal Register Printing Savings Act. My friend, Mr. RUSSELL , is going to develop a reputation around here for being just too commonsense. This bill would prohibit the Government Publishing Office from sending printed copies of the Federal Register to Members of Congress and other Federal offices unless they wanted them. The Federal Register includes rules, regulations, executive orders, and other Federal documents. It is a very important and useful publication. It does not make sense, however, as my friend from Oklahoma has pointed out, for GPO automatically to send it to offices that don’t want it and end up putting it in the garbage, hopefully recycling. The Federal Register is available online, as my friend has pointed out, which significantly cuts down on the need for printed copies for most of us. This bill would reduce waste both in paper and in Federal dollars. The Congressional Budget Office says this bill would reduce Federal spending by $1 million a year. It was the late Everett Dirksen of Illinois who said: ‘‘A billion here, a billion there, pretty soon it adds up to real money.’’ CBO also estimates this bill would result in 1,000 fewer copies of the Federal Register being printed each day. This bill is good for the environment, good for taxpayers, and a useful discipline for us all in terms of excess we don’t need. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. RUSSELL for his leadership, his common sense, and his collaboration on this committee, and I urge all Members to support the bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. RUSSELL ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 195. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
FEDERAL INTERN PROTECTION ACT OF 2017 Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 653) to amend title 5, United States Code, to protect unpaid interns in the Federal Government from workplace harassment and discrimination, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 653 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Federal Intern Protection Act of 2017’’. 
(a) I NGENERAL .—Section 2302 of title 5, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following: ‘‘(g)(1) All protections afforded to an employee under subparagraphs (A), (B), and (D) of subsection (b)(1) shall be afforded, in the same manner and to the same extent, to an intern and an applicant for internship. ‘‘(2) For purposes of the application of this subsection, a reference to an employee shall be considered a reference to an intern in— ‘‘(A) section 717 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e–16); ‘‘(B) sections 12 and 15 of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (29 U.S.C. 631, 633a); and ‘‘(C) section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791). ‘‘(3) In this subsection, the term ‘intern’ means an individual who performs uncompensated voluntary service in an agency to earn credit awarded by an educational institution or to learn a trade or occupation.’’. (b) CONFORMING AMENDMENT .—Section 3111(c)(1) of title 5, United States Code, is amended by inserting ‘‘section 2302(g) (relating to prohibited personnel practices),’’ before ‘‘chapter 81’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. RUSSELL ) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oklahoma. 
Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material in the RECORD on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Oklahoma? There was no objection. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H.R. 653, the Federal Intern Protection Act of 2017, sponsored by my colleague from the Oversight Committee, Ranking Member ELIJAH CUMMINGS of Maryland. Mr. Speaker, the Federal Government is well served by interns who provide invaluable assistance to agencies across the Federal Government. Our interns work alongside us and other Federal employees helping conduct agency business on behalf of the American people. Internship programs also help to identify and develop the next generation of Federal employees. In exchange, interns gain invaluable work experience in a field that they might hope to enter upon graduation and credit they can apply at their institution of learning. Unfortunately, there are no existing provisions in Federal law that protect interns working at Federal agencies against harassment or discrimination. In the case of O’Connor v. Davis, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld a decision finding an intern could not bring sexual harassment claims under Federal law. b1530 The court reasoned that since the intern was not a Federal employee, that person was not covered by existing law. It concluded that: ‘‘It is for Congress, if it should choose to do so . . . to provide a remedy. . . .’’ Mr. Speaker, the Oversight and Government Reform Committee heard testimony showing the damage this loophole can have at Federal agencies. In a 2015 hearing on Environmental Protection Agency mismanagement, witnesses described allegations of sexual harassment against interns. According to testimony, ‘‘one former intern stated that because of this harassment, she changed her mind about not only about working for EPA but also for working in the Federal sector at all.’’ This is simply unacceptable. Mr. Speaker, the Federal Intern Protection Act of 2017 ensures that interns working for the Federal Government receive antidiscriminatory and anti harassment protections. Specifically, the bill prohibits discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or handicapping condition for interns working at Federal agencies. These protections are already in place for Federal employees. I thank my friend and colleague, the ranking member, Mr. ELIJAH CUMMINGS , for his leadership and commitment in protecting interns who work for the Federal Government. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 653, the Federal Intern Protection Act. In fact, it is hard to believe we need this legislation at this point in the 21st century, but we do. Under current law, Federal employees are protected from discrimination on the basis of race, religion, age, and sex. Unfortunately, interns don’t qualify. They have no such protections. I appreciate the wonderful work of our distinguished ranking member, Representative ELIJAH CUMMINGS of Maryland, on this important measure. I am not surprised, and neither are my colleagues, that he would pick up on this and see the need for this protection to be extended to young men and women who want maybe to pursue a career or part of their career in the Federal Government. They need these protections like the employees they are working with side by side. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. CUMMINGS ). 
Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his kind words. I thank Mr. RUSSELL also for his very kind words. The bill before us, the Federal Intern Protection Act, would close a loophole in Federal employment law that currently leaves unpaid interns open to discrimination and sexual harassment with no legal recourse. It is interesting. As I listened to Mr. CONNOLLY , he is absolutely right: it is surprising that they don’t already have this protection. Last year, the Oversight and Government Reform Committee held a hearing at which we heard testimony about sexual harassment and retaliation in an EPA regional office. During the hearing, both Chairman CHAFFETZ and I expressed our disgust at the exploitation of these young women and demanded action to prevent this abuse in the future. Unfortunately, the act of harassing unpaid interns on the basis of race, religion, age, or, in this case, sex is not prohibited by Federal law. Under current law, victims rely on the discretion of managers to prevent this behavior, which is something that doesn’t always occur. As one witness testified before our committee: ‘‘Even after finding out about the numerous harassment victims, the direct reporting manager continued to feed the harasser a steady diet of young women.’’ That is a very sad commentary. As I have often said, we are better than that. We saw at our hearing that allowing this kind of behavior to go unchecked can have serious consequences on the lives and careers of those who are interested in government service. What we want to do is encourage young people to come into government service. We want them to come in and do what will feed their souls by making life better for the general population. The last thing we want to do is anything that would cause them to say this is something they don’t want to do. Many interns are willing to work for the Federal Government without receiving any pay. That is the other piece: so many of these young people come looking for experience, looking for opportunity. They simply want a chance to get their foot in the door. We must protect them from this kind of despicable behavior. Our bill will afford Federal interns protections in the same manner and to the same extent as Federal employees. I want to take this moment to thank the chairman for moving this bill expeditiously through our committee, where it was adopted unanimously, and for bringing it to the floor today. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, again, I want to laud my friend from Maryland (Mr. CUMMINGS ) for his perspicacity in ferreting out this issue. It is a very important one. The use of internships in the Federal Government is a very underutilized tool when compared to the private sector. Many private sector companies will use internships for recruiting the talent it needs for the future. In many cases, 70 to 80 percent of those who intern for private sector corporations end up being hired because they have a carefully monitored program from orientation and recruitment to the tasks at hand during the pendency of the internship. The Federal Government does no such thing systematically. At the very beginning, if we are going to use internships as creatively as the private sector to recruit the next generation of Federal employees, since onethird of the current workforce is eligible for retirement over the next several years, we have to follow the lead my friends, Mr. CUMMINGS of Maryland and Mr. RUSSELL of Oklahoma, have just given us, and that is to make sure it is a safe workplace. Otherwise, who would be attracted to it? This piece of legislation is critical to our making Federal internships a meaningful tool in their recruitment and retention, so long as that workforce is protected by the same norms and same regulations as any Federal employee. I thank my friend, Mr. CUMMINGS , for bringing this to our attention, and I thank Mr. RUSSELL for his leadership. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill. I thank Mr. CUMMINGS for his hard work on this measure. I also thank the committee for their broad, bipartisan, unanimous support and hard work in bringing this practical measure. I urge adoption of it. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. RUSSELL ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 653. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
IMPROVING FUSION CENTERS’ ACCESS TO INFORMATION ACT Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2169) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to enhance information sharing in the Department of Homeland Security State, Local, and Regional Fusion Center Initiative, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2169 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Improving Fusion Centers’ Access to Information Act’’. 
SEC. 2. ENHANCED INFORMATION SHARING IN THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY STATE, LOCAL, AND REGIONAL FUSION CENTER INITIATIVE. 
Subsection (b) of section 210A of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 124h) is amended— (1) in paragraph (2), by inserting before the semicolon at the end the following: ‘‘and conduct outreach to such fusion centers to identify any gaps in information sharing and consult with other Federal agencies to develop methods to address such gaps, as appropriate’’; (2) by redesignating paragraphs (3) through (12) as paragraphs (4) through (13), respectively; and (3) by inserting after paragraph (2) the following new paragraph: ‘‘(3) identify Federal databases and datasets, including databases and datasets used, operated, or managed by Department components, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Department of the Treasury, that are appropriate, in accordance with Federal laws and policies, to address any gaps identified pursuant to paragraph (2), for inclusion in the information sharing environment and coordinate with the appropriate Federal agency to deploy or access such databases and datasets;’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New York (Mr. KATKO ) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. VELA) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. 
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2169, the Improving Fusion Centers’ Access to Information Act. In the years since 9/11, Congress and the executive branch have taken many steps to address information shortfalls and informationsharing shortfalls. However, we know that silos remain. The purpose of H.R. 2169 is to ensure that the Department of Homeland Security is truly serving as a State and local informationsharing advocate, as originally intended by the Homeland Security Act. This bill requires the DHS to regularly review informationsharing efforts with the National Network of Fusion Centers and then work with other Federal agencies to close any identified gaps. State and local fusion centers have grown in maturity and number during the last 16 years since 9/11. There are now 78 fusion centers within the national network. As the network has matured, fusion centers have established themselves as a critical conduit 
for sharing terrorism, homeland security, and criminal information with Federal, State, local, tribal, and territorial partners. As the threat environment continues to evolve, it is vital they have access to the tools and information systems to stay ahead of threats to the homeland. Despite existing requirements for DHS to share intelligence and information with State and local entities, I have found that the Department does not regularly assess if fusion centers have access to necessary information or databases held by other Federal agencies. H.R. 2169 addresses this deficiency by requiring the Secretary to conduct outreach to the fusion centers to identify informationsharing gaps and work with the appropriate Federal agencies to address these gaps. Additionally, the Secretary is required to identify Federal databases and datasets that should be included in the informationsharing environment and coordinate with the appropriate Federal agency to deploy such systems. H.R. 2169 includes input from the fusion centers, Department of Homeland Security, and other Federal agencies. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  a letter from the National Fusion Center Association, and I am pleased they have endorsed the bill. 
NATIONAL FUSION  CENTER ASSOCIATION , April 28, 2017. Re Support for H.R. 2169—Improving Fusion Centers’ Access to Information Act. Hon. JOHNKATKO , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR CONGRESSMAN KATKO : On behalf of the National Fusion Center Association (NFCA), I write in support of your legislation—H.R. 2169—to enhance information sharing and analysis among fusion centers and federal agencies by encouraging appropriate fusion center access to federally managed information systems. As you know, the National Network of Fusion Centers (NNFC) is a focal point for analytical collaboration and information sharing on threats to public safety among federal, local, state, territorial, and tribal public safety agencies. The NFCA has worked closely with DHS, the FBI, and other partners to develop strong information sharing pathways. We have made significant strides to improve daily working relationships with our federal partners. The flow of information from state and local public safety agencies to appropriate federal agencies continues to improve, and the same is true with information coming from federal agencies to local and state jurisdictions. We are also seeing enhanced analytical collaboration. Still, challenges remain that should be addressed. Your legislation will provide important support in this effort by encouraging improved access to data from federally managed information systems that our analysts need to do their jobs in the most effective manner possible. It is crucial for Congress to consistently support a strong information sharing environment, and this legislation would assist in that effort. We appreciate your dedication to effective information sharing and analysis and look forward to working with you to move your legislation forward and accomplish our shared mission of protecting America. Sincerely, MIKESENA, President. 
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to report that H.R. 2169 is a very bipartisan bill that passed the Committee on Homeland Security unanimously. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the measure, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. VELA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2169, the Improving Fusion Centers’ Access to Information Act of 2017. Mr. Speaker, today we consider H.R. 2169, a bill that seeks to authorize DHS’ State, Local, and Regional Fusion Center Initiative. The bill requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to carry out outreach to identify gaps in information sharing. This measure highlights the importance of equipping fusion centers so that they can quickly adapt to the everevolving terrorist threat landscape. Congress has given particular attention to fusion centers and, in the 114th Congress, enacted measures to support fusion centers. Fusion centers operate as State and major urban area focal points for the receipt, analysis, gathering, and sharing of threatrelated information between Federal, local, and private sector partners. I want to particularly highlight a provision of this bill focused on improving the interagency collaboration by requiring the DHS Secretary to consult with other Federal partners in order to develop new methods to address such gaps. DHS must continue to address and improve the Nation’s fusion centers’ capabilities in gathering, analyzing, and sharing threatrelated information between partners on every level. b1545 Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to again express my support for this bill and thank Mr. KATKO for his efforts in bringing this bill forward. We live in a time when the threats we face as a nation remain complex, and this bill is an important tool to ensure our law enforcement professionals have the resources and methods to prevent and deter terror threats. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2169. Before I close, I want to note that I routinely engage in bipartisan efforts on behalf of Homeland Security with Congressman VELA and others. The committee works in a very bipartisan manner to do what is best for this country to keep it safe, and this bill is one of those bills that helps keep our country safe. It is critical that we ensure the proper flow of information to all law enforcement agencies, that they properly use that information, and that they have access to it on a regular basis no matter whether they are a local police officer who is working at a fusion center or whether it is an FBI agent. Everyone should have access to that information because we are all on the same team to keep this country safe. I think our bipartisan efforts that we engage in with Homeland Security on a regular basis are a good example of the good things that happen in Congress. I am proud to be a part it, and I am proud to have Mr. VELA as my colleague on that as well. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland Security Committee, I rise in support of H.R. 2169. the ‘‘Improving Fusion Centers Access to Information Act of 2017,’’ which would enhance information sharing in the Department of Homeland Security State, Local and Regional Fusion Center Initiative. This bill requires outreach to be conducted to fusion centers in order to identify gaps in information sharing and consultation with other Federal agencies to develop methods to address such gaps. Additionally, it requires the DHS Secretary to coordinate with the heads of other federal departments and agencies to provide operational and intelligence advice to fusion centers and support their efforts to operate efficiently and effectively. H.R. 2169 requires the Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis (I&A) to ensure fusion centers have access to Homeland Security information sharing centers and that DHS personnel are deployed to support fusion centers in a manner consistent with the department’s mission and statutory limits. Fusion centers provide the means to local, state, and tribal law enforcement to bring together information from distributed federal and private sector sources for the purpose of collection, retention, analysis, and dissemination. The term fusion centers first coined by the Department of Defense (DOD) refer to the fusing of information for analysis purposes. The Houston Regional Intelligence Service Center is a Fusion Center. The mission of the Houston Regional Intelligence Service Center is to provide security to the Houston area by gathering, developing and sharing intelligence regarding the capabilities, intentions, and actions of terrorist groups and individuals which pose threats. Houston hosted the 51st Super Bowl earlier this year and the Houston Regional Intelligence Service Center was on duty for this major national event. This year’s Super Bowl had: 10,000—volunteers; 140,000—visitors; and 1 million—people who participated in at least one Super Bowl event. The Super Bowl took place free of incidents, which is a testament to the collaborative work of federal, state, and local law enforcement through the Houston Fusion Center. Mr. Speaker, this bill is not only good for our country, but it also will greatly benefit the citizens of Houston, Texas. 
If local law enforcement is given the proper resources, information, and intelligence, they will know how to properly handle terrorism threats. H.R. 2169 will strengthen our economy while keeping our fellow citizens safe. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in supporting H.R. 2169 because the safety of citizens from potential threats is critical to the security of the homeland and strength of our economy. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. KATKO ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2169, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
BORDER ENFORCEMENT SECURITY TASK FORCE REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2017 Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2281) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to reauthorize the Border Enforcement Security Task Force program within the Department of Homeland Security, and for other purposes, as amended.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New York (Mr. KATKO ) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. VELA) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. 
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 2281, the Border Enforcement Security Task Force Reauthorization Act of 2017. Mr. Speaker, we are living in unprecedented times. A quick glance of recent headlines shows that our Nation is suffering from the largest heroin epidemic in the history of the United States. In fact, just last week, Bloomberg Businessweek reported that heroin has become so pervasive in our cities and so profitable for the cartels that supply it that even our local law enforcement officers are disheartened and admit that sporadic streetlevel arrests seem to have little to no effect. Recently, in my district and because of the hard work of our men and women in law enforcement, we witnessed the dismantling of a largescale organization. News reports indicate 52 individuals are facing charges for about 370 crimes, including operating as drug dealers and traffickers. Mr. Speaker, if these individuals had not been stopped, their nefarious activities would have broken the dreams of children across America, and their criminal enterprise would have caused millions in economic loss through increased incarceration, rehab, and medical expenses. If they had not been stopped, their actions would have continued to introduce poison into our communities and shattered lives. Even worse, a recent trend shows that the heroin hitting our streets is becoming more lethal as drug cartels have now begun lacing heroin with fentanyl, a synthetic opioid making doses more addictive and cheaper to produce. I might add parenthetically that, for 20 years as a Federal prosecutor, I prosecuted every possible drug organization known to man. I have never seen anything with the lethality that is heroin. This epidemic is, in large part, due to the stream of illegal narcotics that is flowing across our Nation’s borders. However, there are steps that can be taken to shut down these illicit pathways. Thankfully, there is a Federal task force dedicated to this singular purpose. In 2005, in response to the increase in violence along the southwest border of Mexico, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Homeland Security Investigations, in partnership with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, as well as other Federal, State, local, and international law enforcement officials, created what is known as BEST, the Border Enforcement Security Task Force. To date, a total of 44 BEST units have been deployed across 16 States and in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. My home State of New York is well served by three BEST teams, two of which are situated on the northern border and one of which I helped stand up in Massena, New York. Nationwide, BEST teams comprise over 1,000 members who represent over 100 law enforcement agencies that have committed to jointly investigate transnational criminal activity along the southwest and northern borders and at our Nation’s major seaports. Since inception, their collective efforts have initiated more than 10,654 investigations which have resulted in almost 13,000 criminal arrests, the seizure of 1.2 million pounds of narcotics, and more than $130 million. The street value of 1.2 million pounds of narcotics is astronomical. This is an impressive feat by any measure; however, as we are considering reauthorizing this important task force, it is important to highlight where there is some room for improvement. Every Congress looks at existing programs and makes adjustments when needed. That is exactly what we are proposing to do here today. 
Of the 44, total, BEST units, 20 of them are designated by Homeland Security Investigations as having a maritime security focus. While the Coast Guard provides critical support to Federal, State, and local partners through a majority of the maritime BESTs, not every maritime BEST is currently benefiting from Coast Guard participation. This bill mandates the participation of both a Coast Guard Investigative Service special agent and a uniformed Coast Guard intelligence officer on every maritime BEST. By utilizing both plainclothes investigators and uniformed intelligence officers, BEST will be able to partner with the Coast Guard in ongoing criminal investigations and the generation of actionable maritime intelligence. The Coast Guard is the only agency within DHS that is also an independent member of the intelligence community. This unique position, coupled with the fact that the Coast Guard has unparalleled maritime domain awareness through daily interaction with mariners and facility operators, makes it imperative that they are included in all maritime BESTS in a mandatory fashion. As we find ourselves halfway through Police Week this week, I want to take a second to pause and thank the men and women of law enforcement throughout this great Nation—many of whom I have stood side by side with for over 20 years—for all they do in keeping our country safe. I would also like to thank the ranking member, Mr. VELA, for introducing this bill, and I urge my colleagues to support the law enforcement community and vote in favor of reauthorizing this important task force. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON HOMELAND SECURITY , Washington, DC, May 15, 2017. Hon. BILLSHUSTER , Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Washington, DC. DEAR CHAIRMAN SHUSTER : Thank you for your letter regarding H R 2281, the ‘‘Border Enforcement Security Task Force Reauthorization Act of 2017’’. I appreciate your support in bringing this legislation before the House of Representatives. I understand that the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, will not seek a sequential referral on the bill. We appreciate your cooperation in this matter. The Committee on Homeland Security concurs with the mutual understanding that the decision not to seek a sequential referral on this bill at this time does not prejudice any claim the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure may have on this legislation or similar legislation in the future. I will insert copies of this exchange in the Congressional Record during consideration of this bill on the House floor. I thank you for your cooperation in this matter. Sincerely, MICHAEL T. M CCAUL, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security. 
Mr. VELA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2281, the Border Enforcement Security Task Force Reauthorization Act of 2017. Mr. Speaker, this bill, H.R. 2281, seeks to reauthorize the Border Enforcement Security Task Force, or BEST, program within the Department of Homeland Security. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement leads 42 BEST units across 16 States within the United States and Puerto Rico. Each unit is comprised of members from ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, as well as other Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies who investigate criminal activity along the southwest and northern borders and at the Nation’s major seaports. These units play a critical role in advancing DHS’ border security efforts by ensuring all levels of domestic law enforcement are sharing information and leveraging resources. BEST units have been instrumental in coordinating joint operations with our law enforcement partners in Mexico to thwart threats posed by transnational criminal organizations. This legislation is in furtherance of my efforts as ranking member of the Subcommittee on Boder and Maritime Security to bolster law enforcement collaboration on crossborder threats and to ensure that resources are used in a strategic manner to effectively mitigate such threats, particularly in response to the drug cartels. Those of us representing border districts are well aware that cartels adapt quickly to exploit real or perceived weaknesses in our security. As they shift their criminal operations to new locations along our land borders, smuggle their contraband into the United States through our ports of entry, or utilize maritime routes into this country, DHS must be at the ready to quickly intercept and disrupt their operations. This legislation seeks to ensure that DHS continues to use BEST units to maximum effect. This bill instructs DHS, before standing up a BEST unit, to consider the crossborder threats posed by transnational criminal organizations, the Department’s homeland and border security strategic priorities, as well as the operations of DHS’ joint task forces and other multiagency efforts. H.R. 2281 also updates existing reporting requirements so that Congress has better information on how effectively BEST units are reducing criminal activity, such as the traffic of drugs, weapons, and people along our borders; enhancing information sharing among law enforcement partners; coordinating with the Department’s joint task forces; and generally advancing the DHS homeland security and border security strategic priorities. I also want to thank my colleagues on the Border and Maritime Security Subcommittee who have cosponsored this legislation, including Subcommittee Chairwoman MARTHA  MCSALLY . I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2281. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2281, the Border Enforcement Security Task Force Reauthorization Act of 2017, is a commonsense, bipartisan bill that seeks to maximize the effectiveness of the successful border security program and ensure that, going forward, the program continues to contribute to making our Nation more safe and secure. H.R. 2281 was approved by voice vote by the full committee on May 3 and enjoys broad, bipartisan support. Before I yield back, I would like to thank Chairman MCCAULand Ranking Member THOMPSON , as well as Subcommittee Chairwoman MCSALLY , for their work on this bill. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to adopt this legislation. I want to note that, back in the mid nineties when I was starting out my career as a Federal organized crime prosecutor, I was set on the border in El Paso, Texas, and I had a frontline view, as I was going after cartellevel drug traffickers back then, of just what a problem the border is. Many people think of the border’s primary problem being illegal aliens, but I can tell you firsthand—and I think my colleague from Texas will agree with me—that drug trafficking remains a gigantic issue, and the poison that is killing our kids is streaming across the southwest border in particular. 
It is imperative that bills like this continue. It is imperative that Congressman VELA, Congresswoman MCSALLY , and the others on their subcommittee continue their great work identifying issues along the border, both north and south, and that the BEST concept continues and, indeed, hopefully, expands in the future. Targeted law enforcement that involves people on both sides of the border and law enforcement is the only way we are ever going to solve this problem. I commend them for their work on this. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2281 the ‘‘Border Enforcement Security Task Force Reauthorization Act of 2017.’’ As a Senior Member on the House Committee on Homeland Security; and former Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Border and Maritime Security, I know well the importance of protecting our nation’s borders. I thank my colleague Congressman VELAfor sponsoring this bipartisan legislation, which reauthorizes the Border Enforcement Security Task Force (BEST) program. An escalation in drug trafficking and transnational criminal activity along our nation’s southern border has led to record levels of violence and drug traffickingrelated homicides. Despite significant efforts to combat the drug trade, many governments in the region suffer from overwhelmed criminal justice systems and law enforcement agencies. There must be a multipronged approach to solving the drug crisis in the United States, it must include treatment upon demand; education; increase resources for border interdiction and seizure of illicit drugs and advanced technology to detect and track those who may be engaged in illegal activity along the border. The Border Enforcement Security Task Force is accomplishing the important law enforcement component of border security. The Border Enforcement Security Task Force achieves its goal of border security enhancement by facilitating collaboration among federal, state, local, tribal, and foreign law enforcement agencies to execute coordinated activities in furtherance of border security and homeland security; and enhancing information sharing, including the dissemination of homeland security information among such agencies. The BEST program is currently administered by DHS, and involves information sharing and lawenforcement operations between personnel from federal, state, local, tribal, and foreign lawenforcement agencies to combat criminal activity near the United States borders. This program has established teams of law enforcement agents from over 100 law enforcement agencies that form units to investigate transnational criminal activity. This approach supports better cooperation and collaboration among federal, state, local and tribal law enforcement agencies when investigating criminal activity along the southwest and northern borders, as well as at the nation’s major seaports. Since their inception, BEST Units have collectively initiated more than 10,654 cases. These actions have resulted in more than: 2,718 criminal arrests 7,245 administrative arrests 110,711 pounds of cocaine 5,517 pounds of ecstasy 1,764 pounds of heroin 1,036,749 pounds of marijuana 6,325 pounds of methamphetamine 2,988,561 rounds of ammunition 4,657 vehicles $130.2 million in U.S. currency 15,062 weapons This bill instructs the Secretary of Homeland Security to also consider: The crossborder threats posed by transnational criminal organizations; The Department’s homeland and border security strategic priorities; and The departmental Joint Task Forces and other multiagency crossborder operations when establishing new BEST Units. In addition, this bill would update the Secretary’s existing reporting requirement to provide an assessment of how BEST Units enhance informationsharing among law enforcement partners, coordinate with Departmental Joint Task Forces, and advance the Department’s homeland and border security strategic priorities. This legislation will improve and update the information sharing practices between our law enforcement agencies so they will operate in a cohesive manner. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2281 the BEST program because it had proven throughout the years to improve our border security, along with improving how our law enforcement agencies operate and share vital information. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. KATKO ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2281, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
b1600 REMOVING OUTDATED RESTRICTIONS TO ALLOW FOR JOB GROWTH ACT Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1177) to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to release on behalf of the United States the condition that certain lands conveyed to the City of Old Town, Maine, be used for a municipal airport, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1177 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Removing Outdated Restrictions to Allow for Job Growth Act’’. 
(a) R ELEASE .—Notwithstanding section 32(c) of the BankheadJones Farm Tenant Act (7 U.S.C. 1011(c)), if the City of Old Town, Maine, makes a written request to the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary shall release, convey, and quitclaim, without monetary consideration, all rights, title, and interest of the United States in and to the lands specified in subsection (b). (b) LANDS SPECIFIED .—The lands subject to subsection (a) include only the lands— (1) conveyed by the United States to the City of Old Town, Maine, under section 32(c) of the BankheadJones Farm Tenant Act (7 U.S.C. 1011(c)) by the deed dated June 5, 1941; (2) proposed for conveyance by the City of Old Town, Maine, for the purpose of economic development; and (3) described in the written request submitted by the City of Old Town, Maine, to the Secretary of Agriculture pursuant to subsection (a). 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. PETERSON ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Illinois? There was no objection. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1177, Removing Outdated Restrictions to Allow for Job Growth Act. In the early 1980s, the city of Old Town, Maine, purchased land from the Federal Government to be part of the Old Town airport. The deed included a use restriction, as required by a 1941 amendment to the BankheadJones Farm Tenant Act of 1937, limiting use of the land to a municipal airport or other public use. Old Town has invested heavily in this land in order to attract businesses, but the outdated deed restriction needs to be lifted before further economic development can occur. H.R. 1177 provides for the removal of the deed restriction on the parcel of land around the Old Town airport to allow for business development. The bill allows the City of Old Town to send a letter to the Secretary of Agriculture detailing which lands it would like released from the deed restriction and directs the Secretary to release that land to the city of Old Town. Passage of this commonsense provision will allow economic development in Old Town to move forward, creating as many as 200 muchneeded jobs. This legislation will provide certainty to private investors in the community and help the local economy thrive. I would like to thank the gentleman from Maine (Mr. POLIQUIN ) for addressing this issue, and our chairman on the 
House Agriculture Committee, Chairman CONAWAY , for moving this bill forward. This is a good government bill that eliminates red tape to unleash private investment. At a time when rural America is struggling—it is people like Representative POLIQUIN and all of us— we must do all we can to encourage growth and development in rural communities, many that we all serve, but also the one that Representative POLIQUIN serves in Old Town, Maine. I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1177 is a bill that will allow the city of Old Town, Maine, to move forward with economic development plans that have been hampered by Federal red tape. H.R. 1177 removes the current deed restriction on the land surrounding the Old Town airport. This will allow the city to implement economic development initiatives that will create jobs and spur economic activity in the area. As a pilot, I am glad to see that the airport will not be impacted by this change and will continue to meet the region’s air transportation needs. Again, H.R. 1177 is common sense, reasonable legislation. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. PETERSON ) for supporting this legislation. I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Maine (Mr. POLIQUIN ), who actually was the one who brought this bill to the attention of the House Agriculture Committee and to the floor here today. It is his hard work, and there are not many in this institution who work harder than Representative POLIQUIN in addressing the needs of rural America. Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Illinois for those kind remarks. I am so proud to represent the most honest and hardworking Americans you can find anywhere. Maine’s Second Congressional District is, if not the largest, the second largest congressional district east of the Mississippi River. It is about an 8hour drive from Fryeburg to Madawaska, and you are going to spend about half your time dodging moose and other critters on the road. We are tough, we are rugged, but we need jobs. We need jobs. We have had a situation in our State for the past 30 years where many of our paper mills and sawmills and textile mills and leather tanneries have closed. We have a handful left. And right smack in the middle of our State is the great city of Old Town, Maine, just a little bit north of Bangor. Old Town has also suffered the closure of a significant mill—or two, actually. Ron Harriman, who is the economic development director of Old Town, reached out to our office and said: Bruce, we have a problem here. We have a terrific piece of property surrounding our airport. We have gone through extensive work and cost to the town to extend utilities to this piece of land. But lo and behold, there is a Federal deed restriction on that land that dates back decades that doesn’t allow us to sell the land and develop it for more jobs. I don’t doubt at the time, Mr. Speaker, that the Federal Government that was buying up local property across the country, reclaiming it and turning it into agricultural land, I don’t question the purpose of that and the good intentions of that; but that was a long time ago. We now have a situation where the city of Old Town needs to be able to sell this property in order to attract other investment and other jobs to help our families in central Maine. Removing this deed restriction will allow that to happen. I am asking everybody in this Chamber, Republicans and Democrats—and I thank the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. PETERSON )—please support H.R. 1177. There are many times, Mr. Speaker, when all the government needs to do is get out of the way. This is one example. Let the Federal Government get out of the way. We know how to create jobs in the State of Maine. Let’s remove this red tape. Let’s let this land be sold for folks who want to create jobs. I would be very grateful for everybody in this Chamber to support H.R. 1177 and let the people of central Maine live better lives with more jobs and more freedom. Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support passage of this commonsense legislation, H.R. 1177. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. RODNEYDAVIS) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1177. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
EDWARD T. SCHAFER AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH CENTER Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2154) to rename the Red River Valley Agricultural Research Center in Fargo, North Dakota, as the Edward T. Schafer Agricultural Research Center, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 2154 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. RENAMING OF THE RED RIVER VALLEY AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH CENTER IN FARGO, NORTH DAKOTA AS THE EDWARD T. SCHAFER AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH CENTER. 
(a) R ENAMING .—The Red River Valley Agricultural Research Center in Fargo, North Dakota, shall hereafter be known and designated as the ‘‘Edward T. Schafer Agricultural Research Center’’. (b) REFERENCES .—Any reference in any law, regulation, map, document, paper, or other record of the United States to the facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be considered to be a reference to the Edward T. Schafer Agricultural Research Center. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. PETERSON ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Illinois? There was no objection. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in support of H.R. 2154, to rename the Red River Valley Agricultural Research Center in Fargo, North Dakota, as the Edward T. Schafer Agricultural Research Center. And this, Mr. Speaker, is in spite of the fact that it is located at North Dakota State University, which, in January of 2015, beat my Illinois State Red Birds for the FCS football championship and caused me to have to bring cupcakes from Normal, Illinois, to pay a bet with my colleague who is the author of this bill, Congressman KEVIN CRAMER . So I still support this bill in spite of those actions because it is a good bill, Mr. Speaker. Ed Schafer served as North Dakota’s Governor from 1992 to 2000, and as our Nation’s Secretary of Agriculture from 2008 to 2009. Renaming the Red River Valley Agricultural Research Center in Fargo, North Dakota, to honor Secretary Schafer is a fitting tribute to his distinguished career in public service. Located in Secretary Schafer’s home State and at one of the Nation’s premier land grant universities, this research center continues to advance its vital work on improving crops to strengthen our Nation’s food security. I greatly appreciate the work—in spite 
of the cupcakes—that Congressman KEVIN CRAMER has put forth on this bill, his leadership, and I urge my colleagues to join me today in supporting this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. H.R. 2154 recognizes former U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary and former North Dakota Governor Ed Schafer by renaming the Red River Valley Agricultural Research Center in his honor. The research center serves the region, including my district in Minnesota, by coordinating five research units in two Fargo laboratories. The center does a wide range of work with a focus on animal metabolismagricultural chemicals, cereal crops, insect genetics and biochemistry, sugar beet and potato, and sunflower and plant biology research. I worked closely with Ed Schafer when he was at USDA and also during the time he was North Dakota’s Governor. We worked on many things together. Some of them were pleasant and some of them not so pleasant, such as floods and so forth. I think it is a fitting recognition for an outstanding career in government, and I am happy to be here to support this bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, again, I thank the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. PETERSON ) for supporting this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from North Dakota (Mr. CRAMER ), the author of this bill. Mr. CRAMER. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. DAVIS and my colleague, Mr. PETERSON , from across the Red River in Minnesota for their support for this renaming of the Red River Valley Agricultural Research Center. For all of the reasons that Representative PETERSON  talked about, it is a worldclass facility in a worldclass town, and I think it should be named after a worldclass guy, and I think Ed Schafer is that. I had the opportunity to serve under Ed when he was Governor for 8 years. I served in his cabinet. His intellect and his common sense are matched only by his boundless energy and his eternal optimism, qualities he brings to every job he does, including his work at the Department of Agriculture. When he was recognized by his former Governor colleague, President George W. Bush, and asked to join the administration in that department, it was a remarkable thing not just for agriculture, not just for Ed, but for our State. North Dakota is number one in the production of many crops. Agriculture is the number one industry in our State. It is what makes North Dakota what North Dakota is: the ability to feed hungry people in a growing world. Ed brought that common sense to USDA and that work ethic that works the land so effectively. I feel like this is a fitting tribute to him. It is a celebration not only of his accomplishments, but a celebration of agriculture in North Dakota and the entire Red River Valley, including Congressman PETERSON ’s district, and really for our world. I would note that our two Senators, while it is easy for me to get unanimity in the House for the North Dakota House caucus since I am the only one, North Dakota’s two Senators have a companion bill in the Senate introduced by Senator HOEVEN and cosponsored by Senator HEITKAMP , and they support this effort as well. I appreciate the work of the committee and the work of Ed Schafer, and I look forward, hopefully, to a celebration of the renaming. Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers on this side. Again, I thank the gentleman from North Dakota (Mr. CRAMER ) for bringing this forward. Mr. Schafer is a great member of our community. He spends some time in my hometown every year and I have gotten to know him very well. He very much deserves this honor. I am happy to support this bill, and I ask my colleagues to support it. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. b1615 Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I agree with my colleagues from Minnesota and North Dakota. I urge all Members to support this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. DAVIS) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2154, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
COMBATING EUROPEAN ANTI SEMITISM ACT OF 2017 Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 672) to require continued and enhanced annual reporting to Congress in the Annual Report on International Religious Freedom on antiSemitic incidents in Europe, the safety and security of European Jewish communities, and the efforts of the United States to partner with European governments, the European Union, and civil society groups, to combat antiSemitism, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 672 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Combating European AntiSemitism Act of 2017’’. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: (1) During the past decade, there has been a steady increase in antiSemitic incidents in Europe, resulting in European Jews being the targets of physical and verbal harassment and even lethal terrorist attacks, all of which has eroded personal and communal security and the quality of daily Jewish life. (2) According to reporting by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA), between 2005 and 2014, antiSemitic incidents increased in France from 508 to 851; in Germany from 60 to 173; in Belgium from 58 to 130; in Italy from 49 to 86; and in the United Kingdom from 459 to 1,168. (3) AntiZionism has at times devolved into antiSemitic attacks, prompting condemnation from many European leaders, including French Prime Minister Manuel Valls, British Prime Minister David Cameron, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. (4) Since 2010, the Department of State has adhered to the working definition of Anti Semitism by the European Monitoring Center on Racism and Xenophobia (EUMC). Some contemporary examples of antiSemitism include the following: (A) Calling for, aiding, or justifying the killing or harming of Jews (often in the name of a radical ideology or an extremist view of religion). (B) Making mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews as such, or the power of Jews as a collective, especially, but not exclusively, the myth about a world Jewish conspiracy or of Jews controlling the media, economy, government, or other societal institutions. (C) Accusing Jews as a people of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jewish person or group, the State of Israel, or even for acts committed by nonJews. (D) Accusing the Jews as a people, or Israel as a state, of inventing or exaggerating the Holocaust. (E) Accusing Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel, or to the alleged priorities of Jews worldwide, than to the interest of their own countries. (5) On October 16, 2004, the President signed into law the Global AntiSemitism Review Act of 2004. This law provides the legal foundation for a reporting requirement provided by the Department of State annually on antiSemitism around the world. (6) In November 2015, the House of Representatives passed H. Res. 354 by a vote of 418–0, urging the Secretary of State to continue robust United States reporting on anti Semitism by the Department of State and the Special Envoy to Combat and Monitor AntiSemitism. (7) In 2016, the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA), comprised of 31 member countries, adopted a working definition of antiSemitism which stated: ‘‘Anti Semitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antiSemitism are directed toward Jewish or nonJewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.’’. (8) The IHRA further clarified that manifestations of antiSemitism might also target the State of Israel, conceived of as a Jewish collectivity. AntiSemitism frequently charges Jews with conspiring to harm humanity, and it is often used to blame Jews for ‘‘why things go wrong’’. It is expressed in speech, writing, visual forms, and action, and employs sinister stereotypes and negative character traits. 
(1) it is in the national interest of the United States to combat antiSemitism at home and abroad; (2) antiSemitism is a challenge to the basic principles of tolerance, pluralism, and democracy, and the shared values that bind Americans and Europeans together; (3) there is an urgent need to ensure the safety and security of European Jewish communities, including synagogues, schools, cemeteries, and other institutions; (4) the United States should continue to emphasize the importance of combating antiSemitism in multilateral bodies, including the United Nations, European Union institutions, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe; (5) the Department of State should continue to thoroughly document acts of anti Semitism and antiSemitic incitement that occur around the world, and should continue to encourage other countries to do the same, and share their findings; and (6) the Department of State should continue to work to encourage adoption by national government institutions and multilateral institutions of a working definition of antiSemitism similar to the one adopted in the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance context. 
SEC. 4. ANNUAL REPORTING ON THE STATE OF ANTISEMITISM IN EUROPE. 
Paragraph (1) of section 102(b) of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6412) is amended by adding at the end the following new subparagraph: ‘‘(G) ANTISEMITISM IN EUROPE .—In addition to the information required under clause (vii) of subparagraph (A), with respect to each European country in which verbal or physical threats or attacks are particularly significant against Jewish persons, places of worship, schools, cemeteries, and other religious institutions, a description of— ‘‘(i) the security challenges and needs of European Jewish communities and European law enforcement agencies in such countries to better protect such communities; ‘‘(ii) to the extent practicable, the efforts of the United States Government over the reporting period to partner with European law enforcement agencies and civil society groups regarding the sharing of information and best practices to combat antiSemitic incidents in Europe; ‘‘(iii) European educational programming and public awareness initiatives that aim to collaborate on educational curricula and campaigns that impart shared values of pluralism and tolerance, and showcase the positive contributions of Jews in culture, scholarship, science, and art, with special attention to those segments of the population that exhibit a high degree of antiSemitic animus; and ‘‘(iv) efforts by European governments to adopt and apply a working definition of anti Semitism.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. ENGEL ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. 
Mr. ROYCE of California. I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material in the RECORD . The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by thanking my colleagues NITALOWEY  and Chairman Emeritus ILEANA ROS LEHTINEN for their leadership on the Bipartisan Task Force for Combating AntiSemitism and for their good work on this timely and important bill. Mr. Speaker, I will lay out this case, but it is one we are familiar with. Hostility towards the Jewish people in some European cities is very deep, making Jews in certain areas look over their shoulders, afraid to walk the streets at night. In recent years, this surge in antiSemitism has led to an outbreak of violent attacks. Those violent attacks are targeting certain Jewish neighbors. They are targeting places of worship. I think back to 2015, the deadly attacks on the kosher supermarket in Paris and, later on, the synagogue in Copenhagen. European governments have since passed laws designed to better protect their Jewish citizens, designed to punish those who perpetrate antiSemitic incidents, but much more work remains to be done because there needs to be a better coordination on these efforts between Jewish communities and law enforcement and more comprehensive reporting on the incidents to identify trends, to identify problematic regions. In addition, in order to consistently apply antiSemitism laws throughout Europe, there needs to be a uniform legal understanding of what constitutes antiSemitism. Let me explain. We must be clear on this. The fire bombing of synagogues is not a political protest. The defacing of cemeteries, the yelling slurs at rabbis, the threatening of Jewish school children, this is not political protest. This is antiSemitism, and it must be stopped. Absent a cleareyed definition of antiSemitism, perpetrators of violent acts have, at times, been given a pass for their actions due to the flimsy defense of political protest. Adoption across Europe of a single definition of antiSemitism would provide an important foundation for law enforcement officials, enabling them to better enforce laws and develop strategies for improved security for the Jewish community. This bill, H.R. 672, the Combating European AntiSemitism Act of 2017, calls for these fundamental improvements, and it reaffirms the U.S. commitment to combating antiSemitism. It urges European nations to adopt a working definition of antiSemitism. It calls for increased reporting on it. AntiSemitic incidents in Europe have to be reported in a way in which people can be held accountable. Collaborative efforts between U.S. and European law enforcement and the efforts to improve security for Jewish communities is another important aspect of this legislation. Now is the time to act and pass this important measure. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure. Let me start by thanking the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. LOWEY ), my good friend and neighbor, the ranking member of the Committee on Appropriations. I also want to thank Chairman ROYCE  for his steadfast support in bringing this bill to the floor today. Mr. Speaker, it is so shocking and so heartbreaking to me that, in the year 2017, we wake up day after day to read about antiSemitic vandalism and violence, antiSemitic slurs on Munich buses, Russian socalled law makers pedaling antiSemite conspiracy theories, horrific murders in a kosher market in Paris 2 years ago. Of course, Mr. Speaker, here in our own country, bomb threats to Jewish community centers, desecration of cemeteries. Actually, I can hardly believe it. We know this ancient hatred has never been extinguished. It has always found some dark corner in which to fester until some new group on the fringe tries to pull it back into the mainstream. I fear we are seeing that sort of resurgence right now. When we hear these toxic ideas emanating from major political parties and governing bodies in Europe, we know it is time for action. It needs to be stopped, and this bill will help. This legislation builds on the 1998 International Religious Freedom Act, which established annual reporting on religious freedom worldwide, as well as the 2004 Global AntiSemitism Review Act, which required the State Department to report every year on antiSemitism around the world. This measure calls for continued and enhanced reporting on antiSemitic incidents in Europe. We want to focus on what has been a hotbed of antiSemitism in recent years so that no active antiSemitic hatred goes unnoticed. This bill also expresses our view in Congress that it is in our country’s interest to combat antiSemitism here and abroad; that it is critical to ensure the safety of European Jewish communities; that multilateral organizations like the U.N. and OSCE have an important role to play in combating anti Semitism; that we should continue to report antiSemitic acts worldwide; and that our allies should follow our lead and document antiSemitic acts when they take place so we can share our findings amongst ourselves. We also call on the State Department to adopt the working definition of anti Semitism used by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, because words do matter when it comes to the way we talk about this challenge. It is absolutely amazing that 70 someodd years after World War II ended—and that decade culminated in 
the murder of 6 million Jews in Europe in the Holocaust, men, women, and children—it is absolutely unbelievable that 70 years later you would see anti Semitism in the same places in Europe rear its ugly head by stupid people who don’t know what they are saying or doing. It is just amazing. You think there would be some kind of sensitivity about the Holocaust and about all the innocent people who were murdered for just the one reason that they were Jewish, and yet you see nonothings, as far as I am concerned, popping up again with their antiSemitic hatred. It is bad wherever it goes, but it is especially repugnant to have it in Europe, the site of the murder of 6 million Jewish people. I am very grateful to Representative LOWEY for her hard work on this bill. I am pleased to support it. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. POE), chairman of the Foreign Affairs’ Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding me time, and I thank the chairman and the ranking member for their comments on this legislation. The bill promotes religious freedom throughout the world. Mr. Speaker, as has been mentioned, it has been 60 to 70 years since the Jewish community in Europe was decimated by the Holocaust. Now, more than ever, the Jewish community is under assault yet again. In Europe, antiSemitic individuals are back like never before. A study commissioned by the German parliament this year found that there were 644 antiSemitic offenses in the country in 2016 alone. In countries like Holland, Jewish schools and synagogues need to be protected by special forces because of fear of attack on those schools. And, unfortunately, our country has not been immune. Jewish community centers across the country have been targets of bomb threats, even recently in Houston, Texas, my hometown, such bomb threats. This past Sunday, a historic synagogue in New York City was attacked and burned down by arsonists. That is why this bill, the Combating European AntiSemitism Act, is so important. We must continue to partner with our European friends to ensure that we stamp out the cancer of antiSemitism. As a representative of a country founded on religious freedom, we, as Members of Congress, must send a clear message to Jews and nonJews, from Houston to Amsterdam, that we will not allow the horrors of the Holocaust to repeat themselves in this generation. Mr. Speaker, we must reiterate the commitment the free world made over 60 years ago: Never again. Never again. And that is just the way it is. b1630 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. LOWEY ), my good friend, my fellow New Yorker, the author of this bill, and the ranking member of the Committee on Appropriations. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friends, Chairman EDROYCE  and Ranking Member ELIOT ENGEL , and all those involved in advancing this important legislation. I rise in support of H.R. 672, the Combating European AntiSemitism Act, which was introduced by the cochairs of the Bipartisan Taskforce for Combating AntiSemitism. With the rising threat of antiSemitism in Europe, this bill would require enhanced reporting to Congress on antiSemitic incidents in Europe, the safety and security of European Jewish communities, and the efforts of the United States to partner with European entities to combat antiSemitism. This bill also urges the Department of State to continue encouraging European governments and multilateral institutions to adopt a clear and comprehensive working definition of anti Semitism. I find it hard to believe that in the 21st century European Jews worry about whether or not there is a future for their communities in Europe. But with increased antiSemitic sentiments throughout Europe and many Jews becoming the targets of verbal, physical, and even deadly terrorist attacks, the security and quality of life for European Jewish communities has deteriorated. This is simply unacceptable. AntiSemitism is not simply a Jewish problem. Xenophobia and other forms of racism are never far behind when this pernicious threat rears its ugly head. The United States must remain a leader in the fight against anti Semitism wherever it occurs to ensure that our commitment to ‘‘never again’’ remains a reality. Finally, I want to express my appreciation to my fellow cochairs of the Bipartisan Taskforce for Combating AntiSemitism, Representatives SMITH, ENGEL , G RANGER , D EUTCH , R OS LEHTINEN , VEASEY , and R OSKAM . The task force remains committed to working across regions, religions, and party lines to condemn all antiSemitism and fight for the right of Jews to live freely without fear at home and abroad. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. ROS LEHTINEN ), who chairs the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa and is our chairman emeritus. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman and the ranking member for working to help bring this important bill to the floor in a timely manner and, more importantly, for conducting the affairs of our full committee in an eventempered, professional manner that is an example to the rest of the House. It is an honor to serve under their leadership. I also want to thank my good friend NITALOWEY because she is the author of this bill, but I want to thank her for her leadership in fighting antiSemitism across the world. She has been at this fight for many a year. We have worked closely together on defeating this hatred, one of the world’s oldest forms of discrimination. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of her bill, and I thank the gentlewoman from New York. Mr. Speaker, this bill is an important initiative for our Bipartisan Taskforce for Combating AntiSemitism, a task force of which I am proud to be a cofounder and a cochair along with Mrs. LOWEY , Mr. E NGEL , of course C HRIS SMITH, T EDDEUTCH , K AYGRANGER , PETER ROSKAM , MARCVEASEY , so many good Members. But more than that, Mr. Speaker, it is an important initiative for the Jewish communities across Europe who have been facing a troubling increase in antiSemitic incidents and attacks over the past years that have put their safety and their security at risk. Mr. Speaker, all across Europe, Jews have been targeted. Their places of worship have been targeted, their homes, targeted; their businesses, targeted. Why? Because of their faith. They have been the target of deadly attacks in European cities, democratic societies that we call allies: France, Belgium, Denmark, elsewhere—horrific. This is simply unconscionable, Mr. Speaker. There is no time to delay in taking action. We cannot allow for an atmosphere of intolerance and hatred to once again rear its ugly head in Europe. That is why this bill is an important first step. We have identified growing antiSemitism as a problem before, but this bill will enhance reporting requirements so that we can more acutely identify the problems and, equally important, Mr. Speaker, we can identify the security challenges facing these Jewish communities. Then we can learn how to best tackle this, and we can learn how we can partner with our European allies and our friends and local law enforcement, along with civil society, to protect against antiSemitic acts. We can get a better understanding of how our partners in Europe can better educate their children. We can get a handle on how to better promote awareness in their societies to the dangers of such blind hatred. In closing, Mr. Speaker, I want to say that the first step in fighting anti Semitism is identifying the problem areas and then developing a plan to address it. This bill will help us identify the problem. It is an important first step in taking the necessary action to protect the Jewish communities of Europe. I urge my colleagues to support this important bill. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to close. 
Let me first say, I agree with all the eloquent statements made by my colleagues on both sides of the aisle pertaining to this bill. I want to thank Mrs. LOWEY , again, because it is a really important bill. It is really important that we don’t sweep this under the rug. It is really important that we don’t try to hide it or sugarcoat it. Whether it happens here, whether it happens in Europe, no matter where it happens, any form of anti Semitism, any form of hatred of one group toward another needs to be roundly condemned and stopped. That is what we are trying to do here. It hasn’t even been a century since we heard this canary in the coal mine: political parties scapegoating Jews; insidious campaigns that question the humanity of Jewish populations or their legitimacy as members of certain societies; governments, popularly elected governments, saying that it was okay to hate. We don’t think it is okay to hate. That is why we are doing this. What we hear today is unnerving in light of that history. Mr. Speaker, we know what happened when too few good people stood up and spoke out. We cannot allow that history to repeat. We must do whatever it takes to ensure that it doesn’t. This bill will help us address a part of this growing concern. It will shine a bright light on the resurgence of anti Semitism in Europe. It is just a piece of the puzzle, but it is a good start. I am proud to stand with my colleagues today to support this measure. I urge all Members to do the same. I thank the others on this side of the aisle and the other side of the aisle who have spoken on this, especially Chairman ROYCE . I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. First, let me say that the words just spoken by Ranking Member ELIOT ENGEL are precisely the sentiment that I think we all wish to convey. We must do all we can to combat antiSemitism in all of its insidious forms, and we do it because the consequences, the horrifying consequences of doing nothing in the face of such evil, are unconscionable. We must not repeat the mistakes of the past by remaining silent, as this same poison affects our communities today. Passage of this bill sends a clear signal that antiSemitism has no place in free societies and urges our European partners to provide practical guidance that will empower law enforcement and better equip them to tackle this rising problem, and it sends the message that our own law enforcement is willing to work hand in hand with theirs in order to tackle this problem. I appreciate the work of Congresswoman LOWEY and Congresswoman ROSLEHTINEN and, of course, Mr. ENGEL , the ranking member. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 672, the Combating AntiSemitism Act of 2017, sponsored by my friend NITALOWEY . I and all of our fellow CoChairs of the BiPartisan Task Force for Combating AntiSemitism are original cosponsors. Among its provisions, the bill would require the State Department to include in existing annual reports information about the security challenges and needs of European Jewish communities and European law enforcement. This report would also document related U.S. government efforts to partner with European law enforcement agencies and civil society groups. H.R. 672 is important and timely. As witnesses testified at a hearing I chaired in March on ‘‘AntiSemitism Across Borders,’’ physical attacks on European Jewish communities, and other forms of antiSemitic hatred, remain rampant on the continent. Rabbi Andy Baker, Personal Representative of the OSCE ChairpersoninOffice on Combating AntiSemitism and Director of International Jewish Affairs at the American Jewish Committee noted that even after the deadly antiSemitic attacks in Paris, Brussels and Copenhagen, ‘‘problems still remain. Governments have taken different approaches, and some only in stopgap measures.’’ Rabbi Baker also emphasized that ‘‘We need to be cleareyed in confronting and combating antiSemitism, which manifests itself on both the right and the left.’’ At the same hearing, Paul Goldenberg, Director of the Security Community Network and Senior Advisor to the Rutgers University Faith Based Communities Security Program, warned that ‘‘Evermore connected, extremist groups in the United States are borrowing, adapting and enhancing the tactics and strategies adopted in Europe.’’ This is an especially sobering warning, given the man recent antiSemitic incidents here in the United States. Mark Weitzman, Director of Government Affairs for the Simon Wiesenthal Center, emphasized that ‘‘Fighting antisemitism has always been a bipartisan commitment and in today’s fractured political world it is more necessary than ever that the U.S. maintain its diplomatic and moral leadership in this issue. . . . we would strongly suggest that the position [of Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti Semitism] even be upgraded, to that of Ambassador, thus demonstrating the importance attached by our government to this issue.’’ H.R. 672 is an example of such bipartisanship. It would ensure that the Special Envoy, other U.S. officials, the Congress, and civil society—especially European Jewish communities that their security groups—have key information to act fully and effectively. With the right information, and robust action, the United States can help ensure the safety and security of Jewish communities in Europe and elsewhere. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 672, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. f 
EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE HOUSE REGARDING THE FIGHT AGAINST CORRUPTION IN CENTRAL AMERICA Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 145) expressing the sense of the House of Representatives regarding the fight against corruption in Central America, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the resolution. The text of the resolution is as follows: 
H. R ES. 145 Whereas according to Transparency International’s 2016 Corruption Perception Index, the citizens of Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Nicaragua perceive high levels of government corruption; Whereas widespread corruption in Central America weakens citizens’ faith in public institutions, limits government capacity to advance development goals, and allows drug traffickers and other criminals to thrive; Whereas the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) was created at the request of the Guatemalan Government in 2007, and has strengthened the capacity of Guatemalan institutions, especially the Office of the Attorney General, to combat corruption; Whereas the Office of the Attorney General of Guatemala and CICIG have recently collaborated to investigate and prosecute a series of corruption cases involving highlevel government officials, demonstrating that it is possible for governments in Central America to confront entrenched corruption, and that no one is above the law; Whereas the Attorney General of El Salvador has made significant progress in tackling corruption at the highest levels; Whereas after thousands of Hondurans joined street protests against corruption and in favor of an International Commission against Impunity in Honduras, the Honduran Government reached an agreement with the Organization of American States to create the Mission to Support the Fight against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras (MACCIH); Whereas MACCIH has begun to assist the Office of the Attorney General of Honduras with the investigation into the more than $300,000,000 that was embezzled from the Institute of Social Security; and Whereas the leadership of CICIG and MACCIH and the attorneys general of Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador have faced significant challenges, including credible threats against their lives, attempts to publicly discredit their work, or efforts to remove them from their posts: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the House of Representatives— (1) reaffirms that combating corruption in the Northern Triangle is an important policy interest for the United States; (2) acknowledges that the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) and the Mission to Support the Fight against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras (MACCIH) are currently making important contributions to this effort; 
(3) urges the Government of Guatemala to continue to cooperate with CICIG and the Government of Honduras to continue to cooperate with MACCIH; and (4) encourages the Governments of Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador to— (A) publicly support efforts to fight corruption; (B) respect the independence of the judicial branch and the Office of the Attorney General; and (C) ensure that the Office of the Attorney General in each Northern Triangle country receives sufficient domestic budget allocations to carry out its core responsibilities and that budgeted funds are delivered in a timely manner. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. ENGEL ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. 
Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous materials in the RECORD . The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE of California. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 145, which affirms this body’s support for the independent anticorruption commissions in Central America that seek to combat corruption and combat impunity in the countries of the Northern Triangle region. I would like to commend the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. TORRES ), a new member of the committee, for her work on this important resolution. Of course, I appreciate Mr. ENGEL , the ranking member and the former chairman of the Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, for his longtime focus on this critical region. Mr. Speaker, in recent years, the U.S. has seen a surge in illegal migration from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. Now, that is the Northern Triangle of Central America. Many of these migrants are fleeing violence. They are fleeing criminality and institutionalized corruption. More than anything, the citizens of these countries want governments that will work for them. As a result of these governments, the international community has responded. Governments in the region, including the United States, have helped to establish the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala—that is called CICIG—and the Mission to Support the Fight against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras, known as MACCIH. Both of these organizations are making important contributions to tackling the culture of corruption and impunity in their respective countries and are working to give the citizens of these countries confidence in their own judiciary. These organizations have put politicians and public servants on notice that nobody should be above the law and that their citizenry demands transparency. For example, this special body in Honduras has begun to assist the Office of the Attorney General with the investigation into the more than $300 million that was embezzled from the Institute of Social Security and, in Guatemala, has trained the prosecutors that successfully built highprofile corruption cases against multiple government officials, including the former Guatemalan President, President Molina. b1645 Once again, I want to thank Representative TORRES for bringing this measure forward and for her efforts in working with the Northern Triangle countries to urge greater respect for an independent judiciary and to bring greater security and prosperity to the people of the Northern Triangle countries. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this measure. Let me start by thanking the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, EDROYCE , from California. I am also especially grateful to another colleague from California, NORMA TORRES , a valuable member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, for authoring this bipartisan resolution, and also for her leadership as the founding cochair of the Central America Caucus. Mr. Speaker, when a child from El Salvador, Guatemala, or Honduras arrives at our southern border, he or she didn’t get there because it was an easy journey. It was because poverty, crime, or lack of opportunity at home left that child no option but to face that long, dangerous trek. No child anywhere should be forced to make that heartbreaking choice. The best way to ensure that this doesn’t happen is not to build a wall or isolate ourselves from our neighbors. It is to stop children from having to make that journey in the first place. It is by making longterm, strategic investments in a more secure and prosperous Central America. Over the last 2 years, Democrats and Republicans in Congress have come together to do just that. We made a bold, new foreign assistance commitment to Central America that helps address the root causes of child migration from the region. A big part of this effort is supporting those individuals who are working day in and day out to root out corruption in Central America: the attorneys general in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras; the heads of the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala; and the Mission to Support the Fight Against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras. These brave individuals put their lives on the line on a daily basis. This resolution that we are voting on signals that the United States agrees with them and has their backs. To Guatemala’s Attorney General Thelma Aldana, Honduran Attorney General Oscar Chinchilla, Salvadoran Attorney General Douglas Melendez, CICIG Commissioner Ivan Velasquez, and MACCIH Chief of Mission Juan Jimenez: Today we come to the floor of the House of Representatives to say thank you and to proclaim that we stand with you and your institutions in the fight against corruption. This measure sends a strong message that our Congress, which has the ultimate say over funding for Central America, stands with those who are committed to putting an end to corruption in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. We may have a new President in the White House and a new Secretary of State at Foggy Bottom, but Congress continues to have the power of the purse; and Democrats and Republicans, alike, believe that continued international support for the attorneys general and CICIG and MACCIH is key to the continued success of the Alliance for Prosperity in the Northern Triangle. In December, I led a letter to the attorneys general from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, along with Representative R OSLEHTINEN and several other members of the Foreign Affairs Committee, commending their efforts, pledging our ongoing support, and, most importantly, noting how crucial it is that they be able to carry out their work free from any interference from political leaders in their countries. With passage of H. Res. 145, the entire House of Representatives can and will send that same message. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important resolution, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. ROS LEHTINEN ), who chairs the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for the time. I applaud the work that both Chairman ROYCE and Ranking Member ENGEL have done in helping to focus more of our foreign policy priority here in our own Western Hemisphere. I also applaud Congresswoman NORMA TORRES for authoring the measure that we have before us today, H. Res. 145, reaffirming our dedication to the fight against corruption in Central America. It is an important measure, Mr. Speaker, and it is an important fight. For years, I have been a strong advocate for this fight because, where corruption is allowed to spread, drug trafficking and crime inevitably thrive; 
and this is negative for our neighbors, it is bad for us, and it is bad for our interests. That is why it is vital that we make battling corruption in the region more of a priority of our foreign policy. In fact, earlier this year, I traveled to Honduras and Guatemala with my good friend ALBIO SIRES, and we saw firsthand how these governments are attempting to tackle corruption in their countries. It is not easy, Mr. Speaker. They are making progress and taking some of the tough decisions necessary, but there is so much more to be done and so much more that they need to do, but they need help from the United States. That is what we heard when we hosted the attorneys general from the Northern Triangle countries here in Washington, D.C., just last month to discuss what they are doing to fight corruption and what assistance they might need from us. That is why this resolution before us is so important and so timely. We must urge the governments of Central America to do more to battle corruption, but we also must pledge to do more ourselves because they cannot do it alone. Central American governments must take a stand and voice their support for anticorruption programs. They must respect and defend the authority of the judicial branch, and they must make it a priority. That is not easy for them to do. Some of these governments have shown a willingness to take these steps, but, sadly, Mr. Speaker, not all of them have. While we urge willing partners to take the steps necessary to fight corruption, we must be willing to do more for those unwilling. That is why I have reintroduced my NICA Act, which aims at tightening the economic screws on the Ortega regime until we see some drastic reforms, including efforts to end corruption. It is our duty to support our neighbors so that our partners to the south can live in far more open, free, and democratic societies. It is also in the benefit of our security and it is in the benefit of our national interests to do so. That is why I urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 145. I also urge my colleagues to support my NICA Act and to take a more engaged role in our foreign policy interests in our own Western Hemisphere. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, it is now my pleasure to yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. TORRES ), the author of this resolution, a leader on Central American issues, and a valued member of the Foreign Affairs Committee. Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 145, expressing the support of the House of Representatives for the fight against corruption in Central America. In too many Central American countries, it has become common practice for government officials to use public office to enrich themselves instead of serving the public good. For too long, corruption has allowed violence and poverty to hold these countries back. But recently, the people of Central America have made it clear that they are ready for a change. In the last 2 years, young people from across the region have taken to the streets and demonstrated, and some real progress has been made. In Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, the attorneys general have demonstrated independence and real courage. In Guatemala, Attorney General Thelma Aldana has worked closely with CICIG, the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala. Under the leadership of Ivan Velasquez, CICIG has been instrumental in improving the capacity of Guatemala’s prosecutors and has assisted with effective investigations into corruption and human rights violations. In Honduras, Attorney General Oscar Chinchilla has worked with the Mission to Support the Fight Against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras, MACCIH, since 2016. Led by Juan Jimenez, MACCIH has promoted important legal reforms and is assisting with the investigations of highprofile corruption cases. In El Salvador, Attorney General Douglas Melendez has made significant progress in tackling highlevel corruption cases. I hope that the Government of El Salvador will recognize the value of CICIG and MACCIH and accept the international assistance that the attorney general and his prosecutors so clearly need. Mr. Speaker, the countries of the Northern Triangle are at a crucial point in this fight against corruption, and we cannot turn back the progress that has been made. This resolution will send a very clear message that the United States will be a steadfast partner in its support for the fight against corruption in Central America. I urge all of my colleagues to support this bipartisan resolution. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I thank Chairman ROYCE and Ranking Member ENGEL for their support and hard work in advancing this resolution. Additionally, I thank Congressman MOOLENAAR , who worked with me to draft and introduce this resolution and who has been a strong supporter and advocate of the fight against corruption in Central America. I also thank all of the cosponsors of this resolution. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman NORMA  TORRES for authoring this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. MOOLENAAR ), a member of the Committee on Appropriations. Mr. MOOLENAAR. Mr. Speaker, I also thank Chairman ROYCE and Ranking Member ENGEL for supporting this bipartisan resolution and moving it through the Foreign Affairs Committee. I especially want to thank Congresswoman TORRES for her leadership as a true champion on this issue and helping us all understand the importance of this. This resolution makes it clear that the United States strongly supports the anticorruption efforts in the Northern Triangle of Central America. Already, officials across the region are making headway. The attorney general of Guatemala, in particular, has made progress in taking on corruption at the highest levels of government. This resolution will reinforce support for these efforts in the region and will send a clear message to the millions of people who live in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras that the United States wants them to have a safe country, free of corrupt officials who steal from them. By supporting the efforts of our allies to fight corruption, it is my hope that these governments will continue to promote respect for the rule of law, thereby making it better for residents to live, work, and raise a family in their homelands. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Let me say that, as a father, I cannot imagine being faced with the choice of letting my children risk violence or death from criminal gangs or malnutrition, or taking a dangerous journey hundreds of miles on their own. No parent or child should ever be forced to make this choice. Unfortunately, far too many families in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras must do so on a daily basis. The good news is that our Congress has decided to make a muchneeded, longterm investment in Central America. At the core of these efforts is our commitment to support institutions and individuals that are rooting out corruption. H. Res. 145 makes it clear that our continued investment in Central America will depend on support for anticorruption efforts from the Salvadoran, Guatemalan, and Honduran Governments. Let me finally note that I am heartened that the fight against corruption in the hemisphere is not just limited to Central America. From Brazil to Chile to the Caribbean, the citizens of the Americas have finally had enough and have vowed to put an end to corruption once and for all. The least that our Congress can do is support these valiant efforts. I again thank Chairman ROYCE for working so well with me, putting our heads together over time, and passing good resolutions and legislation like this. I again thank Congresswoman TORRES for introducing this crucial resolution and for her hard work on it. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support its passage, and I yield back the balance of my time. b1700 Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, this important measure by Congresswoman NORMA TORRES affirms this body’s support for all efforts to combat corruption in Central America. The people of this region have been living in societies that, because of corruption, and that corruption has become endemic, has led to gang violence, to criminality, to high levels of impunity. And these conditions directly affect the ability of these governments to bring peace and prosperity to all of its citizens, and that, in turn, fuels the flows of those who leave illegally, migrants, to the Northern Hemisphere—well, to the United States. So the citizens of Northern Triangle countries, those in this region, want to live in safety in their own countries, and we can help by supporting efforts by the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala and its counterpart in Honduras, and those others in the region that are fighting for these efforts that enable an independent judiciary and a judiciary that combats corruption. NORMA TORRES ’ work on Central America has helped to build capacity in these countries to begin providing security for its citizens, and I urge my colleagues to support this measure. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, H. Res. 145, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the resolution, as amended, was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
CAESAR SYRIA CIVILIAN PROTECTION ACT OF 2017 Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1677) to halt the wholesale slaughter of the Syrian people, encourage a negotiated political settlement, and hold Syrian human rights abusers accountable for their crimes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1677 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
It is the sense of Congress that— (1) Bashar alAssad’s murderous actions against the people of Syria have directly contributed to the deaths of more than 480,000 civilians, led to the destruction of more than 50 percent of Syria’s critical infrastructure, and forced the displacement of more than 14,000,000 people, precipitating one of the worst humanitarian crises in more than 60 years; (2) international actions to protect vulnerable populations from attack by uniformed and irregular forces associated with the Assad regime, including Hezbollah, on land and by air, including through the use of barrel bombs, chemical weapons, mass starvation, industrialscale torture and execution of political dissidents, sniper attacks against pregnant women, and the deliberate targeting of medical facilities, schools, residential areas, and community gathering places, including markets, have been insufficient to date; (3) Assad’s use of chemical weapons, including chlorine, against the Syrian people violates the Chemical Weapons Convention, to which Syria is a party; (4) Assad’s abhorrent use of chemical weapons, most recently on April 4, 2017, in an attack on the town of Khan Shakhyn in which more than 90 people died, including women and children, and more than 600 hundred people were injured, is condemned in the strongest terms; (5) violent attacks resulting in death, injury, imprisonment or threat of prosecution against humanitarian aid workers and diplomatic personnel, as well as attacks on humanitarian supplies, facilities, transports, and assets, and acts to impede the access and secure movement of all humanitarian personnel are in violation of international humanitarian law and impede the lifesaving work of humanitarian organizations and diplomatic institutions; and (6) Assad’s continued claim of leadership and war crimes in Syria have served as a rallying point for the extremist ideology of the Islamic State, Jabhat alNusra, and other terrorist organizations. SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
It is the policy of the United States that all diplomatic and coercive economic means should be utilized to compel the government of Bashar alAssad to immediately halt the wholesale slaughter of the Syrian people and to support an immediate transition to a democratic government in Syria that respects the rule of law, human rights, and peaceful coexistence with its neighbors.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. ENGEL ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. 
Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material in the RECORD . The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I would like to start by commending the gentleman from New York (Mr. ENGEL ), the ranking member, for his leadership in authoring this critical legislation. Mr. ENGEL has long been the voice on Syria, and I must mention that the outline that he has given in terms of the initial problems when we saw those citizens on the streets of Damascus, walking, saying, ‘‘Peaceful, peaceful,’’ and then, as we saw on CNN, the automatic weapons open up and saw the Assad regime mow those civilians down—he was the first to begin to ring the alarm. I wish this body, and previous administrations as well, had done more to heed his calls. For 6 years, we have watched the Syrian regime launch wave after wave of unrelenting destruction on the people of Syria. Airstrikes, chemical weapons attacks, forced starvation, industrialscale torture, the deliberate targeting of hospitals, schools, marketplaces, and this done with precision bombs and with crude barrel bombs, and, as a consequence, Syrians suffering every day. Now, just last month, we saw footage of entire families killed, suffocated by sarin gas, a chemical weapon that Assad supposedly gave up under a deal brokered by Russia and the previous administration. The number of dead is estimated now to be close to 500,000, and another 14 million have been driven from their homes. And while ISIS plays a role in the violence in Syria, it is Bashar alAssad and his backers—among them, Russia, Iran, and Hezbollah—who are the main drivers of this death and destruction. ISIS has no airplanes. It is Russian and Syrian fighter planes and helicopters that drop those bombs on those hospitals and schools. It is Hezbollah and Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps fighters who attack cities, who burn crops, who prevent food and water and medical supplies from reaching vulnerable civilians. It is Assad’s secret police and intelligence groups who kidnap and torture and murder civilians from every ethnic group and political party, Sunni, Shia, Christians, Alawite; none are safe. One of the worst facilities is just 20 miles from Damascus, Sednaya, a prison, a place so terrible that it is called a human slaughterhouse. Thousands and thousands of people have been tortured and hung and shot and left to starve to death within the prison. And the numbers are so high that, in 2013, Assad began constructing a crematorium to dispose of the bodies. Over the past 4 years, our committee heard agonizing testimony from Syrians caught up in this horror, including the brave Syrian defector known to the world as Caesar and for whom this bill is named. Caesar testified about the shocking scale of torture being carried out within the prisons of Syria. We saw his photographs and the tens of thousands of photographs he took with those bodies numbered numerically. I don’t know what it is about totalitarian regimes that leads them to want to number their dead and catalog it, but, because of his bravery, we have those photographs. We have also heard from doctors who treat victims of chemical attacks, volunteers who dig through rubble with their bare hands to rescue those trapped within, and we have heard 
from the survivors of torture in Assad’s prisons. As Syria drags on and on, vital U.S. national security interests are at stake. Assad’s brutality is both a magnet for terrorist recruitment and a destabilizing force driving tens of millions of refugees out of that country. We have 14 million Syrians, as I said, who are displaced right now, many of them still in the country, and millions outside of the country, yet we have taken no steps to apply the economic tools that are available to us with respect to Assad and his backers. Mr. Speaker, this legislation is designed to increase the cost to Assad and to those outside backers by targeting the sectors of the economy that allow Assad to murder with impunity. Under the bill, foreign companies and banks will have to choose between doing business with the regime or with the United States. It would also sanction anyone who flies weapons or sends fighters into Syria to support the Assad regime. This bill is also about creating economic leverage to push the parties to negotiate, creating the conditions for a negotiated peace. It is about finding a way forward to be determined by the Syrian people that does not allow Assad to exterminate his own community; it does not allow him to do it with impunity; does not guarantee ISIS a safe space from which to operate; and does not drive another 10 million people from their homes. For there to be peace in Syria, the parties must come together, and so long as Assad and his backers can slaughter the people of Syria with no consequences, there is no hope for peace. As we speak, Russia and Iran have proclaimed themselves the guarantors of peace and have promised to create deescalation zones where military operations can be curtailed and civilians can seek safety. But these zones would be policed by the Syrian Army, supported by Russian military police, by Hezbollah fighters, and IRGC, Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps commanders, backed by those Shia militias—the very same people who have murdered thousands of Syrian civilians with impunity throughout this conflict and who are actively engaged in fomenting sectarianbased violence throughout the region. With this scenario, peace does not have a chance. Mr. Speaker, this bill is long overdue. And last year, ELIOT ENGEL and I brought this up, and we passed it unanimously, yet the other body did not take it up before we adjourned. I urge all Members to support this legislation as we seek to ease the suffering of the Syrian people. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation, and I yield myself as much time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am very grateful that the House is considering my bill today, the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act. I want to thank my friend, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, EDROYCE , for joining as the lead Republican cosponsor of this measure. I am proud that we are bringing it up to the floor with 108 cosponsors, Members from both sides of the aisle. Mr. Speaker, every week, more and more bad news pours in about the civil war in Syria. I am grateful to Chairman ROYCE for making the comments he just made because my heart has been bleeding for Syria, or crying out for Syria, for 4 or 5 years now, ever since, as Mr. ROYCE said, there were peaceful demonstrations and they were mowed down by the Assad regime. The United States didn’t do much. We sort of watched and retreated and perhaps were afraid that we would be bogged down in another war. But we should have, at that point, in my estimation, helped the free Syria Army, which begged us for help, not people, not troops, but help, and we didn’t do it. We didn’t give it to them. We thought that Assad would fall on his own, ultimately, but he didn’t, and we are bearing the price today. We are paying the price today. The people of Syria, unfortunately, are the ones paying the price. Millions of people have died and have been misplaced and just the horrors of war and the horrors of civilians. So my heart really bleeds for the Syrian people. This week, it was the revelation of a crematorium, a furnace where the criminals who do Assad’s bidding can pile the bodies and try to burn away the evidence of their atrocities. Also this week, Russia announced that they will work with Iran, Iraq, and Assad to open a secure road from Baghdad to Damascus. What that really means, Mr. Speaker, is a road from Beirut to Tehran in Iran, a permanent Iranian foothold right in the Middle East, a permanent Iranian foothold right on Israel’s border, a permanent Iranian foothold to do mischief and the usual nefarious things that the Iranian Government does. This crisis has been burning out of control for six long years. I was an early vocal supporter, as I mentioned before, of arming the moderate Syrian opposition. I thought we should have done much more to help push Assad out of power and help the Syrian people chart the course for their country’s future. When we didn’t, I spoke out. Since then, Assad has plowed ahead with his campaign of carnage. The few times he appeared to be taking on water, he was given a lifeline by his devoted enablers, Russia and Iran, through its terrorist proxy, Hezbollah. Every time Assad seemed to be losing, he was given a lifeline and, as I just mentioned, by Hezbollah, also given a lifeline by the Russians who came in. So while it was suspected in the highest annals of Washington that Assad wouldn’t last more than a few months, no one would have imagined that 4 and 5 years later there would be Assad winning the war, again, with the help of Russia, Iran, and their terrorist proxy. It is a disgrace, Mr. Speaker, and we need to act out. We need to help. Today, we find ourselves no closer to a solution, and 4 months into the new administration, we have yet to hear a strategy for dealing with Syria. The Tomahawk missile strike last month was an appropriate response to the chemical weapons attack, although I believe the administration’s policy shift, with respect to Assad, emboldened Assad to launch that attack, and a single missile strike is not a strategy. We need a plan to stop the violence, push a political transition that sees the end of Assad’s rule and helps the Syrian people recover and move forward. My bill, this bill, would be part of that strategy. b1715 It is named, as Mr. ROYCE pointed out, for Caesar, a former Syrian Government photographer. Fed up with documenting the brutality of the Assad regime, he defected and escaped so he could show the world exactly what was happening to the regime’s victims. I will never forget the images he showed us when he came to the Foreign Affairs Committee. Those images are still seared in my brain and I will never forget them; the depth of brutality and indifference to human life. We have named this bill after him because we want to send a message. If you are supporting this murder, if you are enabling the butcher in Damascus to continue waging that sort of violence against his own people, you are going to face consequences. This bill would sanction anyone who provides material support for the Assad regime. We want to go after the actual hardware that keeps his war machine running, the planes and bombs that terrorize the Syrian people, and the spare parts and oil that keep everything running. If you do business with Assad, the blood of the Syrian people is on your hands and you are going to get caught up in these sanction. Yes, that means Iran and Russia. If conditions on the ground change and negotiations were in sight, it might be useful to dial back these sanctions in order to help end the violence. So we have built in some degree of flexibility. The measures are tough, but we all want them to be a roadblock to peace. This bill also seeks to provide some relief to the Syrian people who are now suffering terribly. It would improve oversight of assistance flowing into Syria and evaluate the feasibility of a nofly zone. We also need to think about what must happen after the violence has ended, about who must be held accountable. So this bill requires reporting on human rights violators, and would support efforts to gather evidence of crimes against humanity. This bill isn’t a silver bullet. It isn’t a strategy for resolving the crisis in Syria. Congress can do a lot, though, when it comes to foreign policy. We can give an administration tools and resources, but it is up to the White House to lead on this issue. If the first step in a serious strategy is stopping the violence— and I think it is—this legislation can help dial up pressure on those driving the war. So I continue to push ahead; Mr. ROYCE at my side, and I am grateful to my colleagues for their support. I am grateful to the Foreign Affairs Committee for moving this swiftly. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. KINZINGER ), a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and an Air Force pilot. Mr. KINZINGER. Mr. Speaker, I thank you and the chairman. I want to commend the chairman. I want to commend Mr. ENGEL for his foresight in this bill and for bringing it to the floor. Mr. Speaker, I was just recently in Auschwitz. It was my first visit to Auschwitz and, obviously, seeing something like that is not something you are going to forget very quickly. Seeing something like that and an industrial machine put together to eliminate people is not something that people thought humanity was capable of 
until they found out that it actually was possible. So in preserving Auschwitz, the purpose was to say: Hey, this is possible. Never forget that this can happen again. Mr. Speaker, it was just recently that we learned about the crematorium that was built in the Syrian prison. Now, why was this built? It was built to hide the massive amounts of bodies coming out, tortured to death; destroyed the lives cut short in this Syrian prison. It was used to disguise that. It was used to prevent mass graves from being dug. I think that proves that Bashar al Assad is actually a modernday Hitler. In fact, if you look at when, as was mentioned prior, Caesar came to our committee and showed us the images of brutality—the government cataloging the victims of the Syrian regime with markers written on the body, a numbering system, and a catalog to say, in essence, document these massive amounts of death—it became very clear to us in a very visual sense what was going on in Syria. Mr. Speaker, oftentimes it is easy in the United States of America, where we have a lot of comforts and we have a lot of things granted to us that we take for granted, to look at a situation happening overseas and think it doesn’t apply to us or doesn’t affect us; and it is really tempting sometimes to get into that because it is easy sometimes to pretend something doesn’t affect us. But it does. We see the massive amounts of migration from Syria, the young 7, 8, and 9yearolds who are not going to school now because they have been disrupted and their lives have been disrupted, and in 5 or 6 years, if they don’t get an education and don’t get hope and opportunity, they will provide now the next recruiting ground for ISIS, or ISIS two, or alQaida three, because people without hope and without opportunity are easy to bring into a terrorist ideology like those. Mr. Speaker, the President rightly decided to enforce the red line in Syria when it came to the use of chemical weapons—something that the Western world has held very dear, that chemical weapons on the battlefield have no place—and he destroyed a Syrian airfield. It was the right move. It began to shift the balance of power in Syria, but way more needs to be done. I have called for action in Syria, as many on this committee have for a very long time, and this, the Caesar bill, is a fantastic first step to doing it. It would increase sanctions on the Assad regime and its supporters for continued atrocities committed against the Syrian people. It requires this administration and any future administration to stand up and impose costs on the Russians, on the Iranians, and on the Syrian backers for the barrel bombing and gassing of innocent civilians. Think about that, a barrel filled with explosives dropped indiscriminately on a population center intended to commit the largest amounts of casualties possible; a GPSguided bomb, or a laserguided bomb intentionally dropped into a hospital, and then a delay of 20 minutes so they can hit it again, or hit areas where first responders have responded to. Mr. Speaker, this isn’t a legitimate way of fighting war, if there is a legitimate way of fighting war. This is brutality to the top level, and this is a great step for this Congress to take. We unanimously passed this the last time. I sure hope we can do that again. Again, I thank the leadership for leading on this. I thank Mr. ENGEL and Chairman ROYCE for their leadership. I ask my colleagues to join me and join us in supporting this very important bill. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, it is now my pleasure to yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER ), the distinguished Democratic whip, someone who I know, through our meetings, feels so strongly about this and feels as we do. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the gentleman from New York, the ranking member on the Foreign Affairs Committee for yielding. I thank Mr. KINZINGER for his leadership as well as his statement. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bipartisan legislation, which will impose tough sanctions on entities aiding the Assad regime in Syria. Bashar alAssad is brutal murderer. Very frankly, there are too many countries facilitating and complicit in the murders that he perpetrates. He has gassed his own people and waged a civil war that has displaced millions from their homes and their country. Recently, Mr. Speaker, I had the honor of meeting some of the White Helmet civil defense workers who are risking their lives daily to rescue civilians caught in the crossfire and targeted by government forces; facilitated, I might say, by Mr. Putin’s troops in Syria. The Assad regime is being propped up by Iran and Russia in a dangerous and destabilizing geopolitical game. There are reports that the Assad government is now cremating victims of mass murder in an attempt to hide the evidence of its numerous crimes. While this is taking place, Americans watched in disbelief; frankly, as President Trump met in the Oval Office with those who are protecting, aiding and abetting Bashar alAssad and those committing atrocities by his command and in his name. Not only does that show how little this President understands about the conflict in Syria and its broader complexities, it also reminds us that he has articulated no clear strategy on how to end that conflict and to defeat ISIS. Having said that, let me congratulate the President for taking the actions against the airfield after the chemical attack. But, frankly, that was a significant, but small, step. The continuation of the war that the Assad government is waging against its own people only makes it harder to defeat the terrorists who threaten America, the region, and the world. Today’s legislation will help address this problem. I see on the floor, my friend, Chairman ROYCE , who is a great leader on issues relating to our foreign policy and to human rights. I congratulate him for his leadership. Working with his partner, Mr. ENGEL , we have taken significant steps to raise both the moral and the foreign policy issues that need to be raised. The efforts are bipartisan and reflect hard work on the part of the ranking member, the chairman, as well as members of the Foreign Affairs Committee. I thank them for their efforts, and I urge my colleagues to join in strong and, hopefully, unanimous support of this important resolution. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. ROS LEHTINEN ), who chairs the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman ROYCE again for yielding the time. Mr. Speaker, I stand in strong support of Ranking Member ELIOT ENGEL ’s Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act, H.R. 1677, of which I am proud to be an original cosponsor, and I commend him and the chairman for all of their hard work in authoring the bill and bringing it before us today. During our committee’s hearing on Syria in April—and we have had so many hearings—one of our witnesses made a point that I think bears repeating, a point that highlights the importance of the ranking member’s bill before us today. As long as Assad remains in power, there is very little chance that we will be able to defeat ISIS or its offshoots because Assad, in many ways, has facilitated the growth of the very jihadist groups for which he claims are protecting Syria. Hogwash. As we talk about how to stop the slaughter in Syria, we must remember that no one bears more responsibility for that slaughter than Assad. He and his regime are the ones dropping barrel bombs. They are the ones unleashing chemical weapons on their own people. And if we want to have any chance of stopping the bloodbath, of defeating ISIS, or of putting an end to the immense humanitarian challenges spreading throughout the region and beyond, we must put a stop to Assad. This bill ratchets up the pressure on Assad and his collaborators, especially his main allies—Russia and Iran—while expanding on the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act, a bill which I authored and which became law in 2012. It gives the administration new tools to go after individuals and entities working with Assad in the finance, aircraft, transportation, telecom, and energy sectors, as well as 
it gives them the tools to target individuals complicit in human rights abuses. I am glad to have worked with the ranking member and our esteemed chairman to include my amendments in this bill, amendments that would determine that denying or hindering access to humanitarian aid is a serious human rights violation, and, as such, it would allow the administration to sanction any individual responsible for doing so. All of these tools, Mr. Speaker, are vital components of doing something that we still desperately need in Syria: a comprehensive, holistic strategy that looks beyond shortterm tactical successes and, instead, targets the foundation of so many of the problems rippling through the region. If we continue to narrowly focus on ISIS without getting at the root of the Syrian conflict—Assad, Russia, and Iran—then we will only be treating the symptoms instead of the disease. b1730 If we are to have any hope of finding a solution in Syria, the kind of pressure that this bill would achieve is an essential piece of that puzzle. I offer my full support for this bill, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY ) will control the time. There was no objection. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I certainly add my voice to that of my colleagues in support of this important legislation. Syria is a mess. It does affect all of us, as Mr. KINZINGER said, whether we like it or not. It is destabilizing the entire region. I believe this bill can be a useful tool in our diplomatic efforts. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. FRANKEL ), my friend and colleague. Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chair and ranking member for their great leadership. Mr. Speaker, imagine a mother crying in despair while holding her child in her arms, a child who is gasping for his last breath, an innocent victim of a barrel bomb filled with sarin gas dropped on his school. The situation in Syria is the worst humanitarian crisis since World War II. President Assad’s brutal regime has killed half a million innocent victims and displaced 14 million more, with millions fleeing into Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, and over Europe, straining their resources, threatening regional stability, weakening European institutions, and undermining United States economic and security interests. We must hold Assad and his supporters responsible for their atrocities. American leadership is needed more now than ever. I urge my colleagues to support the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act. Mr. Speaker, I fear that one day we will look back and we will ask: Why did we not do more? The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the gentleman from New York (Mr. ENGEL ) has reclaimed the time from the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY ). There was no objection. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ ). Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act of 2017. Since 2011, the Assad regime’s forces have killed an estimated 500,000 people, mostly civilians, by unconscionably targeting and attacking major population centers. According to Human Rights Watch, last month, the Syrian regime used a nerve agent in northwest Syria that killed at least 92 people, including 30 children. Even more heartbreaking is the fact that this was not the first chemical weapons attack by the Syrian Government against its own people. To the contrary, reports suggest that the Assad regime’s use of chemical weapons has become ‘‘widespread and systematic,’’ and it has dropped bombs with nerve agents on at least four other occasions since December 12. Just yesterday, our own State Department revealed that the Syrian regime is actively using a large crematorium to dispose of the remains of thousands of Syrian men, women, and children, whom they continue to slaughter. Not only has the Syrian Government become a source of such crimes against humanity, but Syria has also indisputably become a hotbed for terrorist activity, propped up by Iran, Russia, and Hezbollah. Both ISIS and alQaida are operating near the SyriaIsrael border, putting the Jewish State of Israel and our regional security in grave danger. As a mother and a Jew, I cannot turn my cheek to this unadulterated evil. As a Member of the United States Congress, I have a duty to keep the American people safe and hold the Assad regime accountable for its war crimes and brutality. That is why I strongly support this critical legislation, and I thank Ranking Member ENGEL for all of his hard work in sponsoring it. This bipartisan legislation would expand sanctions on those individuals who commit such monstrous acts of violence and inflict such extreme suffering upon innocent Syrians. It would ensure that the United States has the tools it needs to reach its ultimate goal of ending the Assad regime’s campaign of carnage once and for all. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this important legislation. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, we have heard both sides simply agree. This is as bipartisan as you can get. It is as unanimous, hopefully, as you can get. Six years into the Syrian civil war, with hundreds of thousands dead and millions more driven from their homes, we cannot waste time looking backward or just simply placing blame. We need to face the reality of this crisis today and do all we can to forge a new strategy to deal with it. Three, four, five years ago, no one would have imagined that Assad would still be clinging to power over more and more deaths of his own people. We need to find a way to push for an end to the violence and bring about a political resolution that gets Assad out of power. By the way, that is going to be harder to do because the Russians and Ukrainians are really backing him. Let’s allow the Syrian people to start their long journey forward. This legislation will help us meet that challenge. It will impose a new cost on those who so far have aided the Assad regime with impunity. It will apply new pressure to the regime, which relies on the patronage of its enablers in Moscow. It will signal to the Syrian people that we share a vision of a future in which they make the decisions and Assad has no role. The bill passed the House unanimously a year ago. I am hopeful we will soon pass it in a little while again overwhelmingly. I urge the other body to act on it without delay so we can get it to the President’s desk. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like to once again recognize the work of Ranking Member ENGEL and the other committee members who have contributed to this bill. Our committee has heard the firsthand accounts of the suffering. We heard the testimony from Raed Saleh of the Syrian White Helmets as he spoke of their efforts to rescue and treat those who were killed and injured in Assad’s brutal air assaults. When the bombs come in, as they often do, his organization, which was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, runs toward those shelters being destroyed to provide relief for the victims and to pull them out. We have heard of the terror. More than a year ago, Dr. Mohamed Tennari of the Syrian American Medical Society described for the committee the sound of helicopters overhead, the thump of exploding bombs, and the overpowering smell of bleach in the air. This brave doctor described the horrendous effects this toxic gas has on the human body and the slow, agonizing deaths as the chlorine gas turned to hydrochloric acid in the lungs of victims. Many of those victims he spoke of were children. They were targeted by the regime. People were targeted as they slept in their beds in their neighborhoods. Just a few weeks ago, one family lost 20 relatives in a single sarin 
gas attack. Of the 92 victims of that attack on that day, 23 were children. Mr. Speaker, in 2016, efforts to establish a lasting ceasefire failed, resulting in an aggressive campaign by Syrian and Russian air assets against eastern Aleppo. U.N. officials described that assault as ‘‘crimes of historic proportions.’’ Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1677 ‘‘Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act of 2017.’’ This bill, introduced by my colleague, Foreign Affairs Committee Ranking Member ELIOT ENGEL , uses sanctions to put pressure on the Syrian government and anyone supporting it to stop committing war crimes against humanity. I support this legislation for its important and necessary purpose to halt the wholesale slaughter of the Syrian people, encourage a negotiated political settlement, and hold Syrian human rights abusers accountable for their crimes. The Syrian government, empowered with support from Iran and Russia, has pursued a strategy of targeting civilians to eliminate any opposition to its rule, including arresting anyone who opposes it. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has reported the deaths of 60,000 people in prisons since the start of the conflict. The Syrian government is the main aggressor in a conflict that has resulted in at least 400,000 dead and 14 million Syrians displaced; between 2011 and 2015, the Syrian Network for Human Rights attributed 96 percent of civilian deaths to the Syrian regime. Additionally, President Bashar alAssad has blocked United Nations humanitarian aid from reaching the intended recipients. Who is Caesar? Caesar, who uses the pseudonym to remain anonymous as a way to protect his family, defected from the Syrian military in 2013. He worked as a crime scene photographer for the Assad government after joining the military, years before the current conflict began. As the conflict escalated, so did the number of bodies he would photograph each day. Photographing the torture and rising death began to change his attitude towards the regime and in 2013, with help from the opposition, he faked his own death and defected from the Syrian military. When he fled in August 2013, Caesar had collected over 53,000 photographs of detainees who had been tortured and killed. He handed these photographs over to an antigovernment political group, the Syrian National Movement, who then distributed the photographs to other groups, including Human Rights Watch (HRW). With these photographs, HRW ‘‘found evidence of widespread torture, starvation, beatings, and disease in Syrian government detention facilities.’’ With the conflict in Syria in its fifth year, the U.S. House of Representatives introduced a bill intended to punish the Assad regime and its supporters and based it on both Caesar’s photographs and his testimony in front of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs this past July. The photographs and testimony show a clear connection between the reported human rights violations and the Assad government, legitimizing the bill and giving clear evidence to the international courts if President Assad stands trial for international war crimes. H.R. 1677 is intended to sanction both the Syrian regime and any actors, what the bill refers to as a ‘‘foreign person,’’ who support its human rights violations by imposing sanctions on them. This support can be in any capacity, such as economic or military support. H.R. 1677 is important and necessary as the United States cannot sit in silence while tens of thousands innocent civilians are slaughtered by Assad’s authoritative regime. Assad’s crimes are not only against humanity but also against democracy, and I fully support legislation aiming to stop these atrocities. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. HULTGREN ). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1677, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
RAISING A QUESTION OF THE PRIVILEGES OF THE HOUSE Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise to a question of the privileges of the House and offer the resolution previously noticed. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the resolution. The Clerk read as follows: 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the President shall immediately disclose his tax return information to Congress and the American people. Whereas, in the United States’ system of checks and balances, Congress has a responsibility to hold the Executive Branch of government to the highest standard of transparency to ensure the public interest is placed first; Whereas, according to the Tax History Project, every President since Gerald Ford has disclosed their tax return information to the public; Whereas, tax returns provide an important baseline disclosure because they contain highly instructive information including whether the candidate paid taxes, what they own, what they have borrowed and from whom, whether they have made any charitable donations, and whether they have taken advantage of tax loopholes; Whereas, disclosure of the President’s tax returns could help those investigating Russian influence in the 2016 election understand the President’s financial ties to the Russian Federation and Russian citizens, including debts owed and whether he shares any partnership interests, equity interests, joint ventures or licensing agreements with Russia or Russians; Whereas, the President fired FBI Director James Comey last week, whose FBI was investigating whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 election; Whereas, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who made the recommendation to fire Director Comey, during sworn testimony neglected to mention his contacts with the Russian ambassador and recused himself from anything involving the Russian investigation; Whereas, Senate Russia investigators have requested information from the Treasury Department’s criminal investigation division, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, which handles cases of money laundering, for information related to President Trump, his top officials and campaign aides. FinCEN has been investigating allegations of foreign moneylaundering through purchases of U.S. real estate; Whereas, the President’s tax returns would show us whether he has foreign bank accounts and how much profit he receives from his ownership in myriad partnerships; Whereas, the President hired a law firm to send a letter to Senator Lindsey Graham to fight suggestions he has Russian business ties; this letter left open the question whether Mr. Trump or his firms received Russian income or loans or derived income from Russianlinked partnerships. Whereas, Donald Trump Jr. said the Trump Organization saw money ‘‘pouring in from Russia’’ and that ‘‘Russians make up a pretty disproportionate crosssection of a lot of our assets.’’ Whereas, the White House will not confirm whether the President has filed a 2016 tax return; Whereas, Congress gave itself the authority to review an individual’s tax returns to investigate and reveal possible conflicts of interest of executive branch officials involved in the Teapot Dome scandal. Whereas, President Donald Trump’s executive order on the Review of designations under the Antiquities Act has directed the U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke to review national monuments that presidents have designated or expanded since 1996. Whereas, this review was praised by industry groups who could benefit financially from oil, gas and mining and condemned by environmental organizations concerned this review will scrap or scale back critical federal designation to protect tribal and historic lands. Whereas, the American people are in the dark to knowing if this review was started to justify selling or leasing public lands to private corporations that could enrich the President or his business partners without reviewing the President’s tax returns. Whereas, it has been reported that federal prosecutors have issued grand jury subpoenas to associates of former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn seeking business records as part of the ongoing probe into Russian involvement in the 2016 election; Whereas, according to his 2016 candidate filing with the Federal Election Commission, the President has 564 financial positions in companies located in the United States and around the world; Whereas, against the advice of ethics attorneys and the Office of Government Ethics, the President has refused to divest his ownership stake in his businesses; and can still withdraw funds at any time from the trust of which he is the sole beneficiary; Whereas, the Emoluments Clause was included in the U.S. Constitution for the express purpose of preventing federal officials from accepting any ‘‘present, Emolument, Office, or Title . . . from any King, Prince, or foreign state’’; Whereas, the most signed petition on the White House website calls for the release of the President’s tax return information to verify compliance with the Emoluments Clause, with 1 million, 94 thousand signatures as of date of this resolution; Whereas, the Chairmen of the Ways and Means Committee, Joint Committee on Taxation, and Senate Finance Committee have 
the authority to request the President’s tax returns under Section 6103 of the tax code; Whereas, the Joint Committee on Taxation reviewed the tax returns of President Richard Nixon in 1974 and made the information public; Whereas, the Ways and Means Committee used IRC 6103 authority in 2014 to make public the confidential tax information of 51 taxpayers; Whereas, the American people have the right to know whether or not their President is operating under conflicts of interest related to international affairs, tax reform, government contracts, or otherwise: Now, therefore, be it: Resolved, That the House of Representatives shall— 1. Immediately request the tax return information of Donald J. Trump for tax years 2006 through 2015 for review in closed executive session by the Committee on Ways and Means, as provided under Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code, and vote to report the information therein to the full House of Representatives. 2. Support transparency in government and the longstanding tradition of Presidents and Presidential candidates disclosing their tax returns. 
b1745 The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does the gentleman from New Jersey wish to present argument on the parliamentary question whether the resolution presents a question of the privileges of the House? Mr. PASCRELL. Yes, Mr. Speaker. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, the stunning conflicts of interest are piling up as the President, his family, and his friends profit in their personal business endeavors while serving in public office. Under rule IX, clause 1, questions of the privileges of the House are ‘‘those affecting the rights of the House collectively, its safety, dignity, and the integrity of its proceedings.’’ There is nothing more of a threat to the integrity of this House than ignoring our duty to provide a check and balance to the executive branch. To restore the dignity of the House, we must use our authority to request President Trump’s tax returns and begin to give the American people the transparency they deserve. That is what we should be giving them. Now, Mr. Speaker, it is evidence time. Today there is in The Wall Street Journal an article entitled, ‘‘Russian StateRun Bank Financed Deal Involving Trump Hotel Partner.’’ It is a very interesting article, I advise, and I want to put it into the RECORD with your permission. Mr. Speaker, a letter was sent just recently from Mr. Trump’s lawyers to Mr. Trump and then on to Senator LINDSEY GRAHAM . That letter was supposed to be an explanation of the President of the United States’ involvement in the finances and vice versa of Russia and President Trump. It does not in any manner, shape, or form, Mr. Speaker, go into any partnership which may exist. There is nothing about that. There is nothing about the Russian staterun bank financing a deal involving Mr. Trump’s hotel partner in Toronto. Number three, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, FinCEN as it is called, which is part of the Treasury Department but independent—independent—has independent investigative powers. They are looking into the money laundering in that situation. They are already investigating that with these Russian oligarchs—very interesting. Also we know of what happened—— The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman’s remarks must be confined to the question of order. The gentleman may proceed. Mr. PASCRELL. Well, I would like to know, Mr. Speaker—I am sure you would, Mr. Speaker—how foreign investments have enriched the President of the United States. That is the only way we are going to find out the conflicts of interest—the only way. So I have heard some House leaders argue that the House should not concern itself with things outside of its control. But section 6103 of the IRS Code is very much within the control of the House, if you have read it, giving specific responsibility to the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, and the American people are demanding the Congress request the President’s tax returns be exercised for several reasons. Mr. Trump has not divested himself from his businesses as was recommended by the Office of Government Ethics. Mr. Speaker, I think it is relevant if we look at what was produced—remember, it is evidence time—what was produced on January 21, 2009, the ethics commitments by executive branch personnel and what has been committed and produced under this administration. They have laughed at Mr. Shaub, who is the ethics commission chairman. They have laughed at him because it is almost like Cornelius Vanderbilt: You have the law; I have the power. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will suspend. The Chair will hear argument only on whether this resolution qualifies under the rule—— Mr. PASCRELL. On a question of privilege, Mr. Speaker—— The SPEAKER pro tempore. On the question of order. Mr. PASCRELL. I’m sorry to interrupt. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair will only hear—— Mr. PASCRELL. On a question of privilege—I am talking about the privilege of this House. I am talking about the privilege of Republicans and Democrats. We are all alike. We are all equal. Nobody is better than anybody else. What I am saying to you tonight, Mr. Speaker, is that this goes to the very heart of the issue and why this is a privileged resolution because we have a right to know, we have a right to uphold the integrity of this institution— everybody—not just some. Mr. Trump has not divested himself from his businesses as was recommended by the Office of Government Ethics. We need to see how our President—our President—would personally benefit from changes to our Tax Code. Tax Code changes proposed by his administration could lower his own personal tax bill by tens of millions of dollars. The American people have a right to know that. We have learned that earlier this year the President apparently asked Mr. Comey to cease his investigation of Trump National Security Advisor Flynn. In a surprise move last week, Mr. Trump fired the Director of the FBI. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is reminded that remarks must be confined to the question of order. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I am saying here and very specifically, we have no way of knowing whether Mr. Trump or his firms have received Russian income. It is an insult to the integrity of this House—Republicans and Democrats alike. We need to know this. We need to know that the President of the United States is beyond question in his objectivity with any nation, and particularly those who are pretty shaky in relationship with, like Russia. A certified letter from paid attorneys that actually confirms the President, in fact, does have financial ties to Russia does nothing to assuage these concerns. The legislative branch has the responsibility—it has the authority—to check the executive branch, and section 6103(f)(1) is very clear, very distinct, the privilege of the House—the privilege of the Tax Code—which allows for an examination of the tax returns, the authority put in place specifically so Congress could examine conflicts of interest in the executive following the Teapot Dome scandal. As I mentioned before, the possible sale of public lands under this administration is not very different than the biggest scandal of the 20th century at Teapot Rock, Wyoming. Mr. Speaker, nothing could be more of a threat to the integrity of this distinguished—— The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair has heard the gentleman’s argument and is prepared to rule. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I have only 2 more minutes. May I finish? The SPEAKER pro tempore. If the gentleman confines his remarks to the question of order, the gentleman may conclude his argument. Mr. PASCRELL. I am confining my remarks to the question of privileges which I said last night. Mr. Speaker, I will not yield on that issue. That is all I am doing—no more, no less. This is not a court. All I am saying is putting forth the rationale behind the resolution which I have put forth today—put forth yesterday and was read today. 
We have nothing but evidence to justify an examination, Mr. Speaker. This is not hot air. If and when such conflicts are revealed, I do not want to say to our constituents that we had the power to review these conflicts, but we did nothing. I for one do not want the integrity—my integrity, the integrity of my colleagues, and the integrity of this House—to be demeaned by such a shameful failure. That goes to the very heart in their own words of what of a privileged resolution is. To restore the dignity of the House, we must use our authority to request President Trump’s tax returns and give the American people the transparency they deserve. My concluding statement is this, Mr. Speaker: I mentioned Vanderbilt before because that is a very powerful statement he made—a very rich guy. He felt he could do anything: The law? What law? I am all the power. This is not the United States of America, this is not our democracy, and this is not what Republicans and Democrats have fought for since they have been in this House and before. I stand with us in only getting what we deserve, and then we decide whether we will communicate it to the American people through the Speaker. Mr. Speaker, I thank you for your courtesies. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The material referenced by the gentleman’s earlier unanimous consent request will be inserted following disposition of the question of order. The Chair is prepared to rule. The gentleman from New Jersey seeks to offer a resolution as a question of the privileges of the House under rule IX. As the Chair ruled most recently on April 5, 2017, the resolution directs the Committee on Ways and Means to meet and consider an item of business under the procedures set forth in 26 U.S.C. 6103 and, therefore, does not qualify as a question of the privileges of the House. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I appeal the ruling of the Chair. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is, Shall the decision of the Chair stand as the judgment of the House? 
Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion. The Clerk read as follows: 
Mr. Rothfus moves that the appeal be laid on the table. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to table. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, this 15 minute vote on the motion to table will be followed by a 5minute vote on the motion to suspend the rules and pass H.R. 1177. The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were—yeas 229, nays 188, answered ‘‘present’’ 1, not voting 12, as follows: [Roll No. 261] YEAS—229

b1821 Ms. SPEIER changed her vote from ‘‘yea’’ to ‘‘nay.’’ Mr. POSEY changed his vote from ‘‘nay’’ to ‘‘yea.’’ So the motion was agreed to. The result of the vote was announced as above recorded. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. The material previously referred to by Mr. PASCRELL is as follows: 
[From the Wall Street Journal] RUSSIAN STATE RUNBANKFINANCED DEAL INVOLVING TRUMP HOTEL PARTNER  (By Rob Barry, Christopher S. Stewart and Brett Forrest) VEB, a Russian staterun bank under scrutiny by U.S. investigators, financed a deal involving Donald Trump’s onetime partner in a Toronto hotel tower at a key moment for the project, according to people familiar with the transaction. Alexander Shnaider, a RussianCanadian developer who built the 65–story Trump International Hotel and Tower, put money 
into the project after receiving hundreds of millions of dollars from a separate asset sale that involved the Russian bank, whose full name is Vnesheconombank. Mr. Shnaider sold his company’s share in a Ukrainian steelmaker for about $850 million in 2010, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. According to two people with knowledge of the deal, the buyer, which hasn’t been identified publicly, was an entity acting for the Russian government. VEB initiated the purchase and provided the money, these people say. U.S. investigators are looking into any ties between Russian financial institutions, Mr. Trump and anyone in his orbit, according to a person familiar with the probe. As part of the investigation, they’re examining interactions between Mr. Trump, his associates and VEB, which is now subject to U.S. sanctions, said another person familiar with the matter. The Toronto deal adds a new element to the list of known connections between Mr. Trump’s associates and Russia. After Mr. Shnaider and his partner sold their stake in the steelmaker, Mr. Shnaider injected more money into the Trump Toronto project, which was financially troubled. Mr. Shnaider’s lawyer, Symon Zucker, said in an April interview that about $15 million from the asset sale went into the Trump Toronto project. A day later, he wrote in an email: ‘‘I am not able to confirm that any funds’’ from the deal ‘‘went into the Toronto project.’’ A spokesman for the Trump Organization, the family’s realestate firm, said Mr. Trump had no involvement in any financial dealings with VEB and that the Trump company ‘‘merely licensed its brand and manages the hotel and residences.’’ VEB didn’t respond to requests for comment. Mr. Trump has said he has no dealings with Russia. ‘‘To the best of my knowledge, no person that I deal with does,’’ he said in February. On Friday, Mr. Trump’s lawyers released a twomonthold letter stating that 10 years of his tax returns show little income, investments or debt from Russian sources beyond items already known to the public. VEB has long been viewed by Russian analysts as a vehicle for the Russian government to fund politically important projects, including the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. A VEB executive in New York was sentenced to prison last year after pleading guilty to conspiring to act in the U.S. as a Russian agent without notifying U.S. authorities. In the wake of U.S. intelligence agency findings that Russian governmentdirected hackers interfered in the 2016 election, several agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, are conducting a counterintelligence probe into whether Mr. Trump’s campaign staff had any contact with Russian officials. Committees in the House of Representatives and the Senate also are investigating the matter. Russian authorities have denied any interference. At the time of Mr. Shnaider’s steelmaker deal, Russian President Vladimir Putin was chairman of VEB’s supervisory board, and major deals would have been approved by him, according to a former Russian government official and several Russian government and economic experts. The bank later was placed on the U.S. sanctions list after Russia’s intrusion into Ukraine and its annexation of Crimea in 2014. American entities are barred from financial involvement with the bank. VEB made headlines when it emerged that its chairman met with Mr. Trump’s sonin law, Jared Kushner in December. A bank spokesperson has said VEB’s leaders met Mr. Kushner and numerous global financial executives as it developed a new strategy for the bank. Mr. Spicer has said Mr. Kushner’s meeting was part of his role during the Trump transition as the ‘‘primary point of contact with foreign government officials.’’ The Toronto project was billed in 2007 as a joint venture between Mr. Trump and Mr. Shnaider and was projected to cost about 500 million Canadian dollars. Mr. Trump said at the time he would manage the hotel’s operations and Mr. Shnaider planned to develop the tower, which also would include condominiums, through his company, Talon International Development Inc. The project has been dogged by financial problems. In November, it entered insolvency proceedings, and a judge in March approved its sale. Alan Garten, the Trump Organization’s general counsel, said the company ‘‘was not the owner, developer or seller’’ of the project. While The Wall Street Journal and others reported in 2011 and 2012 that Mr. Trump had a minor ownership stake in it, Mr. Garten now says Mr. Trump ‘‘did not hold’’ equity and had no involvement with the financing. The Trump Toronto Hotel Management Corp. has received at least $611,000 in fees from the project since 2015, federal financial disclosure forms filed last May show. The forms don’t disclose the company’s total income from the deal. Shortly after the project broke ground in 2007, about 85% of the units were presold. During the financial crisis, some buyers pulled out and others were unable to get financing, receivership documents show. Midland Resources Holding Ltd., then owned by Mr. Shnaider and a partner, was on the hook for cost overruns, the documents show. Midland Resources had acquired its stake in the Ukrainian steelmaker, called Zaporizhstal, for about $70 million after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The 2010 transaction to sell it was opaque. Midland transferred ownership of its portion of the steelmaker to the unnamed buyer through five offshore companies, according to Mr. Shnaider’s lawyer and court documents. The idea for the deal was brought to a top VEB executive by a former Ukrainian government official, according to an investment banker familiar with what happened. Although the buyer wasn’t named, a steel trader with knowledge of the deal said VEB itself ended up with control of Midland’s share of the steelmaker. At the time, Russian entities saw gaining control of large industrial assets in Ukraine as having strategic value to Russian political interests in the future, said another investment banker with knowledge of the deal. Mr. Zucker, Mr. Shnaider’s lawyer, said Midland Resources ‘‘has never had any relationship with VEB’’ and ‘‘does not dictate where their purchasers borrow funds.’’ He declined to identify the buyer, citing confidentiality provisions, other than to say it was a ‘‘Ukrainian industrial group.’’ Mr. Shnaider’s companies continued to pump money into the Toronto tower as it struggled to stay afloat, according to his lawyer and later court documents. Later, Mr. Shnaider became embroiled in a legal battle with Mr. Trump’s companies over management issues. The Trump Organization declined to comment. In November, a Canadian judge placed the tower into receivership. Mr. Trump’s company was owed C$116,165.72, and Mr. Shnaider’s company as much as C$105 million, court documents show. Recently, a judge approved the sale of the building to a Californiabased investment firm for about $220 million. REMOVING OUTDATED RESTRICTIONS TO ALLOW FOR JOB GROWTH ACT The SPEAKER pro tempore. The unfinished business is the vote on the motion to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1177) to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to release on behalf of the United States the condition that certain lands conveyed to the City of Old Town, Maine, be used for a municipal airport, and for other purposes, on which the yeas and nays were ordered. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore.

AMERICAN LAW ENFORCEMENT HEROES ACT OF 2017 Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the Speaker’s table the bill (S. 583) to amend the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to authorize COPS grantees to use grant funds to hire veterans as career law enforcement officers, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. ARRINGTON ). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Virginia? There was no objection. The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 583 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘American Law Enforcement Heroes Act of 2017’’. 
Section 1701(b)(2) of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3796dd(b)(2)) is amended by inserting ‘‘, including by prioritizing the hiring and training of veterans (as defined in section 101 of title 38, United States Code)’’ after ‘‘Nation’’. 
The bill was ordered to be read a third time, was read the third time, and passed, and a motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
CONGRESS MUST FINISH REFORM OF THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION (Mr. BIGGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, last week a Federal court temporarily overturned the termination of the fired Phoenix VA hospital director, Sharon Helman. Helman was relieved of her duties in 2015 after a whistleblower disclosed a string of scandals, including manipulation of wait times to collect performance bonuses. Even worse, in a separate court case, she pled guilty and was convicted of accepting over $50,000 in illegal gifts. For this, she is currently on probation. Mr. Speaker, Congress must take swift action to ensure former and current VA employees like Ms. Helman are held accountable. Those who disregard their duty to our Nation’s veterans should never be allowed to keep their jobs, salaries, or benefits after proven dereliction of duty. Our veterans do not deserve—and they cannot afford—VA leaders who put profit and expediency over the health of those who have worn our Nation’s uniform. Congress has taken steps to reform the Veterans Administration, but we must finish our job. That is why I was proud to vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 1259, the VA Accountability First Act. American veterans are counting on us to keep our promises and protect them from selfserving bureaucrats. I intend to do just that. f 
REMEMBERING FALLEN POLICE OFFICERS (Mrs. DEMINGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, during National Police Week, it is important we continue to remember the brave men and women who were killed while protecting us. Last year, 145 law enforcement officers were killed in the line of duty. One of these officers, Lesley Zerebny, 27 years old, was an officer with the Palm Springs Police Department. She was responding to a domestic disturbance call when she was gunned down. She was killed just days after returning from maternity leave and left behind a 4monthold daughter. Her fellow officer, Jose Gilbert Vega, was also murdered in the shooting. A devoted father, Vega was just days away from retiring. Of the officers killed last year, 10 were State troopers. One of them was Trooper Timothy Pratt of the New York State Police. Trooper Pratt was struck by a car as he was on the side of the road assisting a stopped vehicle. Pratt had 30 years on the job. Our law enforcement officers don’t know what they will encounter when they respond to any call. We applaud them for the bravery and courage they display in the face of danger. Mr. Speaker, let us not forget their sacrifices. 
VETERANS DESERVE THE BEST CARE POSSIBLE (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today during Mental Health Awareness Month to talk about a growing group of individuals who need our help: our veterans. More than 16 percent of veterans have been diagnosed with a depressive disorder. Up to 43 percent struggle with symptoms of mental health issues, such as drinking excessively, smoking, or sleeplessness. These struggles have resulted in an unacceptably high suicide rate for our veterans. Every day, 20 veterans take their own lives, which is almost double the rate of nonveterans. Mr. Speaker, this is heartbreaking. It is unacceptable, and we must act. That is why I was proud today to join with 
Congressman T IMRYANin introducing the Veterans Wellness Act of 2017. This bill brings mental healthcare to our veterans by establishing a 2year grant program to provide wellness care and additional therapies at veteran service organizations like the American Legion, the VFW, and AMVETS. Many offer skilled assistance with VA enrollment that could help our veterans get the care that they so desperately need. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House to ensure our veterans receive the best care possible. 
OUR NATION’S INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS (Mrs. BEATTY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with hundreds of business, labor, and advocacy organizations to recognize National Infrastructure Week. The purpose of this week is to highlight the state of the Nation’s infrastructure and its critical importance to our economy and wellbeing. Building and strengthening our infrastructure is vital to all of us, but it oftentimes goes unnoticed. Our Nation’s deteriorating infrastructure is hampering our ability to compete in the thriving global economy and create jobs that our Nation needs. As an example, in my home State of Ohio, we face significant challenges: 17 percent of the public roads are in poor condition, and almost 7 percent of all the bridges are structurally deficient. Mr. Speaker, we cannot continue to turn a blind eye to our Nation’s infrastructure needs. Congress must work together to upgrade our Nation’s highways, bridges, airports, water systems, energy grid, broadband network, and the like so that our economy can continue to lead the world in the 21st century and beyond. 
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS DESERVE OUR GRATITUDE (Mr. HILL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today during National Police Week to pay tribute to the Nation’s law enforcement men and women. Established in 1962 by President Kennedy, National Police Week serves as a reminder of the incredible sacrifice our police officers make every day to serve and protect the people in our States and communities. Just last week, Lieutenant Kevin Mainhart of the Yell County Sheriff’s Department was killed in the line of duty during a traffic stop in Dardanelle, Arkansas. This tragedy reminds us of the danger that all of our men and women who police our streets have to face. Every American should be proud of our neighbors and fellow citizens who get up every morning, put on their uniform and badge, leave their families, and serve us all, keeping our cities and towns safe and trying to build the trust and faith among our citizens. I respect and appreciate the important work of our police and our law enforcement men and women in Arkansas and throughout the Nation. They deserve our gratitude. f 
PANDEMONIUM COMING OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE (Mr. ESPAILLAT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, when I was sworn in to office, I made a commitment to support and defend the Constitution of these United States. Our President’s latest actions have shown us that we cannot trust him to do the same. Whether it is a lapse of judgment or just plain inexperience, the pandemonium coming out of the White House is worse than a scene from ‘‘House of Cards’’ The method in which Trump chose to reveal classified intelligence to Russian officials—impulsive; The way Trump chose to fire FBI Director Comey—imprudent; And, if the latest reports are true, the way Trump chose to interfere with the FBI investigation of National Security Adviser Michael Flynn—impeachable. I don’t use this last ‘‘i’’ word lightly, but for love of country and democracy, and as an American, I hope this is not true. If it is, this is a blatant obstruction of justice and a grave, grave offense. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. 
THANK YOU TO LAW ENFORCEMENT PROFESSIONALS (Mr. GARRETT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, during this National Police Week, I wish to, on behalf of myself and the fine citizens of the Fifth District of Virginia, extend our thankyou. Since 1791, greater than 22,000 law enforcement professionals have given their lives in the line of duty—over 70 in a single day in 2001, including 37 from the NYPD and 23 from the Port Authority Police—an average of over 140 a year. And yet these men and women who look like us—every race, every color, every gender—are the best of us because every day they get up and go to work again. Mr. Speaker, when I served in the military, I became familiar with Isaiah 6:8, and I cite that verse in thanking our law enforcement professionals: And then the voice of the Lord spoke to us and said, ‘‘Whom shall I send? And who will go for us?’’ And I said, ‘‘Here am I. Send me.’’ Mr. Speaker, take that as a thank you from myself and the citizens of the Fifth District of Virginia to those professional men and women who serve us every day. f 
HOKA HEY (Mr. OLSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, it is time that all of America knows a phrase that the Manvel Mavericks in the 22nd District of Texas know well. The phrase is ‘‘Hoka Hey. Hoka Hey.’’ That means be unselfish; compete for team, school, and town. Hoka Hey carried the Mavericks to the men’s track and field team title for Texas 5A. That happened last week. The team started rough. After seven events, they had 8 points. They were in 10th place. But the spirit of Hoka Hey came back during the relays. Our guys burned up the track. When the relays were over, the Mavs had 50 points and Port Arthur Memorial, 41. Hoka Hey had 85 points when the meet was over. They were the State champions. Congratulations, Hoka Hey Manvel Mavericks, State champions, Texas 5A. 
b1845 GIVE BACK THE FUTURES OF HARDWORKING AMERICANS (Mr. HOLLINGSWORTH asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. HOLLINGSWORTH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because, after coming back from Indiana for the last 8 days, I wanted to report what I saw. What I saw was too much hopelessness, too much despair, in the eyes of too many hardworking Hoosiers, who no longer feel that they have control of their financial future, who no longer feel that they can participate in the American Dream, and who no longer feel that they can start small businesses of their own. But I told them every single day when I was back home this past week what we are doing to change that to roll back the provisions of DoddFrank that have put undue burdens on lenders trying to help small businesses across Indiana’s Ninth District, and across this country, grow and get started; to help hardworking Hoosiers be able to start small businesses so they have control over their families’ future again; to help individuals be able to get jobs at growing enterprises because they have access to capital. Over the past few years, loan growth has stagnated. In the past 100 years, coming out of recessions, we have typically seen a loan growth of 63 percent, but it has only been 18 percent. It is the difference between those two that 
has curtailed the futures of many hardworking Americans. I want to make sure we give that back to them. That is why I am voting in support of the CHOICE Act, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. 
HONORING LAW ENFORCEMENT The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Washington (Mr. REICHERT ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. 
Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the topic of this Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Washington? There was no objection. Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, on Monday this week, hundreds of families, friends, colleagues, and loved ones from every corner of the country gathered at the United States Capitol for the 36th annual National Peace Officers Memorial Day. They were here to honor all of those names at the memorial, 21,000 names, Mr. Speaker. And this year, 394 more were added. Now, some of those are over past years—not this past year, but prior years—but 394 additional names were added to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial. Their names will ever be etched in our hearts and on the walls of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial, and, as I said, with 21,000 others who came before them. People who walk by and view these names may not recognize the names or may not know all of the names. They may have a special loved one whose name appears on those hollowed walls. But the thing to remember here is that these are brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers, and some even grandfathers. They are real people who sacrificed their lives. Some were ambushed and executed, and some lost their lives responding to a call to save a life or someone who called for help. These are the men and women who gave their lives so we could, in many cases, keep ours. I have a lot more to say on this, and we have some time. I am going to yield to other Members, Mr. Speaker, who arrived here tonight to share their stories and remember the officers who served their communities. Mr. Speaker, I yield to Chairman GOODLATTE , chairman of the Judiciary Committee. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I want to express my appreciation to DAVEREICHERT for taking the lead on this very appropriate Special Order to recognize our Nation’s law enforcement. No one better represents that law enforcement here in the United States Congress than former Sheriff REICHERT . And I thank him for not only his leadership in the House but also for his service as a sheriff for many years prior to his election to Congress. Our Nation was founded on the rule of law. The Preamble to the United States Constitution stated that its purpose was, in part, to ‘‘establish justice’’ and ‘‘insure domestic tranquility.’’ Every day, law enforcement officers carry out this legacy. They fight crime, promote justice, and keep the peace. They patrol late at night and early in the morning, while we sleep in the comforts of our homes. And over the past 16 years, our Nation’s law enforcement officers have often been the first to respond to terrorist attacks. On that fateful day, nearly 16 years ago, first responders were running into the crumbling towers as everyone else was running out. Following the Boston Marathon bombings in April of 2013, Boston police responded immediately to aid the wounded and implement emergency plans. That legacy has carried on through the recent catastrophes in San Bernardino, Orlando, and too many others. Sadly, many law enforcement officers have made the ultimate sacrifice on our behalf. Just this year already, 50 law enforcement officers have died in the line of duty, including Deputy Sheriff Curtis Allen Bartlett of Carroll County, Virginia, who was killed in a vehicle crash while responding to assist another deputy and a Virginia State Police trooper who were involved in a pursuit. These are tragic reminders that our law enforcement professionals face danger every day as they carry out their duties. Chillingly, in recent years, police officers have increasingly become targets for violence and ambushstyle attacks. Tomorrow, this House will vote to ensure that State and local law enforcement officers receive the same protections as their Federal counterparts. In fact, this week, the House will pass more than half a dozen bills to help officers do their jobs and return home safely. As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I have the privilege to work with Federal law enforcement. All too often, we fail to recognize how the dedicated men and women of law enforcement make sacrifices to promote law and order and keep our neighborhoods safe. That is true at every level: our local police and sheriff’s deputies, our State police, and Federal law enforcement officers in many different departments of the Department of Justice and other agencies. As a father, grandfather, husband, and citizen, the men and women in blue have my profound respect and sincere thanks. Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman. I thank him for all his hard work in his committee to support law enforcement across the country. I look forward to working with him on some of the law enforcement reforms that his committee is looking at. I appreciate it. It is an honor for me, Mr. Speaker, to lead this Special Order. I am very humbled at the response that we have received tonight by the Members who want to be here and talk about their law enforcement officers in their communities. Another one of our Members who wants to share his thoughts and feelings is the son of a State trooper from Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. COLLINS ). Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, this is a special time as a trooper’s kid. When I think about that and I think about this wall and I think about the heroes that I am looking at standing here, I am thinking about my own father who I just talked to a few moments ago—31 years as a Georgia State patrol. My mom is with him right now. They have been the example of what law enforcement goes through so many times. I will share, in just a few more minutes, about that, but I did want to remind you why we are here, and thinking about this memorial, Georgia officers who have fallen in 2017 already: Deputy Sheriff Michael Butler, Lowndes County Sheriff’s Office; and Sergeant Gregory Michael Meagher, Richmond County Sheriff’s Office. In 2016, we saw Jody Carl Smith, Georgia Southwestern State University Department of Public Safety; Officer Nicholas Ryan Smarr, Americus Police Department; Deputy Sheriff Justin Scott White, Newton County Sheriff’s Office; Deputy Sheriff Daryl Wayne Smallwood, Peach County Sheriff’s Office; Sergeant Patrick Michael Sondron, Peach County Sheriff’s Office; Officer Timothy Kevin Smith, Eastman Police Department; Investigator Anthony Joseph Freeman, Bibb County Sheriff’s Office; and Major Gregory Eugene Barney, Riverdale Police Department. And then one, Mr. Speaker, that came at a time in which the Sheriff and I were on the Police Working Group. We were in Atlanta. We were going through discussing the issues that police are going through and how communities are coming together, and we got word of a shooting in south Georgia. At the time, we just got a name, and we weren’t really sure what had gone on, but we found out there was a shooting and there was a fatality involved. What I came to find out later was that the gentleman who was killed was Deputy Commander U.S. Marshal Patrick Carothers of the Southeast Regional Task Force. He was a leader who didn’t even have to be there that day. He could have taken a step back. Instead, he led the charge. He went in first, as a leader does, and was killed. As it became more and more clear, I began to realize I had another special connection to Marshal Carothers. Just 
a few months earlier, I had the privilege of appointing his son to the United States Naval Academy. It is a matter of family. It is a matter of heart. As someone growing up, who thought that it was sort of awkward having your dad come and pick you up at school in his State patrol car, and he thought it was pretty cute when he put you in the back seat, and the kids were laughing. They would talk about it, and they would say: A State trooper is coming to pick you up. I would look at them and say: It is my dad. But what they didn’t also see were the times when he would come home, and I would wake up at night, and my dad would be coming home to change his shirt because it was ripped and torn and bloody from where he had been involved in a fight. What they didn’t know was a young son, who had listened to all of the things people would say about police officers, and say: They are talking about my dad. As one who has supported me all of my life, I cannot pass this time up without recognizing those who gave the ultimate sacrifice and those who continue to serve every day. It still amazes me the Georgia State patrol has gone on. And now folks, when I look in those blue and gray cars and the sheriff’s deputy cars, and those that I grew up watching, they were my big brothers. Now I look in there and say: Who are those younger people riding in their cars? They are just carrying on that blue line tradition. They are just carrying on that public service that means so much. So tonight, Sheriff, you have done a wonderful job of getting us here, because these folks have families, they have kids, they have a responsibility, and they never turn from it. I thank the families who have lost and gave their loved ones, and I thank the families who get up every day still with their loved ones in the fight, and I thank my father who gave so much. Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia. As he shared his story about his father, it reminded me of my own story of coming home to my three young kids and my uniform being torn and bloodied, in some cases. I never really thought about what my kids or my spouse was thinking when I came home. I was still wrapped up in the shift that I had just come from and the struggles that I had been through on the streets. b1900 I served for 33 years in the King County Sheriff’s Office, and I would do that job all over again, Mr. Speaker. I loved it. But I wanted to share another story, too, of Officer Jake Gutierrez from the Tacoma Police Department, which is a city just south of Seattle. Officer Gutierrez tragically died in the line of duty. He lost his life while protecting a woman from domestic violence. Jake was supposed to exchange wedding vows with his fiancee just a few weeks later. Instead, his fiancee, his three daughters, and his granddaughter attended his funeral. They struggled— and I am thinking they are still struggling today—to picture a life without him. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. GOWDY ). Our U.S. Attorney, prosecutor, knows law enforcement well, and he has a story to tell about one of his officers. Mr. GOWDY. Thank you, Sheriff. I want to start by thanking you for your service as a law enforcement officer and in Congress. And I call you sheriff when I pass by you because I always believe in calling people by their highest title. And as much as it is wonderful, and I am sure the people in your family are proud of your service in the United States Congress, I am proudest of your willingness to sacrifice for the people of Washington as their sheriff. Kevin Carper was a uniform patrol officer with the Spartanburg County Sheriff’s Office. He was not a detective. He was not in management. He was just a regular police officer like the ones we see every day in our towns and cities. Kevin responded to a domestic violence call. Those who are unfamiliar with law enforcement have a tendency sometimes to refer to those as routine calls. There is nothing routine about a domestic violence call, and everyone in law enforcement knows it. Off of Airport Road in Spartanburg, South Carolina, Kevin and his partner arrived to find William Seich on the front porch of his small home pointing a large caliber gun at his wife, Judy. Judy was crouched down in the front yard, trying to protect herself, trying to shield herself behind a tree, and William was pointing the gun at her and, alternatively, pointing the gun at law enforcement who had just arrived on the scene. You know, Sheriff REICHERT and Mr. Speaker, it all seems so easy in hindsight. Do you shoot? Do you pull the trigger? Is the gun real? You have split seconds to make these decisions only to have them secondguessed for months, if not years afterward. Is the gun real? Is it loaded? William Seich finally turned the gun toward his wife and he shot her. As he was turning the gun towards law enforcement, no doubt to shoot them, they returned fire. They struck William Seich. As one officer ran toward his fallen wife, Judy, Kevin Carper ran to the front porch to make sure that William Seich didn’t shoot anybody else. As he got on the front porch, Mr. Speaker, he heard the cries of children. Unbeknownst to Kevin and his partner, there were children inside that mobile home, and the bullets from one of the officer’s guns had struck one of the children. William Seich survived and was charged with murder. Both of the little girls ultimately survived, although one was badly injured. I met Kevin when we were preparing for trial. He was an essential witness, so I needed to prepare him for what would come during this trial. He would be secondguessed. His every move would be scrutinized. In a very real sense, he would not only be blamed for Judy Seich’s murder, he would be blamed for shooting one of the little girls inside that home, and then he would be blamed for not doing enough to protect Judy Seich, not making the right splitsecond decision. I tried to prepare Kevin for what would be a grueling crossexamination, and it was clear to me his mind and heart were somewhere else. So, finally, I said: Kevin, you didn’t do anything wrong. You didn’t have a choice. He said: I know, Solicitor GOWDY . He had tears streaming down his face in my office. He said: I know, Solicitor GOWDY , but I shot that little girl. Objectively, Kevin Carper did everything right that night. He responded to an incredibly tense domestic call. He was confronted with a man holding a gun. Was it a real gun? Was it loaded? All of these thoughts going through his mind; and as soon as William Seich shot and murdered his wife, he returned fire. Objectively, we know everything he did was right, but it didn’t matter how many times I told Kevin: You did the right thing. Deputy Kevin Carper heard me. Father, husband, Kevin Carper had tears streaming down his face at the thought that he would have hurt a child. Well, we went through the trial, and he was, as you might imagine, an indispensable witness. Mr. Speaker, he could not have done a better job in that murder trial. Yeah, he was a tough police officer in a uniform, but when it came time to describe walking on the front porch and hearing the cries of children, he became a husband and a father again, and in front of a jury, Sheriff—and you know this is hard for police to do in front of a jury—this tough, brave man broke down in tears, and the jury had a chance to see the humanity of police officers. The jury had a chance to see that ‘‘protect and serve and defend’’ part of police officers. William Seich was convicted, in no small part, because of Kevin Carper’s help. In South Carolina, the sentencing takes place immediately after the trial, so there was family to talk to and to prepare them for the sentencing hearing so they could allocute on what Judy Seich’s life meant to them and what the proper punishment should be. Mr. Speaker and Sheriff REICHERT , I wanted to tell Kevin what a great job he had done. I wanted to tell Kevin how impressed I was with his humanity. I wanted to tell Kevin—I intended to tell Kevin that he took a cynical old prosecutor and he made him believe again that there are women and men who go into this line of work for all the right reasons. That is what I intended to tell 
him. But in the hustle and bustle of sentencing, he slipped out the back of the courtroom and we went on with the sentencing hearing. But I knew that I would see him again and I would have a chance to tell him. I would have a chance to tell his boss: You need to watch that guy, make him a homicide detective. He is really good. I would have a chance to tell him he did great by those little girls. I knew I would see him again and I would have a chance to tell him again. And I did see him again, laying beside a roadside, shot to death during a routine traffic stop. He was shot by a man who had been arrested more than 30 times. If you have ever attended an officer’s funeral, the finality of that death hits you the very hardest at the end where they do the radio call: Deputy Kevin Carper, do you read? Deputy Kevin Carper, can you hear us? And, of course, there is silence. And then at the end, it is: Deputy Kevin Carper, you are clear to go home. I never told Kevin what I should have told him. Deputy Kevin Carper, you were a credit to law enforcement. Husband, father, Kevin Carper, you are a credit to humanity and your family. I wish I had told you when I should have told you. I hope that all of my other friends in prosecution and in law enforcement now will not wait too long to tell the men and women of law enforcement how grateful they are for their service. Mr. REICHERT. Mr. GOWDY , I have a feeling that Kevin knew anyway when he left that courtroom how you felt. Thank you for sharing that powerful story. I think it really clearly points to a lot of things: One, the job is tough and you have got to make those split decisions, and they are life and death decisions; Two, that the human side of the police officer is not very often recognized; that the connection to their family—as I said in my opening statement, these are people that are fathers, they are sons, they are sisters, they are mothers, in some cases they are grandparents. Sometimes we see a person just wearing a uniform, but there is a human being inside that uniform wearing that badge and carrying that gun to make sure that we can get home to our families and enjoy our families. I lost a best friend and partner in 1982. It still hurts today. If I can get past the emotional part, I might share that story a little bit later. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. POE). Mr. POE of Texas. Thank you, Sheriff. I appreciate your comments, Lawyer GOWDY ; as I call him, his comments. I know that the outlaws in Washington State are glad you are in Congress and you are not back in Washington arresting them and putting them in the jailhouse where a lot of them belong. But thank you for the opportunity to speak at this very important Special Order. As you know, while you were a sheriff in Washington, I was down at the courthouse in Texas, first as a prosecutor, like Lawyer GOWDY , and then, for 22 years, I tried criminal cases, felonies, everything from stealing to killing. I met a lot of police, as I call them, during that time. Some of them, as Mr. GOWDY has pointed out, gave their lives in the line of duty. I met them in the middle of the night when they would come bringing a warrant to me to sign so they could go arrest somebody while the rest of us all slept. They are doing what they do best, and that is protecting and serving our communities. A lot of police officers—and I don’t think it has been said yet—their job is being a police officer, but most of them have other jobs just to make ends meet. They have an extra job, as we call it, because they don’t make a lot being a police officer. None of them ever do it for the money—none of them anywhere in the world do it for the money. So to support their families, they have to have other jobs to do that. I think we as a nation need to understand and appreciate that they do what they do because they feel, and it is, an important service to our community. Last year, 135 police officers throughout the Nation were killed; 64 of them were shot and killed, and 21 of those were ambushed. Among the States, my home State of Texas had the most police officers killed. Twentyone were killed last year in the line of duty. We also had five canines that were killed that worked with police. I have here a photograph—or a poster of the 21 officers killed in the line of duty in the State of Texas last year; all races, both sexes, all ages throughout the State of Texas. Last year, we saw probably more than I can remember, this phenomena of hate and ambush of police officers. b1915 On July 7, 2016, five Dallas police officers were shot and killed as they were protecting a protest demonstration in downtown Dallas. What occurred was a sniper who had been preparing, obviously for some time, was watching this procession go by and he opened fire on those police officers. Other than 9/11, this was the most deadliest day for police officers in the United States. Shortly before 9 p.m., a domestic terrorist—and I am not going to give his name. His name is not important. The names of the officers are what is important—parked his black SUV on Lamar Street. He put on his body armor. He got his automatic weapon ready to fire, and he started stalking Dallas police officers. As those Dallas police officers and a DART officer—DART is Dallas Area Rapid Transit officer—marched along with the protesters, he opened fire on them with the intent to kill as many as he could. So gunfire rang out and bullets struck and killed Senior Corporal Lorne Ahrens, Officer Michael Krol, Officer Patrick Zamarripa, and three Dallas police officers were wounded, along with a civilian. But the sniper wasn’t through yet. He headed back up Lamar Street—and that is in downtown Dallas—shooting out the windows of a nearby college campus, El Centro College campus. During that time, he injured two El Centro College police officers trying to get into the school. He had continued on his quest to kill officers and he snuck up behind a DART officer—his name, Brent Thompson—and shot him in the back and killed him. He then turned his way on to Elm Street nearby and shot his way back into El Centro College. All of this took about 20 minutes. Police officers were following this sniper, trying to capture him, but this individual went up to the library in the school and started firing down. His next victim was Officer Michael Smith, and he injured yet another DART officer. He was cornered in the library. Chief of Police Brown said: During that 2 hourlong negotiation, the individual lied to us, played games, laughed at us, sang, and continually asked how many of those coppers did he kill? Eventually, the Dallas SWAT team took care of the sniper, and he was killed. In total, five officers were killed, seven others were wounded. And these officers were killed for the sole reason that they wore a uniform, that they wore a badge or a star over their heart, symbolizing protecting us from the do bads. That is why that badge is there over their heart. They were willing to give their life so that we might have peace, order, and safety; and on that day, five of them did. In total, like I mentioned, 21 officers were killed in Texas last year, the most in any State. I include in the RECORD their full background and the departments that they worked with. Their names are: Officer David Hofer, Patrolman David Ortiz, Trooper Jeffrey Nichols, Border Patrol Agent Jose Barraza, Officer Endy Ekpanya, Sergeant Stacey Baumgartner, Officer Calvin McCullers, Jr., Sergeant Michael Smith, Officer Michael Krol, Officer Patricio Zamarripa, Officer Brent Thompson, Senior Corporal Lorne Bradley Ahrens, Officer Marco Zarate, Correctional Officer Mari Johnson, Officer Justin Ryan Scherlen, Officer Amir AbdulKhaliq, Deputy Sheriff Kenneth Maltby, Corporal Robert Ransom, Border Patrol Agent David Gomez, Commander Kenneth Starrs, and Detective Benjamin Marconi.

Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, these were real people. And as Sheriff REICHERT said earlier, these people have families. Lastly, I would like to mention one other officer whose name I read. His name was Sergeant Stacey Baumgartner. He worked at a little bitty police department called Patton Village in Texas, right outside of Houston, and he was killed when his patrol car collided with another vehicle while he was involved in a hot pursuit. He is survived by his wife, his son, and his daughter, Chloe. This is a photograph of Chloe taken last week in Austin, Texas, at the Texas Peace Officers Memorial Service event. This is her. It was posted by the police chief of Patton Village, Texas. It expresses the families, the humanity of their fathers and their mothers, and how we as a people need to understand the consequences when people murder our finest. God bless the thin blue line. And that is just the way it is. Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank Judge POEfor his words. When he mentioned police officers don’t do this for the money, I always considered it a calling. And I think if you talked to any police officer or deputy out on the street today, I think they would tell you that they felt called to serve, and called to serve in the uniform, and called to put their life on the line and to risk their life for others. I was going to share the story of my partner, Sam Hicks, who was killed in 1982. He left behind five sons. He was ambushed and shot in the chest and killed instantly. The killer was a man who was already wanted for murder. One of the hardest things I ever did—I was the only homicide detective at the scene when they captured him—was to sit in the back seat with this killer, advise him of his rights, and get him a glass of water and something to eat because he had been on the run for 3 days. I spent an hour in the back seat of that cop car with this killer, knowing that Sam’s five sons no longer had a father. Thank you for your words tonight, Judge. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Jacksonville, Florida (Mr. RUTHERFORD ), the second sheriff in the House. Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to be here this evening with my friend, Sheriff DAVEREICHERT , and all of my colleagues who stand with our law enforcement officers, their families, and their communities for this National Police Week. It is a time where we come together as a country to recognize the sacrifices our police officers make for us every time they put on that uniform. Last week I had the privilege of attending the Nassau County Sheriff’s Office Law Enforcement Memorial Service in Florida, where we recognized those who have lost their lives in the line of duty. And in a very special way, we honored the life of Officer Eric James Oliver, who was killed in the line of duty on November 22, 2016. Officer Oliver died doing what he loved, protecting and serving his community. Before he joined the sheriff’s office, Officer Oliver served our Nation in the United States Navy. But his most important job, Mr. Speaker, was being the loving father to his 6year old daughter, Shelby. Tonight I commend the many sacrifices made by each and every law enforcement officer in Florida’s Fourth District, but this year we give special recognition to Officer Eric Oliver and the great loss felt by his family, his Nassau County Sheriff’s Office colleagues, and our entire northeast Florida community. Tonight I also want to honor in a special way two Department of Homeland Security officers who lost their lives in service to their country. First, I rise to honor Special Agent Jeremy Scott McGuire. Scott served with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, assigned to the National Security Investigations Division at the Homeland Security Investigations office in New Orleans, Louisiana. On January 25, 2016, Special Agent Scott McGuire lost his life while on special assignment in Miami, Florida. In his final assignment, he was conducting investigations to identify, disrupt, and dismantle transnational criminal enterprises and terrorist organizations that threatened the security of the United States. He is survived by his wife, Suzy, and son, Finn. Special Agent McGuire earned an extensive list of awards and accolades in recognition of his academic accomplishments, and his investigative successes. In fact, posthumously, Scott received the HIS national award for top illicit drug trade investigator of 2016. Special Agent McGuire left behind the greatest legacy a man can live. He was truly a man of distinction and a man of devotion to not only his work, but also to his family and friends, and he lives on as a hero. Second, I rise to honor fallen Officer Brian Beliso, a U.S. Immigration and Customs enforcement officer assigned to the Fugitive Operations Unit at the Enforcement and Removal Operations office in San Francisco. Officer Beliso began his work with ICE in 2007. Very early in his career, Brian distinguished himself as a charismatic leader and a dedicated employee who always went above and beyond in all of his duties. In his final assignment, Officer Beliso conducted field operations to locate atlarge criminal and fugitive aliens who are in violation of our Nation’s immigration laws. He was directly responsible for prosecutions of numerous criminal aliens who illegally reentered the country following their deportation. On June 8, 2016, Officer Beliso died in the line of duty. Not only was Brian greatly respected by his colleagues and superiors, he was also known for his selfless service to his family and community. He was a beloved husband and father. He is survived by his wife, Christina, and their three children, Noah, Sophia, and Bella. Mr. Speaker, law enforcement is a noble profession, and it is a noble profession not only because these men and women serve, but because they serve with selfsacrifice. Officer Oliver, Officer Beliso, and Special Agent McGuire laid their lives on the altar of freedom, and we must never forget them and the many other men and women who have 
lost their lives so that we may experience the safety and freedoms that we enjoy today. On behalf of a very grateful nation, we thank them for their noble service and we honor them for their duty and sacrifice. Mr. Speaker, I would be remiss if I didn’t mention two other officers. I had the great honor for 12 years of being sheriff of the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office in Jacksonville, Florida. b1930 During my tenure, I was deeply saddened to bury two of my officers who died in the line of duty. They were Officer Scott Bell, who gave his life in service in 2007, and Officer Christopher Kane in 2008. I say again, on behalf of a very grateful nation, we thank them for their noble service, and we honor them for their duty and sacrifice. Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the sheriff for being here tonight honoring those who fell in his community and under his command. I thank him for his 40 years with the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office. I am proud to serve with him in Congress. We need more sheriffs in Congress, by the way. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. FERGUSON ). Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Speaker, I would first like to thank the gentleman from Washington for organizing this event for us to thank the brave men and women who keep our community safe day in and day out. Like him, I have the honor and privilege of serving with Sheriff RUTHERFORD and Chief DEMINGS . It is quite an honor to be with both of them in the 115th Congress. The men and women of law enforcement are moms and dads, sons and daughters, siblings and friends to the very people who they serve. We ask these brave men and women to uphold the law, but so often this seemingly straightforward mandate sends them into the most difficult and tragic situations that our society faces: terrible accidents, domestic disputes, and the strife that threatens the hearts of our towns and communities. Their bravery and courage is unimaginable to someone like me. The complexity of their jobs and the tolls that it takes on their lives is often underestimated. Having a safe community offers our citizens more than just peace of mind. It offers them a place to live, grow their businesses, provide a living for their family, and to be not only economically secure but socially secure. Law enforcement officers play a very critical role in community development. Each generation of our law enforcement community evolves as society changes and their technology and training improve. This allows them to police our communities more responsibly, effectively, and sometimes even to right wrongs of the past generation. I want to highlight one specific example in my district, Georgia’s Third District. Nearly eight decades ago, an African American man named Austin Callaway was lynched in the town of LaGrange, Georgia. This terrible crime has been a dark part of the town’s history for a long time. Recently, law enforcement officials have taken steps to begin the reconciliation process. LaGrange Chief Louis Dekmar partnered with the president of the county NAACP chapter, Ernest Ward, to facilitate an official apology to the Callaway family from the police force for failing to investigate the lynching nearly 77 years prior. I commend Chief Dekmar and Mr. Ward for their actions to begin to heal this old wound. I am proud to represent this community that has engaged in the hard work of reconciliation. Police officers like Chief Dekmar do so much more than enforce the law. They work actively every single day to bring the communities they serve together. I am so proud that there are such great examples of law enforcement in the Third District of Georgia. Law enforcement officers do more than just keep us safe. They help our communities, they show love and compassion, they bring us together. We owe them a debt of gratitude. I am proud that there are such brave men and women willing to serve in all of our communities and hometowns. I want to extend my deep gratitude for the hard work of these brave men and women and offer a special thanks and special prayer to their families. Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. DESJARLAIS ). Mr. DESJARLAIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of National Police Week and the courageous law enforcement officers who protect the great State of Tennessee. This week, we have thousands of police from across the country here in Washington, D.C., to honor the valiant men and women in blue. Among the 145 heroes who lost their lives in the line of duty in 2016, six hail from the Volunteer State. I would like to recognize Special Agent Frazier with the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, Sergeant Allred with the Livingston Police Department, Deputy Sheriff Larnerd with the Jackson County Sheriff’s Office, Officer Moats with the Maryville Police Department, Sergeant Smith with the Memphis Police Department, and Deputy Sheriff Sturgill with the Humphrey County Police Department. I stand today to recognize their service and extreme sacrifice. Tennessee law enforcement officers often risk their own lives to protect the safety of others. I honor and respect these brave men and women, and I pray for them and their families. Mr. Speaker, during National Police Week, and throughout the year, let us all remember to ‘‘Back the Badge.’’ Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. KUSTOFF ). Mr. KUSTOFF of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I thank the sheriff so much for his leadership tonight and throughout the course as we honor law enforcement and police here and across the country. I rise today to honor the brave men and women of our police forces in the Eighth Congressional District and across the Nation. I have got to tell you that it is challenging to find the right words to thank those who literally lay their lives on the line for others each and every day—most of the time for people who they have never met. This past Monday, I had the incredible privilege of joining the Jackson Police Department and the Madison County Sheriff’s Office at a memorial service in Jackson, Tennessee. I was moved to see not just the active and retired officers there but also the family members of those who died in the line of duty. During the ceremony, there was a wreath for all those who have lost their lives in the line of duty in the Jackson and Madison County area. The names of those officers, sheriff’s deputies, and law enforcement officials who laid their lives on the line, going back to the 1800s, were read. For some of those who died many years ago, there were no family members there. There were family members for those who died going back 60 and 70 years ago in the line of duty. Each of those family members were given a rose that they would place in a wreath—a memorial for all those who have died in the line of duty. It was very moving to see those family members and, obviously, to hear the names of those people who have given their lives in the line of duty. The ceremony reminded me of the daily sacrifices that our law enforcement make in order to protect and serve their communities, their State, and their country. These men and women have families, hobbies, and places of worship. They are heroes living among us who deserve our praise each and every day. During my time as the United States Attorney for the Western District of Tennessee, I worked closely with our police departments and law enforcement agencies to tackle violent crime. Our men and women in law enforcement were on the front lines of some of the most incredibly dangerous and sensitive situations. I feel fortunate to have seen how their tireless work saves lives and changes communities for the better. I also want to take time to thank those in the United States Capitol Police here in Washington, D.C. They are some of the finest, sharpest men and women in the country. We can rest easier knowing they are watching closely over our Nation’s capital and protecting our democracy. This is a pivotal time for our country. We must not forget the significance of maintaining law and order. At 
a time when it seems so many in our society have grown distrustful and disrespectful of law enforcement, the overwhelming majority of the people in the country respect our law enforcement. They need to know that they have our support now more than ever. Too often, their courage and selfless deeds go unnoticed and unacknowledged. Whether it is bringing violent criminals to justice, rushing to the scene of a terrible incident, or keeping constant watch over our schools and neighborhoods, our police officers serve with such distinction. We must not take their service and steady presence for granted. I have never been more appreciative of law enforcement for all that they do to keep us safe. National Police Week is a solemn time as we remember those we have lost. We must also celebrate our active police officers and law enforcement who will continue to serve our country for future generations. I thank the sheriff for allowing me to speak this evening on behalf of all those in law enforcement. We truly appreciate their service. Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. BROOKS ). Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize National Police Week. It is also Mental Health Awareness Month. I want to thank my colleague, whom we affectionately call sheriff, who served his great State for 33 years. I want to express my profound gratitude to the men and women in uniform and their families who serve and sacrifice so much to protect our safety. I think we also need to talk about a way that we can repay these men and women for their sacrifice by making mental health services more available to our law enforcement officers so that they have the resources to handle so many difficult onthejob situations that they deal with every single day. Police officers are under constant attack, often on the job, caught literally in the crossfire of violent domestic violence disputes; violent crime; finding and recovering bodies of murder victims, some of whom are young children; targets for lone wolf shootings and attacks; injecting Narcan, the overdose reversal drug, into people who have overdosed on heroin, trying to save them. Think about all of the different things that the men and women in uniform have to do day in and day out. For most people, just one of these experiences would be enough to cause trauma. But our police officers face these and other unthinkable situations daily, sometimes leading to significant mental health challenges for officers like suicidal thoughts, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, and depression. Fortunately, we have many law enforcement groups, including the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department and the Indiana Fraternal Order of Police, who are working to offer our officers the support and treatment they need to continue to protect themselves and our communities. Since 2010, officers in Indianapolis have been able to receive counseling and referrals to doctors and clinicians through unique, inhouse programs staffed by fellow trained officers. To help police departments develop and implement similar programs, I have introduced, along with my good friend, a new Member of Congress from Florida, VALDEMINGS , the former police chief of Orlando, H.R. 2228, the Law Enforcement Mental Health and Wellness Act. This bill will improve the sharing of Federal best practices by the Department of Justice, the Department of Defense, and the VA with local police departments. It will make grants available to initiate peermentoring pilot programs and develop training for mental health providers specific to law enforcement, study the effectiveness of crisis hotlines, and get officers mental health checkups. If our police officers are healthy, our communities will be even safer. We owe it to all of our heroes in law enforcement across the country to protect their mental health and wellbeing, and I urge passage of this legislation. Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. TAYLOR ). The gentleman from Washington has 5 minutes remaining. Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. DEMINGS ), the former police chief of Orlando. b1945 Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, one of my greatest honors was serving as a police officer in Orlando for 27 years. My husband is a sheriff in Orange County, and he has been serving for 35 years in law enforcement. But today I am here to talk about how we can better take care of our law enforcement officers as they continue to take care of us. Our law enforcement officers are called to some of the most horrific situations and run into harm’s way to protect us and our families every day. Almost a year ago, officers responded to the Pulse nightclub shooting, known now as the site of the deadliest mass shooting in our Nation’s history: 49 persons lost their lives that night and more were severely injured. Imagine the scene as the officers responded. One officer said one thing he will never forget is hearing the sound of the cellphones ringing as loved ones called the victims, but, of course, the victims could not answer. During the most dangerous and most tragic of circumstances, our law enforcement officers may appear superhuman, but they are only human, and responding to scenes like this—or any other horrific scene—no one can really prepare for that. It is just one example of what our officers face. I believe we have a responsibility to our first responders. That is why I am very proud to cosponsor H.R. 2228, the Law Enforcement Mental Health and Wellness Act of 2017, with my good friend SUSAN BROOKS from Indiana. The bill would direct the Departments of Justice, Defense, and Veterans Affairs, as you have heard, to share best practices that can help law enforcement officers in tragic situations. I am so proud to share this legislation with my good friend and urge other colleagues within Congress to join us to make this vision a reality. Mr. Speaker, we must do everything we can to protect the men and women who keep our cities, our towns, and our communities safe. Again, I thank the sheriff so much for his service, and I thank the gentleman for helping us to honor the men and women who are so deserving of this honor. Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chief. It is an honor to serve with the gentlewoman. I know the gentlewoman has a special quality about her now that I heard her husband was a sheriff. The gentlewoman is all thumbs up on my team, and I thank her for her sincere, thoughtful comments. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. O’HALLERAN ) who is a former Chicago police officer. Mr. O’HALLERAN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Washington and the sheriff. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the men and women who have paid the ultimate sacrifice to protect our communities. In 2016, two brave Arizona officers died as they responded to calls: David Van Glasser, Phoenix Police Department; and Darrin Reed, Show Low Police Department, which is in my district. Both of those men left behind family and loved ones. As a former police officer and homicide investigator, National Police Week has a special meaning to me. I have lost friends, partners, brothers, and sisters in the line of duty. I have grieved with their families during the most difficult times, and I have experienced firsthand the real sacrifices they make. Each of the 135 officers from across the country who died in the line of duty in 2016 worked to keep our neighborhoods safe. While we can never repay the debts we owe them and their families, we will forever remember their service. As we look to the future, it is important to highlight the work being done in cities and towns across the country to not only better protect our families, but also the lives of our law enforcement officers. In Arizona, successful community policing programs in Flagstaff, Phoenix, and countless other cities and towns have improved relationships. I am proud to join my colleagues from both sides of the aisle on the House Law Enforcement Caucus. I look 
forward to continuing the bipartisan work we are doing to identify and solve the challenges facing our law enforcement community. Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
ALLEGED RUSSIAN COLLUSION (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I will continue to join my colleagues in honoring our law enforcement officers across America, particularly in my home State, and look forward to providing that tribute in days to come. I thank my colleague, the sheriff, for his work. I have come to the floor today, however, to again comment on the appointment of a special counsel to investigate the Russian collusion, alleged Russian collusion of the President’s campaign operatives and the President as relates to the 2016 election. Director Mueller is a well respected law enforcement leader. I look forward to his quick response. But I believe it is important for this Congress, and I ask Speaker RYAN to ensure, that the committees of jurisdiction—Oversight and Government Reform, House Judiciary Committee, and House Intelligence Committee—do their work as well. That work would include hearings on the issues before us and an impeachment inquiry to determine the facts. I believe that we can do this together, Mr. Speaker, not as Republicans and Democrats, but as Americans. The truth must be found, and America will be better for it. 
INFRASTRUCTURE WEEK The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. BRENDAN F. B OYLE ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. 
Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous materials on the subject of my Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Pennsylvania? There was no objection. Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, this is Infrastructure Week in the United States, and while Hallmark may not quite yet be making cards to observe Infrastructure Week, I hope those of us here in Congress can take a moment to recognize that this is a unique opportunity to talk about the importance of the state of our Nation’s infrastructure. This is a time, as I was mentioning, really to focus on all modes of transportation and our utility systems that most of us only tend to notice when they are broken. Well, Mr. Speaker, there is a lot of broken infrastructure in our country to notice lately. In fact, even President Donald Trump has recognized that the roads, bridges, and all the other underpinnings that make our modern world possible are crumbling and need urgent attention. So the President has vowed repeatedly, both as a candidate and as President, to invest at least $1 trillion in our infrastructure system. That was a key promise of his campaign and critical to his appeal to working class Americans, including in my home State of Pennsylvania. But that promise is, so far, as broken as our Nation’s infrastructure. Instead, 4 months into his administration, this President is laying the groundwork to shortchange American workers and manufacturers. Mr. President, it is most disappointing. I stood Monday morning at Philadelphia International Airport. I stood with the former Governor of our State, Ed Rendell, who is part of a bipartisan group called Building America’s Future. I stood with both Democratic and Republican Members of this body who happen to represent the greater Philadelphia area. I also stood with Senator COONS of Delaware, who, himself, lives not too far from the Philadelphia International Airport. We used that setting to talk about the importance of Infrastructure Week and reinvesting in our Nation’s infrastructure today and for tomorrow. I mentioned in those remarks something that I am going to mention here tonight: 100 years ago, there was no doubt that the United States of America was the leader in the world when it comes to infrastructure. Our roads, our bridges, our waterway systems, our mass transit, and our gas lines were rated number one. Today, if you seek out the report of the American Society of Civil Engineers—these are not Democrats; they are not Republicans; they are really nonpartisan; they are civil engineers—we are rated a Dplus. The International Civil Engineers do not rate the United States of America in the top 20 when it comes to infrastructure. That should bother all of us, whether you are Democrat or Republican or Independent or nonpolitical. I have to say, as someone who believes in this country and believes that we should always strive to be number one, not even being in the top 20 bothers me, and it is simply not good enough. It is unwise economic policy. Part of why the 20th century became known as the American Century is because we were the number one world leader when it came to our infrastructure. How are we supposed to compete today and in the future if we are not even in the top 10 or the top 20? Mr. Speaker, for the needs of our infrastructure and for a myriad of other issues related to this, I have cofounded the Blue Collar Caucus. I have spoken on this House floor about the need for our country’s leaders to pay attention again to our bluecollar workers and our bluecollar economy. I am so happy that, while tonight might be specifically about infrastructure and that sliver of the overall blue collar economy, I am joined in this effort with my cofounder, the cochairman of this caucus, MARC VEASEY of Texas. He will be speaking in a moment, as well as a few other members of our caucus, about the importance of reinvesting in our Nation’s infrastructure and why that is critical to our economy. Mr. Speaker, if we really want to put Americans back to work and put them back to work not in lowpaid jobs but in goodpaying jobs—familysustaining jobs—the way to do it is to reinvest in our Nation’s infrastructure. I have many other things to say on this topic that I will be saying throughout the next hour or so. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. VEASEY ), the cochairman of our Blue Collar Caucus. He is someone who has been a real leader on this issue and feels just as passionately about it as I do. Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from the great State of Pennsylvania for helping cofound the Blue Collar Caucus and just doing a tremendous job. As you know, the hardworking men and women of Pennsylvania, and particularly the Philadelphia area, have been so responsible for many of the things that have really made our country what it is, many of the great public works, many of the amazing museums, and many of the amazing things, bridges, just things like that that people take for granted that there was someone that built those things, there was someone that toiled possibly in the heat and in the snow, but they were able to bring home a good wage doing it. They were able to take care of their families. They were able to send their kids to college. I love when the gentleman talks about his family and the sacrifices that the gentleman’s parents made working in a bluecollar job that ultimately helped him go to one of the most prestigious universities—Notre Dame. So I just really appreciate the fact that the gentleman appreciates the hardworking men and women that really make this country great. We need to do more for them. One of the ways that we can do more for them is to pass an infrastructure bill. I don’t think that there is any doubt about that. We know that this is Infrastructure Week. With roughly $700 billion a year that is being invested at the local, State, and Federal level, infrastructure is vitally important to our economy. We have to have good infrastructure to meet the basic needs of the American people. That may sound like quite a bit of money, but we can’t spend enough 
money to repair and replace our crumbling roads, bridges, and other critical infrastructure. I listened to ELIZABETH ESTY last night, one of our colleagues from Connecticut, talk about the dangers that are involved in not investing in infrastructure and some of the deaths that tragically have occurred on American roads because of collapsing bridges and things like that. That is not what we want. We need for the American taxpayer to have confidence that the roads that they are driving on and that the airports that they are using are up to date, that we have the best ports, that we have the best transit systems in this country, and that we have the money to keep those things worldclass systems and efficient systems in our country. They have to be safe. b2000 According to the American Society of Civil Engineers, one out of every five miles of highway pavement in our Nation is in poor condition. That is an estimated 56,000 of the Nation’s bridges that are structurally deficient. Think about the truck driver who drives every day, think about the person who makes their living on the road. Think about how many families want their loved ones to travel on safe roads. Think about all of the families who depend on their loved ones to make a living on those roads. That is how they put food on the table at the end of the week, at the end of every 2 weeks, at the end of the month, however they get their check. They need to be safe. Those families need to know that those hardworking men and women who work on those roads every day and use them to help fuel American exceptionalism, they need to know that those roads are safe. Some estimates say that modernizing our infrastructure to meet our needs is going to require an additional $5 trillion in Federal spending over the next decade. Federal investment in infrastructure is an economic boost that can also create goodpaying jobs for bluecollar workers. I have to tell you, many were encouraged, a lot of people that I know— Democrats, Republicans, Independents—they were very encouraged when the Trump administration floated the idea of a $1 trillion infrastructure plan. But instead of presenting a detailed infrastructure plan that puts Americans back to work, the Trump administration has basically offered a plan that lacks details. It doesn’t really go into how we are going to get this done. The reports that I have seen say that the Trump plan, if you want to call it a plan, like I said, contains very few details. It contains tax incentives for private industries that make up as much as 80 percent of the cost of the bill. Let me tell you two reasons why that is bad. It would simply enrich companies that would have built their projects anyway, and the only private investment it would encourage is for projects that contain a funding stream such as toll roads. I have to say, if toll roads are the only choice that people have, they will maybe take them. But I know that a bipartisan group of Texans, and I saw this especially when I was in the State legislature before I came to Congress, they are really upset with toll roads. They feel we have too many of them, and they want to see the infrastructure investment that we need in this country to get our roads back up to par and to help relieve congestion. Encouraging private investment in infrastructure is not necessarily a bad idea, but it requires the proper oversight and the selection of the right kinds of projects. I have to tell you, there is a bipartisan group that believes in that. Both the Obama administration under Secretary Foxx and the Bush Transportation Secretary, Mary Peters, they both agree that publicprivate partnerships are only able to address a small segment of what is needed. Without careful attention, we risk wasting taxpayer funds by giving big tax breaks to companies on the backs of hardworking American families. Mr. Speaker, I am going to talk some more later about job creation and about DavisBacon and about some other things that need to be addressed, but I want to be sure that we hear from another one of our colleagues and friends from the Rust Belt, Ms. MARCY  KAPTUR who is here. So I am going to turn it back over to you so you can introduce her. When she talks about what is going on in the heartland and in Ohio, she works directly with those men and women who work in manufacturing and who work in construction. I bet you she has some things that we need to hear about dealing with infrastructure and how it can help our States and help our country. Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. As my colleague was just mentioning, someone who has really been a champion on these issues for decades, someone who intellectually gets it, but also speaks on these issues not just with her head but with her heart, and now as the climate in our country has, I think, evolved on some of these issues, some people are recognizing that what she was talking about for quite a while has been proven to be correct. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR ) who I am honored to serve with. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman BOYLE and Congressman VEASEY for their leadership and the new energy and the innovative ideas that they bring here from their constituency on behalf of our country. It is a privilege to join you tonight and talk about the infrastructure of our country, a major infrastructure bill, and it is certainly appropriate during this infrastructure week. The whole vital topic of investing in a national infrastructure plan and investing in those who will help to modernize America translates into good jobs, as Congressman VEASEY has talked about, and progress for America that Congressman BOYLE has talked about. When we think about infrastructure, some people only think about roads and bridges, and we certainly need attention to those across our country. So many places throughout our Nation are in desperate need of repair. Frankly, the street I live on, there is a big sinkhole at the end of the street. Mr. Speaker, 17 percent of the roads in Ohio, my home State, are in poor condition, according to the American Society of Civil Engineers. They estimate that the average Ohio driver pays an extra $475 a year from driving on roads in need of repair. Look no further than me. I had to pay $500 for a whole front end because of hitting a big pothole driving at home at night. So we know how much it costs. Let me urge President Trump and the administration not to limit their thinking on an infrastructure bill. Infrastructure should be about our roads and bridges for sure, but it should go far beyond that for modernizing the Nation. As the ranking member on the Appropriations Subcommittee for Energy and Water Development, I take very seriously America’s responsibility to modernize the country for this new century. Our energy grid desperately needs an update, and power outages across this country attest to that. Our waterways need help, too. And our drinking water infrastructure, just in Ohio it is estimated will cost $12.2 billion over the next 20 years. As hard as it is to fathom, and I am sure the President hasn’t had a chance to read the fine print on this, but the President’s budget office proposed to zero out the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative which is so vital to fresh drinking water in our vast region. The President has said he wants to help the people in Flint, Michigan. He campaigned there several times. But it is not an either/or. It is both/and. You have to have funding in the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative to take care of the water issues confronting the Great Lakes where algal blooms get larger and larger every year due to phosphorus and nitrogen runoff. Our waterways, our drinking water, are vital components of our national infrastructure. Over 11 million people just on Lake Erie alone, the lake that I represent, need that fresh water. The systems are very old. Some estimate in the cities, cities are losing 30 percent or more of the water distribution underground because of aging pipelines. We truly need to look both above the ground and underneath it. Through many of the counties that I represent, there are old septic systems in place, and 40 percent or more of 
them are leaking. They contribute to some of the problems that we are having in our fresh water systems. These communities need a helping hand and extra financing to help put their wastewater systems into compliance. I have also proposed a bill for a 21st century civilian conservation corps for needed investments in our States and national parks and forests. Ohio and Michigan alone need to plant 20 million trees to replace those that have been damaged by invasive species. I wanted to also mention, I represent, and I know Congressman BOYLE and Congressman VEASEY , we represent urban communities, and many of those communities have housing that is 100 years old. Some a little more, some a little less. Imagine if infrastructure could include weatherization so we could place new roofs on millions of homes across this country. We could train people how to do this. We could help bring up the younger generation. Also windows and insulation. If we look at the condition of America’s housing stock, particularly following the collapse of 2008, if we look at saving Americans money that they currently spend on wasting energy because they can’t afford to put on a new roof, windows, or insulate their homes, we could help millions of Americans. As we help to improve America’s infrastructure, I really believe housing has an important role to play in this regard, especially with energy conservation. Honestly, as I close my remarks tonight, and I thank Congressman BOYLE  and Congressman VEASEY for their leadership, Mr. Speaker, it is not only rewarding to work with them, it is fun, too. Mr. Speaker, Americans have been waiting for us and the Federal Government to really give them a helping hand up. I know working together on a bipartisan basis, we can produce an infrastructure bill that the country has been waiting for, as Congressman BOYLE says, for decades. I know that our mayors, our county commissioners, and our Governors across the country would work hand in hand with us, and I think Americans from coast to coast would applaud what we are able to do here in order to help our country rebuild itself in this new century. Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman KAPTUR . I mentioned, Mr. Speaker, at the very beginning of my remarks that we kicked off infrastructure week on Monday morning at an event at Philadelphia International Airport. One of those Members of Congress who joined me for that event is the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. NORCROSS ), someone who practices what he preaches when it comes to the issues that most concern the Blue Collar Caucus, and someone who can really speak about infrastructure from many different perspectives. I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. NORCROSS ). Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that kind introduction. It was a remarkable time sitting at the airport right there on the Delaware River and understanding how much we depend on safe, secure travel in those airports around the country. But to both MARC and B RENDAN , thank you for the Blue Collar Caucus and bringing to light many of the issues that at times we as a nation might have forgotten, quite frankly, those who work with their hands, those who are getting up each and every morning and going to work, having a job, taking care of their family, and I think focusing on that is so important. I am myself involved with the Building Trades Caucus, and we are talking about something that is near and dear to everybody’s heart, and it is called infrastructure. In this day and age when people are wondering about what is going on in the country, I want to talk about the ‘‘t’’ word. No, it is not Donald Trump; it is a trillion dollars, and that is the number that people have been talking about that we need for infrastructure. Infrastructure means many things to many different people. If you are in Flint, Michigan, it is about having clean water. The pipes need to be replaced. We have a growing infrastructure that is many years old. When we think back about one of the major components of infrastructure in this country, during the Eisenhower administration, it was building the interstate system, from north to south, from east to west, connecting coasts, connecting cities, connecting States. And that is something that has been so important to us. But apparently not important enough to keep and maintain. I am very familiar with the systems that we have. I went to the other 4 year school; it was called an apprenticeship program, an electrical apprenticeship that I spent 4 years in. After graduating, I worked up and down the Delaware River at refineries, on bridges, and on our infrastructure. We know how important it is. But in Congress, because of the Blue Collar Caucus and many others, we need to remember that the dignity of a job is so important. We have 211 attorneys here in Congress, but there is only one electrician. There is only one carpenter. There is only one ironworker, and there is only one painter. Diversity comes in many shapes and sizes, and our Founding Fathers understood how important that was. They were farmers, printers, attorneys, doctors, all coming together and bringing those experiences into this very House, this very floor, to remember why we are here. Anybody who drove on a road to get here today understands what infrastructure means. b2015 But somehow we haven’t paid attention. We had the American Society of Civil Engineers brief us a few weeks ago to the Building Trades Caucus on the report card that they give each and every year: aviation, a D; bridges, a C plus; ports, a Cplus; energy, a D; transit, a D. The overall report card was a D. If I had come home with a D on my report card, I know what my parents would have done to us. But somehow having the D on the report card for the very infrastructure here in the United States has been acceptable. Well, it is not. We are deferring this problem to the next generation when we owe them a responsibility of turning over our world to them in a little bit better shape, not worse shape. So when we look at that investment in roads, rails, ports, airports, it does something more than just to fix the very problems that we look at each and every day. It is about a job. What better way to put America back to work than fixing our own infrastructure. Nobody does it better than the building trades who have the training programs second to none and does not use one dime of public investment. All funded privately. Fifteen different trades coming together to fix our infrastructure. In addition to that, they do something that is really special. We all know the figure when it comes to those who put the uniform on to help protect our country is less than 1 percent. We have so many of those men and women who are coming home today, and there is a program that the Building Trades Caucus have put together called Helmets to Hardhats. Taking those who want to come home and start a career, took their helmet off and go right into an apprenticeship program, put the hardhat on. What better way to say to those veterans they are welcome home than to give them a job? But not just a job, a career. So as we continue to have the discussions daytoday, the ‘‘t’’ word is about trillion dollars. It is about putting back into our country the investment that it is due. Mr. Speaker, I again want to thank my colleagues for coming here today to make sure that we remember those men and women who don’t necessarily put on a suit and tie but have the dignity of going to work each day as blue collar workers, and we are damn proud of it. Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. I should have mentioned when I was introducing Mr. NORCROSS that he is the founder and the chairman of the Building Trades Caucus. When he talked about that one electrician, he was talking about himself. I understand from some of his former electrician buddies that he was a toprated electrician. He is someone who has literally walked the walk. It now gives me a real pleasure to introduce someone who has represented Chicago and the Chicagoland area for a number of years, someone who also gets it when it comes to the issues that most concern the Blue Collar Caucus, 
and then specifically what we are addressing tonight in the Special Order, the need to reinvest in our Nation’s infrastructure and put people back to work. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LIPINSKI ). Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I want to say, first of all, it is an honor to follow Mr. NORCROSS . As Mr. B OYLE said, one of the very few in this body who is an actual member of the building and construction trades. I didn’t intend to talk about this originally, but I just want to say it is very important that all of us in this Nation give more respect to the building and construction trades, and all the men and women in the trades who have built this Nation. These are great jobs that provide a good living for families, and they are building our Nation. We need to encourage more young people to go into the building and construction trades. I used to teach college. I was a college professor, but I know we need to make sure that young people today understand what a great life they can have, what great jobs these are in the trades. I want to thank Mr. NORCROSS for the work that he has done helping to build this Nation and now working here in Congress. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. BOYLE and Mr. V EASEY for their work on the Blue Collar Caucus. There are a lot of people in this country who think Washington has forgotten them, many bluecollar men and women who turned out in the election and I think were motivated in many ways by that feeling that they have been forgotten. Many of these are the bluecollar men and women who work so hard every day. We are here tonight to say we have not forgotten. We understand how important you are to our Nation and the work that you do, and especially tonight to talk about how important the work you do building and repairing our infrastructure is to all of us. There is a lot of infrastructure we have in this Nation that needs to be fixed, to be built. Ms. KAPTUR talked about many of these different areas. One of them, of course, is in drinking water and sewers. So much of it was built right after either the early part of the 20th century or after World War II, and now it is deteriorating. I hear the stories all the time from some of my municipalities back home, saying that they are afraid that the pipes are completely gone, the water right now is just running through the hole that was left from the pipes. There is so much infrastructure we need to build. I want to focus especially tonight on transportation. I sit on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. President Trump promised that he would have a $1 trillion bill to fund infrastructure. I think it is critical that, in these days where we have so many other things that we are focused on, we don’t forget—and we have not forgotten—the fact that we need to do this infrastructure bill. Focusing on transportation, we all know we need our transportation infrastructure to get anywhere we are going. You get up in the morning, you take your kids to school, you go to work, you are going to the store, you are going to church on Sunday, anywhere you go, you need the transportation infrastructure. If it wasn’t there, you couldn’t get there. So we are talking not just about roads and bridges, we are talking about public transit. Public transit systems in many of our big cities are crumbling. We know that in Chicago. We know all the problems right now from that crumbling infrastructure. Something we oftentimes don’t think about is that public transit, how critical it is, how important it is. So let’s remember all of that. Let’s remember the sidewalks, the bike and pedestrian paths, everything that gets people to where they need to go. Everybody knows the problems that we face. Everyone knows in their daily lives what we need to do, how much transportation infrastructure needs work. Chicago is oftentimes labeled the most congested city in America. If it is not number one, it is in the top three. We know it, but people all across the country know it. We need to do this work. If we do this work, first of all, we are putting people to work immediately building the roads, bridges, repairing the infrastructure, the rails. We also need to talk about the locks and dams on our inland waterways, things that many of us never see because we just pass over our waterways on the road, on bridges, and don’t even see the vital waterways that also serve important roles in our country. And the ports. We need to invest in all of these. We put people to work immediately. But also what is important, besides the fact it helps us get around, helps us get to wherever we are going every day, is it also makes our economy more efficient. It makes American business more efficient. If we have an efficient transportation system in our country, American business is more efficient. And that is why so many of them, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, have been on this for a number of years, that we need to improve our transportation system so American business can thrive. And if American business thrives, more Americans get hired by businesses. Not just building the transportation infrastructure, not just working on it, but all businesses in America are more efficient, can hire more people. It makes our economy run. This is something critical. With everything else that is going on right now—and we know what that is, and we never know what is coming dayto day—all these other things are important that we are talking about and that we are looking at. But we cannot forget—and the American people know this—that we need to do our work here and we need to pass an infrastructure bill, including a big transportation component to that. We are going to continue to fight for that. No matter what else is going on here, no matter what else you hear people talking about, we are here to say we need to do this. The American people know we need to do this. It helps all Americans, but especially the bluecollar Americans, the ones who have been suffering for many years in our country. One other thing. President Trump talks about buy American. I am happy that he came out last month and said the administration is going to look at how we can improve our buy American law so that when the Federal Government buys things, they are going to buy Americanmade products. But I have to say, if we want to do something immediately, I have a bill that I introduced, the Buy American Improvement Act, which closes a lot of the loopholes that exist right now in our domestic content, buy American laws. It extends buy American laws, domestic content laws to Federal spending that it is not applied to right now. For example, Drinking Water State Revolving Fund for drinking water. It is important that we use American tax dollars to put Americans to work. It is great that the administration is looking at what can be done; but I have to say, this bill, the Buy American Improvement Act, we can get this done, get this passed, get this into law. When we pass that infrastructure bill, we will make sure Americans are being put to work with American taxpayer dollars. Mr. Speaker, I want to again thank the Blue Collar Caucus and Mr. BOYLE  and Mr. VEASEY for all the work that they are doing, and the most important thing is for the American people. The American people need to know that we are here fighting for them, especially those bluecollar workers who think they have been forgotten. You have not been forgotten. Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. LIPINSKI for his words, and I appreciate his membership in the Blue Collar Caucus. In going through this entire discussion on infrastructure, because there are so many things that we could talk about as part of this, certainly I would encourage those interested in this topic to read the report of the American Society of Civil Engineers. It is an overwhelming case for why we need at least a $1 trillion infrastructure plan really making up for decades upon decades of underinvestment in our Nation’s infrastructure. We could certainly talk about that and talk about many different aspects of it. In the few minutes that we have remaining, I want to talk about its overall effect on our country. I am not talking about dollars and cents. I am not talking about in a tangible way. I 
mean something that is not tangible, that you can’t exactly put your fingers on; and that is the spirit of America. Mr. Speaker, something that Americans have always been known for is our eternal optimism. So much so that if you are friends with folks in Europe and in other places, they would always gently make fun of Americans for being so optimistic, for our undeniable, unending belief in the power of the future; that tomorrow will always be better than today. b2030 Yet we know, Mr. Speaker, in recent times too few Americans are feeling optimistic about our country’s future. All the polls are showing that. There has been a pretty dramatic turn in just the last 20, 30 years in how Americans feel about their own personal futures and the future of this country. Part of what leads to that, part of it is stagnant economic wages. I have talked about that at length on the floor as part of a previous Blue Collar Caucus hour. Part of that also, though, is the sense that we are not building anymore; that 100 years ago we were building, that we were launching the first airplane; that 50 years ago we were going to the Moon. In the Eisenhower era we were building the world’s best highways. But in today’s day and age, we don’t build anymore. That growth is happening in Asia and in other parts of the world. So just imagine what that would do not just for the economy, not just for our infrastructure, but imagine what it would do for the spirit of America if they saw a trilliondollar infrastructure bill take hold, if they saw our roads being rebuilt and new roads being built, if they saw the investments that we can make in our mass transit and our intercity rail. I happen to represent a district smack dab in the middle of the Northeast corridor. I met today in my office with the chairman of The Northeast Maglev project, a project to take a technology that exists today in Japan, build it here in the United States, and make it possible that you could get from New York City to my district in Philadelphia in a half hour, that you could get from New York City to Washington, D.C., in 1 hour instead of the 3 hours that it takes today. That would have a transformative effect. No other place in the world has the maglev. Even in Japan, which has invented the technology, it is only in a small snippet. So making sure that we can move forward in a bipartisan way, actually achieving something with Democrats and Republicans working together with this administration, we would send such a signal beyond the substance of the issue itself. I believe that we would have a dramatic effect in improving the way that the American people feel about their future and the future of our country. Mr. Speaker, literally, over a million jobs will be created by a $1 trillion infrastructure bill. I wanted to speak about the importance of making sure that those are highpaying jobs and why the DavisBacon Act is linked to that, but knowing that my cochairman will speak about this issue, I am happy to turn that over to him now to speak about that issue and others that are affected by this. As it may be my last time speaking on this, I thank my colleagues for their passion on this issue. I appeal to the White House, to President Trump specifically: Please work with us on this issue. It is, I believe, the single best way we could unite Democrats and Republicans in the House and the Senate. We can get this done. It is something that must get done. It would put millions of Americans—that is not an exaggeration, by the way. It would put over a million Americans back to work. It is critically needed for today and tomorrow, and I appeal to this White House, even in this hyperpartisan, fractured time, to work with us on this issue and finally, 4 months after taking office, unveil your infrastructure plan. I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. VEASEY ), my colleague and co chairman. Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative BOYLE . I really appreciate the points he has made tonight, just so timely. It is so important that we talk about those things during Infrastructure Week and the Blue Collar Caucus and the role that the caucus is playing in pointing out a lot of these things that need to be talked about. Again, when you talk about the infrastructure bill, if we had a legitimate trilliondollar infrastructure program and it were enacted, we could put the United States back on a prerecession job growth path and, some people say, create close to 11 million jobs. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, infrastructure spending today—that is what we spend on infrastructure spending right now—is directly responsible for about 15.5 million direct and indirect U.S. jobs, and you are talking about average salaries of $68,000 per year. That is 28 percent above the U.S. median income. We know that infrastructure jobs pay well. There is absolutely no doubt about that. Investment in infrastructure also adds more indirect jobs in manufacturing, logistics, transportation, and an increasing demand for steel, glass, concrete; and all those things get the job growth growing in America. According to Georgetown University, more than half of the new infrastructure jobs will go to high school graduates and even high school dropouts. So many of our young men who find themselves dropping out end up in the incarceration system, but we know that, if we can find high school dropouts a job and they are not left behind due to economic changes and economic factors, we can help those young men. According to that same analysis, jobs and occupations that are expected to grow with greater infrastructure investment pay more than typical wages for high school graduates. Engineering and management jobs, which usually require higher levels of education, also offer good opportunities. However, even construction and transportation jobs associated with infrastructure projects provide higher earnings than an average job for high school graduates. The Blue Collar Caucus advocates not only more jobs but, again, better quality jobs. I used to hear people talk around the dinner table or the domino table or the card table when I was growing up. People wanted to know where the good jobs were, how can you get on at a good job. That is what I am talking about: how we are going to create more of those. The DavisBacon Act, you heard Representative BOYLE talk a little bit about that earlier, about how important that is. We should be troubled. When you start talking about good jobs, goodpaying jobs, we should be troubled that congressional Republicans have taken steps to repeal the DavisBacon Act. I want to talk a little bit about the DavisBacon Act, but first I want to talk about why the DavisBacon Act is important. A lot of times in Washington, D.C., we start talking about these terms. People at the Chamber of Commerce, they know what Davis Bacon is, but maybe the average person has no idea what DavisBacon is. People don’t come up to me at the Dollar Store in Fort Worth and say: Hey, Congressman VEASEY , hey, M ARC, what are we going to do to protect DavisBacon? But people do stop me at the Dollar Store and say: Hey, MARC, what are we going to do about putting some more money in our pockets? That is what DavisBacon is all about. That is where the Republicans fail the American worker. The DavisBacon Act requires that certain contractors and subcontractors responsible for carrying out Federal contracts pay their laborers and mechanics the prevailing wages for the area. That is what I am talking about when I say putting more money in your pocket, putting more food on the table, being able to make that light bill, being able to make that car bill, being able to make that truck payment. I want to sell more cars. We have a General Motors plant in Arlington, Texas, that makes some very good SUVs, goodpaying union jobs, good unionmade SUVs, Americanmade SUVs, and you don’t get that with lower rates. You get that with the prevailing wage rates that Republicans are trying to do away with. That is what everybody needs to understand. Ensuring workers are paid a fair wage is extremely important, especially for bluecollar workers. Prevailing wage laws provide protections for both construction workers and the taxpayers. They ensure that all contractors bidding on public construction 
projects will pay familysupporting wages and that they also ensure projects will be built to the highest standards by skilled, safe, and well trained construction workers. Numerous studies have shown, contrary to the claims of corporate interests, that DavisBacon wage protections do not increase taxpayers’ costs. That is the one thing that you are going to hear from Republicans and downtown business interest people when they want to keep income inequality growing in this country instead of trying to stop income inequality is that DavisBacon drives up wages because it allows families to put more food on their table. I think that is a doggone shame. Fairly paid craftsmen added value to our investments in infrastructure, and DavisBacon must continue to be included in any infrastructure plan. Repeal of DavisBacon would decrease the quality of bluecollar jobs, and that is a loss that we cannot afford. A repeal of DavisBacon would decrease the amount of money that you take home every week or that you take home every 2 weeks, however often you get that check, however often you look for that direct deposit so you can make those bills. If we repeal DavisBacon, you will not be making those bills as easy as you were before. You need to let your Republican Member of Congress know that you want to bring more money home, that you want these prevailing wages, that you do not want to lose these, that it would be absolutely devastating for your family. Another area that Blue Collar Caucus has talked about, another area that we are going to continue to talk about and that Congress should press forward on in great speed is the Buy America provisions. They have to be in any infrastructure package that we pass. Buy America generally requires that projects carried out by State and local governments use U.S.made iron and steel and that they also require domestic production and assembly of other manufactured goods be made right here in the good old USA. These projects—again, mainly highways, public transportation, aviation— are vitally important to our economy, and ensuring that these projects are made with quality Americanmade goods means that we get better value and that we put our own people to work. All of this means more and better jobs for hardworking Americans out there. As we set about rebuilding America’s infrastructure, we have to make sure that we are building an economy that works for everyone and not just the corporate interests in this country because, again, we have to do something about income inequality in this country. It is very real. Productivity is up. People’s paychecks are stagnant. That is why people still feel the economic pinch and the economic pain, because they see the growth, they see the technology, but they don’t see their paychecks getting any fatter—but they do feel themselves struggling more and more and more. We have got to change that. I would like to again thank Representative BOYLE just for being an advocate for the hardworking citizens in the Philadelphia area in his district, just for being a voice on this, and other Members of Congress that came out tonight—Ms. KAPTUR , Mr. L IPINSKI , and others—because we know that this is important. We have to keep talking about this. We cannot continue to let the American worker fail. We cannot continue to let the American worker’s dollar not grow while we see our economy grow and while we see new technology and fat cats getting rich, seeing corporate America getting rich but the average, everyday American just continues to fall further and further behind. It has to end. It has to end. Congress needs to work together to do something about that. I am glad that the Democratic Party in the United States House of Representatives is taking the lead on this issue. Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
