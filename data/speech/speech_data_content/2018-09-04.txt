Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Kernersville Chamber of Commerce on celebrating its 50th anniversary this week. This organization is a steadfast pillar of the strong business community in Kernersville, North Carolina. The Teacher Grant Program is among the chamber’s many significant contributions to local education and investments in future business leaders. Each year, teachers submit proposals for creative ‘‘hands on’’ lessons, and with moneys raised over the summer, the chamber awards at least one $500 grant to each school. The chamber also supports current community and business leaders through its Leadership Kernersville Program, which has prepared 200 participants for leadership roles and involvement within the community, the region, and the State since 1993. The Kernersville Chamber of Commerce has been an incredible asset to the community and will continue to be so for many years to come. f 
RECOGNIZING SIERRA HOLLEY (Mr. HILL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, this Labor Day week, I recognize the achievements of a young woman from Arkansas, Ms. Sierra Holley. Ms. Holley is a student at the Conway Area Career Center and recently completed the SkillsUSA Championships, where she received a Skill Point Certificate in welding sculpture. Sierra won the gold in our State’s SkillsUSA Leadership Conference and received a travel scholarship from the MikeRoweWORKS Foundation to attend the national competition. SkillsUSA’s programs are integrated into career and technical education through a framework of personal, workplace, and technical skills grounded in academics. More than 6,300 students from every State in the Union completed this year’s championships, and Arkansas is so proud of Sierra’s accomplishments. SkillsUSA Championship events are a great way for middle, high school, and college students to immerse in the field of a skilled workforce. Conway Area Career Center is located at Conway High School. I congratulate Sierra for her great achievement and that of her teachers at the Conway Area Career Center. 
HONORING CHARLY BUTCHER (Mr. BANKS of Indiana asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. BANKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of northeast Indiana broadcasting icon, Charly Butcher. 
For decades, thousands of northeast Indiana residents would start their mornings with Charly, a beloved radio anchor on WOWO’s morning news program. His talent and ability to speak directly through the radio and into the home or car of each listener was unparalleled. Though he could have become a radio fixture anywhere in the country, Charly chose to stay in Fort Wayne and broadcast locally for more than 30 years. I was fortunate to get to know Charly both on and off the air, but our offtheair conversations are what I will cherish the most. He was passionate about education, as his wife Sarah is an elementary schoolteacher, and we would often discuss my work on the House Education and the Workforce Committee. While our entire region mourns his loss, his irreplaceable voice will live on for generations to come. I offer my deepest condolences to his wife Sarah, three children, and colleagues at WOWO. Mr. Speaker, I thank you for allowing me time to remember Charly and to honor his legacy. 
HONORING THE AMERICAN WORKER (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the American worker. Yesterday, our Nation observed Labor Day, which was established in the late 19th century as a way to honor the workers who contribute to the wealth and prosperity of this great Nation. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania was one of the first eight States in the Union to recognize the holiday in the late 1880s. In 1894, President Grover Cleveland declared Labor Day a Federal holiday. While many today consider Labor Day a time to celebrate the end of summer and beginning of fall, it is more than just a threeday weekend. Labor Day honors the American worker and the power of work. It highlights that through hard work, risk, discipline, and opportunity, we can all achieve the American Dream. And more Americans will join the workforce thanks to my bill that was signed into law this summer that increases funding for career and technical education programs. This law will work to restore rungs on the ladder of opportunity for every American regardless of age or background, and that is something we can all celebrate. f

ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. For decades, the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill Act of 2018 has had longstanding and broad bipartisan support in both Chambers of Congress. It has been used as a means to bolster United States manufacturing and competitiveness by temporarily reducing or suspending tariffs on certain imported goods and components. I cosponsored this bill when it was introduced last November. I supported it when we considered it on the floor earlier this year in January. The MTB returns to the House today for consideration of amendments made by the Senate on July 26. As the House takes up this bill again, I intend to support the bill, as amended. I have always supported and will always support American manufacturers, and will do everything I can to boost their ability to compete. And I commend the chairman. My home State of New Jersey will benefit greatly from the program, with firms projected to save more than $100 million over the course of a 3year period. From chemicals to textiles, our State’s industries will benefit. The largest industry in New Jersey is chemical manufacturing, employing directly or indirectly over 100,000 workers. Several of those firms will receive tariff relief from numerous imported chemicals that I dare not try to pronounce. I can’t overlook the relief given to little, green peperoncino for those subs and pizzas we all love. Even in Texas, they have that. But today’s vote raises important questions about what I consider to be the chaotic approach to trade from this President and some of my Republican colleagues, their unwillingness to challenge. Since the passage of the MTB in January, this administration has imposed tariffs on up to $47 billion of steel and aluminum imports from around the world and $50 billion on imported goods from China. The administration is now in the final week of a public comment process to determine $200 billion of additional imports from China that it intends to subject to tariffs. 
This administration can and should take strong measures to make China accountable for cheating our global trade system and ripping off American companies and workers. On that, we can agree. But what is confusing right now is the fact that, while the administration continues to move forward with tariffs that will cover nearly half of all imported products from China, the MTB will reduce or remove tariffs on many of the same products. That is a little confusing. To me, it is. For the $50 billion in Chinese imports currently subject to Section 301 tariffs, there are up to 150 products that are covered by today’s bill. For the list of proposed goods valued at $200 billion in Chinese imports that the administration is currently considering subjecting to additional tariffs, the overlap with today’s bill could be as high as 1,000 products. Now, it is true that the MTB reduces or suspends tariffs on products imported from any and all countries, not just China. But let me remind everyone of this: While the administration has been imposing tariffs, our trading partners have been responding in kind by hitting our exports with retaliatory tariffs. As we consider suspending some 1,600 tariffs on imports from China and other countries, I haven’t heard that any of those countries is about to reciprocate and do us any similar favors. Because the administration is relying so heavily on the use of tariffs as a trade enforcement tool—remember, a tool, yes, not a weapon—the majority’s push to move MTB, which reduces and suspends tariffs, with a minimal amount of process, seems like a concerted effort to contradict the administration’s own trade agenda. So, how does the MTB fit with this administration’s trade agenda? Well, we have been asking that question for many months. Several months ago, the administration reached out to the Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee to express concerns with the MTB, especially as it will apply to import duties on goods from China, including finished goods. In response, I expressed my strong interest in working with the administration to address and resolve those concerns. In May, as the administration turned up the heat on tariffs on China, I asked the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee to convene a hearing with administration representatives on these China trade policies. My Democratic colleagues and I were also open to marking up the MTB in committee and considering the legislation under regular order. In no case did we find willing partners. Tomorrow, the Ways and Means Committee will hold a markup on my resolution of inquiry, seeking information about the administration’s tariffs policy, and I expect to revisit the question. Today, I will support the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill Act of 2018. I want to commend the chairman. I don’t say that blindly. I think he has asked many good questions when we have had tariff issues and trade issues before the entire body as well as the subcommittee. I think that this is good. I think that this is important. But we are talking about a specific bill here today, and it is in contradiction to what the administration has proffered. I have also, on behalf of my fellow Democrats, extended every effort to work toward bringing coherence to the policies. To my Republican colleagues, the question I ask you is: What have you done to do that? As we look to the future, in conclusion, I am committed to working to improve the MTB process, to pursue a broader global economic strategy that supports U.S. workers and firms. Imposing or suspending tariffs is not enough. We need trade policies that are strong, effective, and coherent. b1630 We must remember what the purpose of the miscellaneous tariff process is. If we don’t produce it in the United States, then we will not place a tariff on anything. That helps us and our manufacturers, who might need those products from other countries. I think it is a wise process, and I commend the chairman for pursuing this and sticking to it. Madam Speaker, I think that this is important legislation. No one can deny that. This is not frivolous legislation by any stretch, but it cannot be in contradiction with the general agenda for trade universally. This is what I am very concerned about. I have given specific examples as to what I am talking about. This is going to help my State; it is going to help a lot of States throughout the union. I sincerely do commend the chairman for making sure that we get this done before November. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, H.R. 4318 will deliver muchneeded temporary tariff relief to American manufacturers of all sizes, helping them to grow and create jobs. The bill will also help American consumers by reducing prices and not forcing families to pay unnecessary taxes on products that aren’t made here. Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join here in a bipartisan way concurring with the Senate amendments to H.R. 4318. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BRADY ) that the House suspend the rules and concur in the Senate amendments to the bill, H.R. 4318. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the Senate amendments were concurred in. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. f 
BIOMETRIC IDENTIFICATION TRANSNATIONAL MIGRATION ALERT PROGRAM AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2018 Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 6439) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to establish in the Department of Homeland Security the Biometric Identification Transnational Migration Alert Program, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 6439 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Biometric Identification Transnational Migration Alert Program Authorization Act of 2018’’. 
(a) I NGENERAL .—Subtitle D of title IV of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 251 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following new section: 
‘‘(a) E STABLISHMENT .—There is established in the Department a program to be known as the Biometric Identification Transnational Migration Alert Program (referred to in this section as ‘BITMAP’) to address and reduce national security, border security, and terrorist threats before such threats reach the international border of the United States. ‘‘(b) DUTIES .—In carrying out BITMAP operations, the Secretary, acting through the Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, shall— ‘‘(1) coordinate, in consultation with the Secretary of State, appropriate representatives of foreign governments, and the heads of other Federal agencies, as appropriate, to facilitate the voluntary sharing of biometric and biographic information collected from foreign nationals for the purpose of identifying and screening such nationals to identify those nationals who may pose a terrorist threat or a threat to national security or border security; ‘‘(2) provide capabilities, including training and equipment, to partner countries to voluntarily collect biometric and biographic identification data from individuals to identify, prevent, detect, and interdict high risk individuals identified as national security, border security, or terrorist threats who may attempt to enter the United States utilizing illicit pathways; ‘‘(3) provide capabilities, including training and equipment, to partner countries to compare foreign data against appropriate United States national security, border security, terrorist, immigration, and counterterrorism data, including— ‘‘(A) the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Terrorist Screening Database, or successor database; ‘‘(B) the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Next Generation Identification database, or successor database; ‘‘(C) the Department of Defense Automated Biometric Identification System (commonly known as ‘ABIS’), or successor database;

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL) and the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. THOMPSON ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. 
Mr. M CCAUL. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of my legislation to help protect the American people and keep our homeland safe. We are only 1 week out from the 17th anniversary of 9/11, and a lot has changed since those four horrifying attacks, but one thing remains the same: America’s enemies are always looking for new ways to sneak into our country. Today, many special interest aliens and other nefarious actors, including potential terrorists, are exploiting illicit pathways throughout Central and South America, racing towards the border. To combat this threat, we need to leverage our international partnerships and use advanced technology to our advantage. One of the best tools we have is ICE’s Biometric Identification Transnational Migration Alert Program, otherwise known as BITMAP. BITMAP was created in 2011 by the Obama administration and is utilized on five different continents. Through this program, trained and vetted law enforcement officers collect biometric and biographic data on potentially dangerous individuals traveling through their country. The collected data is then shared with American law enforcement, the Department of Defense, and intelligence agencies. This vital information helps us enrich our databases, map illicit pathways, exploit networks, and learn about individuals looking to bring harm. In the last few years, BITMAP has identified several hundred known or suspected terrorists. Top national security officials from DOD and DHS have testified to its success. For example, former Acting Director of ICE, Thomas Homan, told me at a recent hearing: ‘‘People that were known terrorists had been turned around in Panama and sent back before reaching our shores. . . .’’ BITMAP ‘‘has already proven successful.’’ And that is according to the former Director of ICE. BITMAP does not just ID suspected terrorists, however. It also identifies drug smugglers, sex offenders, murderers, child predators, gang members like MS–13, and people with active warrants and other dangerous backgrounds. My bill will enhance American and foreign law enforcement’s ability to keep our citizens safe by identifying threats at the earliest possible stage. Simply put, it will help stop dangerous individuals who want to bring harm to the American people. Threats to America, whether through terrorism, human trafficking, or deadly opioids, continue to grow, and we must do everything we can to stop them. I am proud this legislation passed out of our committee with bipartisan support, and I want to thank Congressman BILLKEATING for all of his work on this issue. Passing this important legislation through the House is a simple step we can take to make our homeland more secure, and I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 6439, the Biometric Identification Transnational Migration Alert Program Authorization Act of 2018. I have long supported Department of Homeland Security overseas programs aimed at preventing terrorist threats from ever arriving at our borders. In fact, over the years, I have sponsored a number of measures that specifically seek to drive greater international collaboration and expand DHS’ overseas border security footprint. Two wellestablished overseas DHS programs that come to mind are: U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s Preclearance program, in which officers are posted abroad to screen travelers prior to boarding U.S.bound flights; and Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Visa Security Program, in which ICE special agents are posted at overseas consulates to assist State Department staff in visa vetting. Earlier this Congress, Representative FILEMON VELA, the lead Democrat on our Border and Maritime Security Subcommittee, introduced two bills aimed at bolstering international border and counterterrorism cooperation: H.R. 2218 would authorize ICE’s Border Enforcement Security Task Force, a program that has been proven to be effective at enhancing cooperation and information sharing among law enforcement along the U.S.Mexico border. The second bill, H.R. 4578, is targeted at expanding efforts carried out by CBP’s National Targeting Center aimed at disrupting and dismantling terrorists and other criminal networks. When presented to the full House, both bills received unanimous support from Democrats for good reason: They are effective counterterrorism programs. However, I am sorry to say, as of today, there is not enough data to assess whether the same can be said for ICE’s Biometric Identification Transnational Migration Alert Program, or BITMAP, pilot. As such, I cannot support permanently authorizing it, as set forth under H.R. 6439. I would expect that some Members of this body are unfamiliar with the program, as it is largely a classified program and, as such, little information about BITMAP is in the public domain. 
Since 2011, ICE’s BITMAP pilot program has trained and equipped foreign law enforcement partners on collecting biographic and biometric data of foreign nationals migrating through partner countries so that such information can be checked against U.S. intelligence and law enforcement databases. The stated goal of the program is to identify known or suspected terrorists or criminals prior to arrival at our borders. Though in operation for several years, the volume of data collected only started to be significant in the last 2 years. Prior to considering H.R. 6439 in committee, committee members had repeatedly been presented in a classified setting with anecdotes about successes that the program has experienced. While we appreciated hearing positive news about this pilot, anecdotes are not enough to justify permanently authorizing this program. Anecdotes are no substitute for data and evidence of efficiency. In an effort to secure data prior to committee consideration, I submitted a number of basic questions about the program’s efficacy and operations to ICE. I received a response prior to the committee’s markup that raised further questions about BITMAP’s efficacy as well as core operational questions, such as: After checks against databases, what does the U.S. Government do with the records it collects on migrants who are not found to have terrorist ties? What, if any, protections exist to guard against the collection of highly personal and sensitive information from migrants with no criminal or terrorist ties who are encountered nowhere near the U.S.Mexico border and have no intentions of coming anywhere close to it? What, if any, audit or oversight mechanisms exist to ensure that foreign partners adhere to requirements of the program and do not use this sophisticated law enforcement tool to suppress domestic activities? Over the recess, ICE officials briefed the committee staff about BITMAP, but fundamental questions remain. I hope that there will be a day when I can say without reservation that, after careful review of BITMAP’s operational documents and data, I fully support making it permanent. Unfortunately, today is not the day. In the absence of evidence, I cannot support H.R. 6439, but I am supportive of the pilot continuing so that ICE can work to aggregate and assess critical data to make an evidentiary case to Congress for why the program should be permanently authorized. b1645 I would note that enactment of H.R. 6439 is not necessary for BITMAP to continue to operate. With or without passage of H.R. 6439, ICE expects to continue to be able to operate the pilot. Madam Speaker, before I close, I include in the RECORD a letter from the American Civil Liberties Union in opposition to this legislation. 
SEPTEMBER 4, 2018. Re Vote NO on H.R. 6439, the Biometric Identification Transnational Migration Alert Program (BITMAP) Authorization Act of 2018. DEAR REPRESENTATIVE : On behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union, Immigrant Legal Resource Center, National Immigration Law Center and the National Immigration Project of the National Lawyers Guild, we urge you to oppose H.R. 6439, legislation that would permanently authorize the biometric pilot program known as ‘‘BITMAP’’ within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The House is expected to consider this bill under suspension of the rules on Tuesday, September 4, 2018. We urge you to oppose H.R. 6439. H.R. 6439 would permanently authorize BITMAP, a program which has existed since 2010—but with no privacy or transparency protections, and with insufficient factfinding during committee consideration of the bill. Although BITMAP would continue without enactment of this legislation, the House should not permanently authorize the BITMAP program with limited information, no information on whether DHS takes any steps to protect privacy, no studies regarding its efficacy, and no statutory privacy or transparency protections. This bill raises significant concerns regarding the sharing of information across foreign governments related to suspicion of terrorism, gang violence, and other socalled national security concerns with very little information as to how this information is used and retained. In 2010, DHS began piloting BITMAP to collect and share biometric and biographical data on ‘‘special interest aliens, violent criminals, fugitives and confirmed or suspected terrorists.’’ According to previous testimony by DHS officials, this also includes gang members and other persons of interest who may pose a potential national security concern. There is no information or proof as to BITMAP’s effectiveness. Despite numerous requests from Congress, including members of the House Homeland Security Committee, DHS has failed to provide information since the program’s inception in 2010 that shows its effectiveness or that it is tailored to meet its needs. Given this, it is premature to permanently authorize the program, particularly given the significant privacy and civil liberties concerns. The legislation fails to require that the program adhere to privacy protections. This program includes the sharing of extraordinarily sensitive information regarding individuals without warrant or analogous legal process. Yet, the legislation fails to include any privacy standards that DHS must follow with regards to the program. For example, what information can be collected, how long can it be stored, when can it be disseminated to other agencies, and can it be shared with foreign partners? The omission of these protections in the bill is particularly striking given that the agency has not provided any public information regarding what, if any, privacy protections currently apply to the execution of BITMAP. The legislation fails to place limits on how information collected under BITMAP can be used. There is little to no information regarding what actions may be triggered as a result of these database checks nor information regarding what is considered ‘‘suspicion’’ or a ‘‘national security concern.’’ The terms used by officials in discussing this program such as terrorism, gang members, and national security concern have historically been used to target Muslim, Arab, Iranian, Latinx, Middle Eastern, and South Asian populations. The failure to provide information regarding policies governing BITMAP raises significant concerns that the program may result in unjust profiling and discrimination. The existing legislation fails to include any language that would prohibit such improper uses. Moreover, insufficient information has been made public to assess whether such profiling and discrimination are current problems with the program. Under this bill, DHS would have the authority to enter into agreements with foreign countries to carry out BITMAP operations without legislative or judicial review. Although this bill would require DHS to notify Congress before the execution of BITMAP agreements, the agreements would not be subject to congressional authorization. This legislation would significantly undermine Congress’ oversight role by allowing DHS to take measures without sufficient checks or balances. Additionally, the bill fails to ensure that the public is made aware of how DHS is exercising its authority. It is irresponsible to permanently authorize BITMAP without a full understanding of its effectiveness, policies and procedures, privacy and civil rights protections, and oversight mechanisms. We urge you to oppose H.R. 6439. Sincerely, AMERICAN CIVILLIBERTIES  UNION. IMMIGRANT LEGAL  RESOURCE CENTER . NATIONAL IMMIGRATION  LAWCENTER . NATIONAL IMMIGRATION  PROJECT OF THE  NATIONAL LAWYERS  GUILD. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, it is our duty as Members of Congress to ensure that counterterrorism pilot programs are effective prior to permanently authorizing them. As I mentioned at the outset, DHS has a number of proven overseas, border, and counterterrorism programs that have strong congressional bipartisan support. However, with all due respect to the chairman, the efficacy of BITMAP as a counterterrorism program has not been established. As such, a permanent authorization of H.R. 6439 is premature. Given the classified nature of this program, some Members are unfamiliar with it and there are natural limitations as to what we are able to discuss on the House floor. But I understand that at an unclassified stafflevel briefing during the recess on threats in the Caribbean, ICE officials stated that BITMAP is working and successful, but failed to provide data to back up the assertions. I will concede that ICE has shared some promising anecdotes, and I do not object to ICE officials touting what they see as a successful overseas program to Congress. However, when ICE’s broadbased assertions and anecdotes are not backed up with data and metrics, it falls to Congress to carry out oversight of the program, not blindly authorize it. Let’s not reward the administration for failing to provide Congress with necessary data and metrics. Let’s come 
together and vote down H.R. 6439. By taking such action, we will be communicating to ICE our expectations, while in no way preventing the BITMAP pilot from continuing as it has for the past 7 years. As I said earlier, I sincerely hope that the positive aspects of BITMAP being touted by the other side of the aisle today can be backed up by reliable data and facts. Unfortunately, the little information we have on BITMAP to date simply does not justify a standalone authorization. Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to oppose H.R. 6439, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, I have tremendous respect for the gentleman from Mississippi, but I do have to respectfully disagree with some of his assertions. First of all, this program, BITMAP, was started 7 years ago under the Obama administration. And over the last 7 years, we have obtained sufficient data that would verify the success of the program. In fact, I can’t get into the classified nature of the program. Suffice it to say that we stopped hundreds of known or suspected terrorists from entering the United States under this triedandtrue program. The Secretary testified before our committee that, on average, 19 known or suspected terrorists try to enter the United States every day. Our solemn obligation is to protect the American people from the threats that we see outside of the United States and do everything we can to stop them from getting into the United States. What the 9/11 Commission talked about in its report about travel and keeping bad people and bad things out of the United States, is the reason this committee was formed in the first place. And we have heard the stories about ISIS in written materials encouraging followers to cross our southwest border. We talked about the 9/11 Commission. We talked about terrorists’ travel strategies. This is one of those strategies, one of those programs that I believe the 9/11 Commission was talking about. Why not use the best technology we have and use biometrics to identify known or suspected terrorists, MS–13 gang members, child predators, opioid traffickers, all of the bad stuff that can come into this country. When Border Patrol tells me we only know 50 percent of what is coming into the country, why would we not want to use the most innovative technology so that when someone enters this hemisphere under one name and gets up to the Mexico border under another name— just like in the Mollie Tibbetts’ killing, slaying, where someone came into the country and changed their identity. This stops the changing of identity up the road into the United States. Why? Biometrics don’t lie. You are who you are. And we know who they are through the great, best technology we have available today. So I believe that being opposed to this legislation really puts the American people at harm. I hope I am wrong in saying this, because I never want politics to enter this committee: National security should never be political. The terrorists don’t check our partisan affiliation. But my concern is that because ICE is in this bill, we are drawing opposition. Madam Speaker, this is one of the best programs that ICE administers, created under the Obama administration. It deserves and it has earned to be fully authorized by the United States Congress, and I ask that all of my colleagues support this measure. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6439. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.

Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 6459) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to require a strategy to diversify the technology stakeholder marketplace regarding the acquisition by the Transportation Security Administration of security screening technologies, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 6459 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘TSA Opportunities to Pursue Expanded Networks for Business Act’’ or the ‘‘TSA OPEN for Business Act’’. 
(a) I NGENERAL .—Subtitle B of title XVI of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 563 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end following new section: 
‘‘(a) I NGENERAL .—Not later than 120 days after the date of the enactment of this section, the Administrator shall submit to the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate a strategy to diversify the technology stakeholder marketplace that the Administrator relies upon to acquire security screening technologies, including by increased participation of small business innovators. ‘‘(b) CONTENTS .—The strategy required under subsection (a) shall include the following: ‘‘(1) Information on how Administration solicitation, testing, evaluation, piloting, acquisition, and procurement processes impact the Administrator’s ability to acquire from a technology stakeholder, including a small business innovator, that has not previously provided technology to the Administration, an innovative technology or capability with the potential to enhance transportation security. ‘‘(2) Specific actions that the Administrator will take, including modifications to the processes described in paragraph (1), to foster diversification within the technology stakeholder marketplace, together with information on projected timelines for such actions. ‘‘(3) Plans for how the Administrator may, to the extent practicable, assist a small business innovator at certain points in such processes, including when such an innovator lacks adequate resources to participate in such processes, to help ensure that an advanced technology or capability can be developed and acquired by the Administrator. ‘‘(4) A feasibility assessment of partnering with an organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and exempt from tax under section 501(a) of such Code to help provide venture capital to businesses, particularly small business innovators, for commercialization of innovative homeland security technologies that are expected to be ready for commercialization in the near term and within 36 months. In conducting such feasibility assessment, the Administrator shall consider the following: ‘‘(A) Establishing an organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and exempt from tax under section 501(a) of such Code, modeled after the InQtel program, as a venture capital partnership between the private sector and the intelligence community to help businesses, particularly small business innovators, commercialize innovative securityrelated technologies. ‘‘(B) Enhanced engagement, either through the Science and Technology Directorate of the Department of Homeland Security or directly, with the InQtel program described in subparagraph (A). ‘‘(c) RULE OF CONSTRUCTION .—Nothing in this section may be construed as requiring changes to the Transportation Security Administration standards for security technology. ‘‘(d) DEFINITIONS .—In this section: ‘‘(1) INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY .—The term ‘intelligence community’ has the meaning given such term in section 3(4) of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 3003(4)). ‘‘(2) SMALL BUSINESS CONCERN .—The term ‘small business concern’ has the meaning described under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). ‘‘(3) SMALL BUSINESS INNOVATOR .—The term ‘small business innovator’ means a stakeholder that is a small business concern that has an advanced transportation security technology or capability.’’.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL) and the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. THOMPSON ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. 
Mr. M CCAUL. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6459, the TSA Opportunities to Pursue Expanded Networks for Business Act, also known as the TSA OPEN for Business Act, sponsored by the ranking member of the Committee on Homeland Security, Mr. THOMPSON . This bipartisan legislation seeks to improve how TSA partners with the private sector to offer innovative technologies for passenger screening. In particular, this bill aims to bolster access for small businesses to TSA’s acquisition process and better serve the public. Specifically, this bill directs the TSA administrator to develop a strategy to diversify the stakeholder marketplace used to acquire advanced security technologies. This strategy must include plans to assist small businesses with navigating the agency’s acquisitions and procurement processes, which are often overly bureaucratic. Additionally, the bill will help establish publicprivate partnerships that will direct venture capital toward emerging, promising technologies. Madam Speaker, our airline industry still remains the crown jewel of targets for international terrorists. The public deserves to have the best security in place throughout America’s transportation and aviation sector, and it is incumbent upon the TSA to create a streamlined way of identifying and deploying advanced security technologies. Since its creation, TSA has struggled to expand participation by small businesses and direct resources towards promising technologies. Ranking Member THOMPSON ’s legislation reduces bureaucratic hurdles, while promoting private sector innovation. Madam Speaker, I want to thank the ranking member for introducing this excellent legislation, as well as the chairman of the Subcommittee on Transportation and Protective Security, Mr. KATKO , for his leadership on this issue. This legislation offers a bipartisan approach to improving opportunities for small businesses seeking to partner with TSA, and improves the security of our Nation’s transportation systems. Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6459, the TSA Opportunities to Pursue Expanded Networks for Business Act, or TSA OPEN for Business Act. Madam Speaker, the Transportation Security Administration must acquire and deploy effective security technology to keep up with current threats. To do so, TSA must ensure its acquisition processes incentivize security manufacturers to develop innovative solutions and compete for contract awards. Unfortunately, in practice, TSA’s processes are unwieldy and full of delays and roadblocks that limit interest and competition. Today, companies looking to do business with TSA for the first time must invest significant resources and expend years of effort on testing and piloting before ever receiving a single purchase order. For small businesses, which generally lack other revenue streams to underwrite their operations while working through the maze of TSA’s processes, these impediments often prove insurmountable. There is no way of knowing how many small businesses have had innovative security solutions, but pursued other opportunities rather than risk getting tangled up in TSA’s acquisition web. My bill, the TSA OPEN for Business Act, requires TSA to develop a strategy to diversify the technology stakeholder marketplace that it relies upon to acquire security technologies. Importantly, the strategy must address barriers to participation for businesses that have not previously provided technology to TSA, including small business innovators. It also requires TSA to conduct a feasibility assessment of partnering with a nonprofit organization to provide venture capital to help businesses commercialize innovative technologies, similar to the InQTel program that has been so successful within the intelligence community. By pushing TSA to take proactive action to diversify the security technology marketplace, H.R. 6459 has the potential to increase competition within the transportation security technology marketplace to ultimately deliver better security. b1700 Madam Speaker, in fiscal year 2017, TSA awarded over $1.6 billion in contracts. Within such a large marketplace, there should be plenty of space for businesses of all sizes with innovative ideas to compete. H.R. 6459 will push TSA to take steps to diversify the security technology marketplace to ensure that it is positioned to acquire the most innovative technology available. Madam Speaker, I thank my colleagues on the other side for their support, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Madam Speaker, in closing, I thank Ranking Member THOMPSON for bringing this legislation. When a lot of people look at TSA, they look at the lines and the screening that takes place. Sometimes I often think they don’t get the respect that they deserve. TSA does a lot more than screening at airports. It screens overseas; it has intelligence leads to stop terrorists from coming into the country; and, most importantly, it stops terrorists with the latest threat that we have that I can say publicly now: turning laptops into bombs and toxic gas. That is a threat that keeps me up at night with U.S.bound passengers from airports like Istanbul, Cairo, and Riyadh into JFK Airport and other airports, but also domestic flights. It is important that we pass this bill that the ranking member introduced to make sure that TSA has the best technology available to stop that threat. I am proud to say that we have worked in a bipartisan fashion to ensure that the moneys have been appropriated to buy these new technologies and new machines that outdated technology cannot see or screen but the updated technology can. We owe it to the American people to deploy this new technology as soon and quickly as possible, given the immediate threat to the United States and the airline sector. Madam Speaker, I think this is an excellent bill. I fully support it, and I urge my colleagues to support it as well. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6459, the ‘‘TSA OPEN for Business Act,’’ which amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002, to diversify the technology stakeholder marketplace for TSA acquisitions. I would like to thank Ranking Member THOMPSON for his leadership on the Committee on Homeland Security and for introducing this important bill to improve transportation security. H.R. 6459 directs the Administrator of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration to develop and submit to Congress a strategy to diversify the technology stakeholder marketplace regarding the acquisition by the TSA of security screening technologies. That strategy must include: 
1. Information on how Administration solicitation, testing, evaluation, piloting, acquisition, and procurement processes impact the Administrator’s ability to acquire from a technology stakeholder, including a small business innovator, that has not previously provided technology to the Administration, an innovative technology or capability with the potential to enhance transportation security; 2. Specific actions that the administrator will take to foster diversification within the technology stakeholder market along with a timeline for such actions; 3. Plans for how the administrator may assist a small business innovator at certain points in such process; and 4. A feasibility assessment of partnering with an organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and exempt from tax under section 501(a) of such Code. I represent the 18th Congressional District of Texas which is situated in Houston and home to 2 major airports, the George Bush International Airport and William P. Hobby Airport, which are essential hubs for domestic and international air travel for Houston and the region. Nearly 40 million passengers traveled through George Bush International Airport (IAH) and an additional 10 million traveled through William P. Hobby (HOU). More than 650 daily departures occur at George Bush International Airport, which is also the 11th busiest airport in the U.S. for total passenger traffic and annually handles more than 419,205 metric tons of cargo. As better transportation security technology becomes available, it is imperative that it be adequately evaluated for use in our nation’s airports. The size of a company should not limit it from contributing to the important work of aviation security. We should support advances in transportation security technology that are positive and help fulfill the TSA’s mission to protect our nation’s transportation systems from terrorist threats. I ask that all members join me in voting to pass H.R. 6459, the ‘‘TSA OPEN for Business Act.’’ The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6459. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New York (Mr. KING) and the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. THOMP SON) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. 
Mr. KING of New York. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. KING of New York. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, on July 24, the Committee on Homeland Security voted to favorably report H.R. 6430. I want to thank the Oversight and Management Efficiency Subcommittee chairman, Mr. PERRY ; the full committee chairman, Mr. MCCAUL; Ranking Member THOMPSON ; the Counterterrorism and Intelligence Subcommittee ranking member, Miss RICE; the Oversight and Management Efficiency ranking member, Mr. CORREA ; Congressman D ONOVAN; and Congressman P AYNE for working with me and cosponsoring this legislation. The legislation under consideration is a result of several years of oversight into supply chain and counterintelligence risks in the procurement process. There is no question that nation states and criminal actors are constantly trying to exploit U.S. Government and privatesector systems to steal information or insert potentially harmful hardware or software. The recent cases involving Kaspersky, ZTE, and Huawei underscore the threats posed to the Federal supply chain and the urgency in developing stronger mechanisms to secure it. On July 12, I held a hearing to review DHS’ current supply chain risk management programs as well as assess the need for additional authority. At the hearing, the Department’s chief information officer noted: ‘‘Gaps exist in the Department’s authority to use intelligence to support its procurement decisions. . . . In those exceptional cases where mitigation is not possible, the Department needs the capability to react swiftly while appropriately restricting the disclosure of other national security sensitive information.’’ Clearly, Madam Speaker, this is a problem. The bill under consideration today provides the DHS Secretary with authority to restrict information technology procurements if the vendor poses a threat to the DHS supply chain. This bill establishes true coordination between the acquisition process and intelligence. This authority is modeled after existing authority granted to the Department of Defense in 2011. The legislation also includes important enhancements recommended by the Office of Management and Budget based on a governmentwide supply chain risk management proposal released at the end of July. I am hopeful that, as this bill moves through the process, we will also have an opportunity to consider the legislation that provides similar authority to ensure national security vetting is incorporated into the wider government procurement process. As a national security agency, it is vital that DHS also have robust supply chain risk management practices and tools to identify, mitigate, and remove potential threats to its systems and contracts. With this legislation, Congress is ensuring that DHS will have the authority necessary to fully vet and restrict, if necessary, vendors who pose a threat. Madam Speaker, I urge all Members to join me in supporting H.R. 6430, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6430, the Securing the Homeland Security Supply Chain Act of 2018. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6430 would authorize the Secretary of Homeland Security to exclude an information technology and communication vendor that is deemed to pose significant national security risk from contracts for equipment and services. I strongly believe that DHS must have the necessary tools to address evolving cyber incursions and espionage by nationstates to keep our country safe. The most significant risk to the supply chain comes from Chinese and Russian companies. For years, the intelligence community has warned that information and communication technology produced by Chinese companies, most notably ZTE and Huawei, could be used to carry out cyber theft and espionage. Some companies with ties to the Russian Government also pose national 
security risks. The U.S. Government has particularly highlighted concerns about Kaspersky Lab. In September 2017, DHS issued a directive requiring Federal agencies to remove all Kaspersky products from their networks, given ties between certain Kaspersky officials and Russian intelligence. The risks to the supply chain are all too real and must be mitigated. That is why I am proud to cosponsor H.R. 6430, a measure that acts upon the information provided to us by our intelligence community to help DHS better counter these mounting threats. H.R. 6430 provides DHS with needed authority to exclude vendors who are bad actors from the information technology and communications supply chain. If enacted, H.R. 6430 will allow the Department to be proactive and effective in addressing these complex threats in the future. Importantly, the bill includes robust oversight provisions to ensure that Congress receives notification and justification of any exercise of authority under this act. Notably, this measure is based on a similar authority provided to the Department of Defense in 2011 and incorporates language provided by the Office of Management and Budget. H.R. 6430 provides the Secretary of Homeland Security with a muchneeded tool to eliminate national security threats to our supply chain. Enactment of H.R. 6430 will help DHS secure information technology and telecommunications equipment and services that are so essential to keeping our Nation secure. Mr. Speaker, I would like to compliment the gentleman from New York, who has significant experience in this area, for offering this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 6430, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Let me again thank the gentleman from Mississippi and the ranking member for his service on this bill and his service to the committee over the years. Mr. Speaker, this legislation provides DHS vital authority to protect the Department from vendors who pose a risk. The bill includes important accountability measures to ensure that decisions are risk based, allows the vendor to provide feedback, and requires annual reviews any time the authority is used. This is commonsense legislation that will provide important national security protections for the Department similar to what already exists for the Department of Defense and the intelligence community. Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6430, the Securing the Homeland Security Supply Chain Act of 2018, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. HILL). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. KING) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6430. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. RATCLIFFE ) and the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. THOMP SON) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. 
Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, earlier this year, the Office of Management and Budget and the Department of Homeland Security 
released a report on the cybersecurity risks faced by Federal agencies. Among the findings of that report was that almost 75 percent of our Federal agencies are vulnerable to cyber threats, in large part due to their inability to understand cybersecurity risks and, therefore, to properly prioritize resources. Mr. Speaker, it is statistics like this that should make the state of our Nation’s cyber readiness and resilience deeply troubling to all of us. And it is one of the main reasons that DHS’ Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation, or CDM, program has been one of my top priorities during my time as chairman of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Protection Subcommittee. That is because CDM has the potential to provide solutions to this problem by dramatically increasing visibility across Federal networks, thereby dramatically improving the ability of DHS, OMB, and agency security officers to better understand the technology assets being utilized across their agencies. Mr. Speaker, at the end of the day, looking across all networks and systems the Federal Government owns and operates, it comes down to fingers on government keyboards, whether they be laptops, desktops, tablets, servers, or in data centers. b1715 We need to know what we have before we can try to defend it. That is why the CDM program is so crucial to the cybersecurity posture of our Federal Government. Through its phased rollout, CDM requires DHS to provide agencies with the capabilities to collect the cybersecurity risk information necessary to make better decisions. It not only allows the ability to combat our enemies in cyberspace, but also to help Federal CIOs manage information technology. The security data that CDM capabilities and tools collect will help Federal CIOs and DHS make smarter choices about where taxpayer dollars are going and to understand some of the most basic questions a cybersecurity expert faces, including what devices are on the network. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6443 is necessary to codify the CDM program at DHS and ensure that these authorities will exist to allow the continued progress of this essential cybersecurity program. Making sure that Federal agencies have access to the tools and capabilities they need to defend their networks and getting DHS the data to understand cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities, and to coordinate our Federal network defenses, are paramount concerns in this technological age. My goal, and the goal of the bipartisan group of cosponsors supporting H.R. 6443, is to help boost the long term success of the CDM program. This bill also ensures that this program keeps pace with the cuttingedge capabilities being developed in the private sector, thereby avoiding the type of vendor lock that has previously been a problem. In that way, this bill ensures that we will be modernizing and updating our systems before they become legacy technologies unsupported by vendors and at even greater risk of being exploited by our digital adversaries. It is DHS’ CDM program that will help Federal agencies and the whole of the Federal Government to understand the threats they face and the risks that these vulnerabilities pose in real time. Authorizing the CDM program will further DHS’ role in the cybersecurity mission throughout our government and will continue to strengthen and elevate this important program. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6443, the Advanced Cybersecurity Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation Act. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6443 would codify the existing Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation, or CDM, program within the Department of Homeland Security’s National Protection and Programs Directorate, NPPD. CDM is an important part of our national approach to securing Federal networks. Through CDM, DHS works with Federal agencies to identify, purchase, and integrate cybersecurity tools and services to help defend their networks against cyber attacks. By taking advantage of bulk pricing, CDM allows agencies to purchase security services at a discounted rate and, in turn, devote more of their limited resources to carrying out their missions. Another benefit of the program is that it enables DHS to track threats to agency networks, giving the Department a more holistic view of the threat landscape. Still, given the enormous challenges associated with protecting such a massive and diverse set of networks, it is not surprising that DHS has, at times, struggled. For instance, in rolling out CDM, DHS officials mapped four phases of implementation where, in the first phase, agencies would identify all the assets and devices on their networks. At the time, DHS projected that the last phase, which is focused on protecting the data that agencies store, would begin being tackled in 2017. Unfortunately, the CDM deployment schedule has been plagued with across theboard delays, starting with the implementation of phase 1, which took years. As a result of these delays, the data housed on agency networks—what the bad guys are really after—remains less secure than might otherwise have been. H.R. 6443 would address CDM’s challenges in a few ways, for example, by asking DHS to reconsider its phased approach to implementation and examine opportunities to streamline adoption of CDM technologies. This bill would also require DHS to develop a comprehensive strategy that addresses deployment challenges, areas where greater coordination is needed, and recommendations for continuous improvement. Finally, H.R. 6443 adds specificity to DHS’ responsibilities under CDM and includes robust reporting requirements to inform congressional oversight. Every year, Federal networks get hit by tens of thousands of attempted intrusions, many of them sophisticated, statesponsored attacks. We have seen time and again the cost and damage that can flow from a highprofile Federal breach. As such, we need CDM to work. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. LANGEVIN ). Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I want to recognize and thank the gentleman from Texas for his leadership on this issue as well as for his leadership as chairman of the Subcommittee on Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Protection. As the cofounder and cochair of the Congressional Cybersecurity Caucus, which I have coled for a decade with my good friend Chairman MCCAUL, I firmly believe that cybersecurity is the national and economic security issue of the 21st century. I believe it is, therefore, incumbent upon us as Members of Congress to enable the government to take the steps needed to protect our systems and to provide some course correction when necessary. This bill does both, authorizing the Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation, or CDM, program and requiring a strategy from the Department of Homeland Security to guide its future growth. CDM represents a core component of the Department’s efforts to better secure the dotgov domain. In particular, by giving agencies a better view into their networks, systems, and data, it helps provide an understanding of cybersecurity status in real time. It also feeds back data to DHS, so that cybersecurity specialists at the National Protection and Programs Directorate can better assist agencies in closing vulnerabilities and responding to incidents. Conceptually, CDM makes a lot of sense, but it has not been without challenges in implementation. Originally designed with a phased model that focused on incorporating new sets of tools at each milestone, it has fallen behind schedule, and many agencies have expressed skepticism about the program’s utility. I believe in CDM, and I believe that the congressional direction provided by Mr. RATCLIFFE ’s bill will help dispel some of these doubts. I also believe that the strategy can further help refocus the program on the present and future needs of Federal networks. So I am pleased that, during the committee 
consideration, my amendment requiring a reexamination of the phasing plan was adopted. While I appreciate the thought underlying the original phasing approach, I believe that we make more progress if the planned phase 3 and phase 4 are constructed in parallel rather than serially. This is a good bill, and I urge my colleagues to support its passage. However, I must take this opportunity to mention this bill’s major omission. It does not address the incentive structure at other agencies to actually adopt CDM offerings. During hearings and roundtables on the program, we often heard from government stakeholders that internal dynamics at DHS’ sister agencies were actually the biggest obstacle to the program’s success. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana). The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from Rhode Island. Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. This is, to be sure, outside the purview of the Committee on Homeland Security, and I believe the bill before us will materially improve the program. One other thing, I urge my colleagues to consider the wisdom of having so many committees involved with cybersecurity jurisdiction, often to the detriment of making real progress. Right now, there are some 30 committees and subcommittees that have jurisdiction over cyber, and it is very difficult to get things done. So I also urge my colleagues to look at the Executive Cyberspace Coordination Act, which would put a Senateconfirmed director of cybersecurity at the White House to help better coordinate interagency processes. Dealing with these jurisdictional problems would substantially improve our cybersecurity posture and would allow CDM to fully live up to its potential. With that, I would like to again thank Ranking Member THOMPSON and Chairmen MCCAUL and R ATCLIFFE for continuing their focus on cybersecurity. I strongly urge support for H.R. 6443. I commend Chairman RATCLIFFE  for introducing the bill, and I certainly hope all Members will support it and DHS’ ongoing cybersecurity efforts. Mr. RATCLIFFE. I reserve the balance of my time, Mr. Speaker. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers on this bill, and I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6443 seeks to improve DHS’ capacity to carry out one of its more important homeland security missions: the protection of Federal agency networks. Over the past decade, we have seen the number of cyber attacks against Federal agencies rise by more than 1,000 percent. Last year alone, the Office of Management and Budget reported that Federal agencies experienced more than 35,000 cybersecurity incidents. A challenge of this magnitude cannot be undertaken by each agency on its own. They need help. That is where the CDM program comes in. By authorizing CDM in law, DHS and its agency partners can confidently move forward to bolster Federal network security. By requiring the Department to revisit its implementation plans and work to finally resolve its longstanding CDM challenges, H.R. 6443 puts the program on an even more secure footing. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my friends across the aisle, Ranking Member THOMPSON  and Congressman LANGEVIN , for their support of this bill. I would like to thank the ranking member of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Protection Subcommittee, Mr. RICHMOND , for cosponsoring this bill. Mr. Speaker, this is, very simply, commonsense legislation that will strengthen our Nation’s cybersecurity posture and thereby strengthen our Nation’s national security. Mr. Speaker, once again, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6443, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6443, the ‘‘Advancing Cybersecurity Diagnostics and Mitigation Act’’ which codifies the Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) Program administered by the Department of Homeland Security. At a time when the computer networks of our government are under constant attack, and have suffered serious breaches in recent years, we must take action to ensure that the information of our citizens and the ability of federal agencies to carry out their duties are resilient. As a longtime advocate of a government that works efficiently for the people, it is clear that current information security practices of federal agencies are neither sufficient nor consistent. Without an honest effort to even get to obtain a view of the security state of federal networks, users, and devices, we will continue to be increasingly vulnerable. To that end, H.R. 6443 recognizes the importance of a dynamic approach that will help secure federal networks and data, as well as provide improved information on vulnerabilities and security practices across the various agencies. In particular, this measure codifies the Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) Program to which: 1. Deploys DHS sensors which perform ongoing scans for vulnerabilities and known flaws; and 2. Feed the collected data to an enterprise dashboard to provide increased insight into the information security posture of federal agencies. Without codifying this concrete measure to fortify federal networks and devices, federal agencies will remain vulnerable. While codifying the DHS CDM Program will harden the security posture of the federal government, we are still suffering from a shortage of workers with the requisite skills in this area. To address this, I have introduced the Cyber Security Education and Federal Workforce Enhancement Act (H.R. 1981), which would address our cyber workforce shortage by establishing an Office of Cybersecurity Education and Awareness within DHS which will focus on: 1. Recruiting information assurance, cybersecurity, and computer security professionals; 2. Providing grants, training programs, and other support for kindergarten through grade 12, secondary, and postsecondary computer security education programs; 3. Supporting guest lecturer programs in which professional computer security experts lecture computer science students at institutions of higher education; 4. Identifying youth training programs for students to work in parttime or summer positions at federal agencies; and 5. Developing programs to support underrepresented minorities in computer security fields with programs at minorityserving institutions, including Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanicserving institutions, Native American colleges, AsianAmerican institutions, and rural colleges and universities. Mr. Speaker, government agencies and the private sector alike continue to struggle to identify the motivations and methods behind a cyberattack and, in many cases, lack timely information on tactics and techniques hackers are using. Despite this, the White House has eliminated the position of Cybersecurity Coordinator from the National Security Council. This occurred even after Federal Risk Determination Reports found that communication of threat information within agencies is also inconsistent, with only 59 percent of agencies reporting a capability to share threat information to all employees within an enterprise so they have the knowledge necessary to block attacks. Federal agencies are not taking advantage of all available information such as threat intelligence, incident data, and network traffic flow to improve situational awareness regarding systems at risk and to prioritize investments. For this reason, earlier this Congress, I introduced H.R. 3202, the ‘‘Cyber Vulnerability Disclosure Reporting Act’’, which was passed by the full House and is now in the Senate. H.R. 3202 requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit a report on the policies and procedures developed for coordinating cyber vulnerability disclosures. The report will include an annex with information on instances in which cyber security vulnerability disclosure policies and procedures were used to disclose details on identified weaknesses in computing systems or digital devices at risk. The report will provide information on the degree to which the information provided by DHS was used by industry and other stakeholders. I would also like to recognize the University of Houston, which has been recognized by the Department of Homeland Security and the National Security Agency as a Center of Academic Excellence for the programs in cybersecurity and cyber defense. In closing, Mr. Speaker, I urge all members to join me in voting to pass H.R. 6433, the ‘‘Advancing Cybersecurity Diagnostics and Mitigation Act’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. RATCLIFFE ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6443, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
MARITIME BORDER SECURITY REVIEW ACT Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 5869) to require the Secretary of Homeland Security to conduct a maritime border threat analysis, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows:

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New York (Mr. KATKO ) and the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. THOMP SON) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. b1730 
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5869, the Maritime Border Security Review Act, sponsored by the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico (Miss GONZA´LEZCOLO´N), my friend and colleague. With increasing focus on the threats at the southwest border, we must be mindful that our adversaries can and will adapt as they seek to gain entry into our homeland. As illicit pathways are squeezed on the southwest border, the Nation’s maritime border is a likely alternative route for our adversaries to utilize. The brave men and women of the United States Coast Guard are responsible for patrolling our Nation’s maritime border, conducting counterdrug and migrant interdiction operations, as well as search and rescue missions to ensure the safety and legitimacy of travel and trade in the maritime environment. The Coast Guard also interdicts and often rescues migrants who are attempting to reach the United States not only from the Caribbean and Latin American region but, as recent cases have indicated, from countries outside the Western Hemisphere, including China, India, Pakistan, and Jordan. Cocaine is one of the most highly trafficked drugs throughout the maritime border, especially in the transit zone, a 7millionsquaremile area that includes the sea corridors of the western Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, and the eastern Pacific Ocean. I know that firsthand from the time I spent for 2 years in the mid nineties prosecuting international drug organizations in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The Coast Guard interdicts thousands of pounds of cocaine every year; though, according to the DHS Office of Inspector General, only about 8.2 percent of the total cocaine flow through the transit zone was interdicted in fiscal year 2017. Unfortunately, we currently do not have the resources to turn back or interdict all the threats in the maritime environment. To make matters worse, the devastating effects of the 2017 hurricane season diminished local law enforcement operational capabilities and resources available to combat maritimebased threats in the U.S. territories, putting further strain on our Federal law enforcement agents and officers. Many of the hurricaneaffected areas are still not back to prehurricane conditions. Under this environment, by the time a threat reaches our coastal waters, it is too easy to slip into the country and often too late, from a law enforcement standpoint, to intercept that threat. H.R. 5869 requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to conduct a threat analysis of the greater U.S. maritime border, to include the territorial waters of Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands as well as the transit zone. The bill requires the examination of terrorist and criminal threats posed by individuals and groups seeking to enter the U.S. through the maritime border. The bill also requires the Secretary to identify vulnerabilities in law, policy, and cooperation between State, territorial, and local law enforcement, and it asks the Secretary to review the impact of the geographic challenges of the maritime border and of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, and Nate on general border security activities related to the maritime border. The Maritime Border Security Review Act is a necessary and timely piece of legislation, and I want to thank the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico for introducing it. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to join me in supporting H.R. 5869, and I reserve the balance of my time. 
COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION AND  INFRASTRUCTURE , HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , Washington, DC, September 4, 2018. Hon. MICHAEL T. M CCAUL, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, Washington, DC. DEAR CHAIRMAN MCCAUL: I write concerning H.R. 5869, the Maritime Border Security Review Act. This legislation includes matters that I believe fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. In order to expedite floor consideration of H.R. 5869, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure will forgo action on this bill, including seeking a sequential referral. However, this is conditional on our mutual understanding that forgoing consideration of the bill does not prejudice the Committee with respect to the appointment of conferees or to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject matters contained in the bill or similar legislation that fall within the Committee’s Rule X jurisdiction. Finally, should a conference on the bill be necessary, I ask that you support my request to have the Committee represented on the conference committee. Please place a copy of this letter and your response acknowledging our jurisdictional interest in the Congressional Record during House Floor consideration of the bill. I look forward to working with the Committee on Homeland Security as the bill moves through the legislative process. Sincerely, BILLSHUSTER , Chairman. 
COMMITTEE ON HOMELAND SECURITY , HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , Washington, DC, September 4, 2018. Hon. BILLSHUSTER , Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Washington, DC. DEAR CHAIRMAN SHUSTER : Thank you for your letter regarding H.R. 5869, the ‘‘Maritime Border Security Review Act.’’ I appreciate your support in bringing this legislation before the House of Representatives, and accordingly, understand that the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure will not seek a sequential referral on the bill, to the extent it may have a jurisdictional claim. The Committee on Homeland Security concurs with the mutual understanding that by foregoing a sequential referral of this bill, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure does not waive any jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this bill or similar legislation in the future. In addition, should a conference on this bill be necessary, I would support a request by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure for conferees on those provisions determined to be within its jurisdiction. I will insert copies of this exchange in the Congressional Record during consideration of this bill on the House floor. I thank you for your cooperation in this matter. Sincerely, MICHAEL T. M CCAUL, Chairman. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5869, the Maritime Border Security Review Act. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5869 would require the Department of Homeland Security to conduct a threat analysis of the maritime border. The bill directs the threat analysis to identify terrorist and criminal elements looking to enter the U.S. through, or exploit vulnerabilities of, our maritime border. Further, H.R. 5869 directs DHS to identify improvements to mitigate such threats. In carrying out this analysis, DHS is directed to look at vulnerabilities in law and policy that hinder border security and other criminal efforts along the maritime border. It is important to note that the bill limits the scope of the legal and policy analysis provisions to maritime security and, as such, has no relationship to the Jones Act. In the current climate where we have a President who repeatedly threatens to shut down the Federal Government if Congress fails to provide funding to build a wall along the southwest border that candidate Trump repeatedly told would be paid for by the Mexican Government, it is easy to lose sight of the fact that border security concerns more than the U.S.Mexico land border. I commend the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico for reminding us of the need to secure maritime borders and seaports. Cargo volume is up. In fiscal year 2017 alone, U.S. Customs and Border Protection processed $2.39 trillion in imports. This translates into our ports of entry processing more than 28.5 million in imported cargo containers. Seaports are critical infrastructure that drive our economy. As such, it is critical that DHS stay abreast of the maritime security threat picture. To that end, I support H.R. 5869, the Maritime Border Security Review Act, and urge my colleagues to do the same. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from Puerto Rico (Miss GONZA´LEZCOLO´N). Miss GONZA´LEZCOLO´N of Puerto Rico. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman KATKO for leading this effort today. I want to thank the chairman of the committee and Ranking Member THOMPSON for supporting this bill. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on behalf of my bill, H.R. 5869, the Maritime Border Security Review Act. As we move to secure our borders, it is imperative that we confront the threats posed by criminal and drug trafficking organizations seeking to enter the Nation through our maritime frontier. Illicit trafficking through the transit zone, a 7millionsquaremile area, includes the sea corridors of the western Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, and the eastern Pacific Ocean. This is the transit zone. According to the Coast Guard, the total known flow of undocumented migrants attempting to enter the U.S. by maritime routes in 2017 was almost 4,800 individuals. The known cocaine flow throughout the transit zone reached about 2,700 metric tons in 2017. This bill also addresses the public safety challenges faced by Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, the only two U.S. territories located geographically within the transit zone. The United States’ Caribbean border has long been exploited as both a destination and a transshipment point for illicit drugs shipped to the mainland, endangering the lives of Americans in the two territories, but also in the continental U.S. About twothirds of the cocaine transiting the Caribbean in early 2016 was destined for the U.S., most of it being smuggled through Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. In 2017, U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers seized about 66,000 pounds of narcotics in and around Puerto Rico from drug cartels and smugglers. And let me tell you something: The CBP, or the Customs and Border Patrol, is outside the mainland. So this is the only CBP office outside the mainland operating not just in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, but our frontier with Venezuela and the whole Caribbean. The year 2017 was a record high for drug smugglers over the previous year. Last year’s devastating hurricane season disrupted interdiction efforts in the United States’ maritime border. According to the 2019 Threat Assessment from the Puerto Rico/U.S. Virgin Islands High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area, the damage inflicted by the storms severely diminished the operational capabilities of local and Federal law enforcement on both islands. The U.S. Coast Guard recently testified before the U.S. Senate that responding in force to the hurricanes meant fewer resources for drug interdiction and border protection. They also admitted that, despite their best efforts, they have struggled to keep up with the volume of illicit traffic due to a shortage of planes, ships, helicopters, and resources, further highlighting the needs at our maritime border. H.R. 5869 would help us better understand these and other challenges the United States faces along its maritime border by requiring the Secretary of Homeland Security to conduct a detailed threat analysis of the region. These assessments must include the terrorism and criminal threats posed by those seeking to enter the U.S. throughout the maritime border; improvements needed at all U.S. seaports to reduce criminal activity; and all vulnerabilities in law that prevent effective border security, similar to those recently released in the Northern Border Threat Analysis of 2017 that were approved by the House of Representatives. The Secretary of Homeland Security must consider technology and personnel needs, the role of State and local enforcement in border security activities, the geographic challenges of the region, and the impact of last year’s hurricanes on general border security activities. 
Protecting and ensuring the safety of the American people both on the mainland and in the territories is very important not just for me, but for all of us, and should be one of our priorities. An assessment of the threats posed at our Nation’s maritime border will help us achieve just that. The reason behind this bill is to promote that kind of analysis. I want to thank Chairman MCCAUL, Ranking Member THOMPSON , and Congressmen KATKO and P ERRY for their leadership in assisting and moving forward this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5869. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I have no speakers on this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I will be prepared to close in a moment, but I do want to follow up on a couple of remarks from my colleague from Puerto Rico. I served there as a Federal organized crime prosecutor in the mid1990s in San Juan, and during that time I saw firsthand how much of a vulnerability the maritime areas have of the United States in general, but Puerto Rico in particular. The HIDTA report, which refers to the high intensity drug trafficking report, talks about severely diminished capabilities for law enforcement post hurricane. But that doesn’t begin to describe what really goes on down there. When I first walked into the U.S. Attorney’s Office in 1996 in Puerto Rico, there were about five or six major fast boats lined up in a parking lot that had been seized. They were seized because of large shipments of cocaine coming across the water directly from Colombia, which is only about 500 nautical miles away. These boats could go anywhere within Puerto Rico. It doesn’t have to come to a port. It can pull up to shore anywhere and offload whatever contraband they are trafficking. Certainly any one of those boats carried millions upon millions of dollars of poison that were going into drug users in this country, but they could easily be carrying terrorists. Once they get into Puerto Rico, you are in the United States. That is what people have to understand. Once you are in the United States, there is more customs scrutiny. So getting it into Puerto Rico, St. Thomas, or the Virgin Islands, or other territories of the United States, and not knowing what those vulnerabilities are is a serious gap in our security in this Nation. We did a similar threat assessment of the northern border, and it was very illuminating to see how much the northern border is wide open and how much of a threat it actually is. I would venture to guess that what we will see from this report when it is issued is much more eyeopening. It is a vulnerability in the world where people don’t want us to survive as a democracy and, instead, want to impose terroristic views on our society. It is incumbent we pass this bill to get the full scope of the extent of the threat. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, in the current climate, it is easy to lose sight of the fact that border security encompasses land, air, and maritime borders. Maintaining situational awareness along our maritime borders and in the transit zone can be a daunting task for the U.S. Coast Guard and Customs and Border Protection, given the vastness of the maritime domain. H.R. 5869 will position DHS to better understand what additional resources are required to protect our maritime ports and borders. Given that the measures before us were authored by the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico, I would be remiss if I didn’t take this moment to acknowledge September 20 will mark a year since Hurricane Maria upended the lives of millions of Americans living in Puerto Rico. b1745 The death and destruction caused by this category 4 storm was compounded by the Trump administration’s flat footed, weak, and slow response to the suffering. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  a piece published by The New York Times this past weekend entitled ‘‘Don’t Give Trump a Pass on Puerto Rico.’’ 
[From the New York Times, Sept. 1, 2018] DON’TGIVETRUMP A PASS ON PUERTO RICO 
FANTASTIC JOB LAST YEAR HANDLING HURRI CANE MARIA . BUT THE REVISION OF THE  
DEATH TOLL , TO NEARLY 3 ,000 FROM 64 , SAYS  
DIFFERENT  (By Mekela Panditharatne) The wind and rain began lashing New Orleans in the early hours of Aug. 29, 2005, while President George W. Bush was on vacation at his ranch in Texas. As the levees buckled and water poured into the city, the federal government tarried. Later, Hurricane Katrina’s long pall—the more than 1,800 related deaths, the devastation and the slow federal response—would come to haunt Mr. Bush’s presidency, cratering his approval rating. President Trump, who has overseen his own hurricane crisis after last year’s storms in Texas and Puerto Rico, has largely escaped the presidencydefining censure that dogged Mr. Bush after Hurricane Katrina. Last week, Puerto Rico’s government increased the island’s official death toll, estimating that 2,975 people died as a result of the hurricane and its effects—up from the tally of just 64 that had been the official count until then. Nearly one year after the storm hit, we now know that Hurricane Maria may be among the deadliest natural disasters to occur in the United States in a century. So why the pass for President Trump? Mr. Trump’s scandalplagued presidency has benefited from a deliberate pattern of diversion and the deep executive dysfunction he has created in the federal government. Under his tenure, the president has given the impression it is not the White House’s job to coordinate with federal agencies and that by extension, he does not own his agencies’ failures. This shouldn’t stand. The scope of the administration’s negligence is reflected in a report released by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in July. FEMA said the agency ‘‘had thousands fewer workers than it needed’’ and that many of those it had weren’t qualified to take on a catastrophe of this scale. The report also states that the agency took longer than expected to secure supplies and lost track of much of the aid it delivered. An investigation by Politico found that FEMA provided roughly a third of the meals, half as much water and a small fraction of tarps to Puerto Rico than it provided to Texas after Hurricane Harvey in the first nine days after the storm. Several weeks elapsed before FEMA and the Defense Department increased their presence on the island, even though airports and ports had reopened after a few days. The agencies failed to direct the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln and other ships to Puerto Rico to aid with the response. Mr. Trump remained largely out of the picture. No president in recent memory has upended internal executive branch norms so much. In immigration, military and other matters, major executive orders have been introduced by the Trump administration without consulting with his cabinet. Agency heads have been caught off guard when policies affecting them are put into motion. The robust interagency exchange that typically characterizes complex decisions has atrophied. All of this makes it easy for Mr. Trump to escape blame for his agencies’ missteps. But this isn’t normal. In an unwieldy bureaucracy, pressure and highlevel oversight from the White House ensure that disaster response does not fall by the wayside. Where agencies are illequipped to handle the on theground devastation and local authorities cannot fill the void, presidential leadership assumes greater import. The Trump administration has additionally taken actions that may set back Puerto Rico’s recovery. The funding request the White House sent to Congress last November drew condemnation from both Republicans and Democrats for being too low. The administration gave Puerto Rico little choice but to adopt an experimental funding formula to rebuild its public infrastructure. The formula gives Puerto Rico flexibility during the rebuilding process but requires the island to pay for any cost overruns, putting it at risk of being on the hook for costly receipts down the road. To make matters worse, last Thursday a federal judge ruled that Puerto Ricans who have been living in motels and hotels on the mainland as part of FEMA’s temporary housing aid after Hurricane Maria have to check out on Sept. 14, possibly rendering many of them homeless. Going forward, Mr. Trump must ensure that his agencies focus attention and resources on the resilient, sustainable rebuilding of the outdated power grid and on restoration of the water infrastructure and health care system in Puerto Rico to buttress the island against future disasters. If not, it’s up to us, as fellow Americans, to hold him to task. The image of Mr. Trump lobbing rolls of paper towels to a crowd last October in Puerto Rico, arms arched, mimicking a basketball player, should rank high in the pantheon of presidential slipups. It brings to mind another iconic image—Mr. Bush surveilling Hurricane Katrina’s wreckage in New Orleans, from Air Force One. Mr. Trump has defied many dogmas in politics. But the abnormal executive branch dynamics that he 
has created should not absolve him from responsibility for the grave humanitarian situation in Puerto Rico. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to reclaim the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5869, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5869, the ‘‘Maritime Border Security Review Act,’’ which directs the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security to submit a report on DHS’s maritime border threat analysis based on the work that the agency is doing to secure the border. During the markup of this legislation by the Committee on Homeland Security, a Jackson Lee amendment for this bill was adopted. This Jackson Lee Amendment requires a review of the metrics and performance parameters used by the Department of Homeland Security to evaluate maritime security effectiveness. This amendment will provide a report on the data that is required by this bill’s report. The generation, collection, and use of data can create greater transparency on processes that can better inform our work on the Committee. Reporting requirements are an important committee oversight tool that can provide relevant information on the programs and policies authorized by Congress. The more important aspects of data collection require that the information be relevant, accurate, and consistent. The private sector is making great strides in the use of data science and big data to better understand the past and present in order to make more informed decisions that will impact the future. Data collected and used for the purposes of this bill can support data analytics for Maritime Border Security. Data analytics is the process of examining data sets in order to draw conclusions about the information they contain, increasingly with the aid of specialized systems and software. Data analytics technologies and techniques are widely used in commercial industries to enable organizations to make moreinformed business decisions and by scientists and researchers to verify or disprove scientific models, theories and hypotheses. The Jackson Lee amendment supports data analytics for the maritime border threat analysis the bill will provide to the committee. I urge my colleagues to vote for the passage of H.R. 5869. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. KATKO ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5869, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. FITNESS INFORMATION TRANSPARENCY ACT OF 2018 Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 6374) to require the Department of Homeland Security to streamline Federal contractor fitness determinations, and for other purposes, as amended.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New York (Mr. KATKO ) and the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. WATSON  COLEMAN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. 
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 6374, the Fitness Information Transparency Act of 2018, otherwise known as the FIT Act. This legislation seeks to improve how the Department of Homeland Security vets the character and conduct of contractor employees, known as a fitness determination. Homeland Security relies on thousands of contractor employees every day to achieve its missions. From IT work to construction and janitorial services, Homeland Security and contractor employees work hand in hand to secure our Nation. With the department’s unique mission of protecting the homeland, it is vital that everyone working for Homeland Security, be it a Federal employee or a contractor employee, is appropriately vetted to ensure that he or she will uphold the integrity of the department. However, Homeland Security’s fitness determination process is bureaucratic in the worst ways: inefficient, inconsistent, and lacking transparency. Currently, the Office of Personnel Management sets minimum fitness standards for all Federal contractors. However, each Homeland Security component can apply the criteria differently, creating disparate standards across the department. For example, a contractor employee who has been deemed fit to work for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, may not automatically be deemed fit to work for Customs and Border Protection. Many contract personnel support a variety of Homeland Security components and may be required to receive separate fitness determinations from each component, creating duplicity and inefficiency. Such inefficiency not only delays the time a contractor employee can start providing necessary services to Homeland Security, but because the contracting company builds the lag time into the bid price, this process also increases the cost to Homeland Security and, ultimately, to the United States taxpayers. This legislation will require Homeland Security to consolidate its varying fitness standards by creating uniform fitness requirements for each position risk level. By doing so, Homeland Security will achieve department wide uniformity and reciprocity of fitness standards, therefore eliminating the need for one contractor to undergo multiple fitness investigations. The FIT Act also reduces bureaucratic redundancies by allowing, when appropriate, the Secretary of Homeland Security to deem someone who possesses a security clearance to also be considered fit to work for Homeland Security. Moreover, this legislation increases transparency into the fitness determination process by requiring Homeland Security to publish the uniform fitness standards, provide monthly status updates to contractor representatives, and report certain information to Congress. It is important that Homeland Security vet each and every contractor employee prior to working for the department. The FIT Act provides Homeland Security the flexibility it needs to vet contract workers for its diverse missions, while also making the process to do so more efficient and more transparent. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to join me in supporting H.R. 6374, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6374, the Fitness Information Transparency Act of 2018. H.R. 6374 would require the Department of Homeland Security to issue uniform standards to vet Federal contractors seeking to work for the department. Currently, there is no standard for vetting contractors to determine their fitness to access DHS facilities, IT systems, and sensitive information. Each 
component has different standards, different procedures, and different adjudicators for contractor fitness. Lack of a departmentwide uniform standard hinders reciprocity across the department. As a result, the committee has received testimony that contractors who work for multiple DHS components are investigated over and over and over again. What a waste of time and resources. Today, DHS contractors routinely wait 3 to 4 months, if not longer, to be investigated, regardless of whether they have already been determined to be fit by another DHS component. This wait time is costly for not only the contractor, but it also hinders the ability of the Department of Homeland Security to execute its mission. Today, neither the contractor nor their employer is regularly informed of the status of their investigation. Enactment of H.R. 6374 would help ensure that Federal contractor firms can access timely information regarding the status of their employees’ fitness investigations. Thanks to language that was authored by Representative CORREA and accepted in committee, H.R. 6374 also recognizes that weaknesses in DHS fitness processes not only undermine the onboarding of Federal contractors in a timely way but also the onboarding of new DHS employees. Representative CORREA ’s amendment would require the department to take steps to improve the suitability determination process for Federal applicants and appointees and to report on the degree to which components and offices are granting reciprocity to individuals who are employed by other components or offices within the DHS. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this measure. H.R. 6374 improves the Department of Homeland Security’s contractor investigation process by requiring a uniform set of standards, encouraging reciprocity among components, and enhancing communication between the department and the private sector. It is our duty as Members of Congress to ensure processes are followed and that such processes are effective and efficient. H.R. 6374 seeks to do just that. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 6374, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I echo the sentiments of my good friend and colleague from New Jersey. I once again urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6374, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6374, the ‘‘Fitness Information Transparency Act of 2018,’’ or the ‘‘FIT Act,’’ which will streamline federal contractor fitness determinations for receiving and maintaining contract awards for the Department of Homeland Security. This bill will standardize the fitness standards for contractors for the Department of Homeland Security that reflect employability standards to ensure contractors meet public trust obligations relating to the work they will do on behalf of the American people. During the Homeland Security Committee markup of H.R. 6374, an amendment I offered was adopted. The Jackson Lee Amendment improves the FIT Act by establishing an ‘‘Exigent Circumstances Fitness Determination Review’’ process. The Jackson Lee Amendment provides that ‘‘The Chief Security Officer may conduct an immediate review of a contractor employee’s fitness determination when a contractor employee has engaged in violent acts against individuals, property, or public spaces based on the contractor employee’s association with persons or organizations that advocate, threaten, or use force or violence, or any other illegal or unconstitutional means, in an effort to prevent others from exercising their rights under the Constitution or laws of the United States or of any State, based on factors including, at a minimum, race, religion, national origin, or disability.’’ In July 2018, news reports surfaced that Northrup Grumman had business with a government contractor who employed Michael Miselis, an active member of the California based Rise Above Movement (RAM), a well known violent white supremacist group. RAM’s membership has deep roots in California’s racist skinhead movement and the violence of RAM members has been a hallmark of the group and its members. The AntiDefamation League describes RAM as a white supremacist group whose members believe they are fighting against a ‘‘modern world’’ corrupted by the ‘‘destructive cultural influences’’ of liberals, Jews, Muslims and nonwhite immigrants. RAM members consider themselves to be part of the ‘‘Alt Right’’ and operates like a streetfighting club. RAM members actively train to do physical battle with their ideological foes, and have been involved in violent clashes during political rallies and demonstrations. Mr. Miselis had a security clearance and worked for Northrup Grumman, a major defense contractor, at the time he engaged in physical violence against persons protesting racism and white supremacy in Charlottesville, Virginia. In May 2018, Northrup Grumman was informed of Mr. Miselis’ membership in RAM and the violent assaults he initiated while he was in Charlottesville participating in activities in support of white supremacy, which were captured on video and in photos. Mr. Miselis worked for a government contractor and held a security clearance authorizing him to work on projects that were of vital interest to our nation and its defense. Northrup Grumman did not dismiss him until the story broke earlier this month with media reports on the violence Mr. Miselis engaged in at the white supremacists’ rally held in Charlottesville, Virginia. Mr. Speaker, the United States is a nation of laws, which gives us the freedom to agree, and most importantly disagree, with not only each other, but with our government. But the limitations on the right to express political views was best described by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., who said: ‘‘The right to swing my fist ends where the other man’s nose begins.’’ There is a limit to the expression of free speech and the freedom to assemble and that limit is violence. The awarding of security clearances to contractors must be better managed and the consequences for involvement in activities that would be cause for dismissal from the armed services or any federal agency should not go unnoticed. The Jackson Lee Amendment makes the clear statement to DHS contractors that the awarding of contracts that involve the security of our nation should not be taken lightly and that the allocation of federal funds to contractors who employ persons who advocate or participate in acts against persons on account of their race, creed, religious beliefs, or gender who engage in constitutionally protected activities will not be tolerated. For these reasons, I support H.R. 6374 and urge my colleagues to support this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. KATKO ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6374, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY CHIEF DATA OFFICER AUTHORIZATION ACT Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 6447) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to establish the position of Chief Data Officer of the Department of Homeland Security, and for other purposes, as amended.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New York (Mr. KATKO ) and the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. WATSON  COLEMAN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. 
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6447, the Department of Homeland Security Chief Data Officer Authorization Act, sponsored by my colleague, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CARTER ). In today’s datadriven world, organizations like the Department of Homeland Security generate, collect, and maintain enormous quantities of data in carrying out their daytoday operations. Unfortunately, data continues to be underutilized as an asset by organizations, especially in the Federal Government, largely as a result of poor internal data management and governance practices. To address these shortcomings, the private sector and Federal, State, and local entities have increasingly begun appointing the position of chief data officer to their management teams. Such a position would work to improve data management and governance at an organization in order to format data for better analysis and use. The work conducted by chief data officers can help organizations achieve operational efficiencies, improve policy insight and decisionmaking, achieve data interoperability across legacy IT systems, and increase transparency. To date, several entities within Homeland Security, including Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, have designated chief data officers. Recognizing this growing trend, H.R. 6447 authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with Homeland Security’s chief information officer, to designate a Homeland Securitywide chief data officer. The chief data officer is tasked with overseeing policies to manage, organize, and format Homeland Security data in order to better carry out data analysis for use in departmental operations. Additionally, H.R. 6447 requires the heads of all Homeland Security operational components, in consultation with the chief data officer and component chief information officers, to appoint componentlevel chief data officers. Homeland Security is charged with the responsibility of keeping our homeland and its citizens safe. As such, it is imperative that Homeland Security possess the capability and capacity and tools to make informed decisions in today’s rapidly evolving threat environment. The appointment of chief data officers at the department and its components is integral to providing Homeland Security with the tools to make datadriven decisions in the 21st century. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6447, the Department of Homeland Security Chief Data Officer Authorization Act. H.R. 6447 would require the Department of Homeland Security to designate a chief data officer for the department. This official would be responsible for coordinating the organization and integration of data across the department for improved analysis and decisionmaking. DHS generates, collects, and maintains vast quantities of data, but has difficulty uniformly analyzing it because of its inconsistencies in how data is collected and maintained throughout the department. b1800 The chief data officer would serve as the lead official for coordinating internal data processes to achieve data and interoperability across DHS systems. Importantly, H.R. 6447 includes language authored by the Representative from Florida (Mrs. DEMINGS ) to delegate responsibility for overseeing the Data Quality Act to the chief data officer. Under the Data Quality Act, Federal agencies are required to issue guidelines to maximize the quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of information, including statistical information they disseminate. Additionally, the law requires agencies to establish mechanisms for persons to correct data that does not comply with guidelines. At this time, when truth is under assault, it is critical that there be vigilant watchdogs to help ensure that information provided by the Department of Homeland Security is accurate. With that, I encourage my colleagues to support this measure. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CARTER ). Mr. CARTER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding. I rise today on behalf of H.R. 6447, the Chief Data Officer Authorization Act. This bill designates the chief data officer to increase transparency and to ensure best practices are implemented throughout the DHS. My bill is the culmination of listening to my constituents and DHS employees along the border regarding transparency, communication, and oversight issues at the Department of Homeland Security. Every day 240,000 employees at DHS go to work to ensure the security of our Nation. Many of these men and women are under intense pressure to identify efficiencies and do more with less. This bill answers their request for help in managing and sharing information to protect the homeland. I have also heard from my constituents who are concerned about government transparency. I truly understand the need to keep the public informed on how their government is working for them. This bill is in answer to those concerns. This bill also ensures Members of Congress receive the answers and the 
data they need to effectively perform our constitutional oversight responsibilities. I echo the sentiments of many of my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation. Today is a big step forward for the American people. This bill ensures DHS does not fall behind other government agencies as we increase transparency for those we serve. I urge my colleagues to support the passage of this bill. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I have no speakers on this bill, and I am prepared to close. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers. If the gentlewoman from New Jersey has no other speakers, I am prepared to close once she does. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to be here with my friend, Mr. KATKO , and I am prepared to close. Mr. Speaker, enactment of H.R. 6447 would help improve DHS’ ability to integrate and analyze data and ensure the reliability of the data it disseminates. Further, it would help ensure that Congress is provided timely and accurate data to facilitate effective oversight. As such, I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 6447. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I agree with my colleague and friend from New Jersey. It is always a pleasure to work on bills with her because there is always very good bipartisan spirit. I think that is something that is lost often in this Chamber. I am happy to support this bill. It is commonsense legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. KATKO ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6447, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
MOTION TO INSTRUCT CONFEREES ON H.R. 6157, DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2019 Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1 of rule XXII and by direction of the Committee on Appropriations, I have a motion at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion. The Clerk read as follows: 
Mr. Cole moves that the House take from the Speaker’s table the bill, H.R. 6157, with the Senate amendment thereto, disagree to the Senate amendment, and request a conference with the Senate thereon. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Oklahoma is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, this is a necessary step to continue to move the fiscal year 2019 appropriations process forward under regular order. On June 28, the House passed H.R. 6157, the FY 2019 Defense Appropriations bill by a vote of 359–49. The Senate took up that bill and added the LaborHHS Appropriations bill and has now sent H.R. 6157 back to the House. With the appointment of these conferees, the House and the Senate may begin to resolve the differences with the goal of passing H.R. 6157 before the end of the fiscal year. As such, I strongly support this motion. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the motion. The previous question was ordered. The motion was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to instruct at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion. The Clerk read as follows: 
Ms. DeLauro moves that the managers on the part of the House at the conference on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the Senate amendment to the bill H.R. 6157 be instructed to agree to division B (relating to appropriations for Labor, Education, and Health and Human services) of the matter proposed to be added by the Senate amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 7 of rule XXII, the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DELAURO ) and the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Connecticut. 
Ms. D ELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Connecticut? There was no objection. Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, we have unfortunate circumstances. We do not have a bill that the majority has brought up for consideration, the LaborHHS appropriations bill, as I believe it is our duty. I will remind everyone that this bill was twice delayed in the markup for LaborHHS, so we are trying to make the best of a bad situation. Meanwhile, the Senate has passed a LaborHHSEducation bill. The Senate bill is not perfect. In fact, there is much to improve, but it provides a foundation for conference negotiations between the House and the Senate. The House bill, unfortunately, despite an increase of $18 billion in nondefense spending, the House Labor HHSEducation bill is held to level funding. Out of a total increase of $18 billion, the LaborHHSEducation bill should receive an increase of about $5.5 billion, and yet we received a zero increase, and Chairman COLEhas heard me say this over and over and over again. This allocation means that the House bill includes no new investments in the Child Care and Development Block Grant, nor new funding to help students afford a postsecondary education. The House bill also eliminates funding for family planning and teen pregnancy prevention programs, as well as health and safety grants. It even cuts funding for community health centers by $100 million, and the list goes on. In addition, the House LaborHHS Education bill is loaded with ideological poison pill riders, including riders to block funding for the Affordable Care Act, block funding for family planning, block funding for Planned Parenthood clinics, and it adds new riders to protect Monsanto and to allow religious discrimination in child welfare services. However, there is one crucially important issue that is addressed in the House bill that must be included in the final conference report. That is the President’s manufactured crisis at the border. I speak, of course, of family separation, which has inflicted terrible trauma on children, their parents, grandparents, siblings, aunts, and uncles. The administration’s policy of separating families is child abuse. Experts have sounded the alarm on the lasting damage that we are doing to these children. Parents are the buffer. With them, the children can endure incredibly stressful circumstances. Without them, the children are at risk of lasting mental and physical damage, and they are suffering these wounds at our hands. Now, months and months later, approximately 500 children who were separated from their families remain in HHS custody. For most of these children, their parents were deported, and HHS has been unable to reunify these families, and unfathomably, may never be able to reunify them. The administration has tried to pass off responsibility of reunifying these families to third parties like nonprofits. It is unconscionable. In the House bill, Democrats advanced the first congressional action to address this manufactured crisis. The full committee, I might add, on a bipartisan basis, adopted 12 amendments. These amendments must be retained in the final conference report. These amendments, to discuss them very briefly, did a number of things. They expressed the sense of Congress that families should not be separated and that families should be reunited immediately. They required HHS to provide Congress a plan for swift reunification, to provide regular reporting, and to ensure the agency and its partners are upholding the highest standards with regards to care and privacy. 
Family separation is not the only crucial element of the conference committees. Student safety must also be paramount, and thus, it is also important to address the issue of guns in our schools. Arming teachers is not the answer to school shootings, and it is outrageous that Secretary DeVos would even consider using taxpayer dollars on such a dangerous proposal. If the Trump administration actually wants to keep students safe, it should allow the Federal Commission on School Safety to consider the role guns play in school violence, support funding for gun violence prevention research at the CDC, and fully fund the Student Support and Academic Enrichment Program to provide more mental health services and bullying prevention programs in our schools. The Secretary has said she has no intention of weighing in on whether funds can be used or cannot be used to arm teachers. However, she should say that this money is not there for guns in the classrooms. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, we must make the best of a bad situation. Republicans are not operating under regular order and abdicating our responsibility as the House of Representatives. Yet, as we proceed, we need to ensure that we advance the best policy under the circumstances. I believe that we should have had the House LaborHHS bill come before the floor of the House. I urge my colleagues on the conference committee to keep these priorities in mind as they work toward a final bill. The American people deserve nothing less. They are already getting too little. Let us not forget that our obligation and duty is to give people a better chance at a better life. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. b1815 Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to instruct conferees. As the House and Senate come together to find a path forward on funding the Federal Government, we will, no doubt, be faced with tough choices and fierce disagreements. But we agree that these two bills, funding the Department of Defense and funding the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, are two of the most important bills that we handle and, frankly, the two largest as well. They deserve thorough consideration and fair discussion amongst the conferees. We are all committed to getting this done and getting this done right. As we are currently doing with our first package of appropriations bills, this conference committee will negotiate fairly and respectfully to reach a final agreement on funding these critical Defense and LaborHHS programs. I want to remind the body that, of course, we have done this before. We have begun in different places, and, to my friend’s credit, we have worked together, have found common ground three times in a row, and have been able to support the final bill. It certainly would be my hope that we are able to do that again. So I just want people in the conference committee to feel free to bring up any topics that they think are important, and that we have a free and full discussion, and, hopefully, work ourselves to a resolution. I urge my colleagues to reject the motion to instruct conferees, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. LOWEY ), the ranking member of the Committee on Appropriations. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the motion to instruct conferees to reject the rightwing House LaborHHSEducation appropriations bill and, instead, support the Senate’s bipartisan compromise. The LaborHHSEducation bill funds some of the most important priorities for our country. It helps meet the needs of Americans at every stage of their lives. With this legislation, Congress funds childcare programs, Head Start, Pell Grants, job training, community health centers, NIH research, Social Security, Meals on Wheels. Yet, instead of robustly supporting these priorities, House Republicans have shortchanged all of these critical endeavors. Despite an $18 billion overall increase in the budget cap for nondefense discretionary spending, the House’s fiscal year 2019 LaborHHSEducation appropriations bill does not include a single dime of additional funding. House Republicans have found $5 billion to pay for President Trump’s wasteful border wall, yet they apparently cannot allocate anything to strengthen America’s schools; help families afford college; ensure workplace safety; or expand quality, affordable healthcare. In fact, the policy provisions in the bill directly attack many of these priorities. Their riders sabotage the Affordable Care Act, threatening the health of tens of millions of Americans with preexisting conditions, and increasing costs for American families. This Republican bill undermines women’s healthcare by eliminating Title X family planning, prohibits millions of women from choosing Planned Parenthood as their preferred healthcare provider, and attacks the dignity of LGBT families. The American people, my friends, deserve better than this partisan bill. The Senate has done good work, bipartisan work, to provide additional resources for the LaborHHSEducation bill, while avoiding the kinds of right wing riders that make the House bill completely unacceptable. I urge my colleagues to vote for this motion. Reject House Republicans’ misplaced priorities and extreme attacks on American families. Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT), the ranking member of the Committee on Education and the Workforce. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the motion to instruct, but also to call for the inclusion of one specific improvement to the LaborHHS appropriations bill that makes it clear that taxpayer money cannot be spent to arm teachers. Two weeks ago, news reports revealed the Department of Education was considering allowing States to use Federal education funding to purchase firearms and firearms training for teachers. The Department has since confirmed those reports. Last week, I was joined by 172 Members of the House to call on Secretary DeVos to issue formal guidance prohibiting the use of taxpayer money to put guns in classrooms. In response, the Secretary said she has no intention of taking any action on this issue. In refusing to act, the Secretary is setting a new and dangerous policy. That is, the Secretary is allowing funding provided under Title IVA of the Every Student Succeeds Act to be used to arm teachers. This move by the Secretary is unprecedented, as Federal funding has never been allowed for this purpose. Secretary DeVos has pointed the finger at Congress and expressly called on us to clarify our intent, but congressional intent is already clear. Under the law, the Student Support and Academic Enrichment Grant Program authorized under Title IVA affords local leaders the flexibility to tailor investments to meet local needs. It was designed to support a wide range of programs to help schools create a better learning environment by expanding students’ access to important services like mental healthcare, art, and STEM classes, and new technology that better prepares students for the future. However, when writing and enacting the law, Congress never contemplated such flexibility allowing the purchase of firearms. In fact, Congress denounced the presence of firearms in schools in a section in ESEA that promotes programs that foster ‘‘the creation and maintenance of a school environment free of weapons.’’ Mr. Speaker, Congress’ opposition to taxpayerfunded guns in schools was reiterated in the STOP School Violence Act, which the House passed last March in the aftermath of the Parkland, Florida, shooting. This legislation, which passed 407–10, explicitly prohibits the program funds from being used for the purchase of firearms or firearms training. Even the Department of Homeland Security under Secretary Nielsen has acted through executive authority to prohibit grant funds specifically intended for school security from being used to purchase guns. Secretary DeVos has both the authority and the responsibility to follow legal precedent, congressional intent, 
as well as common sense about gun violence by prohibiting taxpayerfunded guns in schools. But seeing as the Secretary is shirking that responsibility, Congress must take immediate action to protect students and teachers from a policy that will recklessly endanger students and teachers. The final version of the LaborHHS appropriations bill must make clear that no taxpayer money can be used to arm teachers. This has not been a partisan issue in the past and should not be a partisan issue today. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close if my friend is prepared to close. Ms. DELAURO. It is my understanding, Mr. Speaker, that the gentleman needs to yield back, and then I close. Mr. COLE. Correct. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I want to begin by thanking my friends. They always bring interesting points to the floor, particularly the ranking member of the full committee, but also my friend Mr. SCOTT. I just want to assure them that, when we sit down to bargain, we will bargain in good faith, and all these things will— and I think appropriately should be— on the table and open for a fair discussion. I do point out to the body that, frankly, when we have done this before, we have been able to find common ground and been able to arrive at a final solution that had substantial bipartisan support for the last 3 years. I am confident that we can do that again this year and, frankly, it is very much my hope that we can do it before the end of the fiscal year. I think that is important that the domestic programs that we fund in the LaborHHS bill, which my friend, the ranking member of the subcommittee, so ably advances and defends, that we do that without having a continuing resolution, something that interrupts the progress. That is even more important in the area of defense, that we avoid a continuing resolution. So I think there will be considerable goodwill on both sides and a considerable effort to come together in common ground. Having said that, I continue to oppose instructions to the committee because the conferees have proven before they can work together to produce a product. It is my hope that we will be able to do that. So I urge the body to reject the effort to instruct the conferees, and I invite my friends, as I know they will, to sit down in good faith to work with us to arrive at a bill that both sides of the rotunda and both parties can support in substantial numbers. I look forward to that process with my good friend the ranking member from Connecticut and, obviously, with my good friend the full committee ranking member as well. I have every confidence that, working together in good faith, as we have in the past, we will get to a place that we both can be pleased with, if not perfectly satisfied with. Mr. Speaker, I urge rejection of the instruction, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. In closing, let me again urge the House conferees to look at the Senate LaborHHS bill as a base for improvement, and I mean seriously to improve it. I ask them again to please pay close attention to the priorities that we have outlined here today. The work of the LaborHHS bill has always reflected our priorities as a Nation, helping to provide services that meet our most basic needs, our health, our children’s education, and the scientific research that uncovers the cures of tomorrow. These are challenges that only the Federal Government has the ability, the capacity, and the resources to help us meet. The central problem of the House bill is that it fails to meet that threshold. The American people are tired of Congress spending trillions in tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans while telling families and working people that we simply do not have the resources to invest in things that impact their daily lives. We can make those investments, but only if we make them a priority. I want to say to the chairman of the subcommittee, to Mr. COLE, that we have been able to bargain in good faith over the last several years, and that ought to be our goal in this effort, so that we can meet the mission of what this LaborHHS bill has at its core. It is about the people of this country and meeting their needs. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. BARTON ). All time for debate has expired. Without objection, the previous question is ordered. There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to instruct. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it. Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New York (Mr. KATKO ) and the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. WATSON  COLEMAN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. 
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 6265, the PreCheck is PreCheck Act of 2018. The name of this bipartisan legislation demonstrates my belief that the Transportation Security Administration should use its PreCheck screening lanes at airport checkpoints as they were originally intended. This bipartisan bill codifies a solution to a longstanding frustration that I and others have reiterated to TSA on many occasions: PreCheck lanes should not be used as tools to manage congestion for passengers in an airport. Instead of employing a onesizefitsall approach to passenger security screening, the concept underlying TSA’s PreCheck program is one of riskbased security. This should, when applied as intended, save taxpayer dollars and result in an enhanced security checkpoint experience for all travelers. However, the stated benefits of the PreCheck program have been consistently undermined by TSA’s practice of moving unvetted passengers into PreCheck lanes for the sake of expediency. I have said it before and I will say it again: Security cannot be sacrificed for expediency. This legislation will require TSA to ensure that only travelers who are members of trusted traveler programs are permitted to use PreCheck security screening lanes at TSA checkpoints throughout the country. To address the issue of passenger throughput, H.R. 6265 also provides a framework for TSA to expedite screening for passengers who have been determined to pose a lower risk to aviation security. The effects of this legislation will be farreaching. By restoring the PreCheck program to its original purpose, passengers who have elected to participate will experience a shorter checkpoint process they were promised when they first enrolled in the program. Additionally, passengers will be more incentivized to enroll in a trusted traveler program when it is working as it should. To achieve TSA’s stated goal of enrolling 25 million passengers by the end of 2019, restricting PreCheck expedited screening lanes to vetted, enrolled passengers is a necessity. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member of the subcommittee, my friend, the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN ), for cosponsoring this bill and for her leadership on this issue. I also thank my good friend Congressman KEATING for his bipartisan support of this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this act, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6265, the PreCheck is PreCheck Act of 2018. Mr. Speaker, in 2011, the Transportation Security Administration launched the PreCheck program to expedite vetted, known travelers through airport checkpoint screening. Today, TSA PreCheck is in more than 200 airports nationwide, improving security by allowing TSA to focus resources on the passengers it knows the least about who may pose a higher risk to the aviation system. While PreCheck has generally proven popular with passengers, there is a concern that TSA has strayed from the program’s original intent. In an effort to manage checkpoint wait times, TSA has pushed travelers who are not enrolled in PreCheck into expedited screening lanes. While I recognize that large crowds of passengers waiting at checkpoints could pose a security risk, the way to prevent long lines is to staff checkpoints sufficiently, not to abuse the availability of expedited screening lanes. H.R. 6265 seeks to address this issue by requiring that PreCheck lanes be used only by trusted travelers, with limited exceptions. It also requires TSA to pilot a risk modified screening concept under which a new level of screening, somewhere between PreCheck expedited screening and standard screening, could be provided to passengers who TSA deems to pose a lower risk to security. b1915 Finally, this bill pushes TSA to grow participation in the PreCheck program by providing more innovative and convenient enrollment opportunities for passengers. This bill is a result of bipartisan work and builds upon legislation that the Committee on Homeland Security ranking member, Mr. THOMPSON , advanced in the last Congress; and it is my delight to work with the current sponsor of this bill, Mr. KATKO , as we move forward to ensure that traveling passengers are always safe. I thank Mr. KATKO for his collaboration on this bill. Mr. Speaker, in closing, Members on both sides of the aisle have been frustrated by not only TSA’s use of PreCheck lanes to address wait times, but its failure to make significant progress in improving PreCheck enrollment opportunities. Enactment of H.R. 6265 should help TSA achieve its original vision for the PreCheck program. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I want to echo the sentiments of my colleague from New Jersey, the gentlewoman, Mrs. WATSON  COLEMAN . She is exactly right. This program is not being used like it is supposed to be used. The idea of PreCheck was to have a known, trusted traveler program, a traveler program where someone walks through and gets a different level of scrutiny because you know enough about them in advance. When you put people through that same lane and they get a different level of scrutiny that they shouldn’t have because you don’t know about them, it entirely defeats the purpose of the bill. With terrorism what it is today and the zest to try to attack our aviation industry, it is not a time we should be cutting corners to manage traffic. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN is exactly right. We need to have more people staffing these lanes, and we need to have a better running of the PreCheck program itself. If they did those two things, then we would be okay; but we cannot cut corners when it comes to security, especially in the aviation sector. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6265, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. KATKO ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6265, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New York (Mr. KATKO ) and the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. WATSON  COLEMAN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. 
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6461, the TSA National Deployment Force Act, sponsored by my good friend and the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Transportation and Protective Security, Mrs. WATSON  COLEMAN . TSA security operations happen 365 days per year at nearly 440 federalized airports. Our Nation depends on the professionals at TSA who are on the front lines every single day to keep our transportation systems moving and secure. In testimony before the committee, Administrator Pekoske has stated that TSA’s greatest assets are its people, and I could not agree more. Transportation security officers are tasked with a zerofail mission, and their dedication to duty is what helps keep traveling Americans secure when they fly within our civil aviation system. With a strengthening economy, passenger volume has surged over the past few years and is expected to go much higher in the years to come, and TSA has often struggled to accommodate massive traveler volume increases at checkpoints. However, one of the most practical, useful, and helpful tools in TSA’s toolbox, the National Deployment Force, helps TSA alleviate long lines at airport checkpoints, providing both a national security value by minimizing public area security risk and providing efficiency by reducing passenger wait times. This legislation authorizes the National Deployment Force, or NDF, within TSA to provide rapid and efficient response capabilities. The NDF is comprised of transportation security officers who may be deployed across the country to supplement existing TSA staffing during periods of high seasonal demand, natural disasters, national special security events, or other scenarios requiring additional security screening support. Recently, the NDF has provided critical screening support for largescale events requiring additional security, such as the Super Bowl and in the wake of Hurricane Harvey. Given the anticipated increases in passenger growth, this bipartisan legislation will help ensure that TSA has the resources 
it needs to quickly respond to influxes in passenger volume at specific airports. I am proud to cosponsor this bipartisan legislation with my good friend and colleague from New Jersey to authorize a National Deployment Force and help make TSA the agile agency the American people expect and deserve. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6461, the TSA National Deployment Force Act. Mr. Speaker, the Transportation Security Administration maintains a National Deployment Force, or NDF, a volunteer force made up of transportation security officers who are deployed to various locations across the country in support of TSA’s homeland security mission. Today, the TSA Administrator is able to deploy this force to respond rapidly to operational challenges at more than 440 airports where TSA conducts security operations. Maintenance of this operational capability would not be possible if TSA did not maintain a robust federalized screening workforce. TSA deploys the NDF to address hiring difficulties, seasonal demands, severe weather conditions, and periods of relief and recovery following a natural disaster or other major incident, as well as to support securing national security events, again, such as the Super Bowl and national political conventions. In particular, the NDF was critical to ensuring TSA could continue to operate fully in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy after that storm devastated my region of the country. Notably, TSA has called upon the NDF to fill staffing gaps at airports where private screening companies operating under TSA’s screening partnership program are unable to hire enough officers. My bill authorizes the NDF to ensure its work continues and directs TSA to report to Congress on the NDF’s activities to ensure proper oversight. Because officers serving on the NDF often go above and beyond, leaving their homes and families on short notice, my bill authorizes TSA to consider service in this force as a positive factor when evaluating applicants for promotions within TSA. The NDF is a critical component of TSA’s homeland security efforts, and I urge my colleagues to support this measure. Mr. Speaker, in closing, in recent years, we have seen TSA face a wide array of challenges, including complex threat streams, lengthy wait times, and the need to reopen airports quickly after natural disasters. The NDF provides TSA with the operational flexibility it needs to maintain the security of our country’s transportation systems in the face of these challenges. Mr. Speaker, I thank my partner on the Transportation and Protective Security Subcommittee, Mr. KATKO , as well as my other colleagues for their support, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6461. I agree with the comments of my colleague from New Jersey, and I think that this commonsense legislation will give TSA more flexibility and more elasticity in facing the ongoing challenges with staffing issues at airports, especially during peak travel times. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. KATKO ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6461. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
DHS COUNTERING UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS COORDINATOR ACT Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 6438) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to establish in the Department of Homeland Security an Unmanned Aircraft Systems Coordinator, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows:

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. PERRY ) and the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. WATSONCOLEMAN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Pennsylvania? There was no objection. Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6438, the DHS Countering Unmanned Aircraft Systems Coordinator Act. In 2016, the Federal Aviation Administration estimated that there were 1.9 million consumer unmanned aircraft systems vehicles, commonly known as drones, in the U.S. This number is expected to grow to a staggering 4.3 million by the end of 2020. The increased availability and expanded use of drones has led to concerns over the potential risks to national security. Drones provide malicious actors both a robust aerial delivery mechanism for potentially hazardous payloads and anonymity in carrying out an attack. 
This threat is not just imaginary. Known incidents involving drones have included weaponized use by ISIS and cartels, smuggling operations, intrusions at NFL and Olympic stadiums, and damage to electrical grid infrastructure in Canada. Several DHS offices and components assess drone threats and are members of interagency and industry drone working groups which promote information sharing, research, and joint problemsolving initiatives. However, DHS currently does not have a centralized, departmentwide official responsible for the coordination of counter drone policies and activities. H.R. 6438 authorizes the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security to designate a countering unmanned aircraft systems coordinator at the Department to serve as the lead DHS official for coordinating counterdrone threat planning policies and plans. H.R. 6438 enables DHS to centralize the coordination of counterdrone threat planning efforts under one official. Under H.R. 6438, the countering UAS coordinator is responsible for coordinating with relevant DHS components on the development of policies and plans to counter threats from drones. The countering UAS coordinator promotes the research and development of counterdrone technologies within the Department and ensures that information and guidance regarding drone threats is disseminated across the Department as appropriate. The coordinator will also serve as the principal Department official responsible for disseminating information to the private sector regarding DHS counterdrone measures and will ensure that DHS counterdrone activities are carried out in accordance with Federal laws. H.R. 6438 is an important and timely piece of legislation that seeks to further prepare the Department in carrying out its duties in countering this emerging threat. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to join me in supporting H.R. 6438, and I reserve the balance of my time. 
COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION AND  INFRASTRUCTURE , HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , Washington, DC, September 4, 2018. Hon. MICHAEL T. M CCAUL, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, Washington, DC. DEAR CHAIRMAN MCCAUL: I write concerning H.R. 6438, the DHS Countering Unmanned Aircraft Systems Coordinator Act.

In addition, should a conference on this bill be necessary, I would support a request by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure for conferees on those provisions determined to be within its jurisdiction. I will insert copies of this exchange in the Congressional Record during consideration of this bill on the House floor. I thank you for your cooperation in this matter. Sincerely, MICHAEL T. M CCAUL, Chairman. 
b1930 Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6438, the DHS Countering Unmanned Aircraft Systems Coordinator Act. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6438 directs the Department of Homeland Security to have a designated official to coordinate the Department’s unmanned aircraft systems, or UAS, plans and policies. The countering UAS coordinator would work with Department components and offices to ensure testing, evaluation, or deployment of systems to identify, assess, or defeat a UAS threat are in compliance with applicable Federal laws. The coordinator would also serve as the principal Department official responsible for disseminating information to the private sector regarding counterUAS technology. In homeland security circles, there is broad recognition that UAS technology enhances capabilities to, among other things, deliver disaster relief to affected areas and surveil weak spots along the southwest border. At the same time, Mr. Speaker, today, there is considerable concern regarding the security threats that UAS may pose. More and more, we hear of instances where unmanned aircraft systems, commonly referred to as drones, are used for nefarious reasons, such as smuggling operations or to conduct surveillance to evade law enforcement. The threat was underscored last month when a drone was used in an unsuccessful assassination attempt on the life of the Venezuelan President as he spoke at a massive military parade. As such, I support DHS organizing itself to better address this emerging homeland security threat, as set forth in H.R. 6438. There is increasingly more concern regarding the potential threats that UAS may pose to the security of our Nation and its people. Last Congress, when I served as the ranking member of the Oversight and Management Efficiency Subcommittee with Mr. PERRY , we worked together on legislation that I drafted to address the UAS threat. Since that time, the range of threats associated with UAS has grown more complex and demand that DHS prioritize counterUAS efforts in an unprecedented way. Designating an official to coordinate Department counterUAS plans and policies is a step in the right direction. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. PERRY ) for his work on this measure, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from New Jersey. She has been a leader on this issue, and it is something that is important to both of us and to our country. I applaud her efforts and thank her for her support of these efforts. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6438, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. PERRY ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6438, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
UNITED STATES PORTS OF ENTRY THREAT AND OPERATIONAL REVIEW ACT Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 6400) to require the Secretary of Homeland Security to conduct a threat and operational analysis of ports of entry, and for other purposes, as amended.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. LESKO ) and the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. WATSON  COLEMAN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Arizona. 
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Arizona? There was no objection. Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the United States has over 300 official ports of entry, ranging from land border ports along our southern and northern borders to international airports in major metropolitan cities, to seaports ranging from the Great Lakes to coastal cities. While each port facilitates trade and travel that keeps our economy humming, each has their own unique security challenges to prevent illicit activity. That is why it is imperative that we know the vulnerabilities and operational needs at each and every port in order to properly protect our homeland from threats and exploitation. I introduced this bill because our country’s ports are long overdue for a comprehensive review. My bill requires the Department of Homeland Security to do a full threat and operational analysis of these vulnerabilities and create a strategy and implementation plan to prevent human trafficking, illicit drugs, illegal contraband, and transnational criminal activity at our air, land, and sea ports of entry. The bill also works to improve the flow of commerce that is vital to our economy. We need to not only think about the security of our ports, but also the infrastructure and operational needs as well. Ports of entry continue to be a preferred location for transnational criminal organizations and drug smugglers to transport illicit drugs and contraband into the United States. In fact, between October 1, 2010, and March 31, 2018, Customs and Border Protection conducted more than 84 million nonintrusive inspection examinations, resulting in more than 19,000 narcotics seizures and $79 million in currency seizures. Many U.S. ports of entry were built 40 to 50 years ago. Therefore, they were never designed for post9/11 security measures, technology, or increased volume of traffic. These infrastructure constraints magnify the threats at our ports of entry and manifest themselves as long lines and bottlenecks that strain Customs and Border Protection’s ability to properly vet all incoming traffic. In addition, long lines and wait times delay trade and cost the U.S. economy millions of dollars every year in lost productivity. This is why my bill’s required analysis will look over current and potential threats, methods, and pathways used to exploit security vulnerabilities and improvements needed to improve illicit drugs and other contraband from crossing our border. Following the analysis, my bill directs the Department of Homeland Security to create a strategy and implementation plan to address the threats and operational inefficiencies identified. We need to fix these problems. We need to take action. Our ports must be brought into the 21st century. I am pleased by the support I have received on this legislation, and I specifically want to thank Chairman BRADY  of the House Ways and Means Committee and Chairman MCCAUL of the House Homeland Security Committee for working with me to bring this bill to the floor. Modernizing our ports of entry is just one step in securing our border. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to join me in supporting H.R. 6400, and I reserve the balance of my time. 
COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS , HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , Washington, DC, August 31, 2018. Hon. MICHAEL T. M CCAUL, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, Washington, DC. DEARCHAIRMAN MCCAUL: I write to you regarding H.R. 6400, the ‘‘United States Ports of Entry Threat and Operational Review Act.’’ The Committee on Ways and Means has jurisdiction over this bill and an additional referral was granted to the Committee on Homeland Security. The Committee on Homeland Security ordered this bill favorably reported. Because of the extensive communication regarding the policies contained in the bill, the Committee on Ways and Means is willing to waive formal consideration of the bill so that it may proceed expeditiously to the House Floor. Please note that by waiving formal consideration of the bill, the Committee on Ways and Means is in no way waiving its jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in those provisions of the bills that fall within your Rule X jurisdiction. I will include a copy of our letters in the Congressional Record during consideration of this legislation on the House floor and would support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate number of conferees on any HouseSenate conference involving this legislation. Sincerely, KEVIN BRADY , Chairman. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON HOMELAND SECURITY , Washington, DC, September 4, 2018. Hon. KEVIN BRADY , Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, Washington, DC. DEAR CHAIRMAN BRADY : Thank you for your letter regarding H.R. 6400, the ‘‘United States Ports of Entry Threat and Operational Review Act.’’ I appreciate your support in bringing this legislation before the House of Representatives, and accordingly, understand that the Committee on Ways and Means will not take further action on this bill. The Committee on Homeland Security concurs with the mutual understanding that by foregoing consideration on this bill at this time, the Committee on Ways and Means does not waive any jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this bill or similar legislation in the future. In addition, should a conference on this bill be necessary, I would support a request by the Committee on Ways and Means for conferees on those provisions within your jurisdiction. I will insert copies of this exchange in the report on the bill for H.R. 6400. I thank you for your cooperation in this matter. Sincerely, MICHAEL T. M CCAUL, Chairman. 
Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6400, the United States Ports of Entry Threat and Operational Review Act. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6400 would require the Department of Homeland Security to conduct an analysis of the threats and operations at all United States air, land, and sea ports of entry. Following the completion of the threat analysis, H.R. 6400 requires the Department to produce a strategy and implementation plan to mitigate such threats. The strategy and implementation plan must include consideration of improvements needed at the ports of entry to reduce wait times and facilitate the lawful movement of trade, travel, and people. This bill is modeled after the Northern Border Security Review Act, which was signed into law in 2016. Most of what is required in this measure is already being done by the Department. What H.R. 6400 would do is bring together various mandated materials into one report. The Department should be able to carry out this new mandate in a way that is not duplicative of other efforts. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 6400, a measure that directs DHS to take a holistic approach to protecting our ports of entry, vital gateways for trade and travel. Speaking of the need for a holistic approach to homeland security, I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge that the Department’s Quadrennial Homeland Security Review is 247 days overdue. Pursuant to section 707 of the Homeland Security Act, the Department is required to produce this overarching strategy every 4 years. As the author of the Quadrennial Homeland Security Review Technical Corrections Act of 2017, a measure aimed at improving the quality of future reviews that is pending in the Senate, I strongly believe that DHS needs to do a better job of prioritizing its vast array of homeland security mission areas. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6400, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. LESKO ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6400, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
ANNUAL DISTRICT BUS TOUR (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, each August, I conduct a bus tour of South Carolina’s Second Congressional District with my wife, Roxanne, and dedicated staff from all offices. This year, I especially appreciate scheduler Emily Saleeby for the very meaningful agenda. It was humbling and inspiring to meet with constituents and visit 22 locations, from small businesses and schools to local chambers of commerce and large employers. I had the opportunity to thank employees for their service, and I observed firsthand the extraordinary success of jobs created by President Donald Trump’s tax cuts, promises made, promises kept. Many of the businesses were multigenerational success stories, such as Shumpert’s IGA, which has been in operation for four generations and is currently led by Frank Shumpert. We also visited with newer companies that thrive, like Tidewater Boats of Lexington, which started in 2006 and is currently in the top 10 of saltwater boat manufacturers in the Nation with the leadership of Jimmy Metts and Chris Martin. I was grateful for the opportunity to receive, personally, questions, concerns, and input from citizens on the bus tour. In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. Thank you, Congressman MADELEINE  BORDALLO , for your remarkable achievements, your loving devotion for the families of Guam, and your tireless bipartisan support of a strong national defense. MADELEINE BORDALLO is a living legend of effective service for the people of Guam. 
b1945 ISSUES OF THE DAY The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from California (Mr. GARAMENDI ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, before I launch into the major subject matter of this evening, I want to call attention to the horrific fires that have occurred in California over the last month. It is extremely early in the fire season. Normally, fires of the size that we have seen in California during the month of August occur in late October/ November. Climate change is real, and what we are seeing is a 365dayayear fire season in California. In my own district of Lake County, the largest fire ever in California’s history is still burning, mostly under control, but it will probably burn for another month until the rains come. Just to the north, in the Redding, California, area, more than 1,000 homes were lost and 4 people lost their lives. We saw last year the huge fire that occurred in southern California, in the Santa BarbaraVentura County area, followed by horrific mudslides that, again, claimed the lives of dozens of people. My heart goes out to all the victims of the fire, and my gratitude, along with the gratitude of the communities of California, goes out to the brave firefighters and first responders who met the challenge of these very fast moving, very, very dangerous fires. It should bring to the attention of all Americans the need for us to address 
the new issues that confront our Nation as a result of the everwarming climate and, also, the need for this Congress to carry on what is now in place in law, and that is to allow the U.S. Forest Service to have two accounts: one account for fighting fires and a separate account for managing the forests. The health of our forests is in doubt. As one of my colleagues often says, we can take the trees out in an orderly way and remove some of the vegetation, providing the necessary firebreaks and forest thinnings, or it will come out in a fire. Now, if I might, Mr. Speaker, go to the other subject matter that I would like to spend a few minutes on. I often start my Special Order hours with some words from a very well known American, a fellow who had four terms as President of the United States. If you haven’t figured it out already, it would be FDR. In the past, as I have used this to set the tone and to set the value of my conversation, or the values of my conversation, I didn’t really appreciate how pertinent these words would be here in September, the day after Labor Day, of 2018. So I want to draw your attention to what FDR said in the 1930s. He said: ‘‘The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little.’’ I want to say that again, because this really should be our goal. It should be the principle value of our legislative process here. ‘‘The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little.’’ So, what to make of this. Yesterday was Labor Day, a tradition that goes back to the 1880s, when there was a real crisis, when there was child labor, where there were no workplace safety laws, where there was the advent of what became known as the robber barons and the era of the golden few. Yesterday, Richard Trumka, the president of the AFL–CIO, wrote an op ed laying down some thoughts that all of us ought to pay attention to. He said that working people are crying out for change that would bring about a political system that lifts up our voices, an economy that treats us fairly, and a society that values labor. He also said a few other things. He said: ‘‘For decades, corporate interests have been hellbent on chipping away at our most fundamental rights and freedoms. They have corrupted our public institutions and rigged the economy to work for the few at the expense of the many.’’ Well, it seems as though he may have been channeling FDR, and it wouldn’t surprise me that he would. In December, Congress passed and the President signed the largest tax scam in America’s history. Our friends on the Republican side sold the tax bill to the American public as relief for middleincome families. President Trump went further to say that working families could expect a $4,000 to $7,000 raise due to the lowering of tax burdens on companies. I should repeat that: President Trump said that working families could expect a $4,000 to $7,000 raise due to the lowering tax burden on companies and corporations. Hmm. Let’s test those words. Let’s test those words against what has happened since December of 2017 when the largest tax scam in the Nation’s history actually passed. So, what have the workers of America found? The Bureau of Labor Statistics in the Department of Labor has shown that workers’ real wages, accounting for inflation, have decreased slightly since the signing of the tax bill. This means that the average worker’s salary buys less today than it did before December 2017. By the way, that tax bill cost the Federal Treasury, that is, reduced the tax receipts to the Federal Treasury, by nearly $2 trillion over the next decade. Well, not the next decade. We are now 9
1⁄4years ahead. Two trillion dollars. All that sold on the premise that the wages for working Americans would increase. No. Didn’t happen. Not likely to happen. There were some modest increases in wages, but they have been negated, wiped out, by rising inflation. Since the great recession of 2009 and ’10, there really was real wage growth, adjusted for inflation, every year until the current year. Now, undoubtedly, there are some here in Congress—and perhaps the President—who would point out that some corporations have actually used their windfall for employee bonuses. Let’s just take a look at what that windfall is. Yes. Here it is. Well, I’m afraid this number is wrong. We now know it is actually going to be close to a $2 trillion reduction in taxes. So where is it going? Well, let’s see. Mr. Speaker, 83 percent of all of that near $2 trillion winds up in the hands of the top 1 percent and American corporations. Everyone else can share 17 percent of that number, $2 trillion. So, how many Americans saw a windfall as a result of the tax cut, as promised by the President, the $4,000 to $7,000 bonus coming to you as a result of the tax bill? Well, there are 155 million employees in America, doing every conceivable kind of work, including some of the folks here in the dais behind me. Only 6.8 million of the 155 million actually received wage increases or bonuses since the passage of the tax scam. Their 5.9 million employers, a very generous 411 of the 5.9 million employers, provided their employees with a bonus or a significant wage increase. Publicly traded companies across America are spending 101 times more money on stock buybacks, $712 billion in the first 8 months of 2018, than employee raises or bonuses, which are $7.1 billion. Shall I say that again? Probably ought to. Publicly traded companies have spent $712 billion on stock buybacks and $7.1 billion on bonuses and raises. Interesting. The New York Times reported on this on July 13, and the headlines read, ‘‘Paychecks Lag as Profits Soar, and Prices Erode Wage Gains. Corporate profits have rarely swept up a bigger share of the Nation’s wealth, and workers have rarely shared a smaller one.’’ I suppose, if I wanted to play economist, I would put up something like this: How is corporate America spending their tax cut, the Trump tax cut? Well, here you have—oh, this was April. This blue line, that was April. In April, corporate stock buybacks were $238 billion, in April of 2018. We are now in September. That was April. Mr. Speaker, $238 billion in stock buybacks, $6.5 billion for bonuses and wage increases. We are now in September, 4 months later, and stock buybacks are $712 billion, a number that I said just a moment ago; and wages and bonuses have increased $7.1 billion. Half a trillion dollars. A half a trillion dollars of the stock of the tax cut has been spent, increased, from April to September. No doubt in everybody’s mind why the stock market is roaring ahead. There has been $712 billion spent on buying back stocks since January 1, 2018. That is threequarters of a trillion dollars. No wonder the stock market is roaring ahead. Unfortunately, the wages of Americans have actually, in real dollars, declined. b2000 A few other things for those of you who like to play economist. You have to love these graphs. The employee pay as a share of the national income, in 1970, it was about, I don’t know, 66
1⁄2 percent of the total wealth of the total national income that was for wages. Here we are in 2018, and it has fallen to 62 percent. Well, how about corporate profits as a share of national income? Well, in 1970, it was down here around 9 percent of the total national income that was corporate profits. Here we are in 2018, and it is 13 percent. We would say that would be wonderful for corporations, if somehow that corporate wealth would actually be shared with employees. Now you can kind of understand why Mr. Trump was so agitated on Labor Day yesterday when he was talking about income inequality. There is one other way to see this, and let me put this up. This is corporate tax rate, individual and corporate income taxes as a percentage of all the Federal revenue. That is all the tax revenue the Federal Government collects. Well, let’s see, way back in 1934, about 10 percent. Both corporate and individuals paid about the same 
amount, and that went on until 1939, 1940, and then it began to shift. In that period of time, since the 1940s, early 1940s, until today, corporate taxes, as a share of the burden of taxes paid in America, has declined from 40 percent in 1939—that was the build up to World War II—to, well, somewhere down around 7.8 percent today. Pretty good for corporations. Pretty good for people who own stock. Who does own stock? Eightyfour percent of U.S.traded stock is owned by the top 10 percent of Americans. Whoa, now that is an interesting statistic. So the stock market roars as more and more of the tax cut is poured into stock buybacks, and the benefit goes to the top 10 percent of Americans. We ought to pay attention to that. Oh, by the way, individuals have continued to pay more and more of the total burden of funding our Federal Government. All of this is a result of tax policy over time. So what are we going to do about this? Before I go to what we are going to do about it, let me just pick up one more thing. Do you remember all the talk about bringing American corporations back to America, end the offshoring? Surely, you remember that. Well, I remember the talk here on the floor. The great tax bill is going to end the offshoring of American jobs. We are going to Make America Great Again. We are going to bring American corporations back home. Well, it didn’t happen. Why didn’t it happen? Well, because the way the law was written, there is actually greater incentive today to offshore jobs than there was prior to the great tax scam of December 2017. American corporations can actually have a lower tax rate by offshoring, by investing offshore. I am sure you remember the great ballyhoo about HarleyDavidson. They were concerned about the President’s tariffs and said that they were going to manufacture their motorcycles in Europe as a result of the tariff on steel and aluminum. Well, there is another known issue about HarleyDavidson. They utilized the tax break given to American corporations for offshoring jobs to open a facility in Thailand after the tax bill was passed. They laid off 800 workers in their Kansas City facility and opened a new facility in Thailand. They not only did that, but what did they do for the remaining workers in America? Well, if those workers happened to own Harley Davidson stock, I suppose they did okay, because HarleyDavidson decided to spend $700 million to buy back 15 million shares. Interesting the way in which tax policy actually works, to the benefit of whom? Hardworking American families? No. The top wealthy Americans? Yes. What did FDR have to say about all this? This isn’t ancient history. This is America today. This is America today, and we ought to pay attention to what FDR has said when he said American progress is not whether the wealthy do better, but, rather, whether the working men and women of America, the poor, the people who are struggling to put food on their table, the people who are trying to get their kids an education, trying to deal with the everincreasing cost of higher education, FDR said it very clearly when he said it is our test, that we are judged by what we do for those who have little. So here we are today. Here we are just days ahead of a new election in which this issue is going to address every American. This election is going to be about whether the policies so starkly laid out here in the tax legislation, the policies of adjusting the American wealth so that those who have much get more versus those who are working day in and day out are struggling just to stay ahead and failing to do so. There is a stark difference here in policy. Let there be no doubt that, for us, as we go into this election, we go into this election keeping firmly in mind that our task is to provide A Better Deal for the people, A Better Deal for the people of America. The wealthy have done fine. The top 10 percent are doing terrific. We are not against them, but we are for the people. We are for the working men and women of America who are trying to put food on their table, pay rent as housing prices soar, as rental rates go through the roof, working men and women in the families of America who are struggling every day just to keep up with inflation, and far too many not able to do so. Yes, there is no doubt that, in America today, the unemployment rate has dropped. Yet, there are still millions of Americans who have not been able to get into the labor market, who have not been able to adjust to the changing economy of America, who are unable to have the skills to fit into that new economy, who are on the outside. But I will tell you this: We care about them. We think it is our responsibility to care about every American, not just the wealthy, as some do in this hall, but every working man and woman and for those not able to work. So we offer A Better Deal for the people, and I am just going to lay out four specific issues in the next remaining minutes. First of all, it is about healthcare. I came to this Congress in 2009 with the determination to work for a healthcare system that provided quality insurance for every American. We made a major step toward that, not because I arrived but because the American public was crying out for a quality health insurance program. Too many Americans were on the outside. Too many people were excluded because they had a preexisting condition. Too many Americans couldn’t afford it, and more and more American companies were eliminating healthcare insurance as part of the benefits. So we, the Democrats, without one Republican vote, put forward the Affordable Care Act. And guess what? More than 20 million Americans within 3 years had insurance that wasn’t previously available to them, and it was a good insurance policy. All the while, from January 2011 to this moment, our Republican colleagues have been trying to reverse that progress. More than 60 different bills passed the House of Representatives in those years that would eliminate the basic health insurance for 27 million Americans. That was their policy. That is not ours. Our policy is to provide universal health insurance for every American. We have not given it up. We have seen erosion in the years with the new President who rails against insurance for everybody. And we see specific programs put forward by our Republican colleagues to carve away protections for those Americans who have preexisting conditions. How cruel is that? How wrong is that, that this Nation would set up a system that would remove the protection that has been in the law since 2010, the protection that insurance companies cannot discriminate in the provision of insurance because of preexisting conditions? What is a preexisting condition? For a young female, it is that she might get pregnant. Yes, they consider that a preexisting condition, being a female. You have high blood pressure? That is a preexisting condition. You had measles or chickenpox in the past? That is a preexisting condition. It goes on and on and on. I know this issue. I was an insurance commissioner elected in California to protect Californians from the abuses of insurance companies, and I saw time after time after time insurance companies discriminating, harming individuals, terminating their health insurance because they forgot to write down that they had chickenpox as a child. Now here we are in this era of Trump, this era where, once again, the majority and the President would impose upon Americans, once again, insurance discrimination. You have a preexisting condition? Good luck. We are going to fight that. As we have seen the wages of Americans stagnate under the pressure of insurance and the pressure of the tax scam, as we have seen that, we have also seen the inevitable increase in the cost of prescription drugs. Who does that hurt? The super wealthy? The 10 percenters who have done so well in the last year? Or does it hurt everyday working Americans? I will tell you this, it is our plan to put in place policies that would give the Federal Government the opportunity to negotiate prices for prescription drugs so that Medicare and Medicaid recipients don’t have to endure 
the enormous outofpocket costs associated with that and to give other Americans who are not yet of that age the opportunity to be able to get their prescription drugs at a reasonable price just as the rest of the world, or at least that part of the world that has advanced economies, is able to get. b2015 What about education? I was back home in my district, as were all the rest of us over this last month. How many times did I hear from parents whose children are about to graduate from high school, saying they can’t afford it, that they can’t afford to go to college. And if they do, they will be saddled with such student debt that they will never be able to buy a home. They will spend the first 10, 15 years of their postgraduate life paying off the student loans. This is not a small matter for Californians. This is not a small matter for citizens of every other State. It is an epidemic in America, the cost of higher education, the burden that is placed upon young men and women who are struggling to get an education, having to go out and get a student loan just to be able to continue, and then paying that off in the years ahead. It occurred to me somewhere along the way that, as I received the inevitable mail about refinancing my home mortgage, maybe students ought to be able to refinance their student loan. But, oh, no, not in America. You can refinance your home mortgage, but you can’t refinance your student loan at a lower rate? That is wrong. So I, and others, have introduced legislation that would at least allow for a refinancing of student loans at a lower rate. But that is not enough. That is just one piece of a solution to a problem that is endemic and an epidemic in America. We are going to spend $1 trillion in the next decade rebuilding every one of our nuclear bombs and our basic mechanisms to deliver those bombs. What if we spent like onetenth of that on allowing American children to get an education without being saddled with a student loan for the first 10 to 15 years of their postgraduate life, to be able to have a free community college education the first 2 years? Some States are trying to do that, New York among them. Why not the Federal Government? But, oh, no. The Secretary of Education is going exactly the other direction, trying to eliminate the protections that were put in place by the Obama administration to protect students from loan scams, from bogus education programs, such as the Trump real estate education program. Did I mention that loudly enough? Such as the Trump real estate program. So his Secretary of Education wants to allow him, when he terminates his career as President, to go back and rebuild the scam that harmed thousands of Americans and, along with that, maybe many, many more. American families need to be concerned about what is going on here. For the people, are our policies for the people? I was traveling across California in my district, 200 miles one side to the other, the great Sacramento River Valley, more levees than anywhere in America, including Louisiana. The roads are filled with potholes. The levees are in need of repair. The airports are crowded. We just heard a lot about that in the previous session. The bridges are collapsing, not just in Italy, here in America. I think we have some 60,000 bridges that are in need of serious repair. I noticed one of them across the river here in Washington, D.C., under repair, and that is good for Washington, D.C. But what about, I don’t know, Missouri? What about our infrastructure? We have lead contamination in the communities of Michigan and other contamination in the water of cities in California. We have shore lines that are collapsing. We have water lines that are not working properly. American infrastructure was built decades ago and has not been repaired in the intervening years, and we have a $1 trillion backlog just to keep pace. Travel to Europe, travel to China, travel to other countries, Japan, and others, and you will see modern infrastructure, but not in America, not in America. So what are we going to do about it? I will tell you what we want to do about it on our side of the aisle. We want a real infrastructure program, not a bogus one like ones proposed earlier this year by our President, but a real, solid infrastructure program that has real money, that has the real opportunity to be able to rebuild our existing infrastructure to bring about what we have called for, for more than a decade: good repair of all of it, whether it is a water system, sanitation system, a levee, a highway, or an airport. That is what we want to do, and we want to build the infrastructure for tomorrow. We know that international trade is going to increase. Well, maybe not. Maybe I have to change that, given the trade war that is now underway, brought to us by the President. So we will see how it turns out. But right now, maybe we are not going to see an increase in international trade as tariffs are imposed. But maybe that will pass, and we will get back to fair trade, real opportunity to grow our economy by trading internationally. To do that, we are going to need better ports. We are going to need better infrastructure to move goods into and out of the ports. We need to have deeper ports. All of these are infrastructure projects. How are we going to do it? Well, I suggest that we are going to do it with a real infrastructure program that has real money. If we were to go back to one of those charts I had there that showed the share of American corporations, their share of the total tax revenues is declining, decade by decade, to the lowest level since the imposition of a corporate tax rate. We are going to try to retrieve some of the mistake that was made in the tax bill of December 2017, retrieve some of those incentives that were in the bill, replace those incentives with real legislation that encourages American corporations to bring those profits back into America. I bring to your attention a bill that Mr. LLOYD DOGGETT of Texas has put forth, a bill that would terminate the unfair, unjustified provisions of the 2017 tax bill that encourages further investment by American corporations overseas. Reverse that. Bring that money back home. If we were to pair that with another bill by Mr. DELANEY , we would see the opportunity for a real infrastructure program, setting up an infrastructure bond and banking program where we can use that money coming back into America from the kind of tax reform that Mr. DOGGETT has put forth and Mr. DELANEY has put forth to build our infrastructure, having American corporations that enjoy the benefits of this Nation pay their fair share and not hide their profits overseas, as so many have done and will do even more because of the tax program. A final point about our program, which we call A Better Deal for the People, America knows the level of corruption that is taking place here in our Nation. They hear it; they see it on television. There has never—well, ‘‘never’’ is a long time. In the memory of living Americans, there has never been such a corrupt administration as we have today: EPA Director; questions raised about the Commerce Secretary; people resigning left, right, and center, just ahead of the cops; and, of course, the President. We need to pay attention to this. It erodes the foundation of our democracy. Campaign financing, Citizens United, is allowing secret, dark money to invade our election process. We don’t know the full extent of Russian involvement. We know hacking. We know that they are out there using social media. We don’t know the full extent of foreign money coming into our election. We are not ever likely to know, under the current laws, because there is secret money allowed in our democratic process, eroding the very nature of our democracy. Maybe some of it is foreign. There is evidence that it is. Maybe—no, not maybe. We know about millions coming into the campaign. There is not a Member in this House of 435, less those who have left for various issues of corruption, not one of us wakes up in the morning without concern that secret money, millions, will be dumped into their campaign in the 65 days, 62 days until the next election. We don’t know. We can’t know. It is out there. It is wandering around out 
there, millions upon millions of dark money, secret money. It could land on any of us. Given what I have been saying about the President, it may land on me. Fine, we will deal with that. This is a problem. It is a problem for America when that kind of money buys elections, buys candidates, buys Members of Congress and more. Citizens United and all the rest needs to go. We need to know who is financing me, financing my colleagues here. We need to be able to report that so that the people can make up their minds what they want to do. I will give you one example, and then I think I have said enough for the night. There was an election in California a few years ago that had Pacific Gas and Electric, one of the major corporations, utilities—well, the largest in the Nation, trying to carve a special favor for itself, eliminating all competition. They got it on the ballot. They collected signatures, got it on the ballot. They were required, under California law, to disclose where the money came from in support of their campaign and all of the ads, all the television, all the written mailers and so forth paid for by PG&E. The opposition to this, which was basic citizen groups, said that this is wrong. There were editorials written. Maybe $20,000, $30,000 was spent opposing PG&E’s effort. It went down 2–1 for one simple reason: PG&E was required to disclose that they were paying for the ads, and people go, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. So disclosure works. Unfortunately, Citizens United and a couple of other decisions have made it impossible for the American people to know who is financing Members of Congress, Senate, President, so forth. b2030 So, here we are. A better deal for the people, healthcare, infrastructure, jobs, wages, corruption. You are going to hear a lot about this. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR ), who is joining me this evening. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, Mr. GARAMENDI , for yielding. I welcome Congressman GARAMENDI  back. Wouldn’t I know he would be on the floor the very first moments we get back here. How fortunate the citizens of California are to have elected him. I am very proud to stand with the gentleman this evening for A Better Deal for the American people. And because it has been Labor Day week and we are celebrating Labor Day this week, I thought it important to link my remarks to his, and I will be very brief. As we celebrated Labor Day this week, we recall that it actually was declared Labor Day by a Republican president back in the 1890s. So this is an historic moment by any measure, but this past weekend, the President and Republican congressional leaders in this chamber chose to criticize, to vilify labor unions and their leaders, while the Republicans have failed to deliver on a living wage for America’s workers. Wages are stuck, while many in the top 1 percent get very handsome bonuses and pay increases. And the Trump administration is actually increasing, and the record shows, job outsourcing, shipping out our jobs, by doling out, get ready for this, $50 billion in new Federal contracts to companies that continue to close down factories here and move them abroad. In fact, the President’s trade antics can’t hide the fact that with China—I remember how China feted him—can’t hide the fact that China is drowning us in imports and we can’t move an equal amount into that vast marketplace. The President actually tried to say he is renegotiating NAFTA, but it is funny that in that proposed agreement, he does end runs around the labor standards and living wage issues. More than 133,000 Americans have a certified traderelated job loss since this President took office, 133,000 people, and only 4 percent of the workers Congressman GARAMENDI talked about will receive an increase from the GOP’s big tax giveaway to the top 1 percent. So for most Americans, real wages are falling and the middle class is a dream for tens of millions of people who can’t seem to get there. Any pay raise people have earned is, in fact, now being eaten up, and I heard this at my meetings all across the district, as their costs of healthcare go up, the cost of medicine goes up, the cost of education for their family goes up. President Trump on Labor Day weekend announced that he is going to cancel pay raises for 2 million Federal workers, people who work in Homeland Security, people in our air control towers, people who are caring for the sick, people who are ministering to our veterans. How about that: cancel any cost of living. The pay increase is actually a cost ofliving increase. And for those that work in the capital city areas across our country, we know how expensive it is to live in these places. Americans’ labor history shaped the American economic dream and grew the middle class, which is what you and I want to get back to. And following our 124th national Labor Day, the power and worth of hard work is worth fighting for, it is an earned status, and we must never diminish the value of hard work or, in fact, we will lose its value completely. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Congressman GARAMENDI for being here tonight. Americans deserve a Congress and a President that gives them A Better Deal and stands up for the true value of hard work for the people, always for the people, especially when Labor Day has been celebrated for the 124th time in our Nation’s history, over a century and nearly a quarter. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman so very much. 124 Labor Days for the working men and women of America. We should keep that in mind, and certainly I know the gentlewoman will and I, and I am sure my colleagues, at least on the Democratic side of the aisle, will also. Mr. Speaker, I want to end once again with FDR: ‘‘The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much, it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little.’’ Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. f 
MICHAEL NGUYEN The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. HOLLINGSWORTH ). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. MIMIWALTERS ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. 
Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. Mr. Speaker, before I begin, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the topic of my Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from California? There was no objection. Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. Mr. Speaker, we gather here this evening to demand the immediate release of Michael Nguyen, an American citizen and Orange County resident, who has been detained by the Vietnamese government for nearly 2 months without cause. Michael, a loving husband and father of four, owns a small printing business and is actively involved in his community and church. He is a lawabiding citizen with no criminal record in the United States. Michael traveled to Vietnam on June 27, 2018, to visit family and friends. When he did not return home on July 16 as planned, his family grew worried and contacted my office. They learned through social media Michael had been imprisoned by the Vietnamese government. On July 31, the State Department was able to confirm Michael’s detainment. We now know he has been imprisoned for allegedly violating Article 109 of the Vietnamese criminal code, activities against the government. Article 109 is an arbitrary and vague charge the Vietnamese government often uses to justify baseless arrests. Michael could be held for months without formal charges as the Vietnamese government investigates. During this time, Michael will be denied access to an attorney or direct communication with his family. State Department officials are only allowed to visit Michael once a month. The Vietnamese government has refused repeated requests to provide my 
office with evidence to substantiate Michael’s arrest. In a perversion of justice, the Vietnamese legal system allows individuals like Michael to be arrested and languish in prison before its government even begins an investigation or collects evidence. Michael’s detainment is only the most recent example of Vietnam’s troubling human rights record and lack of a transparent legal system. Earlier this year, the Vietnamese government unjustly detained William Nguyen, an American citizen of no relation to Michael. I am deeply concerned for Michael’s safety and wellbeing and I demand his immediate release. Mr. Speaker, I would like to commend the Nguyen family’s strength during this trying time. I am inspired by their love for Michael and determination to bring him home. Michael’s wife, Helen, is a nurse, who works long hours with many emergency oncall days. Michael’s flexibility as a small business owner allows him to be the primary caregiver for their four young daughters. His absence is devastating the entire Nguyen family. This American family should not have to spend one more day worrying and wondering when Michael will return home. Michael’s story has touched many people. Several of my colleagues who have heard of Michael’s detainment have joined my fight to secure his release. I am grateful for their support and their willingness to join tonight’s Special Order. We will not stop until Michael is returned home safely, and will continue to put ongoing, relentless pressure on the Vietnamese government. I am committed to bringing Michael home so he may be reunited with his family, and will stop at nothing to make this happen. Mr. Speaker, now it is my privilege to yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ), a fellow Orange County resident and esteemed chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. I yield to Congressman ROYCE , representing the 39th District of California. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, let me begin by thanking the gentlewoman from California for yielding to me. And I do want to commend my colleague, MIMIWALTERS , for organizing this Special Order. I want to commend her for her tireless effort here for the release of her constituent by the name of Michael Nguyen, someone whose family I happen to know. I rise today to request that the government of Vietnam release an American citizen. If I could just share with you my observations about this situation. We are really speaking out on behalf of a U.S. citizen from Orange, California, who was detained, as the Congresswoman shared with you, on July 7. And what I wanted to share with you is he was touring Vietnam and visiting elderly relatives. I think it is a very commendable thing that he does, that he stays in touch, he tries to do this once a year, to see his elderly relatives in Vietnam. We have been informed that he is under investigation for engaging in activity against the People’s government, which in this case is a spurious charge that the Vietnamese government is using to justify an arbitrary detention of a U.S. citizen. Now, this is an individual who is deeply missed by his wife and four daughters, the youngest of whom is only 8 years old. Michael’s family has seen their entire lives turned upside down because of this senseless ordeal. Now, as I shared with you, I know the family, I know his wife, Helen, who works in healthcare in Orange County, and I can tell you what she and the daughters would tell you: This fellow is a loving husband, a doting father. The kids really enjoy his sense of humor. He is the guy that gets up, and because of his schedule as a small businessman, he is able to make breakfast for the girls every morning. He enjoys taking them to school, to the dance classes, to the sports practices. As school begins again back here in the United States, it is usually a time of excitement, but also nervousness, for young students. So our hearts especially go out to his four daughters, who are being forced to navigate the new school year without their father. While his family suffers without him at home, Michael remains detained in a Vietnamese prison. While in detention, he is provided only one meal a day and is allowed to buy a bowl of soup extra a day from the canteen. Michael is 54 years old. He cannot and should not be subjected to such treatment. It is really imperative that we speak out, because Michael could be detained for months on end. Some prisoners are held for years on these bogus charges. This situation is deplorable. Michael’s case is an egregious example of Vietnam’s troubling history of arbitrary arrest. My fear for Michael’s safety is the same fear that you have already heard Congresswoman MIMI WALTERS share with you. We do fear for his safety. We want him returned to his family here in the United States. The United States has a growing relationship with Vietnam, particularly in security and in the trade arenas. However, human rights remain a core value to us here in the United States, and we cannot separate rights, those rights, from our own ongoing engagement with the Vietnamese government. If you abuse our citizens, there will be consequences. All levels of the U.S. government should make every effort to ensure Michael returns safely to his family without delay. So here again is my request: Just allow this citizen to return back to his family here in the United States. Mr. Speaker, I very much appreciate, again, Congresswoman MIMIWALTERS  for organizing this Special Order today. Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. Mr. Speaker, I now introduce my friend from Orange County who serves on both the Veterans Affairs and Homeland Security Committees. I yield to the gentleman from California, Congressman LOUCORREA , representing California’s 46th Congressional District. Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman WALTERS for bringing this most important issue to the attention of the American public. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as well to address the issue of Mr. Michael Phuong Nguyen, an American citizen and a resident of Orange County, who is currently being detained by the Vietnamese government. As Representative ROYCE just said, we seem to be enjoying a stronger, closer relationship with Vietnam on trade and security. Then we have this contradiction, a contradiction that an American citizen is being detained. On July 7, Michael Phuong Nguyen was touring Vietnam, visiting relatives, and he was arrested. It has been almost 2 months. The charge is penal code 109, which is activity against the People’s government, yet there are no facts that have been presented, no evidence. He is being held. He has been arrested with no evidence being presented. b2045 His wife and his family, they are also personal friends of mine. I know this family. They are strong members of our community. That is why I don’t understand how Michael could have been arrested in Vietnam. I ask the Government of Vietnam to please release Michael. Please release him back to his family and to his country, the United States of America. Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I would now like to welcome Congressman ALAN LOWENTHAL , the cochair of the Congressional Caucus on Vietnam. I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. LOWENTHAL ) of California’s 47th Congressional District. Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, first, I, too, would like to thank my colleague, Representative WALTERS , for yielding and for holding this Special Order. I would also like to thank Representatives CORREA , ROYCE , LAMALFA , and GREEN for joining us. Well, we are here once again, and I am outraged. We are speaking on behalf of another American citizen, and that is really important, an American citizen who was arbitrarily detained. He was imprisoned on vague allegations by the Communist Government of Vietnam. Let’s understand who we are talking about, as has been pointed out. Michael Nguyen is a father of four daughters. He was on a trip to Vietnam with his family—really, with his friends, not so much his family but friends. When he didn’t return home at 
the end of the trip, his family frantically contacted officials. Let’s see what happened. He was taken off a bus, as he was traveling from the city of Da Nang to Saigon, by public security officials. He was then detained, imprisoned, and neither his family, and what is also important, nor the United States Government were notified until after 10 days after he was arrested. As part of an agreement between the Government of Vietnam and the United States, the Vietnamese Government must notify the United States within 96 hours if they have arrested an American citizen, which they have failed to do. Since then, we have learned very little about why Michael was detained. The government claims, the Vietnamese Government, that he posted on Facebook a plot to overthrow the government, but they have not shown us any evidence that this occurred. I have also met with Michael’s family and his wife, Helen, and they are stunned. They are hurt. They are confused. They are angry. How could this happen to an American citizen who was just visiting Vietnam? As was pointed out, just a few months ago, another American visiting this country was wrongly detained and coerced into confessing his crime for merely engaging in a peaceful protest. And that, as we have heard, was William Nguyen. He was beaten. He was placed in jail. He has been finally released and returned to America because the charges against him were also bogus. In part, he was released because a significant number of Members of Congress stood up and championed his cause. And, again, I thank Congresswoman WALTERS for leading that charge. That is exactly why we are here in Congress: to defend the rights of American citizens. Michael is yet another victim of Vietnam’s egregious human rights violations. As was pointed out, we have engaged in economic development with Vietnam. We have a closer relationship economically with Vietnam, but they have consistently violated human rights of the citizens of Vietnam or anyone who speaks out, anyone who engages in religious freedom. They are an oppressive, prosecutorial society that does not allow any dissent. As one of the cochairs of the Congressional Caucus on Vietnam, I joined with my colleagues of the caucus in support of the Vietnam Human Rights Act, which invokes sanctions per the Magnitsky Act, which not only imposes financial and travel restrictions for human rights abusers, but it also calls upon the Vietnamese Government to release those political prisoners and to stop arresting citizens who just champion human rights, freedom, and democracy. This bill that we are pushing through Congress—and this will push us further toward accomplishing this goal—would also make the sale of military equipment or services to Vietnam conditional on improvement in human rights, and this is one of the classic examples of the lack of human rights that goes on. So I call upon the Government of Vietnam to quickly close this case and return Michael Nguyen to his family. It is unconscionable that any American of Vietnamese descent or any American who criticizes the Vietnamese Government—I am not saying that Michael did, but anybody who speaks out, anyone—must fear that they are going to be arrested. If these incidents continue to occur, this is going to lead to a serious reevaluation of our economic and diplomatic relationships with Vietnam. I call upon the government to do the right thing. Michael was just visiting. He has done nothing wrong. Please release Michael Nguyen back to the United States. Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. Mr. Speaker, my next colleague is an active member on the Natural Resources, Agriculture, and Transportation and Infrastructure Committees. I yield to the gentleman from California, Congressman DOUG LAMALFA , representing California’s First Congressional District. Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Mrs. WALTERS from southern California, for leading the charge tonight on yet another example of a United States citizen being detained or arrested falsely. At this point, 59 days into the process, no actual charge has been brought against Michael Nguyen. Is this justice or is this some kind of game they are playing with our citizens that isn’t appreciated by our country and, certainly as my colleague, Mr. LOWENTHAL , was mentioning just a minute ago, that is something that, if it continues to happen, we have to continue to reevaluate our relationship with Vietnam? Now, obviously, we went through some very difficult times in the 1960s and 1970s, but we have been building on that for a long time. We want to build on that. We want to have those good relationships and good trade and all of the opportunities that make our country, as well as theirs, stronger with positive economics. But that is very difficult when you have this kind of action going on against a United States citizen where, in this country, we enjoy due process; we foster due process; we encourage that. And so for those whom we trade with, those whom we have partnerships with, those whom we want to have relationships with, we want to not only encourage that, but demand that, for the way our citizens are treated. In California, we have a very strong population of Vietnamese immigrants and people from the region who have immigrated to our State, including in my own district, who have been very enterprising and become part of the community in the few decades they have been here now. Why would we not want to continue to battle for these citizens if they are going to travel back to Vietnam for whatever purpose: tourism, business, or seeing relatives that maybe didn’t come over to the United States? So we are here tonight to demand the release of Michael Nguyen as a citizen of the United States and as a citizen of California. Michael’s family has been wondering for a long time what is going on with their loved one. It has taken weeks to find out through some kind of update as to what Michael’s status is. So we strongly, joining in with our bipartisan coalition of Members here tonight, demand General Secretary Trong and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam respect the rights of our citizens and consider again the consequences that might come should this illegal imprisonment continue or there be more like it in the future. So we will continue to work together with Congresswoman WALTERS and our Secretary Pompeo to ensure that Michael is returned to his family as soon as possible because, again, he hasn’t even been charged with anything other than being a U.S. citizen in Vietnam. It is high time that he has his rights restored and not have this be harmful to him, his family, and our relationships. Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. Mr. Speaker, my next colleague proudly represents Michael Nguyen’s family members who live in the Houston area. I now yield to Congressman AL GREEN of Texas, who represents the Ninth Congressional District. Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight as a proud American. I am proud of the country’s due process laws. In this country, you don’t go to jail indefinitely. In this country, you don’t just get picked up. In this country, you are entitled to have a lawyer upon realizing that you are being charged. I am proud to be an American. Tonight, I rise on a mission of mercy, understanding that one of our own, an American citizen, is being detained without charges, no lawyer, and little knowledge of what has happened to him. Imagine, if you will, Mr. Speaker, a wife anticipating her husband’s arrival. He is supposed to arrive at the airport with a friend on July 16. She finds out that her husband is not on the plane. She contacts the airline. They indicate that he was not among those to be on the plane. She then panics, as anyone would, and she uses every means necessary to try to ascertain what has happened to her husband. She finds out by way of social media that, on or about July 6, he was detained and that that detention is something that she can get very little information about. She is upset. She and her children are upset. They don’t know what has happened to this husband, this father. So 
they reach out to their congressional Representative—who has done an outstanding job, I might add. Congresswoman WALTERS immediately did that which is necessary to protect an American citizen. She contacted the necessary authorities, contacted the Secretary of State, contacted the Ambassador, wanted to know what his condition was, and wanted to know if he was in good health. She found out that he is okay, but has not been charged. Mr. Speaker, we, in this country, understand that when one of us is being detained unjustly, every one of us has a responsibility to do what we can to get that person released. Any American being held is something that every American is concerned about. Every Member of this House will take the position, I am confident, that an American being detained unjustly should be released immediately. So I rise tonight, Mr. Speaker, on a mission of mercy asking the Government of Vietnam to release this American citizen. He has not been charged. He has no lawyer. He has friends and family who are waiting for his return. He was there as a visitor seeing friends. This is something that he has done on previous occasions. I ask that he be released so that he may be returned to his family. In this country, we protect our own. He is one of us, and we want him back. And we want him back right away. I commend all of my colleagues for what they have said tonight, and we will shine additional light on this issue. We will not rest until he comes home where he belongs. Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. Mr. Speaker, when I told Michael’s family I would be hosting this Special Order, I asked if there was any message they wanted me to share on their behalf. I would now like to read a personal statement from the family. b2100 Michael Phuong Nguyen has been unlawfully detained for over 60 days. He longs for the comfort of his family profoundly and deserves immediate attention to return to the United States. Michael’s wife and four children urgently and desperately appeal to all Members of Congress, right now, to take actions to bring Michael Nguyen back home to his family where he belongs. All four girls are experiencing heartfelt anxiety, affecting their school and emotional wellbeing. He plays a crucial role in his four daughter’s livelihood and needs to be where his heart belongs, with his family. Our prayers are with Michael Nguyen’s family, and we want them to know we will do everything in our power to bring him home. Again, I thank my colleagues for joining me this evening to support my constituent Michael Nguyen. We will not stop working until Michael is released and returned safely to his family. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ISSUES OF THE DAY The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT ) for 30 minutes. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague, Congresswoman MIMIWALTERS , for her special order. It is a reminder again that Vietnam has not lived up to the agreement they made in Paris to end the Vietnam war. They promised they would turn over remains. They promised they would give lists of our POWs and MIAs. They lied. They didn’t do that. They still have that information. In fact, there was one year I agreed with the national Chamber of Commerce’s position on most everything, but I disagreed on a trade agreement with Vietnam because I could not vote to give some special deal to people who will not honor their agreements that lie about Americans dead and who were prisoners of war and missing in action and remains of which they know and have never disclosed. This is one more reminder that one thing we can do in this House is show courage and say we are not dealing with countries, no special deals at all, with countries that harm Americans. We need to protect our own. I am so glad that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle are calling attention to that fact, led by Congresswoman WALTERS . It is important to remember. I hope and pray that we will do the right thing here in the House. I know the President has a heart for getting Americans back when they have been improperly detained, or, in some cases, when they have been properly detained, but especially if they are being mistreated. Vietnam needs to wake up. And this House, the Senate, and the President need to make abundantly clear to Vietnam that, economically, we are going to come after you. You better let our people go. I also want to address a matter tonight. Having been a former judge, when I hear courageous judges stand up for the Constitution, or I read opinions wherein courageous, intelligent judges have taken a stand for the Constitution, it warms my heart. It inspires and encourages me. I have heard many friends in the media who have given accolades to a Virginia Federal judge named T.S. Ellis—not T.S. Eliot, but T.S. Ellis— who is the judge who is handling the case involving Paul Manafort. This is from a May 4 article by Jeff Mordock. It says: ‘‘A Virginia Federal judge Friday blasted prosecutors from the Office of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, demanding to know how decadeold bank and tax fraud allegations against former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort’’—I think he was chair for about 100 days—‘‘could relate to Russian election interference,’’ which, of course, is 2016. ‘‘’You don’t really care about Mr. Manafort’s bank fraud,’ District Judge T.S. Ellis said during a morning hearing. Judge Ellis said prosecutors were interested in pressuring Mr. Manafort because he could provide information that would lead to President Donald Trump’s ‘prosecution or impeachment.’ ‘‘At times, Judge Ellis appeared frustrated and even lost his temper with attorneys from Mr. Mueller’s team. He grilled them on how allegations against Mr. Manafort for activities’’— the copy I have ends there, but it says: ‘‘’How does bank fraud in 2005 or 2006 have anything to do with coordination with the Russian Government?’ Judge Ellis said. ‘What is really going on, it seems to me, is that this indictment is to put pressure on Mr. Manafort, but in and of itself has nothing to do with your appointment.’’’ ‘‘Judge Ellis appeared to agree with the defense, but did not issue an immediate decision. He repeatedly barraged prosecutors about their authority to pursue decadeold charges against Mr. Manafort. At one point, Judge Ellis asked how the Manafort case differed from the FBI raid on President Trump’s attorney Michael Cohen. The Cohen matter was referred by Mueller’s team to prosecutors with the Southern District of New York for investigation and possible prosecution. In contrast, the Manafort case is being handled directly by Mr. Mueller’s officer. ‘‘He then appeared to guess the prosecutor’s answer, saying the Cohen investigation did not ‘further our core effort to get Trump.’ ‘‘Later, Judge Ellis summarized prosecutor Michael Dreeben’s argument as, ‘We said what this investigation was about, but we are not bound by it, and we were lying.’ He then looked at Mr. Dreeben and said, ‘C’mon man,’ referencing a catchphrase from ESPN’s NFL pregame show.’’ Further down: ‘‘At issue in the memo is the definition of ‘arise.’ The order gives the special counsel the authority to investigate any matters that ‘may arise directly from the investigation.’ But prosecutors admitted Friday that the Manafort probe had been ongoing by the Department of Justice before Mr. Mueller was appointed special counsel. Mr. Dreeben said the charges against Mr. Manafort came because they had to ‘follow the money’ to discover Mr. Manafort’s financial records and ties to Russia through his lobbying work in the Ukraine. The comments provoked a sharp rebuke from Judge Ellis. ‘It didn’t lead to that,’ he said of the Manafort charges and Russia probe. ‘It was given to you by the Department of Justice.’’’ Well, that sounds like a courageous judge, Judge T.S. Ellis. It sounds like a judge who calls them as he sees them. But, as the saying goes, where the rubber meets the road, his courage, his constitutional conviction, took a back seat to convenience. So he got accolades for calling out the Mueller investigation for exactly 
what it is. It is unconstitutional. Mueller has taken an investigation. He was not appointed by the President. He was not appointed by the Attorney General. He was picked by the same guy who was involved in the Russia investigation of Russia’s effort to get uranium. He hired another lawyer named Weissmann who was involved in that investigation. They have all kinds of ties together. They have all kinds of reasons to cover for each other. But the fact that Rosenstein is Deputy Attorney General, the fact that he wrote a memo saying fire Comey and the President acts on that memo and fires Comey based on Rosenstein’s recommendation, or with his recommendation, and then Rosenstein uses the President’s action in accordance with Rosenstein’s memo to say that probably was obstructing justice, we need a special counsel. Are you kidding me? There has been a failure of justice and of the justice system. Federal District Judge T.S. Ellis saw that, and he commented on it. When he had the chance to use the Constitution and say enough already, justice has run amok, and Paul Manafort, probably guilty of some of the things charged here, if not all of them, but you are not the one authorized to prosecute. The DOJ already had this investigation. It did not arise because of the special counsel. But the special counsel took it over, showing, again, his lack of integrity, as well as that of Mr. Weissmann. They had limitless, basically, authority given to them, which is unconstitutional. And Judge Ellis, in his opinion, where he ran away from his courageous words in May, said, in part, in his opinion, ‘‘The intended purpose’’—and he does a good account of the 1978 law creating special counsels. He said, ‘‘The intended purpose of the 1978 act was to create a mechanism for the investigation and prosecution of highranking government officials. ‘‘In 1988, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the 1978 act despite substantial separation of powers challenges,’’ which, by the way, just because one Supreme Court says one thing, they are not 100 percent right all the time. That is why they reverse themselves frequently. But, as he pointed out, ‘‘Congress reauthorized the 1978 act for the final time in 1994. It is important to note that despite the fact that Morrison’’— the case that took this up—‘‘was decided 7–1, Justice Scalia’s dissent presented a compelling and powerful argument against the constitutionality of the 1978 act. Beginning with an eloquent description of the Founders’ motivations in enshrining separation of powers principles in the Constitution, Justice Scalia’s dissent went on to describe the ways in which the 1978 act infringed upon executive power.’’ And this is from that dissent from Justice Scalia, a great man, a funny guy, a great sense of humor, but brilliant intellect, and I miss him very much. Justice Scalia said the independent counsel’s investigation was commenced, not necessarily because the President or his authorized subordinates believe it is in the interest of the United States, in the sense that it warrants the diversion of resources from other efforts and is worth the cost in money and in possible damage to other governmental interests, and not even, leaving aside those normally considered factors, because the President or his authorized subordinates necessarily believe that an investigation is likely to unearth a violation worth prosecuting, but only because the Attorney General cannot affirm, as Congress demands, that there are no reasonable grounds to believe that further investigation is warranted. b2115 The decisions regarding the scope of that further investigation, its duration, and, finally, whether or not prosecution should ensue are, likewise, beyond the control of the President and his subordinates. But he goes on, quoting Justice Scalia: ‘‘If to describe this case is not to decide it, the concept of a government of separate and coordinate powers no longer has meaning’’ because ‘‘it is ultimately irrelevant how much the statute reduces Presidential control.’’ Of course, any impingement on Presidential control over the executive branch was unconstitutional. Justice Scalia also noted significant appointments clause problems with the ‘78 act, arguing the independent counsel was not an inferior officer because neither the President nor the Attorney General could remove the independent counsel. Ultimately, however, Chief Justice Rehnquist and the other Justices involved in the case were not of the same mind as Justice Scalia. The Court ruled seven to one that the ‘78 act passed constitutional muster, even though I would submit, parenthetically, it really didn’t, but including the appointments clause. In 1999, through a bipartisan consensus, Congress agreed to allow the ‘94 Reauthorization Act to expire. Lawmakers at that time concluded the ‘94 Reauthorization was seriously flawed in several important respects, as experience had shown. Both Republicans and Democrats had come to the conclusion that, in practice, the 1994 Reauthorization Act and its predecessors had become more often a political weapon to be unleashed in the ongoing—indeed, escalating—culture wars, than a tool for ferreting out and prosecuting crimes ostensibly committed by highranking government officials. Later, in ‘99, the DOJ, acting pursuant to distinct statutory authority, promulgated regulations ‘‘to replace the procedures set out in the Independent Counsel Reauthorization Act of 1994.’’ Thus, to provide a special counsel with a large budget and tell him or her to find crimes allows a special counsel to pursue his or her targets without the usual time and budget constraints facing ordinary prosecutors, encouraging substantial elements of the public to conclude that the special counsel is being deployed as a political weapon. Furthermore, although the regulations required the Attorney General to provide a special counsel with a factual statement of the matters to be investigated, notably missing from the regulation is any requirement the Attorney General specify any particular crime or statutes that are believed to have been violated. He goes on in his opinion, I think, 31 pages, but he also comments, given the investigation’s focus—he is talking about Mueller’s—on President Trump’s campaign, even a blind person can see that the true target of the special counsel investigation was President Trump, not the defendant. Further, he says the wisdom of allowing all links between individuals associated with President Trump’s campaign and the Russian Government to be subject to investigation, irrespective of how stale those connections might be, is seriously in doubt. Nevertheless, he says that the grant of investigatory authority is written broadly and does capture the connections at issue in this case, which Judge Ellison already talked about. It was too broad. When you look at the people Mueller has hired, not content to have hired what, 17 lawyers—two of them left recently, as I understand it—he went looking for somebody else who hated Trump as much as he did and Weissmann did and was successful. Apparently, the two who left didn’t hate the President as much as Mueller wanted them to, which is one of the flaws in having someone so unaccountable—unaccountable because they answer to a man who is in—well, it is an old word where I come from—cahoots with Mueller, Weissmann, and the original Russia investigation that let Russia end up with 20plus percent of our uranium, knowing they were acquiring it illegally. The Obama council on foreign investments in the U.S. voted to let them go, well, sure, because Mueller, Rosenstein, and Weissmann made sure that their guy behind the scenes wasn’t talking. They kept the information quiet about Russia’s illegal actions, and, gee, that ended up leading to $145 million in contributions to the Clinton Foundation. A lot of money changed hands. Pay to play, some people call it. We know for certain that Hillary Clinton’s private server was hacked, and the fact that the current FBI Director, Director Wray, would allow a statement to go out last week fraudulently deceptive says the FBI has not cleaned itself up yet. Yes, there have been some people fired, some people demoted, and some people moved over, but it is still fraudulently deceptive and dishonoring the hard, honest work 
of thousands and thousands of FBI agents across this country. The intel community Inspector General and his investigators learned that Hillary Clinton’s private server was, in fact, 100 percent certainty, hacked. It was reported by Richard Pollock. I know who hacked, I know where the information went, and I can’t dispute what Richard Pollock wrote last week. He said that Chinese intel were getting every one of Hillary Clinton’s messages, including some of our most sensitive classified information. Now, I didn’t remember the story from November 6 of 2016, but I saw it recently, and it pointed out that Hillary Clinton was not only exposing our Nation’s secrets and those who worked secretly for our Federal Government around the world; she was exposing people to extreme danger and potential loss of life through her unsecured, illegal, and, it turns out, criminal use of that server, not to mention the obstruction of justice when she got a subpoena and had the information sought destroyed. But the good thing for her was that her friends controlled the Justice Department. They hated Donald Trump, and they were going to do everything they could to help her get elected. That is why I knew Peter Strzok was lying when I asked him about the investigator of the intel community, IG Frank Rucker, coming to him and Dean Chapelle and telling them: We now know for certain China has hacked all of Hillary Clinton’s emails coming in and going out and gave them specifics. We know Peter Strzok. We know from his texts from all he was doing, he was doing everything he could to protect Hillary Clinton from criminal prosecution and to help her defeat whoever the Republican would be, and especially Donald Trump. So it was certainly a lie when he says: Yeah, I remember Frank Rucker coming over and briefing; I don’t remember what he briefed about. He does remember what he briefed about because, when he heard those searing words that Hillary Clinton’s server has been, for certain, hacked, he knew there was a problem, and he covered it up. It takes courage to clean up a dirty justice system, especially when the dirt is at the very top. I was brokenhearted to read the words in Judge Ellis’ opinion, a man who is clearly very intelligent, stays on top of the law, saw wrongdoing, saw impropriety, and I would compare him—I am tempted to compare him, but I won’t compare him to Pontius Pilate because then some liberal would say: That means Gohmert is saying Manafort is Jesus, and I certainly am never going to say that. I know Jesus. Jesus is a friend of mine. He is my savior, and I can promise you, Paul Manafort is no Jesus. But the action of a judge saying ‘‘I see a problem with your prosecution here’’ and then refusing to use the power within his control to right the wrongdoing of a justice system, and in this case the unconstitutionality, defies the judge’s own words when he says: 
Let us hope the people in charge of this prosecution, including the special counsel and the Assistant Attorney General, are such people. 
The case is a reminder, ultimately, that our system of checks and balances and limitations on each branch’s powers, although exquisitely designed, ultimately works only if people of virtue, sensitivity, courage, not affected by the winds of public opinion, choose to work within the confines of the law. 
Let us hope the people in charge of the prosecution, including the special counsel and the Assistant Attorney General, are such people. 
I can tell you, Mr. Speaker, they are not. The judge says: 
That is heartbreaking. The former judge and Chief Justice, you want people who are in judicial positions to have the courage to do the right thing. These people in charge of a runaway prosecution are attempting to commit a coup d’etat. They are engaged in a civil war to take down a President, the origins of which operation were fraudulent and were paid for by Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party. What has happened to the Department of Justice at the top and the FBI at the top is heartbreaking to people who have spent their lives dedicated to truth, justice, and our American constitution. It turns out Judge Ellis—brilliant, knowing—intentionally walked away from his responsibility and did not show himself to be a person of virtue, sensitivity, and courage not affected by the winds of public opinion. That is a tragedy. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

Lord, transform our lawmakers into instruments of Your glory, enabling them to strengthen our Nation and world. Remind them that fierce winds bring no anxiety to those who keep their eyes on You.
