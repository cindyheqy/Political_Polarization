Mr. KINZINGER. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to welcome Pastor Paul C. Meyers as our guest chaplain this morning and greatly appreciate him leading us in prayer on this historic Thursday. Pastor Meyers is from the 16th Congressional District of Illinois, which I proudly represent, and serves as the senior chaplain at the United Methodist Church in Roscoe, Illinois. Serving in ministry since 1992, Pastor Meyers has been a stalwart, faithful figure in our community. He serves as chaplain for the fire, EMS, and law enforcement—19 years and counting—and is currently the head chaplain for the HarlemRoscoe Fire Department and the Roscoe Police Department. He also serves as chaplain with the FBI and will be resident chaplain at the FBI Academy this month in Quantico. I want to say thank you to Pastor Meyers and to his family for all they do to serve in our community. We are humbly grateful for this dedication to serving the Lord and providing us with this spiritual guidance. f 
RECOGNIZING THE 50TH BIRTHDAY OF PEACE, INC. (Mr. KATKO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 50th birthday of PEACE, Inc., a nonprofit, community based organization in my district in Onondaga County. PEACE, Inc., was founded on March 26, 1968, with a mission to empower individuals in our community to thrive. Today, this organization plays an integral part in the lives of so many central New Yorkers. From children and families, to teenagers, to senior citizens, PEACE, Inc., is dedicated to helping all individuals realize their self worth and become selfsufficient. Under the leadership of Executive Director Joe O’Hara and its board of directors, PEACE, Inc., in Onondaga County has such programs as Head Start, Senior Nutrition, the EITC Free Tax Prep programs, and many others. Poverty does not just hurt those who live in it; it hurts our entire community. By focusing on stabilizing families, improving living conditions, and developing partnerships with our regional schools, businesses, and other nonprofits, PEACE, Inc., has provided thousands of individuals and families in our community with a pathway out of poverty. After 50 years of outstanding work, PEACE, Inc., deserves our recognition and our gratitude. I join many in our community in wishing the many men and women involved in this great program congratulations on 50 years of serving the community. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the work being done by First 5 San Luis Obispo County for families on the central coast. I stand to endorse their Children’s Bill of Rights. This document serves as a guide well beyond San Luis Obispo County that every lawmaker in this Nation should work toward, especially the right to visit a doctor to help children stay physically and mentally healthy. This week marks the eighth anniversary of the Affordable Care Act that covers 1 million children through the State and Federal marketplaces. The ACA also made significant investments in our Children’s Health Insurance Program. I urge my colleagues to continue to work together to strengthen this legislation. By controlling the cost of prescription drugs, ensuring costsharing reduction subsidies, and adding a public option to bring down the cost of health insurance plans, we can ensure that we continue to raise healthy children. 
RECOGNIZING THE CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION OF BOY SCOUT TROOP 14 (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Boy Scout Troop 14 of Williamsport, Pennsylvania, on its centennial celebration. Troop 14 is the oldest consecutively chartered troop in the Susquehanna Council Boy Scouts of America. Saint John’sNewberry United Methodist Church has been its sponsor for these 100 years. Troop 14 has provided scouting to boys in Newberry and the surrounding area. Impressively, the troop has produced 127 Eagle Scouts during that time. It has been through the efforts of many that the troop has been and continues to be an active and strong unit. For 100 years, Troop 14 has helped scores of Boy Scouts build a more conscientious, responsible, and productive society. The Boy Scouts of America is one of the Nation’s largest and most prominent valuesbased youth development organizations, providing programs for young people that build character, train them in the responsibilities of participating citizenship, and develop personal fitness. Mr. Speaker, along with my colleague, TOMMARINO , I commend Troop 14 on its centennial celebration for building so many future leaders by combining educational activities and lifelong values with fun. I wish them the very best on this milestone occasion and look forward to another 100 years of excellence. 
COLORECTAL CANCER AWARENESS MONTH (Ms. BARRAGA´N asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. BARRAGA´N. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month. This type of cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States. Each March, we raise awareness about this terrible disease and spread the word about the importance of getting screened. If you are 45 years or older, please get yourself screened early. The disease poses an especially high risk to AfricanAmerican men and women who have the highest rate of death and the lowest survival rate among all Americans. This is why I am proud to support funding for programs like the Colorectal Cancer Control Program, which was established specifically to address disparities in screening rates and to improve access to underserved populations. Along with the Affordable Care Act, which requires the coverage of screening tests, we can provide the healthcare that Americans need to stay cancer free. 
HONORING THE SEVEN U.S. MILITARY MEMBERS KILLED IN IRAQ ON MARCH 16, 2018 (Mr. KINZINGER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. KINZINGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of our fallen heroes, the seven U.S. military members killed in the helicopter crash over western Iraq on Saturday, March 16, 2018. As an airman, I had the privilege of flying with Captain Andreas O’Keefe. His Air Force service included three tours in Iraq, serving in Afghanistan and the Horn of Africa and, most recently, in Texas to help out during Hurricane Harvey. And still, he wanted to do more. Andy was a fellow air guardsman, a Long Island guy, and served with the 106th Rescue Wing of the New York Air National Guard. Like many who join the service, Andy did so voluntarily, with a servant’s heart, eager to serve his country and to help others. Without question, he lived by the 106th credo: ‘‘That others may live.’’ As a nation, we mourn for the families and loved ones of those fallen heroes. We send them our prayers, deepest condolences, and deepest gratitude for their service to the country. While we grieve this tragic loss, I know Andy died doing what he loved and what he was called to do and what he wanted to do: serve his country. Mr. Speaker, we stand in this Chamber because of the sacrifices of men and women like this. We have the freedom to debate and vote and use our voices because of their sacrifice. With that, it is with a heavy heart that I say Godspeed to my friend, Captain O’Keefe. May God bless our troops every day. f 
CONGRATULATIONS TO COACH DON LUCIA (Mr. EMMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an outstanding person and a friend. Don Lucia started playing hockey on outdoor rinks in northern Minnesota as a boy. After playing the game through high school and college, he became one of the most successful college hockey coaches in the country. Recently, Coach Lucia announced he will retire from coaching the Minnesota Golden Gophers men’s hockey team after 19 seasons. During his tenure at Minnesota, Don’s teams regularly finished at the top of the WCHA and, more recently, won the Big Ten Conference 4 out of the past 5 years. His teams also made the NCAA playoffs 13 times and won two national titles. As a player growing up in Grand Rapids, Minnesota, Don was a leader. He was disciplined, and he made everyone around him better. As a coach, he not only built winning teams, he developed young men. Don is retiring as a true ambassador for the game. While he will no longer be coaching our Minnesota Gophers, I hope Don continues to be a leader for the game of hockey and for our State for years to come. Don, thank you for leading our Gophers to victory time and time again. Good luck to you; your wonderful wife, Joyce; and the rest of the Lucia family as you start the next chapter. 
HONORING MICHAEL MACCHIAVELLO (Mr. PITTENGER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PITTENGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of North Carolina State University senior Michael Macchiavello, who, on March 17, won the NCAA Division I National Wrestling Championship at 197 pounds. Mr. Macchiavello is a graduate of Sun Valley High School in Indian 
Trail, North Carolina, where he was a 4A State champion wrestler in 2013, when he posted a 61–1 record. His college coach says Michael is constantly improving and that his work ethic, discipline, attitude, and commitment put him in position to compete for the national title. Mr. Macchiavello is not just a champion inside the ring. He has already completed a bachelor’s degree in finance and is working on a master’s of arts. Congratulations to Michael Macchiavello on winning the NCAA Division I National Wrestling Championship. Indian Trail, Union County, and the entire Ninth Congressional District are mighty proud of him. We wish him the best in what we know will be a great success for him in the future. 
PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF THE SENATE AMENDMENT TO H.R. 1625, TARGETED REWARDS FOR THE GLOBAL ERADICATION OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING; AND PROVIDING FOR PROCEEDINGS DURING THE PERIOD FROM MARCH 23, 2018, THROUGH APRIL 9, 2018 Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 796 and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 1 hour. b0915 Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN ), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. 
Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, last night, at a late hour, the Rules Committee met, where we had expert testimony that was offered on behalf of the chairman and ranking member of the Committee on Appropriations, the gentleman from New Jersey and the gentlewoman from New York. I would like to, if I could, express to my friend, Mr. MCGOVERN , the professional nature not only that he but Judge HASTINGS , another member of the committee, represented the Democratic side at a time that is very difficult for them with the passing and loss of a tremendous leader in the House of Representatives, the gentlewoman from New York, Chairwoman LOUISE SLAUGHTER . Mr. MCGOVERN and Mr. H ASTINGS not only conducted themselves, in my opinion, in a professional straightforward manner, but represented their party quite well in a time of distress and a time of need. I want to express my complete confidence not only in Mr. MCGOVERN , but also thank Judge H ASTINGS for his professional demeanor last night as we worked through very, very difficult issues till late in the night, till early in the morning. And compliments also to the gentlemen, the chairman of the committee and the ranking member for their professional conversations that were had that were in the best interest not only of the House of Representatives but the American people. I want to thank Mr. MCGOVERN publicly at this time for his professional cause and substance. Mr. Speaker, today we rise in support of this rule and, of course, the underlying legislation. The rule provides for consideration of the Senate amendment to H.R. 1625, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018. Mr. Speaker, this is funding the government for the rest of the year, through September 30. This is an important measure. This is an important measure not only for the American people, but it is important for Members of Congress. There are a lot of ways that we could stand and say what we are for or what we are against, but the bottom line is that this is a piece of legislation that has been worked on, on a bipartisan basis, Republicans and Democrats, give and take, and has been worked on the other side of the Capitol with the United States Senate. It is in no way a perfect bill. That, I think, I learned a long time ago, is hard to get through to be signed by the President. But with that said, it yielded amazing results in a process that needed to come to a conclusion. This 12bill appropriations package provides funding for fiscal year 2018 at levels consistent with the bipartisan budget agreement and the National Defense Authorization Act. After years of neglect, this body has taken the important step of reshaping and rebuilding the United States military by providing them $659.6 billion worth of funding for our national defense. But it is for more than just national defense. It is also trying to give better protection to the men and women who protect us, the men and women who, today, are in cold, lonely, hot, dangerous places around the globe. Mr. Speaker, a muchneeded $65 billion increase over 2017 fiscal year spending was essential. Mr. Speaker, the numbers speak for themselves. More members of our armed services gave their life in defense of this country in training exercises than they did in combat last year. This is a hardy reminder for Members of Congress and the American people to understand that our men and women not only fight hard, but they train hard. And in that defense, we need to do a better job to make sure that the equipment, the training, and the needs that they have are top flight yearround not just in combat areas, but in training missions where they are preparing to protect this country. Mr. Speaker, we have come a long way to that, and I am proud of the work that we have done. The agreement ends, I think, the irresponsible practice of pairing dollar fordollar increases in defense spending with nondefense. This is a hard fight. This is a hard fight not only RepublicanDemocrat, but across this country. We have tried to make some balanced decisions. We have tried to err on the side of using money for the best interest of research and development and to move this country forward. The bill strengthens missile defense. It strengthens and funds new weapons systems for the military. And it heavily increases designated counterthreats around the globe. As you know, Mr. Speaker, we are facing down one of the greatest threats to the world right now, North Korea. Now is not a time to 
shy away. Mr. Speaker, we will not shy away. These colors don’t run. It funds additional national security priorities, including nuclear modernization, new nuclear submarines, and other important shipbuilding and aircraft procurement for our United States military. Quite honestly, Mr. Speaker, the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. GRANGER ) and her counterpart from the appropriations committee looked at the exercise that is necessary and came up to streamline and make sure that the money that would be given would be necessary and only in defense of this Nation. This legislation also includes a long overdue 2.4 percent pay increase for our troops. The men and women who care for our veterans know that they need the help, and their service to this country will not be without a thankyou, thus providing a record level of VA funding, while increasing oversight to make sure that the benefits and treatment of our veterans is properly taken care of. The new Secretary Shulkin of the VA is very concerned about the duty that they have to our veterans, and he has assured us this amount of funding will allow he and the Department that opportunity to fix, correct, and, long term, know that the longterm safety for our veterans and their facilities will be accomplished. It provides robust funding to fight terrorism. It enhances criminal law enforcement and secures our borders by increasing funding for border security and the enforcement of immigration law. This legislation also includes new infrastructure funding for highways, waterways, airways, railways, and other infrastructure priorities to ensure public safety is taken care of and to promote economic growth. Mr. Speaker, it provides $4 billion, the largest investment to date, to combat the opioid crisis. We have spent a great deal of time not only working on this Member to Member, but also State organizations working with their members; Federal law enforcement; and the National Institutes of Health, through the direction of Dr. Shiva Singh, their chief medical officer who spent a great deal of time working with Members of Congress, opioid task forces, substance abuse task forces, and perhaps, most of all, the problems that we have that face this great Nation, where we have addiction problems. These are addressed within this spending bill. Increase in funding by $3 billion, certainly the head of the NIH, Dr. Francis Collins, believes that this investment in the National Institutes of Health, including the National Eye Institute and other important parts of NIH, will receive the funding that is necessary to ensure that the men and women of this country who suffer longterm effects of aging and other medical problems, that we can address them and live up to our responsibility. I thank Dr. Francis Collins and Dr. Shiva Singh for their instruction to our important Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman TOMCOLEfor his great work at the NIH—$2.3 billion in new funding for mental health training and school safety efforts help our children to make sure that our schools are safe. This is a brief rundown, Mr. Speaker, of the kind of work not only that we have dug in and done on a bipartisan basis, but the kind of work that I believe the American people want, need, and expect. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. (Mr. MCGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. SESSIONS ), the chairman of the Rules Committee and my friend, for the customary 30 minutes. Mr. Speaker, I first want to thank the distinguished chairman of the Rules Committee for his thoughtfulness in the aftermath of the passing of our dear friend, the former chairwoman of the Rules Committee, LOUISE  SLAUGHTER . We appreciate his support. We appreciate the support of all the Republican members on the Rules Committee, especially for the Democratic staff, but we are truly grateful for all of his consideration and for all of his remembrances of our friend. We want him to know it means a great deal to all of us, so we thank him. I also want to take this opportunity to once again wish the chairman of the Rules Committee a happy birthday. I had the honor to be with him at 1:30 in the morning yesterday and to wish him happy birthday then. So we will wish him happy birthday again at 9:30 in the morning, and we wish him many, many more. Mr. Speaker, you know, here we are, and I am kind of at a loss for words. There is really not a lot to say. We are here, yet again, facing another manufactured and totally avoidable crisis. You know, what on Earth will it take for the Republican leadership of this Congress to actually step up to the plate and start governing? Because this process that is bringing us this bill today, I don’t think, represents good governing. We have seen five continuing resolutions. We have seen two government shutdowns in less than 6 months. It is mindboggling. It takes my breath away. Mr. Speaker, Republicans control the House, they control the Senate, they control the White House; but the truth is that it turns out that they can’t govern. Governing is hard work. It takes skill. It takes compromise. It is not all press conferences and it is not all tweets. It takes leadership. So I would encourage our Republican colleagues to cut the nonsense and get down to business. We can’t keep on embracing processes like the one that we are seeing unfold today. Give the American people the certainty they deserve, fund this government the right way. But this process that brings us this omnibus today, I think, is disappointing not just to Democrats, but to a lot of Republicans as well. Now, as lousy as this process was to get here, there are some things in this agreement that we can be enthusiastic about. We are encouraged by increases in spending for domestic priorities, like infrastructure, education, medical research, and support for our veterans, among other things. These are things that are of great importance to Members on the Democratic side. We are pleased that the negotiators on our side of the aisle worked diligently to remove poison pill riders, and they fought to limit the construction of the President’s stupid border wall. Our enthusiasm is tempered because of what else might be in the bill, what we might not know. It is over 2,200 pages long, and it was posted at 8 p.m. last night. I am not sure anyone in this Chamber has had the chance to actually read the entire text of this omnibus. I don’t know how many inadvertent errors may be contained in this omnibus. b0930 I worry what kind of provisions we could find tucked away in this bill in the days and the weeks to come. This is no way to govern, Mr. Speaker. Our Republican colleague from Louisiana over in the Senate, Senator JOHNKENNEDY , said yesterday that he thinks this whole process is an embarrassment. He said: ‘‘As bad as it looks to the American people from the outside, it is worse on the inside.’’ I don’t blame the Appropriations Committee. I have nothing but the highest respect for Chairman FRELING HUYSEN and Ranking Member L OWEY . They did an incredible job, and they and their staffs deserve our gratitude. There were many sleepless nights to be able to produce a product so that we could actually move forward and not shut the government down. They did what everybody expected them to do, and I want to thank them for their work. And to be honest with you, I don’t really blame the Rules Committee. We were given this last night, and we had to come up with a process and a rule to bring it to the floor. But I do blame the Speaker, and I do blame the Senate majority leader, and I do blame the President, because they are in charge and we shouldn’t be at the brink of a government shutdown before we consider spending bills. This should have been done months and months ago. Mr. Speaker, again, the American people deserve much better. They deserve a Congress that works for them, a Congress that is responsive to their calls for action, a Congress that listens to all voices, both Democrats and Republicans alike. 
Mr. Speaker, I am hopeful that this omnibus legislation will ultimately work its way through Congress and to the President’s desk to avert yet another Republicanmanufactured shutdown. But I would ask the Republican leadership of this Congress: Let’s reform the way we do business around here. I don’t believe that those of us in the minority expect to win all the time, but we expect to have our voices heard, and we want and we demand a fair process. We want enough time to read bills before you bring them up for a vote. That is not too much to ask. Let’s work together to bring a little bit more transparency, a little bit more sunshine, and yes, a little bit more democracy into the people’s House. This is supposed to be the greatest deliberative body in the world. I don’t know why it is such a radical idea that we deliberate every once in a while. Instead, we are presented with a 2,200 page bill, and we have been given summaries, but, in all honesty, none of us know what is actually in this bill and whether or not there are some things here that, quite frankly, might be very, very troubling once we begin to read this bill over the days and weeks ahead. Let’s have an honest and open debate. Let’s resolve that we are not going to ever go back to this process again where we fund government hour to hour. We need to get back to important issues facing our country and the American people. Again, I want to express my gratitude to the appropriators and to those who were in these negotiations to try to get us a bill here today, but this is a lousy process, and I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the rule. We can’t sanction this process. No matter what you think about the bill, this process is something that we have to stand up and say: This is unacceptable. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, to the gentleman from Massachusetts, I not only accept his advice about process and procedure, but I certainly would join in with him to thank our appropriators, the men and women who, on a bipartisan basis, Mr. Speaker, took time to wander to the other side of the Capitol to engage their colleagues. I can tell the gentleman, and he knows this probably on a firsthand basis, much was discussed. This was a big process. This was at the end of the year that I do agree with that should have taken place on October 1, not on March 22, that we decided where we are headed. But the discussion, the decisionmaking, the ability for both sides, both parties, to deal on the same issues has gotten tougher and tougher. I support our Speaker and what he is attempting to do. He has opened up the process. He has tried to make it to where the discussions take place on a bipartisan basis. And the Speaker, I believe, has tried to place before us, as Members of Congress, the opportunity to be heard, to represent our thoughts and ideas. I didn’t win some of the issues that I was for. I held some ideas out about a number of issues that we had been working on that were contained in the bills that came out of the House only to come back months later from the Senate in a different priority, in a different way, and perhaps not exactly what I would have wanted. It would be easy for me to say, however, that the greater good of what we are attempting to accomplish is why we are here. Ultimately, we have a duty, Mr. Speaker, we have a duty and a responsibility, to ensure that which we finalize is in the best interest of the American people. The overriding concern here is to make sure that the efforts of government, albeit that we as Americans, I don’t think, want to get all that we pay for from government, we still recognize that there are people in our midst that need a government— and I do, too—a government that works well and is funded properly. Mr. Speaker, last night we had an opportunity to hear from a number of my colleagues on the Republican side, a number of Members of Congress who spent hours waiting their time before the Rules Committee, not an unusual intuitive process from a number of our Members who had questions, comments, and concerns. I promised to address one of them. The gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. MASSIE ) brought forth what was a discussion about what is known as the NICS fix, or, as we refer to it, fixing NICS, a NICS fix. Well, this is the database that is responsible for holding names and giving approvals for those people who purchase weapons across the United States. I agreed to provide some bit of an answer today and I hope some clarity on the issue that relates back to December of 2017. I told the gentleman last night that I believed that, while his arguments were important and I supported exactly the underlying ideas, and that is that we do not believe that agencies by themselves should have the ability to deny an American citizen the right, the constitutional right, for them to properly, legally own a weapon, as we do know and remember back during a previous administration, at least two agencies, the Social Security Administration and the Veterans Administration, developed procedures by which they believed were appropriate, but that I think have proven incorrect, to deny people a weapon based upon a criteria that they established. This fix NICS provision was corrected and is still in law, and, to the best of my ability in doublechecking, I would now like to notify the gentleman from Kentucky that I believe it is properly done. I would not be a part of making a change in the law, as I told him, that would deny an American citizen under these two agencies without lawful consideration of a hearing and with due process, and based upon the law and constitutional requirements of our Constitution to deny someone their right to keep and bear arms. Mr. Speaker, please consider that I appreciate the gentleman who showed up last night until late, late in the morning, and that he was doing his duty, which I respect and admire, and I am trying to respond back to him. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Texas, the distinguished chairman of the Rules Committee, said that he appreciated the Speaker’s listening to the different opinions of all Members here in the House. I think the frustration here is not that we can’t raise our voices, the frustration here is that we cannot bring things that we care about to the House floor for debate. The gentleman just talked about the issue of guns. We are living in a country where we have massacres on a regular basis. The American people overwhelmingly want us to bring gun safety legislation to the floor. Things like universal background checks, for example. The leadership of this House will not let us bring those bills to the floor for debate or for a vote. They have shut us out. So this process that has been endorsed by the Republican leadership is not open. It is very, very closed. In fact, we are on record to becoming the most closed Congress in the history of the United States of America. That is not something that I think the United States Congress should aspire to. Maybe that is something that the Russians might want to aspire to, but it is certainly not something that we here in this country want to aspire to. Everybody in this Chamber has ideas. Everybody represents the same number of people. Everybody should be heard, and important legislation and important ideas ought to be brought to the floor for debate and for a vote. If you do not want to vote for universal background checks, or if you do not want to vote to ban bump stocks, or if you do not want to vote for an assault weapons ban, then don’t vote for it. But it is wrong and it undermines this institution when, on issues like that, we are told: You cannot deliberate on the House floor. Another issue is DACA. The President of the United States single handedly ended the DACA program, and he threw the lives of hundreds of thousands of people into chaos. It was a cruel and rotten thing to do. The President’s arbitrary March 5 deadline ending this program has come and gone, and instead of leadership and compassion, all we have seen is partisan tweeting. It is maddening, and it betrays our values. 
Earlier this month, President Trump tweeted: ‘‘Total inaction of DACA by Dems. Where are you? A deal can be made.’’ Well, to answer President Trump’s question, the Democrats are right here, offering bipartisan solutions to protect these young Americans. This is the 26th time that we have attempted to bring a bipartisan bill, the Dream Act, for a vote on the floor. And I am going to ask people to vote against the previous question so we can bring a solution to the floor and protect these incredible young people who have given so much to our country. But this is the 26th time that we have attempted to do this. And, by the way, this is not just a Democratic bill. There is bipartisan support for this. And what is particularly frustrating is that the Republican leadership of this House will not let us have that vote. Why? Because they know it will pass. They know it will pass. They don’t want the majority to work its will in this Chamber. They have deliberately said: No. We are not allowing you to bring that to the floor. If you want to help these people, you have to bring a bill to the floor. And if you don’t want to help them, well, bring the bill to the floor and vote ‘‘no.’’ But this is ridiculous. There is bipartisan support to fix this problem, to help these people, to live up to our values in this country. Again, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up H.R. 3440, the Dream Act, and this bipartisan, bicameral legislation would help hundreds of thousands of young people who are American in every way except on paper. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the RECORD , along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. WOMACK ). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Massachusetts? There was no objection. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I would just say to my colleagues: Give us the vote. Give us this vote. If you don’t like it, then vote ‘‘no.’’ But if we were to bring this bill to the floor, I guarantee you it would pass. I think every Democrat would vote for it, and a big chunk of Republicans, maybe even a majority, might vote for this. b0945 I don’t know what the gentleman is afraid of. I don’t know why this is so hard. This is the Congress of the United States. This is the place where these issues are supposed to be resolved; and, instead, all we get from the leadership of this House is obstruction, obstruction, obstruction. They block everything—block everything. Everything is closed. It is my way or the highway. Enough. These people deserve better than this institution is providing. They deserve a vote. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. SOTO) to discuss our proposal. Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Massachusetts for yielding. Yesterday, the University of Central Florida in Orlando had a unique student body president election. The candidates were Karen Caudillo, my constituent, and Josh Bolona, both Dreamers, beneficiaries of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Act. They ran on a platform of justice and equality, and so did I. Today we celebrate Josh Bolona’s victory on becoming UCF’s first Dreamer student body president. So what a sad backdrop we have here today. President Trump declared victory for getting $1.6 billion to start his wall in a tweet late last night—$1.6 billion to start Trump’s wall. So his wall gets funding, but our Dreamers get left behind. How can I, in good conscience, go home to my constituents and explain this? I wonder aloud: When will our Dreamers be the priority? When will it be their time to shine? When will they have their moment of opportunity, a reprieve from worrying and from looking over their shoulders every day? Mr. Speaker, when will the waiting finally stop for them and the living begin? When will the Dreamers finally get to dream? Every week for 198 days, we have come here to ask our colleagues for their consideration of the bipartisan Dream Act. I remind you of that because it has been 198 days since the President put hundreds of thousands of Dreamers at risk of losing their jobs, careers, their families, and everything they have worked for their entire lives. Many take solace in a court injunction issued in California and New York. As a lawyer, I can tell you these Dreamers are hanging by a thread. They are one adverse ruling away from oblivion. What about the over 1 million Dreamers who are not part of the case? Those young people who would be entering the program, the young sisters and the young brothers of Dreamers who are in the DACA program and those Dreamers who did not apply out of concern and out of a mistrust they had for giving their information to a Federal Government that has turned their back on them? They would have no quarter under these injunctions and no rest. They have no peace. Why can’t we, once and for all, come together to give these deserving young patriots who embody our deepest values the opportunity to earn their citizenship, hardworking patriots like Josh, Karen, and hundreds of thousands of others who will have contributed an estimated $460 billion to the U.S. economy over the next decade? These young people are making positive and significant contributions to the economic growth of our country which benefits all of us. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Florida an additional 2 minutes. Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, I know my colleagues across the aisle don’t want deportation of Dreamers on their hands, so why not do something now, at this moment, at this time? Why not pass a law that would permanently allow these young people to build a life here, to graduate from college, to start a new business, and to show their immense gratitude to a country that gave them a chance? Today we have the opportunity to uphold our values and pass the Dream Act so that these Dreamers and the millions of people who swore to represent them aren’t worrying and wondering any longer. We are asking for one vote, just one vote, that will keep whole our principles and ideals and allow these young people to pursue the American Dream. So for the 26th time in 198 days, I ask my colleagues to vote against the previous question so that we can immediately bring the Dream Act to the floor and provide certainty for Dreamers like Karen and Josh who want to continue to work, live, and contribute to the only country they love and the only country they have ever known. I cannot afford to wait another day, nor can they. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I don’t want to digress too much, but the gentleman from Massachusetts referred to a process that just was embarrassing and did not work. I recall, last night, testimony from the ranking member, the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. LOWEY ): ‘‘This is one of the best processes that I can recall. We have products that we can be proud of. We worked together.’’ Mr. Speaker, it is hard doing business in this town. It is hard doing business because we have disagreements. But let us not also misunderstand that it was President Trump who challenged Congress when our previous administration simply went about writing their own rules and regulations that made the circumstances on our border not only more dangerous, but very costly for every single American by encouraging tens of thousands of people to travel through Central America to come to the United States, and for us to take them into the United States with illegality that has been ruled on by Federal courts in this country. A legal and lawful process is what President Trump is attempting to have this Congress do. He understands that power under Article I and the power under Article II. I believe that President Trump personally invoked hours of his time to make sure that he properly worked with Congress—key people from the House, key people from the Senate—televised day after day to get 
closer on the issue that he felt could gain resolution. It is a hard issue. But to suggest in any way that President Trump is a culprit of anything except leading to the best I believe would be an unfair statement against his intended desire to resolve the issue. Mr. Speaker, last night, the Rules Committee, under the strong leadership of the gentleman from Georgia, ROBWOODALL , and the strong leadership of TOMCOLE, provided evidence based information not just to sustain the document that we are here for, but actually to continue the explanation of what we are doing and why, including the balances of budgeting and those necessary items but also the content. Our vice chairman of the Rules Committee, the gentleman from Oklahoma, TOMCOLE, doubles in his duty to Congress, and he serves as the lead appropriator, the chairman of the subcommittee that is responsible for health, NIH, and research and development. Mr. COLE’s professional attributes really shined last night as he, with great pride, discussed major, hard issues facing this Nation, facing the United States, and facing the medical community in this country. I was very proud of not only his content with the substance, but also with the delivery of the product. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE) to discuss this seemingly impossible work that he made possible. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his gracious comments. I appreciate the time, and I appreciate the fulsome praise. I do want to talk just a little bit about process because I think, if you are not on the Appropriations Committee, you probably haven’t been able to follow a lot of this. And, frankly, this process can be made better; there is no doubt about it. I suspect, processwise, my friend from Massachusetts and I are not very far apart on where we think it ought to end up. But I do want the full body to understand what we went through to get to this point. First, it is important to remember that all 12 subcommittees of the Appropriations Committee produced legislation last year. There were full hearings and fulsome debate, and each subcommittee reported out their product. Then the full committee dealt with each subcommittee’s report and presentation, and in doing so, all amendments were open from both parties. Eventually, of course, all those 12 were put into a single bill. There were hundreds of amendments from both sides of the aisle that were made in order in that process. That bill was brought to the House floor in midSeptember, and it was passed. So, the House effectively did all of its work. It did the hearings; it did the markups; it reported it to the floor; and it moved it across the floor. We have been waiting for about 180 days for the Senate to respond. I could point some fingers. I am not going to. They didn’t get a single appropriations bill across the floor, and only a few out of the full committee. We have finally, about 4 weeks ago, had a bipartisan negotiation at the leadership level that reset the numbers: a big increase from the Budget Control Act for defense spending. That is something Republicans very much wanted, and many Democrats did as well. And, frankly, also, an increase from nondefense discretionary spending as well—so new numbers. At that point, we began what is a pretty normal appropriations process at the committee level. That is the so called fourcorner prospect, when the ranking member of each subcommittee and the chairman of that committee sit down with their Senate counterparts and negotiate the differences between what were effectively Senate committee bills, but bills that the House had moved fully across the floor. There is a great deal of giveandtake in that. When you go as far as you can to the subcommittee level, you kick them upstairs to the chairman at the next level. They negotiate, and they solve those. I can give you an example. In Labor HHS, we had 12 issues unresolved in a $170 billion bill. That is actually awfully good. They were moved up to full committee. Nine of those issues were resolved there. Eventually, three more were kicked up to the leadership level, and they were all resolved there. That happens for each and every subcommittee. So there is a great deal of giveandtake. Frankly, we begin this process knowing it needs to be a bipartisan product in the end. You have to have 60 votes in the United States Senate. There are 51 Republicans. Frankly, over here, obviously, they will take both Republican and Democratic votes. So there is a good deal of giveandtake in this particular process. At the end of the day, we have got a bipartisan bill that both the chairman and the ranking member brought before us last night. Again, as I mentioned earlier, from a Republican standpoint, you are probably most pleased with the defense number. That is something we have wanted and the administration wanted. But in the nondefense area, there are many, many things that both sides agree on are very important for the national wellbeing: a $3 billion increase at the National Institutes of Health, the largest increase in a generation; substantially more money on opioids, a crisis we know affects all of our districts, $3 billion this year and $3 billion next year spread over a number of subcommittee jurisdictions. There is a substantial increase in early childhood education and childcare, something, again, that people on both sides of the aisle feel strongly about. There is lots of money for mental health to follow up on some of the initiatives that were laid out in the 21st Century Cures Act, again, a bipartisan product. Now you are seeing bipartisan appropriations to try and match the money with the legislation that was created by the Committee on Energy and Commerce. There is money for school safety. This is probably the largest single increase we have had. I think last year under, title 4, we did about $400 million. This bill has $1.1 billion, a pretty substantial increase in something I think we all care about. So, again, it has been pretty extraordinary. Also, I want to point out—we are all proud of our respective committees— that Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN and Ranking Member LOWEY produced an omnibus last year in April or May. They have done three supplementals for the disaster relief. They now have produced this omnibus which will fund the government for fiscal year 2018, and they are hard at work on the next one. So they have been extraordinarily productive. My friend is right. I wish more of this work got piecemeal to the floor so we could look at each bill. Hopefully, we can do that going forward since we now have a topline agreement between the two sides for fiscal year 2019 as to what the bill will be. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Oklahoma an additional 2 minutes. b1000 Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, we have the possibility of having a more regular measure. But whether that can be achieved or not, I don’t know. In passing this bill, we have at least laid the groundwork for it. I particularly want to single out Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN and Ranking Member LOWEY because they have shown how Congress can work together. They have managed all 12 of these bills—multiple bills in multiple areas—and gotten them to the floor and across the floor in a bipartisan manner. So, if we can do the same thing in the body as a whole, I think there would be much more appreciation and understanding and, frankly, much more input. That would be a good thing. My friend is right about that. But if we are going to do that, I would also add we have to think through how many amendments there will be. How much floor time do you want to give us? If you are going to come down here with 200 or 300 amendments on each side of the aisle, I guarantee you that all you will be doing is appropriations for the whole year. As appropriators, we might like that. As legislators in other areas, you might not. I think there has got to be some leadership giveandtake on what the appropriate structure is going forward. But none of that should take away, number one, that the rule itself is 
bringing to the floor an extraordinarily important product. If we don’t get that product passed here on a bipartisan basis and in the Senate by midnight tomorrow night, both parties will have participated in shutting down the government of the United States. I don’t think that is something either of us want to do. As a matter of fact, each of us have tried this once or twice, and we now know it is not a very productive way to proceed. I think we have got an opportunity, by passing of the rule—and I urge passage of the rule—and then the underlying legislation, to do some really good things for the American people to fulfill our obligations. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I guess I would just say to my colleague from Oklahoma that I have no problem with the appropriators. I think that is what Ranking Member LOWEY was talking about yesterday when she talked about the process. The appropriators have done their work. They work in a bipartisan way and it is not their fault that we are at this moment. As I said, it is not even the fault of the Rules Committee. It is the fault of the Republican leadership. This bill that we are doing now could have been done last December, but the Republican leadership couldn’t figure out a budget agreement until last month. Without top numbers, no one could move forward in the House or in the Senate. It turned out that what was more important was a tax cut for billionaires. That was the priority. So they passed the tax cut for billionaires and we get five CRs and two government shutdowns as a result. This process cannot be explained away, cannot be justified, and cannot continue. I probably should have had the bill in front of me here for dramatic effect, but it is 2,200 pages long. Again, it is not what I know is in the bill that I have a problem with. It is what I don’t know is in the bill that concerns me. I know it concerns Democrats and Republicans alike. I just want to go back to something the chairman of the Rules Committee referenced with regard to DACA and President Trump’s, somehow, support for these incredible people. Let’s not forget there was no reason at all—none—for this President to end DACA. There was no deadline, there was no court case, there was no law that required that the program come to an end. It was just plain, oldfashioned cruelty and stupidity. That is what was at play here: red meat for the extreme rightwing base that can never get to ‘‘yes’’ on anything regarding immigration. The way we are treating these young people is unbelievably cruel. The frustration level throughout the country is at an alltime high. Every poll I have seen, Democrats, Republicans, and Independents all overwhelmingly support us helping the DACA recipients. There are unbelievably high approval ratings for moving forward and passing a bill like the Dream Act, yet we can’t even get it to the House floor for a vote. We talk about a lousy process. That is what we are also talking about. We talked earlier about guns. We have recordhigh levels of gun violence in this country and we have massacres that occur on a regular basis. I am so grateful that millions of young people are going to be out on the streets protesting on Saturday, demanding that their government do something. They are frustrated that this Chamber, supposedly the greatest deliberative body in the world, can’t even find the time to bring something to the floor for a debate. All we do is have moments of silence in the aftermath of massacres. It would give me hope for the future of these young people, because they are not going to take it anymore. They are sick of the indifference. They are sick of the lack of action. They are sick of Members in this Chamber not listening to their voices. I feel hopeful that, ultimately, we will take action and do the right thing. I will tell you right now, for those who continue to turn their backs on the demands of these young people, I don’t think they are coming back here after November. But, again, the frustration that you are hearing on our side here today— and I know that a lot of my Republican friends feel the same way—is that this place is broken. This process stinks. There has to be a better way to do this. None of us want to shut the government down. People are going to vote how they want to on the omnibus, but I would say: Don’t endorse this lousy, broken process by voting for the rule. People should vote against this rule. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to inquire of the time remaining on both sides. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 3
1⁄2minutes remaining. The gentleman from Massachusetts has 7 minutes remaining. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I would inquire if the gentleman has any other speakers. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I have one additional speaker. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. WOODALL ), the Rules Committee designee to the Budget Committee, a gentleman who has served this Nation well and will continue to serve the Budget Committee well. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his leadership on the committee. It seems like I just saw him a couple of hours ago, but only because I just saw him a couple of hours ago. Mr. Speaker, you know as well as anyone that it is hard to get things done around here. It is never made any easier by the recriminations that circulate so widely. I appreciate the Speaker’s admonition about engaging in conflicts of personality. This is hard. This isn’t the bill I would have voted for. In fact, it is not the bill I voted for the first time around. When this House did its job 9 months ago, when it was supposed to do its job, we voted on a completely different bill. But as my friend from Massachusetts knows full well, Mr. Speaker, if Republicans had 60 votes in the Senate, we wouldn’t be going through these machinations. We go through these machinations for one reason and one reason only, and that is, after a Republicanled House gets its work done, the Senate can’t. The Senate can’t because they work in a much more bipartisan way. As bipartisan as this institution is, that institution is even more so by the Senate rules. We talk about this as if it is a spending bill, Mr. Speaker. I just want to be clear: this includes brownfields act reauthorization. That is the bill that lets us go into environmentally damaged areas and restore them. We haven’t been able to get that done just in the normal course of doing business. So to get it across the Senate floor, it is now added into this bill. The Child Protection Improvement Act, Mr. Speaker, is the bill that provides the database so that caregivers and parents can go and see who it is that is taking care of their children and make sure folks are properly vetted. We couldn’t get that through in the normal process, so we had to add it into this bill. Mr. Speaker, the CLOUD Act is the bill that allows law enforcement to go and access information stored on clouds in other countries so that you don’t have to wait 9 months through bureaucracies so that you can identify those terrorists, those criminals, earlier and more often. We couldn’t get that through the regular process, so we have got that in the bill. EVerify, Mr. Speaker, is the provision that allows any employer to dial in online to make sure that they are hiring American citizens. It is buried in this bill, Mr. Speaker. Together, we are getting things done. This bill is an example of that. It is a source of progress, not an impediment. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from the great State of Maryland (Mr. HOYER ), the distinguished minority whip. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts for yielding. I have been here long enough to see my Republican colleagues bring to the floor these bills and plop them down heavily on the table. I have been here long enough to have citizens assault me in a town meeting and ask: ‘‘Have you read the bill?’’ 
ITREALLY MEANS  This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the House of Representatives (VI, 308–311), describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.’’ To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition’’ in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (RIllinois) said: ‘‘The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.’’ The Republican majority may say ‘‘the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.’’ But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here’s how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ‘‘Although it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by voting down the previous question on the rule....  When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.’’ In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled ‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ‘‘Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon.’’ Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Republican majority’s agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous question.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to say happy birthday to my daughters, Sky and Sage. There is no greater love than the love I have for my twin girls, Sky and Sage, and for my wife, Monica. There is no greater role or responsibility I have than to be their father and Monica’s husband. There is no greater title more honorable and more meaningful in my life than the title of father and husband. There is no greater joy than to hear my girls sing with happiness, play with vigor, and laugh with gusto. There is no greater medicine for my soul than feeling their bear hugs when I arrive home after being away at work for days. Today, I celebrate their birth, their 3 years of life, and their future with the highest hopes and aspirations any father can have throughout all generations of fatherhood. Today I sing our love story, and I sing Happy Birthday to my Sky Bear and Sage Monkey. Happy birthday. I love you a lot—te amo mucho. 
PROVIDING FOR A CORRECTION IN THE ENROLLMENT OF H.R. 1625 Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I send to the desk a concurrent resolution providing for a correction in the enrollment of H.R. 1625, and I ask unanimous consent for its immediate consideration in the House. The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. CURTIS ). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New Jersey? There was no objection. The text of the concurrent resolution is as follows: 
H. C ON. RES. 116 Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), That in the enrollment of the bill H.R. 1625, the Clerk of the House of Representatives shall make the following correction: Amend the long title so as to read: ‘‘Making appropriations for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2018, and for other purposes.’’. 
The concurrent resolution was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
HOUR OF MEETING ON TOMORROW Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 10 a.m. tomorrow. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New Jersey? There was no objection. 
60 YEARS OF THE PIONEER CENTER FOR HUMAN SERVICES (Mr. HULTGREN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. HULTGREN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank and congratulate the Pioneer Center for Human Services for 60 years of serving the people of McHenry County, Illinois. The Pioneer Center was founded in 1958 out of a mother’s desire to provide greater opportunities for her daughter with Down syndrome. Since then, it has provided services for members of the community facing developmental disabilities, homelessness, and behavioral health issues. I am always impressed by the compassion and energy of Pioneer Center employees when I visit their facilities, which now include 17 group homes, a homeless shelter, a transitional home, and a family and child therapy center. Mr. Speaker, 4,500 men, women, and children are served every year, including 95 who are annually employed in local jobs through the Community Employment Services Program. Last year alone, individuals logged 8,500 hours of community activity, everything from attending classes at the gym to visiting a farmer’s market and taking community college courses. I am proud to celebrate with the Pioneer Center for Human Services as they continue to empower individuals to achieve their full potential. 
RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION (Mr. HUFFMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, despite the Kremlin’s lies, all facts lead to the conclusion that Vladimir Putin tried to murder Sergei Skripal, a former Russian double agent, in broad daylight on British soil. Great Britain strongly condemned Russia, and because Britain is our closest ally, our Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, did what we would expect from him: he forcefully condemned the crime and vowed the U.S. would hold Russia accountable. But within hours, Tillerson was fired. Now, we know about the strains between President Trump and Tillerson: Trump has mocked him for favoring diplomacy with North Korea; they have disagreed over the Iran nuclear deal; and it didn’t help when Tillerson reportedly called Trump a moron. But none of that cost Tillerson his job. It was only when he aggressively condemned Putin that he crossed the reddest of redlines for Donald Trump. Why is Trump so afraid of Putin that he would fire his own Secretary of State for talking tough on Russia? Why does he constantly fawn over Putin, even calling to congratulate him for winning a fake election this week? You would think the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence would be asking these questions, but, instead, they have shut down their Russia investigation. This stinks, Mr. Speaker. What are they trying to hide from the American people? The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. f 
PAYING TRIBUTE TO PRIVATE RUDOLPH JOHNSON (Mr. HILL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to pay tribute to Arkansas native Rudy Johnson. Former Private Rudy Johnson will be laid to rest at the Arkansas State Veterans Cemetery in North Little Rock this Friday, 73 years after he was killed in action during World War II. Private Johnson was drafted into the Army in 1943 and was assigned to the 93nd Division, nicknamed the Buffalo Soldiers and the only AfricanAmerican division to see combat in Europe during World War II. Rudy was stationed in northern Italy, fighting against German forces when his unit reported that he was killed in action in 1945 at the age of 20. Private Johnson’s remains were finally identified after DNA analysis in 2016, and he was flown home this week to rest where his journey began. Rudy’s sacrifice for Arkansas and America will never be forgotten, and I join his family and all Arkansans in welcoming him back home for his final rest. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF JESSICA KLYMCHUK (Mr. KIHUEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Jessica Klymchuk. Jessica was the mother of three daughters and one son. She was an educational assistant, bus driver, and librarian at St. Stephen’s School in Valleyview, Alberta, Canada, for 4 years. She went to the Route 91 festival in Las Vegas on October 1 with her fiance, Brent. The couple had recently been engaged and looked forward to their wedding. Jessica always put her family first and loved camping with them. She is remembered for being a loving woman who always worked hard and dedicated her life to her children. I would like to extend my condolences to Jessica’s family and friends. Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada, and the whole country grieve with you. f 
PROTECT MINNESOTA’S LIBERIAN COMMUNITY (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, time is running out. Unless the administration takes action by March 31, members of Minnesota’s Liberian community who have been here for more than 20 years after fleeing a vicious civil war and making new lives here in the United States could be forced to leave. Minnesota is home to one of the largest Liberian communities in the country. More than 16,000 Liberians, including 4,000 children, have made Minnesota their home, and for decades, they have been productive members of our society and our economy. Since the early 1990s, Presidents of both parties have ensured that they can stay. A bipartisan group of my colleagues and I are asking and joining together to ask the President to act to do the same. I have also coauthored bipartisan legislation to allow these families to stay because, Mr. Speaker, we are asking the President: Don’t let this happen. Do the right thing. These families are fundamentally American, and they are a part of the very fabric of what we have in Minnesota as a community. 
HONORING DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. (Mr. COHEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, while we are on recess, the city of Memphis, Tennessee, will be the center of civil rights history as the 50th anniversary of the tragic assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., will be memorialized on April 4 in Memphis, where he was slain. At the Lorraine Motel where he was staying and killed, a great civil rights museum has sprung up like a phoenix from the ashes, the great history of the civil rights movement. At that spot, at the same time he was killed, there will 
be a bell ringing, and there will be civil rights leaders from all over the country in Memphis to mark the occasion: our own JOHN LEWIS, Andrew Young, Danny Glover, and Cary Kennedy. There are so many that I shouldn’t start, but they will be there to honor Dr. King’s memory. Dr. King’s dream is not fulfilled yet. We need to continue to work to make his dream fulfilled in this country to where everybody, regardless of their race or their gender, for that matter, or their sexual orientation, has an opportunity to climb ladders of opportunity to participate in the American Dream and have a successful life and be a part of the middle class, if possible. I hope everybody will give some thought to Dr. King and his dream on April 4. 
THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC (Mr. MESSER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MESSER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support President Trump’s plan to tackle the opioid epidemic, a crisis that has plagued communities and devastated families all across Indiana. In Indiana, roughly 40 percent more people die from drug overdoses than they do from car accidents. Since 2010, opioidrelated deaths have nearly tripled in my State. It is past time to address the opioid epidemic and get serious about saving lives. Growing up in the 1980s, Nancy Reagan’s Just Say No campaign had a real impact on my life, and I applaud President Trump’s plan to do more to educate young people about the horrific effects of drug use. I also support the President’s plan to address the opioid crisis by securing our border, stopping the flow of drugs pouring into our country, and reducing rampant prescription drug abuse. The President is right. For the worst drug traffickers, the death penalty should be an option. Today we took a big step in the right direction, but more must be done to help families dealing with the devastating effects of opioid abuse. 
b1330 FRIENDSHIP CIRCLE WALK (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of the annual Walking 4 Friendship event. This past March 18, friends, families, and neighbors from my congressional district walked three kilometers to promote awareness and acceptance of children, teens, and young adults with special needs. More than 1,000 of my constituents walked to raise support for The Friendship Circle of Miami. This volunteer organization provides a number of social, recreational, and educational programs for some of the most vulnerable members of our society and helps them build lasting friendships. Mr. Speaker, the positive impact of The Friendship Circle is felt widely throughout our community and brings so much joy and comfort to young people with special needs and their families. I would like to thank the countless volunteers and local sponsors who make this organization and this wonderful annual event possible. Let us not forget their theme: Together, we can perform miracles. f 
MARY’S CUPBOARD (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to the issue of food insecurity, affecting nearly 1.6 million people in my home State of Pennsylvania. In our district, that is 1.6 million too many. I am proud to recognize the efforts of Mary’s Cupboard in Levittown, Pennsylvania, a food pantry which has served nearly 86,000 individuals since its inception in 1976. Operating in conjunction with Catholic Social Services, Mary’s Cupboard offers both perishable and nonperishable food items. Their standard practice is to provide a family with 5 days’ worth of food. I would like to recognize founder Marion Slack and operations coordinators Betty Rommet and Ann Hyjurick, who, along with the assistance of partnering parishes St. Ignatius in Yardley, St. Andrew in Newton, St. Cyril of Jerusalem in Jamison, and St. Michael the Archangel in Levittown, bring hope and peace of mind to their neighbors on a daily basis. Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of us to follow their lead and work to eradicate hunger in all of our communities. 
REMOVAL OF NAME OF MEMBER AS COSPONSOR OF H.R. 4760 Mr. COFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that my name be removed as a cosponsor of H.R. 4760. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Colorado? There was no objection. 
NEW HARTFORD, NEW YORK, CELEBRATES ITS 230TH ANNIVERSARY (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the 230th anniversary of the settlement of my hometown, New Hartford, New York. New Hartford was settled in early 1877 by Jedediah Sanger, who was in search of the American Dream. By 1789, Jedediah had brought his entire family to New Hartford and built a sawmill and gristmill. The village began to flourish with farmers who provided New Hartford and the surrounding communities with fresh produce and a variety of dairy products. Today, the town of New Hartford strives to maintain Jedediah Sanger’s original vision and ideas. It is home to numerous retail stores, restaurants, and churches, while remaining an extremely civicminded and generous community. In fact, our own New Hartford Central School District, my alma mater and the same school from which my son graduated from 30 years later, consistently ranks as one of the very best schools in New York State and among the top public schools in the country. Fun fact: I actually live across the street from the house I grew up in, my childhood home, and I now live in a home that I purchased from our former Congressman, Alexander Pirnie, who once served in this great Chamber. Please join me in honoring and celebrating the 230th anniversary of New Hartford, New York. f 
SALUTING CAREGIVERS OF ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE (Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to salute the caregivers who support those living with Alzheimer’s disease or a related dementia in our community. Over 5 million Americans have Alzheimer’s disease, including 5,000 in my home county of Butte in northern California. It is also the most expensive disease in America. Medicare and Medicaid pay twothirds of all the costs. This is unacceptable and unsustainable. This is a tremendous burden to our country. From my perspective, if we are going to have a shot at reducing government spending, we have to advance the movement to cure Alzheimer’s and do something to lower the cost of care and also reduce the burden on families who suffer as they watch their loved ones dealing with this disease. This is why I joined 32 of my House colleagues in cosponsoring the BOLD Infrastructure for Alzheimer’s Act. This would create a public health response to Alzheimer’s and would help educate community members and doctors on dementia detection, diagnosis, symptom management, even brain health and prevention of dementia. I will continue to fight for quality, affordable healthcare for seniors nationwide. We must do everything in our 
power to preserve Medicare and Medicaid for future generations. 
FUNDING ISSUES (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, just a few minutes ago, we passed a major omnibus appropriations bill, of which I had the privilege of submitting over 30 requests. Frankly, I am thankful for the funding I received on behalf of the 18th Congressional District of Texas. It is a tradition that I pride myself in. I also take pride in the work of the Appropriations Committee in working on behalf of the American people. It is also important to take note of the fact that—as we have done positive things, it is also important to note some issues that I have concern with. First of all, I want to acknowledge that there is no limit for the funding for Planned Parenthood, which is part of my constituency, which helps young women with their health. There is opioid funding and VA funding. I am most happy with the childcare funding and for TIGER grants. But what we need more of, even though we had 450,000 new certificates for the disabled, is Section 8 vouchers for seniors and families. We need to be able to insist that the quality of housing is best. As I finish, Mr. Speaker, let me just say that in the effort to stop school gun violence, I am disappointed that there are no civil rights protections to make sure we aren’t pointing out Hispanics and Latinos differently from other children, as well as no DACA relief for our children. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, it is always an honor to address this Hallowed Hall, sometimes more hallowed than others, but today was a bit of a sad day for some of us. The Federalist reported the headline: Congress Rushes Towards Spending Vote to Prevent a Shutdown. ‘‘Congressional leaders released a $1.3 trillion government spending plan for the rest of the fiscal year and asked lawmakers to begin voting on it with only hours to read and analyze the 2,232page text. ‘‘The measure is wide ranging, with funds for fencing on the U.S.Mexico border, combating opioid addiction and building new roads, along with incentives to bolster reporting to a database for gunbuyer background checks.’’ I have got to assert, Mr. Speaker, that this fix NICS bill, as it’s been called, leaves in place a practice that has been going on. It grieved me greatly that Republicans would rush to embrace this thing, which allows the practice that the Obama administration started that administrative procedures by unelected, unaccountabletovoters bureaucrats could decide people were not, in their opinion, entitled to have their Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. We have heard accounts of people who didn’t realize that they were being questioned in a way that would be used to take their guns away and their right to keep and bear arms to protect themselves, to engage in selfdefense, and the VA is the most notorious. Simply asking a question like, ‘‘Who takes care of your checkbook finances?’’ and answer anything like, ‘‘Oh, my wife takes care of that,’’ then a matter of weeks later, a letter is received saying you don’t have a right to have a gun. It is amazing that the Obama administration would start such an unconstitutional practice, and it is, to me, even more grievous that Republicans would participate in a bill that says it is going to correct a problem and make America safer when, actually, what it does will not make a difference in the mass shootings that have occurred. But in the tradition of Congress, if there is a problem, too often people in this body feel it is not important that we do something that will make a difference; it is just important that we look like we are doing something. That is really where the fix NICS bill came into play. It really wouldn’t make people safer. It will add some restrictiveness, and it allows this heinous practice of having some bureaucrat at the VA just decide that a veteran who served his or her 
Nation valiantly, qualified to use a weapon, can’t have a weapon. b1445 Forget the Constitution. We are the VA, and we decide you don’t get one. Rather egregious. But most egregious of all, we have about half a year to go, and we just voted $1.3 trillion to be spent between now and the end of the fiscal year, which ends midnight September 30. Quite tragic. And we are told, over and over, by pollsters that the American public doesn’t want to hear about process, how laws are made, or if some rules are violated. They don’t care about those things. But the fact is, just like America and each State has laws, and if those laws are not observed, we hasten the demise of a Democratic Republic, this little experiment in selfgovernment. And when it comes to the rules of the House, when we don’t go through the normal regular orders, it is called, which just means following the rules for how we pass a law, then the product is not going to be nearly as good. And that is what we have in the bill that was passed today. It is really immoral. Going back as far as we are aware in North America, parents have traditionally wanted for their child or their children more opportunity, better opportunity, a better life, than the parent had growing up and going forward. Yet, now for the last 50 years, we have had generations engaged in being all about themselves, and that includes my generation. Not all of us, but enough that we could pass a bill a month or so ago and then pass another one today that heaps hundreds of billions of dollars of debt onto our children, our grandchildren, that they didn’t run up. This is totally different. It is so immoral. It is totally different from what generations of Americans have wanted: something better for their kids. Yet here we are. It is as if we go into a bank and say: I need a loan. Well, what is your collateral? How are you going to pay? Oh, I am not going to pay. I can’t pay. But I have got all my children, got some grandchildren someday, and they will pay. Well, what do you need the money for? Because I can’t stop spending money. I just can’t control myself. So I am going to have my kids and grandkids pay someday, because all I can do is spend, and that is where we are. There is an obligation for each generation to be accountable for their actions to future generations. And there has been so much debt run up. Of course, when I got here 13 years ago, we had crossed over into $10 trillion in debt, $11 trillion, and all of a sudden, in 8 years, we hit $20 trillion. It was incredible. The biggest part of that hit during the 4 years where the Democratic majority controlled the House and the Senate, and those 2 years in which the Democrat majority in the House and Senate was also linked up with President Obama, a Democrat in the White House, and the debt exploded. But when we bring a bill to the floor like came today, didn’t go through regular order, it did not go through committee process, and I can’t know for sure, I heard there were two, I heard there were four people negotiating. I heard that it was staff members who were doing the negotiation. And for heaven’s sake, if we are going to have staff members negotiating numbers that involve $1 trillion that our children and grandchildren will have to pay, let’s at least get better staff members to do the negotiation for the sake of our kids. It is really tragic what has been going on. I was just reading an article a moment ago with a statement from Minority Leader PELOSI , in which she indicated they had won the negotiation, they got lots more of what they wanted than did those in the majority and than did the President himself. Unfortunately, though the President is an amazing negotiator, he graciously allowed the House leaders and the Democratic leaders to do the negotiating. And I would encourage the President, I know he wants better deals than this atrocity, but we need his negotiating skills involved to get a better product. This article from Chad Pergram says: ‘‘With $1.2 trillion omnibus bill topping 2,200 pages, Congress needs CliffsNotes.’’ I have another from Jacob Sullum: ‘‘Fix NICS bill would help block gun sales to peaceful people.’’ And Jacob Sullum is right about that. This from August 11, 2016, they are pointing out that the background checks, which were proposed in part of this bill that passed in the House today, would not be effective. The headline says: ‘‘Background Checks: Ineffective, unconstitutional, and dangerous.’’ It says: ‘‘Background checks were sold to gun owners as a bill of goods in the 1990s. But consider how ineffective, and dangerous, they have become to our Second Amendment rights: ‘‘Number 1, roughly 95 percent of NICS denials are ‘false positives,’ which means most of the people who are being denied are not the people that want to hold up the neighborhood grocery store. ‘‘Number 2, for the last year on record, only 13 prohibited persons were convicted for trying to illegally purchase a gun—when more than 10 million guns were sold.’’ Pretty amazing. Only 13. And this was back in the Obama administration. Of course, we know they weren’t enforcing the law. They had the weakest gun violation enforcement of any administration in the last 50 years, all the while demanding tougher laws, gun laws and gun restrictions, when they were doing the worst job of just enforcing the laws we had. So out of 10 million guns that had background checks and were approved for sale, only 13 were convicted of trying to illegally purchase a gun. The article continues: ‘‘And the inspector general’s report in 2016 found that the Justice Department’’—and again, this is during the Obama administration—‘‘only refers an average of 32 prosecutions per year under the Brady Law.’’ ‘‘That is not surprising, since good people can be denied their Second Amendment rights for outstanding traffic tickets, that result in a bench warrant . . . for having the same name as a bad guy . . . or for having engaged in a bar fight 50 years ago. ‘‘Number 3, because of the NICS system, there are now more than 250,000 military veterans who cannot purchase firearms from a gun dealer—and the Obama administration tried to disqualify tens of thousands of otherwise lawabiding seniors in similar fashion.’’ I want to inject here. Just because a senior citizen has his or her adult child take care of their checkbook, it does not mean that that senior citizen does not know when their home is being broken into and they need to protect themselves. Number 4 in this article says: ‘‘And what if you’re blocked from buying a gun because you’re illegitimately denied by the NICS check? Well, according to USA Today, the Obama administration illegally diverted every single one of its FBI appeal examiners to other duties, making it impossible for the agency to overturn people’s denials and creating a huge backlog. ‘‘Number 5, every time a gun dealer contacts the NICS system and a background check is conducted, there is the potential that gun buyers’ names will be retained—despite prohibitions to the contrary. This data retention and the potential for gun owner registration is a constant concern for gun owners, given the expansive backup system at the FBI. Not only that, the General Accounting Office found in 2016 that the ATF had illegally retained the names of thousands of gun owners. ‘‘Number 6, forcing lawabiding citizens to get ‘permission’ to exercise a constitutionally protected right can result in harmful delays—and even death. Consider Carol Bowne of New Jersey who tried to get a gun for protection . . . was forced to wait several weeks during the screening process . . . and was ultimately stabbed to death by the man she wanted to defend herself against. ‘‘Gun control is denying the rights of lawabiding Americans, while not making us any safer.’’ And that is the thing. We hear these constant proposals for more background checks. A proposal that is being pushed, we have got to have background checks when someone gives or sells a gun to another individual when that person selling or giving the gun is not a firearms dealer, they are not in the business, which means a father to a 
son, or a mother to a daughter. This push to get background checks when, as my friend John Lott’s research has shown not one mass shooting in the last 100 years has resulted from a gun that was given or purchased in a lawful transfer person to person. So that kind of idea wouldn’t help save any lives. If we are going to do something, at least do something that saves lives, makes a difference. But we know that, in Rwanda, there was a horrendous period in which 800,000 human beings were slaughtered with machetes. We know that the worst attack with the most horrendous murders in our U.S. history, on our soil, happened on September 11, 2001, and the weapon that was used was a box cutter. We know that the Boston Marathon bombing, in which people were killed and maimed, a pressure cooker was used. We know that in Austin, Texas, a sick criminal mind killed two people and wounded a number of others. There is a lot of talk about ending gun violence without a thought about ending violence. Oklahoma City, that was ammonium nitrate, that was fertilizer, used as a bomb. I keep coming back to the quote of President John Adams in 1798, when he said so prophetically and analytically: ‘‘Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.’’ b1500 That is really where we are. Do we want to end gun violence or do we want to end violence? Some of us would like to end violence. 800,000 human beings that are killed with machetes are just as dead as 800,000 killed with a bomb or a gun. Actually, they most likely suffered a great deal more than if they were killed with a gun. A gun is like the law itself. It can be used to protect. During my 4 years in the Army, we were trained to use a weapon for protection of the United States and our Constitution. We took an oath to do that. We were never in combat in my 4 years, but that is what we were trained for. It was not an assault weapon. It was a protective weapon to protect our country. So when we hear all this talk that maybe it is time to again ban assault weapons, any weapon is an assault weapon. Any weapon is also a defensive weapon. It is all about the hands of those who are holding the weapon. We also know for a fact that the years in which socalled assault weapons were banned, it made absolutely no difference. We also know that in cities where there is the most strenuous gun laws, you often find the most violent number of gun attacks. The Wall Street Journal had an article some time back talking about the mentality of those who use a gun and kill and engage in a mass shooting. They said that almost invariably these are control freaks. Their idea, their thought is ‘‘I have got to be in control,’’ so they want to go to a place where no one else will have a gun. They intentionally want to be somewhere where nobody else has a gun. That is their mentality. They want to be in control. It is not uncommon to have happen what happened in Austin, when the bomber there was about to be captured, he took his own life because of the fear they are going to lose control, so they take that one last act of control and kill themselves. So will we save more lives if we let lawabiding people have guns and do what the Obama administration refused to do more than any other administration in modern history, and that is prosecute people who violate the law in trying to obtain a gun illegally? I submit to you that the latter is the best way to go. We are better off allowing lawabiding citizens to have the guns just as the Constitution intended. Coming back again to John Adams’ quote, we have suffered through a time in American history where people on the far left politically have been saying, in essence, there is no real right or wrong. What may be wrong for you may be right for somebody else, so it is all relative. There is no absolute right and wrong. C.S. Lewis pointed out that it is like music. Although some people will come closer to singing the proper note, just because many can’t doesn’t mean that note does not exist. The law does exist, and some will come closer to following the law more easily. The law exists, and it must be enforced. That is one of the things that has made the United States so successful, to become as it was, the greatest country in the history of the world—I would humbly submit, even greater than Solomon’s Israel, because Americans had more freedoms, more opportunities, and more assets. This is the first time that I can find in history, anywhere, anytime, that the number one health problem for a nation’s poor was obesity. That just doesn’t happen through history, but it is happening here in the United States. If you go back to the founding, you had people, most of whom were Christians, but all of whom wanted to have a country where Christians were not persecuted for their Christian beliefs. Now we have had the Christian religion so slandered and defamed that, even by government entities, it has been called a hate group. Evangelical Christians— which just means these are Christians who so love and honor God and believe they are going to Heaven when they die that they want others to have the opportunity to go to Heaven to be in paradise with Jesus. Yet in this perverse time, we have people belittling Christianity and Christian beliefs like has never happened in the history of this country. I think a majority of Americans believe we have been blessed beyond measure because a majority of Americans did have an abiding faith in God Almighty, and you had a majority that believed that Jesus was not a liar, that He was not a lunatic, but that He was the Lord just as He said: 
I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one goes to the Father but by Me. 
So a believer in Christianity believes if you don’t believe in Jesus Christ, you can’t go to Heaven. So either Jesus meant what He said and He was the Son of God, or He was a lunatic, because that is a crazy statement if it is not true, or He is just a liar, like David Koresh. Yet now the perversion has come and the attack has come that this religion, the one religion that is completely and truly based on love, that God so loved the world He sent His Son, and His Son so loved the world He laid down His life so that anyone who believed in Him could be in paradise in the next life, that is being called a hate religion, and Christians are being persecuted. For the first time in American history, America doesn’t seem to care about Christians being slaughtered and a type of genocide going on in the Middle East of Christians. The prior administration made very, very clear that their priority was not the Christians who were being slaughtered by the thousands in the Middle East; it was Muslim refugees. And that is why there was such a tiny, tiny percentage of Christian refugees who were allowed into the United States when compared to the percentage of Christians living in the Middle East where the refugees were coming from. It is a sobering time, and it only makes sense that, when we reach a time when Christianity is maligned, defamed, and persecuted, that it is a time the Bible talks about: Right is wrong; wrong is right. Those that try to hold to the right as God gives them to see the right, that, gee, those folks are said to be crazy, and if not crazy, hatemongers. They are not hatemongers. But when we get into that period of time, it made sense. Priorities are completely askew, and the generation in charge thinks of themselves and does not think about what is going to happen to that generation’s children. When one thinks about it, and with the scientific advancements we have, we know that a heart is beating inside that little child in the mother’s loving womb. It is a real person with a beating heart. Janet Porter and others have talked about, with regard to the Heartbeat bill: What happens if you see someone appearing to be unconscious, lying down? You run over and check: Is there a heartbeat? If there is a heartbeat, then you call the ambulance and you do everything you can to save that life. Mr. Speaker, it is a dangerous time, and it is time to become a moral nation again. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
