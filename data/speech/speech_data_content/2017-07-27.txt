Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the plight of the Oromo people of Ethiopia. The Oromo are Ethiopia’s largest ethnic group, with a population of more than 25 million, or 35 percent of Ethiopia’s total population. I speak here on behalf of one of my constituents, Ms. Seenaa Jimjimo, who is of Oromo descent. Ms. Jimjimo is the president of the Coalition for Oromo Human Rights and Democracy. The coalition is dedicated to bringing the suffering of the Oromo people and other Ethiopians to the attention of Americans and the world. She impressed me with her passion for defending the rights of her people, and that is why I bring this issue to the floor. Human rights in Ethiopia have been subject to deteriorating conditions for over a decade, with a sharp decline since 2014, making an already difficult situation even worse. The Ethiopian Government has adopted laws restricting freedom of expression, association, and assembly, including rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the Ethiopian constitution. These violations have been widely decried by numerous international bodies and nongovernmental organizations. Our own State Department has said the following about Ethiopia: ‘‘The most significant human rights problems included harassment and intimidation of opposition members and supporters and journalists; alleged torture, beating, abuse, mistreatment of detainees by security forces and politically motivated trials.’’ Free expression is curtailed by laws permitting the government to punish speech it disagrees with up to 5 years in prison. In just 2016, security forces killed at least 1,000 and held more than 28,000 newly arrested persons in detention centers. In the midst of the difficult situation for all Ethiopians, the situation for the Oromo people is particularly dire. The Ethiopian Government released the Addis Ababa Master Plan, which sought to expand the capital into the Oromia region. The plan would displace millions of farmers, carve Oromia into two regions, changing the livelihood of 36 Oromia towns and 17 districts by hurting the livelihoods and lives of the Oromo without consulting the Oromo. The Oromo protests erupted in November 2015 in response. The Ethiopian Government admitted the use of excessive force. A Human Rights Watch report described interviews of hundreds of people who survived gruesome and inhumane acts by security forces. Even so, no one has been brought to justice. According to the State Department report, the government also recently won what appears to have been a rigged election. The deaths of thousands of Oromos and other Ethiopians cannot bring a lasting solution to the country’s mounting problems, yet the Ethiopian Government continues to receive money for its role in the Somalia and Sudan peacekeeping missions. We must ask how long the United States should keep financing a regime that has received $30 billion in foreign assistance since it came into power in 1991, and reportedly has stolen virtually all of it. In honor of thousands of Oromo people who have been savagely murdered, injured, arrested, and have been victims of enforced disappearance, I now join my colleagues in cosponsoring House Resolution 128, which calls for supporting respect for human rights and encouraging inclusive governance in Ethiopia. This resolution sends a clear and strong message to the Ethiopian movement and government by letting them know that we keep a vigilant eye on the suffering that some minorities have been going through in recent years and the offenses that caused these sufferings. Many Ethiopians who dare to speak up against the current government are being treated badly all across Ethiopia. Oromos are being singled out. Consider the case of Bekele Gerba. He was arrested upon his return from the United States, where he spoke to several Members of Congress. Now he stands charged with terrorism, although after a year and a half, the government has been unable to produce a 
single document to back up their accusation. Even as the Ethiopian Government has admitted to arresting 28,000 people, there is reason to believe the number is closer to 80,000. We must condemn violence against peaceful protestors, unlawful arrests, inhumane treatment, and the withholding of key human rights. The Government of Ethiopia has an obligation to care for all its people, including the Oromo. As the United States, we should stand with the people of Ethiopia and help the Ethiopian Government return to the path of peace and democracy. 
MAX PAGE SAYS CHILDREN’S HEALTHCARE NEEDS A BIPARTISAN SOLUTION The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. RUIZ) for 5 minutes. Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, with all the political rhetoric, the fingerpointing, and the many versions of TrumpCare, hyperpartisan politicians often forget what this debate is all about. It is about people, about relieving a person’s pain and suffering, about giving a person a chance to live a healthy and happy life. It is about Max Page. Maybe you will remember him. Max was the mini Darth Vader from a Super Bowl commercial in 2011 who captured our hearts. Max was born with tetralogy of Fallot, a rare and deadly congenital heart defect. Throughout his 12 years, Max has had more than 10 heart surgeries under the loving care at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles. He lives every day with a pacemaker and an artificial pulmonary valve. Open heart surgeries are complex and very serious surgeries. They are tough on patients, with often a long recovery, and grueling for the family. Max stopped by my office a few days ago to talk about his experience, and he told me: ‘‘I am going to have my condition all my life. I am going to have surgery as a constant commotion on my life. I just want to be covered. I don’t want to have to worry about insurance and how I am going to pay these bills. I just want to focus on keeping myself healthy and not having to sacrifice everything for a surgery.’’ Max wants to play baseball. He loves Harry Potter, and he dreams of being an actor. Earlier this year, Max was in the hospital for treatments for an entire month. His mom, Jennifer, described how they were feeling bummed one day after such a long and arduous hospital stay. They decided to take a walk, and on their walk they met a boy Max’s age named Will. Will is still in the hospital today. He has been there 9 months waiting desperately for a heart transplant. Max told me how Will has spent every holiday and even his birthday in the hospital this year. Max wanted to do something for Will, so they had these bracelets made. He named them ‘‘Will Power.’’ They have Max’s favorite verse on them. Max and Will connected. They developed a bond bound by compassion. Their hope for a normal life gave them strength and friendship, and Max promised Will he would bring the bracelets to Congress when they came. Philippians 4:13: ‘‘I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.’’ Max and Will, that is my favorite verse, too. Max is fighting to protect other kids like him and Will, people with a preexisting illness, from losing coverage and having to pay more from facing a lifetime path on coverage. He came to tell the stories of so many other children he knows from his many hospital visits. His message is simple: ‘‘Children’s healthcare needs a bipartisan solution.’’ Max and Will and all the friends they have made in the hospital aren’t rooting for Democrats or Republicans. They are fighting for their life and rooting for each other. They are children who want to get healthy, who want to stay healthy and care for one another. We can all learn from Max’s and Will’s selfless courage to help others. Stop the hyperpartisan fight to score political points and start fostering a bond through compassion. Let’s find a way to protect healthcare for Max and Will. In the midst of this healthcare fight, we should take a moment to pause and remember that goal. Let’s be like Max and think of others as we come together to find a bipartisan solution to address what isn’t working, and remember Max’s message: Children’s healthcare, all healthcare, must and should be a bipartisan issue. 
A TRIBUTE IN MEMORY OF PAMELA TODD MAY The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. ROGERS ) for 5 minutes. Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the memory of a dear friend and advocate for eastern Kentuckians, Pamela Todd May. Although her life tragically ended too soon, she lived with endless compassion for those in need, and abounding devotion to our region, the Pikeville Medical Center, the University of Kentucky, her husband, Walter May, her children, and all her family and friends. Pam May lived with consummate elegance, always joyous in service, and loyal in deed. She faithfully dedicated more than three decades of service to the Pikeville Medical Center as a steadfast advocate for expanded access to quality healthcare in Kentucky’s rural Appalachian region. As founder of one of the most respected law firms in Kentucky, Pam was as trustworthy defender for the people of eastern Kentucky and a voice for those who otherwise may not be heard. One of the most recent examples of her endless and selfless service was her prompt action to help hundreds of individuals obtain medical records for Social Security hearings and honorable representation in the wake of emergency redetermination hearings by the Social Security Administration. She partnered with local attorneys and orchestrated hope for hundreds of families desperate for assistance while navigating through Federal hearings. Pam was a thoughtful leader you could rely on to stay steps ahead of everyone else. My wife, Cynthia, and I mourn the loss of our treasured friend, yet we rejoice in the legacy of justice and compassion that she leaves behind. Those of us who were blessed to know Pam must carry on her banner of hope and love for the people of our region. Mr. Speaker, eastern Kentucky is a better place because Pam May lived. If we could replicate her passion and drive, our future would undoubtedly be much brighter in the hills of Appalachia. Mr. Speaker, Cynthia and I extend our deepest heartfelt condolences to our friend and confidant, Walter May, as well as Pam’s mother, children, and extended family and friends who were honored to know and love her. f 
THE GOP’S FAILURE TO GOVERN The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER ) for 5 minutes. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, it is now 7 months since the start of the 115th Congress, and 6 months since Republicans have controlled all the levers of power of our government, and all we have seen are broken promises. Donald Trump and our Republican colleagues in Congress ran on a platform that included healthcare for everyone, massive investments in infrastructure, tax reform, and a dramatic increase in jobs. On all four of these, there has been zero progress, zero legislation sent to the President, and zero effort to work with Democrats to achieve any of those objectives. Donald Trump promised voters that he would be ‘‘the greatest job President that God ever created.’’ b1015 Yet neither he nor the Republican congressional leadership have put forward a comprehensive jobs bill. Instead, he and his Republican allies in the Congress have proposed budgets that would slash investments in education, infrastructure, and research, all areas that directly help our economy create jobs. In fact, jobs that the President claimed to have saved are going overseas. Forecasters are now predicting slower economic growth, and manufacturing average weekly earnings have 
RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF THE AMERICAN FARMER The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK ) for 5 minutes. Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, with the fall season fast approaching, Bucks County’s robust agricultural community is in full swing with the impending harvests, summer fairs, community projects, and recognition of the important work of the American farm family. In a few weeks, Bucks County will celebrate their 69th annual Middletown Grange Fair. From Wednesday, August 16, through Sunday, August 20, attendees from across our community 
will have the amazing opportunity to come together to enjoy live entertainment, timeless carnival rides, tons of local food, animal demonstrations, and 4–H projects on display. Crowds will gather to see the antique equipment competition and exhibits in hundreds of categories ranging from a variety of vegetables, tomatoes, fresh flowers, and livestock to handcrafted quilts, jewelry, and woodwork. Mr. Speaker, as an annual attendee, I have seen firsthand how the Grange Fair brings our community together to enjoy the refreshing success of our local agricultural community. It is an event that helps people gain a better appreciation of the importance of agriculture and how the agricultural industry sustains our local economy—not to mention all of the jobs that it creates. We love our farmers in Bucks County. They have contributed so much to our community. They are an indispensable part of Bucks County’s past, and they will remain an indispensable part of Bucks County’s future. 
INVEST IN THE NATION’S INFRASTRUCTURE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. COSTA ) for 5 minutes. Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to our Nation’s infrastructure. I am talking about our roads, our bridges, our rail corridors, our waterways and dams, the investments that over two centuries have made America great, the greatest economy in the world. We have a long history of investing in the infrastructure in America, starting with the canal and rail systems in the 19th century, the highways and air transportation systems in the 20th century. However, over the last 25 years, we have lived off the infrastructure investments our parents and grandparents made in the previous generations. Why? Because there has been a lack of political will here in Washington, D.C., to make new investments. But Congress, working with the President, must face this challenge headon. I believe there is bipartisan support for infrastructure investment, having been part of a bipartisan conversation this year with Members of Congress and with the administration. There is an attempt to offer a proposal to make major investments in our Nation’s infrastructure. We are talking about four different areas. First, there needs to be an incentive component. I strongly support incentivizing States and local governments to provide their own funding for these efforts. We know infrastructure projects move forward most effectively when local, State, and the Federal Government all do their part. In the San Joaquin Valley in my district, Merced, Madera, and Fresno Counties have all increased their local sales tax to pay for critical transportation projects. Earlier this year, California enacted a bill to increase State gas tax and vehicle fees to provide over $52 billion over the next 10 years in California for muchneeded transportation projects. And while more needs to be done in California, we know that, if we provide incentives across the country, States ought to come up and do their part as well. The second focus of the administration’s action is to support projects in rural areas. On Wednesday last week, the Agriculture Committee held a hearing in which we discussed strategic infrastructure investments in rural areas with a goal of increasing opportunities. The importance of investing in our rural areas cannot be overstated. Too often, rural America gets left behind in the infrastructure and development conversation. I know because I represent a large part of rural America in the San Joaquin Valley in California. The third focus is transformative projects, projects that make creative and dramatic changes. I have always supported and will continue to support these projects, such as highspeed rail in California, California WaterFix. b1030 Water is so critical to the West, especially in the San Joaquin Valley. Water provides the food that we have on America’s dinner table every night. It is a national security issue. These projects support deeper, systemic change, and they can have a largescale and lasting impact on the future development of our Nation. They are investments in our future, like those our parents and grandparents made in the past. Lastly, the administration talks about a loan program. These can be helpful. Overall, I support these four components. But first we must not pick winners and losers when improving our Nation’s infrastructure. This is, of course, very challenging. We need to have a policy that must rank priorities and decide how much we spend and where we spend. We also must establish criteria to ensure infrastructure decisions promote fair distribution and cost effectiveness, doing the most good in critical areas. Second, while I support publicprivate partnerships, they should not provide subsidies to projects that the private sector would already finance themselves. Sound infrastructure is literally and figuratively the foundation of our Nation’s economy. It is what has made America the greatest economy in the world. Countries around the world are making investments in their infrastructure while the United States sits on the sidelines engaging in a political debate that does not reflect the reality of the policy choice we have and the decisions we must make. Mr. Speaker, we must come together as Democrats and Republicans to address these serious problems of our Nation’s infrastructure, and as Americans in a bipartisan way because no transportation system, no water infrastructure system, no improvement in our energy grid, and all the other elements of our infrastructure are Democratic or Republican. They are the basis of an investment in America, and that is what we should be doing as Members of Congress with this administration. So let’s act as legislators. Let’s act and show that we can work together in a bipartisan fashion. Let’s show some profiles in courage. f 
THE BILL IMPORTANT TO ALL AMERICANS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON ) for 5 minutes. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, as we prepare the next farm bill, I rise today to speak about the impact that agriculture has on the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, our farmers, our economy, and our communities. Agriculture is the number one industry in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. We proudly boast 58,200 farms, totaling more than 7.7 million acres of farmland. These farms contribute to a total economic impact of $45 billion from production, food processing, marketing, transportation, and manufacturing. Mr. Speaker, the farm bill affects everyone in Pennsylvania in various ways, just as it does families throughout the United States of America. It provides a safety net for farmers and ranchers during difficult times. It supports infrastructure and economic development in rural communities. It incentivizes good conservation practices to protect our farmland and our environment. It helps provide access to nutritious, quality food for the least fortunate among us, as well as breakfasts and lunches for our schoolchildren. The farm bill’s effects can be felt beyond the ag industry. In 2015, the USDA rated the market value of all agricultural production in Pennsylvania at $8.7 billion, and agricultural exports contributed $2 billion to the State economy. The strengthening impact that agriculture has on the Pennsylvania economy is significant and undeniable, yet it is only one example of agriculture’s vast influence on the lives of everyone in the Commonwealth. Agriculture employs our residents, provides better health for our communities, and promotes agricultural exports. Agriculture touches the lives of millions of Americans, and not just those who work as farmers or ranchers. Pennsylvania’s farmers look to the farm bill to protect their livelihood from weather disasters, to provide them a safety net when times are hard, and to ensure their ability to support their families and their communities. 
Over 6 years, the USDA has invested more than $1.4 billion in Pennsylvania for programs that promote new markets for farm and ranch products. These programs provide revenue and price loss payments to eligible producers. This legislation ensures that eligible acres are afforded disaster assistance in light of natural disasters and droughts, providing our farmers with a safeguard against the unpredictable elements of weather. Beyond supporting our farmers, the farm bill fortifies Pennsylvania’s infrastructure. The bill provides funding for the expansion of telecommunications, the improvement of water and wastewater infrastructure, and the construction of community facilities like fire stations, hospitals, and libraries. It promotes growth in the community, the health of our children, and the wellbeing of Pennsylvania families. In 2016, more than 65 million breakfasts were served to more than 386,000 children in the School Breakfast Program. Last year, the State served more than 173 million lunches to 1 million students who participate in the program. Programs such as WIC, the Women, Infants, and Children program; and SNAP, the Supplemental Food and Nutrition Program, help people in need put food on their tables. The farm bill truly impacts the lives of so many. Mr. Speaker, as vice chairman of the Agriculture Committee and chairman of the Nutrition Subcommittee, I look forward to producing a strong farm bill that will promote sound policies for agriculture in Pennsylvania and throughout the country. 
REVIEWING PRESIDENT TRUMP’S FIRST 6 MONTHS IN OFFICE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. POCAN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, we are now at the 6month point in President Trump’s time in office, and I think it is time we check in and do his review. President Trump has made a lot of campaign promises, and we should take a look at how he is living up to them. First, creating jobs. Let’s start with his claims that he would be the ‘‘greatest jobs producer that God ever created.’’ We haven’t seen any major action on President Trump’s jobs plan. His infrastructure week included no concrete details—pardon the pun—and his Made in America week meant nothing because his own products have long been made overseas. Despite bragging that he was saving jobs at Carrier in Indiana, we have learned that Carrier is laying off 600 employees this month and sending those jobs to Mexico. After the Trump administration lobbied hard for Ford to not move to Mexico, Ford announced it was moving the production of its Focus model to China instead. Not exactly a deal closer. As for creating jobs, that is an F. Draining the swamp. How about his promises to drain the swamp? President Trump has stacked his administration with insiders, opened the floodgates to more lobbyists, and is loading his administration with so many Goldman Sachs employees that the CEO of Goldman Sachs called it an ‘‘inconvenience.’’ Donald Trump hasn’t drained the swamp. He has merely built a highrise luxury condo on it. That will get him an F as well. Accomplishments. President Trump has yet to sign any major legislative accomplishments into law. From repealing the Affordable Care Act to tax reform, to an infrastructure package, not one of his major initiatives has yet made it through Congress in over 6 months. Now, that may be good news for the working men and women of this country, but, still, as a grade, that gets him an F. Tweeting. Now, we have seen a lot of action on Twitter from this President, from insulting women and threatening journalists to relitigating the election against Secretary Clinton and shouting ‘‘fake news.’’ In fact, President Trump tweeted 991 times in his first 6 months in office with ‘‘fake news’’ being mentioned almost twice as much as the word ‘‘jobs.’’ While he scores high on the volume of tweets, he is low on the content of tweets, so we are going to give him an incomplete in this area. Golfing. President Trump’s second favorite activity after tweeting is golfing. According to CNN, in his first 6 months, President Trump spent 21 of his first 26 weekends in office at Trump properties and spent 40 days at Trump branded golf properties. So he is golfing for sure. Let’s give him an A. Covfefe. Now, that is not a word in the dictionary or that I know in the universe. I guess only Donald Trump knows what it really means, so I am guessing he would give himself an A because there isn’t a grade higher until he invents one of those, too. But for the rest of us, that is not even incomplete. That is just incoherent. Conflicts of interest. American taxpayers have been footing the bill for pricey trips to Trump branded properties and trips benefiting the Trump family business in Canada, Uruguay, MaraLago in Florida, New York, and many others places. President Trump’s failure to separate himself from his conflicts of interest shows special interest groups around the world that influence can be sold to the highest bidder. I will give him an A because apparently he is excelling at selling out potential. Job approval. President Trump has finished first in one area. We all know he likes to be a winner. With a 36 percent approval rating, President Trump is the first President to have that low of a 6month approval rating of any President in polls dating back 70 years. So from the American people, apparently that is an F. This has not been an impressive first 6 months, Mr. Speaker. If this were a reality show, I think we would be hearing the famous ‘‘you are fired, Mr. President.’’ But outside of that 6 months, just this week, Mr. Speaker, Donald Trump embarrassed himself with inappropriate comments before the Boy Scouts and insulted transgender Americans serving in the military. My only question, Mr. Speaker, is: When will the leadership on the other side of the aisle quit enabling him and start standing up for this country? America is not a reality show. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. f 
IN MEMORY OF PFC JAMES T. STANFORD The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. ADERHOLT ) for 5 minutes. Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, this morning, I would like to recognize Marine Private First Class James T. Stanford for his duty, his selfless service, and his sacrifice to our great Nation. Stanford was a native of Gadsden, Alabama, and he lost his life back in 1954 after a devastating explosion on board the aircraft carrier USS Bennington. I am honored to recognize Private First Class Stanford this morning, who made the ultimate sacrifice in service to our great Nation. Stanford attended Gadsden High School in Gadsden, Alabama, before enlisting in the United States Marine Corps on February 21, 1953. After completing basic training at Parris Island, South Carolina, he was assigned to the USS Bennington in June 1953. On May 26, 1954, the USS Bennington was sailing off the coast of Rhode Island for aircraft carrier qualification when hydraulic fluid from a forward catapult caught fire. The resulting explosion caused massive damage to the forward portion of the ship. It resulted in over 200 casualties, including 103 sailors and marines who lost their lives that day. On May 28, 1954, Private First Class James Stanford, at just 20 years old, succumbed to his critical burn wounds and passed away at Newport Naval Hospital in Rhode Island. By his side were his wife, the former Lou Moore; and his father, Mr. J.C. Stanford. James and his wife, Lou, had recently celebrated their first wedding anniversary. Mr. Speaker, may the sacrifice of Private First Class James T. Stanford and the other 102 sailors and marines who lost their lives as a result of that explosion onboard the USS Bennington on May 26, 1954, never be forgotten, and may those individuals be remembered as they gave their all. 
FUNDING A BORDER WALL The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. O’ROURKE ) for 5 minutes. Mr. O’ROURKE. Mr. Speaker, later this evening, perhaps early tomorrow morning, this body will be voting on a series of appropriations measures to fund our armed services and the VA. Tacked on to that, at the whim of the chairman of the Rules Committee, in what I can only describe as the most undemocratic, unrepresentative fashion, is a provision to fund a border wall between the United States and the country of Mexico to the tune of $1.6 billion, a mere down payment on total construction costs which are estimated to be over $20 billion. I think it is important, Mr. Speaker, that we keep in mind some very basic facts; the first being that the border between the United States and Mexico has never been safer or more secure. b1045 Last year and the year before, we saw recordlow levels of northbound apprehensions from Mexico. If you look at where we were in the year 2000, you had 1.6 million apprehensions from Mexico. Last year, you had a little over 400,000. Do you know who so many of those apprehensions were? They were kids, young families, scared and frightened, leaving the most horrific brutality that we can imagine from the Northern Triangle countries of Central America, literally fleeing for their lives to this country, which is comprised of immigrants, refugees, and asylum seekers, and is the very foundation of our success. Apparently, this is who we are trying to wall off and protect ourselves from with this $1.6 billion boondoggle. We now see, in the last 4 years, that more Mexican nationals are leaving the United States for Mexico than are coming north from that country into ours. We have twice the Border Patrol agents that we did in 2001: 20,000 Border Patrol agents. Today, you and I, the American taxpayer, are spending $19.5 billion a year. We are long past the point of diminishing returns with this very precious public resource. We are trying to solve, Mr. Speaker, a problem that we don’t have. Case in point: the city that I have the honor of serving and representing, El Paso, Texas, is regularly ranked the top, the second, or the third safest city, not just in Texas, but in the entire United States, using FBI crime statistics as crunched by CQ Press. We are the safest community, yes, because we have excellent local and Federal law enforcement, including the Border Patrol. But we are also the safest city because of, and not in spite of, the fact that a quarter of the people who I represent were born in another country, most of them in Mexico. They are not, Mr. Speaker, the rapists and criminals that thenCandidate Trump would have us believe that they are. So, if there is no rational, logical, factbased case for a wall, why in the world would we be spending $1.6 billion on this, instead of creating more jobs or ensuring that more Americans can see a doctor or that more kids can go to a great school with excellent public school teachers? Here are some of the other consequences. There was excellent reporting in The Texas Observer, followed up by the LA Times, on the Santa Ana National Wildlife Refuge. It is about 10 miles southeast of McAllen, Texas. It is the last refuge for the ocelot, for 400 different species of birds, bobcats, and armadillos. They are planning to build the wall right through that refuge. That belongs to you, me, our families, and our descendants. That is our heritage that we are about to wall off and destroy. We are dividing communities; we are diminishing our relationship with Mexico, who should be our closest partner; and we are making our communities, including El Paso and other communities in Texas, less safe, as we militarize them and as people who live amongst us question whether they can go to local law enforcement to report a crime, serve as a witness, testify in a case, or help contribute to the safety of our communities. Let me bring this fact to your attention, Mr. Speaker. On Sunday, in a Walmart parking lot in San Antonio, Texas, the bodies of nine dead immigrants were found in the back of a trailer. A tenth died later in the hospital. Tuesday morning, in El Paso, three bodies, including those of children, were dredged out of the canal that joins us with Cuidad Juarez and Mexico. Mr. Speaker, since 1998, 7,000 people— human beings—have died trying to cross into the United States. As we further militarize and wall up and make it harder for people to come as legitimate asylum seekers; refugees; folks who want to work in our economy; people who want to join their families, be with their moms, dads, brothers, and sisters, their children, we ensure greater suffering and death. Mr. Speaker, we do not need a wall. We need comprehensive immigration reform. We need to treat each other with dignity and respect. That ensures our safety, security, and success. 
VETERANS HOUSING The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. GALLAGHER ) for 5 minutes. Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of veterans across the State of Wisconsin who have put themselves in harm’s way to defend this Nation. As citizens, we have a clear moral obligation to ensure that they are able to receive the quality care that they need, deserve, and earned. The Department of Veterans Affairs is predicated on this very idea. Wisconsin Veterans Home at King, in my district, is a facility for homeless and atrisk veterans in northeast Wisconsin. Just last week, veterans housed there were notified the VA would no longer renew grants for housing programs, an action that will result in the closing of this facility by the end of the calendar year. This unfortunate news has caused significant stress, uncertainty, and anxiety among the veterans community in northeast Wisconsin, and specifically among the veterans at King, who now face the possibility of homelessness. We cannot let this happen. We would be abandoning our duty if we let this happen. That is why I was proud to coauthor a letter with the Speaker of the House, PAULRYAN, requesting answers from Secretary Shulkin on this vital matter. While we await answers, we must continue to bring attention to the concerns of our veterans and remain committed to working together across the aisle to ensure that our veterans receive the housing and care they vitally need and care that they have earned. 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Speaker, I had the honor last week of welcoming a group of American heroes who journeyed from northeast Wisconsin to Washington, D.C., aboard the Old Glory Honor Flight. Generations of veterans, representing every major conflict since World War II, visited the very monuments that honor their courage and commitment. Just as these vets visited their respective memorials, so, too, should the brave men and women who have served and continue to serve in the ongoing war on terrorism in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the war that I was fighting 8 years ago. They, too, should have something to honor their sacrifice. Under current law, a war must be over for at least 10 years before a memorial can be built in its honor. That is why Representative MOULTON and I have introduced legislation that would allow for a global war on terrorism memorial. This war is unlike any preceding it. It has no end date. There will be no victory date, no VJ Day. Threats continue to rise, and so the longest ongoing conflict continues. After 15 years, and over 6,800 American lives lost, there is still no end in sight. This memorial is for the brave men and women who have died fighting, who continue to fight, and are still joining the fight against terrorism. If we are going to continue passing the torch from one generation to the next, we need to build this memorial so that future generations never forget their duty to do the same and to pass that torch. 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Speaker, agriculture is a driving force behind our economy and a way of life in northeast 
Wisconsin, which is why I was honored that Farm Technology Days decided to hold their annual event in Kewaunee County at Ebert Dairy Enterprises, an impressive sixthgeneration family farm in Algoma. Farm Technology Days is the largest agricultural show in Wisconsin, and one of the largest in the Nation. The 3 day event showcases the latest improvements in production agriculture, recent research findings, and technological developments. Mr. Speaker, 15,000 hamburgers and 11,000 bowls of ice cream later, the event was a huge success for our local ag economy. The first day alone saw an attendance of over 10,000 people. Because of the hard work of the Ebert family and the nearly 2,000 volunteers who pitched in, northeast Wisconsin was able to demonstrate the powerful role we play in Wisconsin’s agriculture industry. 
AVERTING A CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. ALGREEN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to defend the Constitution and avert a constitutional crisis. I rise, Mr. Speaker, to defend democracy. I rise to protect the Republic. I rise to prevent a constitutional crisis that would be created, should any rogue President attempt to pardon himself. Let me be clear, Mr. Speaker: I do not believe that a President can pardon himself. The ability to pardon is the ability to forgive. I do not believe that a President can forgive himself for crimes committed. I do not believe that the Constitution allows a President to forgive himself for the most egregious crimes barred by our laws. I do not believe that a President could pardon himself or forgive himself for the crime of treason. I do not believe that this country would allow such a thing to exist, and if a President attempted to do it, we would have a constitutional crisis. So I rise today to prevent a constitutional crisis. I don’t believe that the Constitution would allow it, but I want to prevent the crisis, should some rogue President attempt it. So, Mr. Speaker, I have a simple amendment to the Constitution that would avert this crisis. It reads: The President shall have no power to grant to himself a reprieve or pardon for an offense against the United States. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the great and noble American ideals that we hold dear and that we protect with everything that is near and dear to us. We use our very bodies to protect it. Our men and women will go to distant places to protect these noble and great ideals, and many don’t return the same way they left. These ideals would be put at risk if some rogue President decided to pardon himself. We would have a constitutional crisis. I am honored, Mr. Speaker, to say that this amendment will be filed later today, and there are two other Members of Congress that I am proud to have associated with me on this amendment. They are the Honorable BRADSHERMAN and the Honorable S ETH MOULTON . We are filing this amendment not because we believe that a President can selfpardon, but if some President attempted to do it, this amendment would be there for us to act expeditiously and prevent it. Mr. Speaker, this is the solution that I hope we never have to use. I pray that this amendment never has to be pushed through, but I am so proud to have it there, in the event it is needed. 
POW/MIA SELECT COMMITTEE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. PAULSEN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, the fourth line in the Warrior Ethos reads: ‘‘I will never leave a fallen comrade.’’ Every soldier who passes through Army basic training knows this motto, and truly it is the spirit of our entire military. Currently, more than 75,000 Americans are unaccounted for from conflicts ranging from World War II to the war on terror. We must continue to vindicate the spirit of the Warrior Ethos and aid our military to make sure that we never leave any servicemembers behind, which is why I am cosponsoring a resolution for the creation of a Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs in the House. This select committee will be responsible for investigating these unaccounted for servicemembers and finally bring peace of mind and closure to their families. So, Mr. Speaker, it is appropriate that we not abandon this obligation and that we help our brave servicemembers never leave behind a fallen comrade. 
Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, sharks are being killed 30 percent faster than they are able to reproduce, which is having a serious impact on our ocean’s ecosytem. One contributor to this decline is an inhumane practice that is known as ‘‘finning.’’ Finning is the removal of the fins from a shark and, often times, is done while the shark is still alive. These fins are mostly used for shark fin soup, which is a traditional soup seen in many Asian countries. After harvesting the fins, these sharks are thrown back into the ocean, where they are left to die from suffocation, blood loss, or be killed by other predators, since they have no way of having an opportunity to defend themselves. That is why I am cosponsoring the Shark Fins Elimination Act, which will make it illegal to possess, buy, or sell shark fins, unless the shark was lawfully taken with a license or permit. This bipartisan effort will protect the fragility of our ocean wildlife and prevent these cruel practices. f 
b1100 TRUMPCARE AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California (Ms. MAXINE WATERS ) for 5 minutes. The gentlewoman will suspend. The Chair would advise the gentlewoman to remove the chart from the well. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, would the Chair tell us why. The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is the determination of the Chair that it is a breach of the decorum of the House. The gentlewoman may proceed. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, yesterday was the 27th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act. It is a day to reflect on how people with disabilities are treated in our society. Our President indicated to us what he thinks about people with disabilities long before he was elected when he mocked a disabled reporter. Mocking the disabled is rude and insensitive, and it sends a terrible message to our children. Who are the disabled people who were mocked that day? They are veterans who lost a limb or suffered a traumatic brain injury while courageously serving our country. They are children who were born with serious medical conditions like autism, Down syndrome, and cerebral palsy. They are victims of workplace accidents and car accidents. They are victims of mass shootings and terrorist attacks. They are senior citizens in nursing homes. They are our mothers and fathers, our brothers and sisters, our friends and neighbors, and our children. They might be with us today or they may be with us a year from now. They deserve to be treated with respect, and they deserve quality healthcare. Given that we already know about the attitudes that have been displayed against them, it should come as no surprise that TrumpCare would have a devastating impact on people with disabilities. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has scored several versions of TrumpCare. Most would cause at least 22 million people to lose their health insurance. The socalled repeal only bill, which repeals the Affordable Care Act and does not replace it with anything, would cause 32 million people to lose their health insurance. Even the socalled skinny TrumpCare would cause 16 million people to lose health insurance and increase premiums by 20 percent. 
When people with disabilities lose their health insurance, they cannot get affordable treatment for their medical conditions; and when healthy people lose their health insurance and then become disabled, they, too, will not be able to find affordable treatment for their injuries. Furthermore, when they try to find a new health policy, their disability will be considered a preexisting condition. TrumpCare cuts more than $700 billion from Medicaid. According to an analysis by the Center for American Progress, more than 15 million children and adults with disabilities rely on Medicaid for their health coverage and could lose it if TrumpCare became law. The President’s budget would also have a very devastating impact on all people with disabilities. Trump’s budget cuts $50 billion over the next 10 years from benefits earned by American veterans who are unable to work because of a serviceconnected disability. His budget cuts billions from Social Security Disability Insurance, which provides earned benefits to workers who become disabled after years of paying Social Security taxes on their earnings. His budget cuts billions from Supplemental Security Income, which protects vulnerable people with disabilities, including 1.2 million children who suffer from conditions such as Down syndrome, cerebral palsy, autism, intellectual disabilities, and blindness. His budget cuts funding for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act by $113 million, jeopardizing special education services for students with disabilities. His budget cuts funding for housing for persons with disabilities by 20 percent. His budget eliminates the Limb Loss Resource Center and the Paralysis Resource Center, which cuts support for people with traumatic brain injuries by 67 percent and cuts funding for the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities by 26 percent. It even eliminates Special Olympics Education. In conclusion, people with disabilities deserve better. That is why we must raise our voices to support them, oppose these budget cuts that target them, and protect their healthcare. Stopping TrumpCare is not about politics. It is a matter of life and death, and this is especially true for people with disabilities. 
IN REMEMBRANCE OF STEVE ROCKFORD The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS) for 5 minutes. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of my friend, Steve Rockford, who passed away last week following his 5 year battle with ALS, Lou Gehrig’s disease. I first met Steve when he came here to Washington, D.C., to advocate on behalf of more funding for ALS research, and I was really struck by his courageously uplifting demeanor in the midst of a very dark prognosis. Steve came to my office, was all smiles, brought me this pack of cards where his card was on the top. As you can see right here, Steve leaves behind his wife, Tammie, and his five children. While this terrible disease attacked Steve’s body, it really never touched his resolve. He held a positive and inspirational mindset throughout not only the diagnosis and his treatments, but throughout his fight against ALS. He never let Lou Gehrig’s disease bring him down. Steve actually sent me text messages every day, and it is sad that I don’t get them anymore, and we know why. His text messages would have Biblical verses, inspirational messages from a man who was fighting a disease that he knew he was not going to live through. That tells you a lot about Steve Rockford, a former wrestling coach at Southeast High School in Springfield, Illinois. He is somebody who taught others how to lift themselves up. And while he was fighting the fight of his life, he taught me what it was like to be lifted up by someone so special. ALS is a devastating disease. It attacks the body. It never stops relenting. It is estimated that 20,000 people have this disease at any given time, and only 20 percent of those affected with ALS live more than 5 years after diagnosis. We must follow Steve’s request to fund research at the National Institutes of Health to ensure that diseases like ALS are eradicated and that those afflicted with the disease have access to home health services and rehabilitation equipment. While facing a debilitating disease and diagnosis, as you can tell, Steve did not despair, falter, or surrender. Steve Rockford is a hero to me. He is a hero to many in his hometown of Springfield, Illinois. I am a better man for knowing Steve Rockford. Please continue to keep his wife, Tammie, and their five beautiful children right here in this picture, please keep them in your thoughts and prayers. Steve, we are going to miss you. I am sure you are having fun up there. f 
PRAYER Dr. George Dillard, Peachtree City Christian Church, Peachtree City, Georgia, offered the following prayer: Almighty God, we humbly come before You as leaders in a nation that seems to have lost its way. We seek Your help this day and in the future, Your guidance to help us return to a place where liberty and justice is for all. Remind us that liberty and justice go hand in hand and that liberty cannot exist if there is not justice for the innocent. Teach us to protect life, to be a refuge for immigrants, the unborn, the aged, the orphaned, the widows, the homeless, the family, the oppressed, those in danger, every race, and our veterans. Help us to see that unity is stronger than division. Remind us that consensus without truth is confusion and that power without control is destructive. Remind us again that out of the many should come the one. Give us compassion, strength under control, humility and grace. Lead us, Father, through this valley that we might stand on the mountain proclaiming with one voice that we are the united people of America. In Jesus Christ’s name. Amen. 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman from New York (Mr. FASO) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. FASO led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
WELCOMING DR. GEORGE DILLARD The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. FERGUSON ) is recognized for 1 minute. There was no objection. Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Dr. George Dillard, whose leadership and guidance have made him a valuable member of the community in Peachtree City and Georgia’s Third District. 
George was born in 1958, in Jacksonville, Florida, while his dad served in the Navy. He grew up in the Eastpoint Christian Church where he was ordained into ministry in 1982. He graduated with a bachelor of science degree from Atlanta Christian College in 1983, and answered the call for the First Christian Church in Rincon, Georgia, in 1985, where he began his first fulltime ministry. In 1993, George and his family moved to Peachtree City to serve the Peachtree City Christian Church, where he continues today. George has been married to his wife, Renee, since 1988, and they have three children and one grandchild. George and his family live in Peachtree City, Georgia. I want to commend Dr. Dillard for his commitment to our community. There is not a week that goes by where George isn’t a visible and welcoming part of the Fayette County community. The grace and love he has shown his parishioners and neighbors throughout his 24 years in Peachtree City is unparalleled. I am truly honored to have Dr. George Dillard here with us here today. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. FASO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and congratulate Mr. Ralph P. Avery of Claverack, New York, who will soon be awarded the French Legion of Honor Medal. Mr. Avery served in the U.S. Navy during World War II as a crew member of an LCT–571 landing craft built in upstate New York. He bravely stormed Omaha Beach on Dday in defense of our freedoms and in service of European liberation. On that historic day, he courageously manned a 20millimeter gun, firing upon enemy positions. For his heroic actions in combat and their importance to our French allies, next month Mr. Avery will be formally awarded the French Legion of Honor Medal, France’s highest honor. Mr. Avery has been awarded the American Campaign Medal, the European African Middle East Campaign Medal with a Campaign Star for the invasion of Normandy, the Navy Combat Action Ribbon, and the World War II Victory Medal. Mr. Speaker, we thank Ralph P. Avery and his fellow veterans for their outstanding service to America and the cause of liberty. f 
THE BORDER WALL IS EXPENSIVE AND UNNECESSARY (Mr. BROWN of Maryland asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Speaker, President Trump’s immigration policies are unpopular. They don’t protect our national security and don’t promote our ideals as a nation. Nowhere is that more apparent than his repeated calls for a border wall. This wall is so unpopular and nonsensical that the House has now resorted to funding it without even a straight upordown vote. Why are they doing this? Not only to give the President a muchneeded win, but to fool the American taxpayer who was repeatedly promised that Mexico would pay for this wall. The border wall is expensive and unnecessary. It is opposed not only by a huge majority of Americans, but also by those living on the border. Now, Members of Congress are being forced to choose between voting for the wall and voting to fund our military. I support our servicemembers. I spent 30 years in Active and Reserve Duty. I am a member of the House Armed Services Committee. I want to improve the readiness of our Armed Forces, but I cannot and will not support a multi billion dollar wall that Members of both sides of the aisle now know is unnecessary and ineffective. I will not throw away $1.6 billion to feed the President’s ego. On this issue, the American people deserve to know exactly where their representatives stand. 
PEACE CORPS ANGEL ABROAD— JENNIFER MAMOLA (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Jennifer Mamola represents the very best of America. She volunteered for the Peace Corps at 26 and served in Uganda. While there, tragically, she was hit from behind by a drunk driver, breaking both of her legs. Her life changed forever. When she returned home to America, she faced an uphill battle to get treatment and endless bureaucracy. After 3 months, the Peace Corps stopped covering her medical costs and sent her to face the bureaucracy of the Department of Labor. Instead of serving as a resource, the Peace Corps’ postservice unit was no help at all. When she reached out asking for mental health services, they ignored her. She has undergone four surgeries and endless hours of agony. America’s angels abroad deserve better. My legislation will ensure that Peace Corps volunteers have medical care in foreign countries and in America when they return home. I want to welcome Jennifer to the House Chamber today. Congress appreciates her service as a Peace Corps volunteer, and we must provide help for wonderful people like her. And that is just the way it is. f 
DON’T POLITICIZE NATIONAL SECURITY POLICYMAKING IN CONGRESS (Mrs. MURPHY of Florida asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, the House is currently considering the minibus, which would fund certain Federal agencies in the next fiscal year. As a former Pentagon aide, I have opposed efforts to politicize national security policymaking in Congress. That is why I introduced a bill to bar political operatives from serving on the National Security Council, and was proud when Steve Bannon was removed from the NSC. The minibus provides robust funding for the Defense Department, the same funding that I proudly voted to authorize as a member of the Armed Services Committee. Sadly, House leadership has taken a strong bipartisan bill and contaminated it by adding a provision assigning $1.6 billion to construct a border wall. This provision is opposed by public officials from both parties who actually live along the southwest border, and it will do nothing to keep my constituents in central Florida safe. The money could be better spent to expand an underfunded counterterrorism program that Orlando has been excluded from, or to enhance security at our air and seaports. In short, this funding should be used to give the American people real security, not politically motivated gimmicks. 
MORRISVILLE 12U SOFTBALL TEAM WINS PENNSYLVANIA STATE TITLE (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Morrisville 12U Softball Team. These incredible young athletes from our district won the Pennsylvania State title and advanced to the regional tournament in Bristol, Connecticut, to represent the entire State of Pennsylvania. Not only did these young ladies play an incredible season, of which they should be extremely proud, they did so while honoring a member of our community. The team dedicated their postseason play to the memory of Ms. Donna Rossi, a committed league volunteer and supporter who passed away following a battle with cancer shortly before the first district game. 
Mr. Speaker, I am so proud of the accomplishments of these young ladies: Ainsley McClure; Rowan Mulholland; Katey Brennan; Molly Milewski; Ella Visco; Laney Freiband; Caitlyn Martell; Ahlana Sesar; Quinn McGonigle; Emma Hause; Riley Mahony; Hannah Hawkes; Brielle Crawford; and managers and coaches Joe Sesar, Andy Mahony, and Tim Hawkes. Each one of these individuals should be proud of the example they have set both on and off the field. They do credit to themselves, to their families, and to our community, and we are so proud of them. 
PROTECTING DACA (Mr. COSTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak about the American Dream and those who need protection who are striving to fulfill it. These are individuals who have come to this country as children, as infants, through no fault of their own, and America is the only country they have ever known. In essence, they are Americans. Recognizing these realities, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program was created in 2012, otherwise known as DACA. Since that time, DACA has granted hundreds of thousands of young immigrants the stability and the protection needed to pursue a college degree and seek employment, to be a part of America’s future. If we eliminate DACA, these students could see their pursuit of the American Dream swept away beneath them. In California’s San Joaquin Valley, this could happen to over 500 students at the University of California, Merced, who I represent, as well as over 1,000 students at Fresno State University. Some here in Washington plan on trying to eliminate DACA in coming months, and I stand here to say we cannot let that happen. I urge the administration and those to stand with those of us who want to protect the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and allow these folks to pursue the same American Dream that our parents, grandparents, and previous generations were able to do. Let’s keep DACA. 
PANAMA CITY BEACH AND GOVERNMENT RED TAPE (Mr. DUNN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight a prime example of how needless government regulation is wasting both taxpayers’ time and money. In my district in Florida, on the beautiful Gulf Coast, we are susceptible to hurricanes with damaging winds and flooding. Sometimes roads get washed out. Back in November of 2014, Panama City Beach applied for a Federal grant from FEMA to improve drainage and alleviate flooding of Front Beach Road. The project involves the installation of just two culverts under the road for storm runoff. This is not building the pyramids. Three years later, local officials have submitted more than 900 pages of paperwork and spent countless hours working on this application. All this is for a project that will take just 1 week to construct and involves a grant of only $170,000. Mr. Speaker, this is exactly the kind of crushing red tape that our constituents face on a regular basis, and this is what we are working to fix. f 
SUPPORTING THE RUSSIA, IRAN, AND NORTH KOREA SANCTIONS ACT (Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3364, the Russia, Iran, and North Korea Sanctions Act. These sanctions are critical to countering aggressive and destabilizing actions by Russia, Iran, and North Korea, sending a strong message at a critical moment. Iran has continued its illegal ballistic missile program, its support for terrorism, and its atrocious human rights record; North Korea has continued to pursue its dangerous development of nuclear weapons; Russia has maintained its aggression in Ukraine, its illegal occupation of Crimea, and its destabilizing actions in Syria. These sanctions also send a long overdue response to the Kremlin’s attacks on our elections here at home. I commend this body for coming together on this important American national security issue. I call upon the Senate to pass this legislation and for the President to sign it. 
b1215 SOUTH CAROLINA IS RIGHT FOR BUSINESSES (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, this week The Boyd Company released their annual report confirming that South Carolina is the best State to locate or expand a business for jobs. As reported in The Spartanburg HeraldJournal on Monday, the Palmetto State ranks the lowest in the Nation in annual operating costs for advanced manufacturing companies. This success is also improved by low property taxes and being a righttowork State, which has helped recruit highquality jobs for South Carolina families by remarkable companies, including BMW, Michelin, Boeing, Volvo, MTU, and more. South Carolina is also a competitive State to create jobs because of our educated workforce. Working with readySC and Apprenticeship Carolina, businesses have technical colleges to close the skills gap and hire employees for highly technical jobs, enhanced with positive Federal legislation. I appreciate the leadership of local chambers of commerce in creating jobs, working with Governor Henry McMaster and Secretary of Commerce Bobby Hitt. In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. f 
WASTEFUL SPENDING ON BORDER WALL (Mr. GONZALEZ of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. GONZALEZ of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak out against the wasteful spending of $1.6 billion of taxpayers’ money. These funds will be used to construct unnecessary barriers along our Southern border, destroying wildlife habitats, and violating property rights of Americans. If we want to be more secure, we should appropriately fund to address CBP staffing issues, to maintain and upgrade aerostats and other technology, and to provide CBP with the resources it actually needs to continue maintaining a safe and secure border. Building a wall along our Southern border will put us on the wrong side of history. It will also be a shameful act in front of the international community that is watching us. Mr. Speaker, I support the Department of Homeland Security’s mission to safeguard the American people, our homeland, and our values. These are not our values. But the congressional misallocation of over $1.5 billion does not help to accomplish this goal. I urge my colleagues to oppose the funding of this expensive, unnecessary wall. I call on them to find more productive and effective uses of this fund in a way that better helps the American people and is on the right side of American history. 
RECOGNIZING MARIENVILLE VOLUNTEER FIRE COMPANY ON 125 YEARS (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Marienville Volunteer Fire Company as it celebrates 125 years of service on Saturday, August 19. The 
Marienville Volunteer Fire Company began in 1892 at the home of Dan Moriarty as a small group of men with a wagon, a pump, and a determination to keep their community safe. In 1902, a great fire ripped through the area, destroying a substantial section of Marienville. In response, the company came together to raise money for better equipment, and soon became a wellorganized department with official uniforms, its first fire truck, and a firehouse on North Forest Street. As the team grew, a new building was built on North Forest Street that still houses the company today. Today there are about 40 active members under the direction of President Randall Parrett and Fire Chief Greg Geyer. As a statecertified firefighter, EMT, and rescue technician myself, I know these firefighters are always ready to answer the call. Mr. Speaker, I proudly congratulate the Marienville Volunteer Fire Company on this outstanding milestone, and I thank each member of the company for their service. 
HONORING RAMON ANIBAL RAMOS, A TRUE LEADER (Mr. ESPAILLAT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ramon Anibal Ramos, a leading communicator and television producer born in Ingenio Angelina, San Pedro de Macoris, in the Dominican Republic. Ramon has had a long and successful career. Ramon obtained his passport through the ‘‘‘Fiesta’ de Tele Antillas’’ program. His show, the ‘‘Ramon Anibal Show,’’ is focused on the dissemination of positive news, positive stories about people, particularly immigrants that have excelled in America, and particularly in New York. Throughout all of this time, particularly during the negative antiimmigrant rhetoric that is going on right now, including this week’s push to build a divisive border wall, Ramon Anibal is the embodiment of being an immigrant, a pioneer, and successful contributor to our community. Thank you, Ramon, for being such a role model and leader in our community. Ramon Anibal Ramos, ‘‘the best of cable,’’ ‘‘lo mejor del cable.’’ 
IN HONOR OF THE RETIREMENT OF JUDGE FRED A. STINE (Mr. MASSIE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of the retirement of Judge Fred A. Stine, the Chief Circuit Court Judge of the 17th Judicial Circuit in Campbell County, Kentucky. Judge Stine graduated from the University of Cincinnati in 1973, and received his J.D. from the Salmon P. Chase College of Law at Northern Kentucky University in 1978. He then worked in private practice for 2 years until his appointment as the Assistant United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Kentucky. Judge Stine has honorably served the Commonwealth as circuit court judge since 2005. He has many awards, which include a Distinguished Service Recognition from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and a Special Recognition for Victims’ Rights from the U.S. Department of Justice. Throughout his career and despite his heavy case docket, Judge Stine selflessly gave his time to serve his community. Judge Stine is a true public servant who has served his State and Nation well. On behalf of the Commonwealth of Kentucky and all of the citizens of the Fourth District, I am honored to wish Judge Fred A. Stine the very best in his retirement. Thank you from us all. f 
BORDER WALL FUNDING IN MINIBUS PACKAGE (Mr. SOTO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, recall President Trump’s promise on the campaign trail: we will build a wall and have Mexico pay for it. Not only is it costly and unnecessary, but it will do more to divide America than it will to keep us safe. First, taking the fact that Mexico is not paying for it, nor would anybody in their right mind think that Mexico was ever going to pay for it, now he is asking for $1.6 billion of Americans’ hardworking taxpayers to pay for it. We already have 650 miles of border fencing, but representing the Sunshine State, with over 1,000 miles of coastline, this isn’t going to make us safer. It is not going to help us at all. And then you look to how there are racial undertones to this. Notice how there is a focus on the Southern border, but not the Northern border? While I would not support that, we can’t help but notice that this is focused on dividing America on racial lines, on making us less safe and on wasting taxpayer dollars. It is time to unite America. It is time to look forward to a safer America, and spend our money on the Coast Guard, on custom border control, and other works that will make us safer. 
REPEAL INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS’ CLASSIFICATION (Mr. BIGGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, during my ‘‘Freedom Fridays’’ series, each week I highlight burdensome regulations that limit American freedom. This week, my focus is on the Obama administration’s net neutrality policy. The internet is one of the greatest innovations ever. This has largely been possible because of the Federal Government’s regulatory absence from the industry. Yet the Obama administration, in one of many cases of overregulation, took a radical step to inappropriately insert government interference. In 2015, the FCC adopted a rule to reclassify internet service providers as ‘‘common carriers’’ under title II of the Communications Act of 1934. This reclassification caused undue burdens for American ISPs and consumers. The Trump administration has been supportive of rolling back the Obama era regulation. Now Congress needs to limit the authority of Federal bureaucrats and preserve a free and open internet. We should repeal the 2015 rule and prevent the FCC from issuing a similar rule. Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in restoring internet freedom. f 
OPPOSE FUNDING FOR BORDER WALL (Ms. MOORE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, Americans don’t want to pay a single dime of Federal money to pay for the President’s wall. During the Presidential campaign, this was a very provocative claim, and he said Mexico would pay for it. So why does the defense appropriations bill have a blank check for this wall? I, like so many of my colleagues, including Republicans, know that this wall is unnecessary and environmentally catastrophic. It will require us to seize property through imminent domain. It is ineffective, just like Homeland Security Secretary Kelly has said. I urge my colleagues to oppose funding for this illgotten wall, to vote against the rule before us today, and begin to work on an honest conversation about the types of immigration reform that our country needs. 
SUPPORT THE GENERAL AVIATION COMMUNITY (Mr. ROKITA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. ROKITA. Mr. Speaker, I was disappointed last week to read about some criticizing the general aviation community as a ‘‘special interest group’’ that was trying to stand in the way of progress and modernization. We are for modernization, as modernization has already taken off, and we have been partners from the very beginning. The fact of the matter is 
that GA is not some special interest group. We are family, friends, and neighbors. There are doctors, teachers, community leaders, and, most importantly, small businessmen that rely on general aviation to create jobs. They are just like, in fact, my son, Ryan, who is with us today, who absolutely loves aviation and wants to be a pilot when he grows up. And that is because he has been exposed to general aviation. General aviation is an important part of our community and our economy. It employs 1.2 million people and adds $219 billion, Mr. Speaker, of economic output. So I ask my colleagues to side with general aviation on any bill that comes to the floor, like the one that came out of the Transportation Committee, and vote against such measures. Moving a system where everyone is treated equally to a system where one user benefits over another is a bad idea and one that we should reject as anathema to American exceptionalism. 
DEMOCRACY IS IN JEOPARDY (Mr. COHEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the Judiciary Committee brought before the House a motion of inquiry that was introduced to seek answers to some of the issues concerning the firing of James Comey and Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ role therein. Instead of passing that and dealing with issues that are fundamental to democracy and the respect our citizens may or may not have for its government, the Republicans put a substitute amendment in, raising all kinds of questions about Hillary Clinton. They did everything but yell: ‘‘Lock her up.’’ It was a disgusting display of the majority taking advantage of the minority, squelching our voice, and taking the subject away from what is a serious issue concerning obstruction of justice and the potential obstruction of justice that could come about if there is an attempt to fire Mr. Mueller. Instead, they concentrated on old harangues about Hillary Clinton. It was not a good day for democracy. We need to be aware of the fact that our democracy is in jeopardy, and we need to be alert at every moment and try to find every answer. 
b1230 CONGRATULATING CRITTENTON HOSPITAL ON ITS 50TH ANNIVERSARY (Mr. BISHOP of Michigan asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute and congratulate Crittenton Hospital as we commemorate its 50th anniversary in the Rochester, Michigan, community. Over the past 50 years, Crittenton Hospital has faithfully dedicated itself to serving the Rochester area community and all of its citizens. Since opening its doors in 1967, Crittenton Hospital has expanded to meet the needs of a growing community while keeping pace with advances in healthcare technology and modern approaches to medicine. The longevity enjoyed by Crittenton Hospital is a testament to its unique and enduring impact on our community. Its dedication to our residents ensures that Crittenton Hospital will continue to serve and care for patients for many years to come. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to recognize Crittenton Hospital’s 50th anniversary. I thank Crittenton Hospital for its commitment to the people it serves and to our entire Rochester area community. f 
HIGHSKILLED IMMIGRANT WORKERS (Mr. YODER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. YODER. Mr. Speaker, more than 700,000 highskilled immigrant workers from India are in the United States today on temporary work visas. These people are working hard every day helping grow our economy and raising their children as Americans right here in our communities. But under our legal immigration system, they are essentially here as indentured servants, stuck in a cycle of temporary work visas, unable to change jobs or even start their own businesses to create more American jobs. They are stuck because of the arbitrary 7 percentpernation cap on employment based green cards. Now there is a mother in Greenland whose unborn child will be able to obtain permanent residence in America before someone from India who has already been working here for years. That is absurd, and it is wrong. My bill, called the Fairness for High Skilled Immigrants Act, would fix this problem. It would transition us to a first come, first served, meritbased legal immigration system. It would help these people in need, and it would help create new jobs. Mr. Speaker, with more than 230 cosponsors, it is time to pass this bill and get this done. 
THE PEOPLE’S RIGHT TO JUSTICE (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, one of my predecessors set the standard for service to this Nation, among many, certainly—the Honorable Mickey Leland and Craig Washington—but the Honorable Barbara Jordan served on the Judiciary Committee. It was her standard during the Watergate impeachment hearings that set the Nation afire about the relevancy of the people’s right to justice. That is why I hold this Constitution in hand and rise to the floor today to express my concern of the issues surrounding the Attorney General and the potential firing of the special counsel, Mr. Mueller. This book that has the Constitution in it guarantees three equal branches of government. There is an orderliness to the responsibilities of the Executive and of the United States Congress. We have oversight. The people want answers regarding Russian collusion and the steering of the election to one person over the other. Yes, they want jobs and opportunities, but we have the opportunity—or the responsibility—to clean our kitchen up. I am very concerned about any executive, any Commander in Chief, who would suggest, in violation of the Constitution, that they would fire the Attorney General and then have the opportunity to ensure that the special counsel was fired in contravention of the American people’s desires. That is why I have introduced H. Res. 474, to cause this Congress to disapprove of any firing of the special counsel and reckless pardons of those who are under investigation. f 
THE EXPORTIMPORT BANK (Mr. MCCLINTOCK asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, this administration was elected to drain the swamp, and one of the muckiest parts is the ExportImport Bank that makes taxpayerguarantied loans to foreign companies that buy American products, often to use in competition with American companies that get no such advantage. Now, when politicians are picking winners and losers in the shadows, it shouldn’t surprise us that we find a particularly nasty breeding ground for corruption. We can debate the merits of the Ex Im Bank, but one thing is undeniable: it is an agency that needs a taxpayer watchdog on its board and not just another lapdog for crony capitalists seeking to fleece the taxpayer. Scott Garrett is a watchdog. He has sounded the alarm on the ExIm’s more questionable loans, and his leadership on its board would restore credibility to its decisions. The bank’s supporters should welcome an independent voice that could restore its reputation, and the President should insist on it. 
PROVIDING FOR FURTHER CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3219, DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018 Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I 
call up House Resolution 478 and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Washington is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. SLAUGH TER), my friend, pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Washington? There was no objection. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, the House Rules Committee met yesterday and reported a rule, House Resolution 478, providing for further consideration of H.R. 3219, the Make America Secure Appropriations Act of 2018. This legislation includes four individual appropriations bills: Defense, Energy and Water, Legislative Branch, and Military ConstructionVeterans Affairs. The rule provides for further consideration of H.R. 3219 under a structured rule. Mr. Speaker, this rule provides for consideration of a critical measure that will prioritize funding for important components of our national security. This legislation directs funding for our troops and their families, our Nation’s veterans, the legislative branch and United States Capitol Police, border and nuclear security, energy and water infrastructure investments, and vital appropriations to ensure our military has the equipment and readiness necessary to keep the Nation safe. Mr. Speaker, this legislation is composed of the serious and essential work conducted by the House Appropriations Committee over the past many months. As an appropriator and a member of this committee, I fully appreciate and understand the hard work my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have put in to report these key measures we have before us today. The most important job we have as Members of Congress is ensuring the safety of our Nation. By supporting this rule, we can move the national security package forward. H.R. 3219 includes a 2.4 percent pay increase for our troops. That is the largest military pay increase in 8 years. It keeps our military on the cutting edge of defense technology by investing in research and development and in equipment and weapons procurement. Under the legislation, we will restore readiness shortfalls and make muchneeded critical investments for our troops to address ongoing threats around the globe. We must provide support for our troops to combat terrorism and defeat ISIS. With the legislation, we take a major step forward in restoring the devastating cuts our Armed Forces faced under the Obama administration. The bill also increases funding for construction of critical military infrastructure to keep our troops safe and prepared. The bill also provides for critical safety and enhanced security functions for the United States Capitol. In light of the recent horrific attack on our colleagues, on staff, and on the Capitol Police, the legislation provides increased funding for the Capitol Police toward increased training, equipment, and technologyrelated support. The men and women who guard these hallowed Halls deserve to have access to every resource needed to do their job as safely and as effectively as possible. Under this bill, H.R. 3219, we can ensure that the Capitol Police and House Sergeant at Arms are equipped with these critical enhancements. Regarding the important Energy and Water provisions included in the bill, the underlying legislation will improve public safety, will create jobs, and will grow our economy by funding the Army Corps of Engineers, prioritizing navigation projects and studies. H.R. 3219 reduces regulatory red tape, including authorizing the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency as well as the Secretary of the Army to withdraw from the devastating waters of the United States rule. The bill also funds important Department of Energy programs, including nuclear cleanup efforts, such as the Hanford Site, which is located in my district in central Washington State, as well as nuclear weapons programs to strengthen our national security. Mr. Speaker, this legislation also provides the highest level of funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs in our Nation’s history, ensuring that we keep the commitment to those who have defended our Nation. It supports vital medical care for our veterans, including mental healthcare services, suicide prevention activities, traumatic brain treatment, opioid abuse prevention, and homeless veteran services. There are some issues here in Congress that are nonpartisan. Every single one of our colleagues here in the U.S. House of Representatives believes we must provide the best care possible for our Nation’s veterans. I am proud of the significant strides this legislation takes to support veterans across the country. The rule we consider here today provides for the consideration of a bill that is critically important to keeping our Nation safe. b1245 By passing this legislation, we will continue to rebuild our military, ensure we maintain our military superiority, and boost defense efforts in the face of rising global threats. The bill will aid in supporting our troops and their families, and improve access to care for our veterans. It will increase the safety of the United 
States Capitol complex for Members and staff who serve here; for constituents, as well as the tourists from around the globe who visit this campus; and for the valued Capitol Police, who protect us all. It will also aid in important infrastructure and construction investments to move the United States towards energy independence, improve our economic competitiveness, and fund nonproliferation efforts to prevent, counter, and respond to global nuclear threats. Most importantly, this legislation will make major strides to projects our men and women in uniform serving across the globe who are protecting our freedoms. I urge my colleagues to support this rule as well as the underlying legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule. I certainly thank the gentleman from Washington, my friend, for his kindness. I think he is one of the best Members we have, but I am going to have to disagree with Mr. NEWHOUSE today. When Speaker RYAN assumed the gavel, he told the American people that he wanted to have ‘‘a process that is more open, more inclusive, more deliberative, more participatory.’’ When the majority took control of both the Congress and the White House, they again promised to abide by standard congressional procedure. But we are here, 3 months from the end of the fiscal year. The majority hasn’t passed a budget resolution, and legislation moves at a glacial pace. The majority working to rush through a massive minibus before any individual appropriations bills have been considered on the floor is also a mistake. This may sound pedantic, but we do have rules. Every one of us wants to improve our security, but this bill, I am afraid, is a little more than smoke and mirrors. The increase in defense spending under this bill will never see the light of day. That is because we operate under the Budget Control Act, and that mandates that any breach of the defense cap, which this bill does, will trigger an acrosstheboard sequestration cut of all defense accounts, making what we do here a useless exercise, I am afraid. The majority has also inserted an amendment to provide $1.6 billion President Trump requested to begin construction of the wall on the U.S. Mexico border. This is surely just the beginning of making taxpayers pay for the entire wall, which experts have estimated could cost as much as $21 billion, with nary a peso from Mexico. If we are investing $1.6 billion now, I see no reason why they do not plan to go on to reach the $21 billion expenditure. Let me put that in some perspective: $21 billion could be used to double the Federal investments in public schools. Think of that. Just the money to build that wall, it could provide 6 million people with healthcare under Medicaid, it could buy school lunches for tens of millions of lowincome children. But these investments are not a priority for this majority. President Trump’s own budget director famously said that it isn’t worth feeding hungry children if the nutrition does not improve their school performance, and that Meals on Wheels ‘‘sounds great,’’ but doesn’t work. I never thought I would hear either of those things come from the mouth of a Federal official. The idea that we should not feed hungry children unless their school work improves, frankly, I am baffled by that, let me say it that way. The opposition to the wall is bipartisan. Republican Representative HURD from Texas, a former CIA officer, sits on the Homeland Security Committee and represents the largest border district in the State of Texas. He testified before the Rules Committee late Monday night against it, saying, ‘‘having a onesizefitsall solution to border security makes no sense.’’ Yet this amendment was included without debating the merits on the floor and without giving Members an upordown vote. Let me explain that a little bit. This amendment is in the bill, but there will be no vote on it. It has been what we call selfexecuted to keep people from being recorded in any way, whether they are for or against the wall. The last statistic that I saw from the American public is that 68 percent of them oppose it. They will never know whether their Representatives did or not. It is a sort of a baitandswitch idea. Mr. Speaker, immigration has enriched our country beyond measure. It is what has allowed our country to shape the world, rather than to fear it. A wall will lock the United States away from the rest of the world. The President’s new communications director, Anthony Scaramucci, wrote online: ‘‘Walls don’t work. Never have. Never will.’’ We don’t know whether he is going to change his mind about that or not, but that is what he said. One of our famous Republican Presidents that everybody knew and loved, Ronald Reagan, 30 years ago last month stood in West Berlin and demanded that another wall be torn down. I said in the Rules Committee yesterday and I will say it again here this afternoon: if the President and the majority build this wall, it, too, will be torn down, not by someone crossing the border or by an outside force. It will crumble because the public understands in a way that this President and majority do not, that our Nation does not barricade itself away from the rest of the world. We will not build walls to keep us in. What kind of superpower would we be if we built a wall around the outside of our Nation and crumbled from the inside because the money we put on the wall kept us from updating our infrastructure, which is in such terrible shape, and a shredded social safety net? None of us want to find that out, but the majority is putting us on such a path. Just yesterday, President Trump announced a ban on transgender servicemembers serving in the military. It appears today that he made that announcement all on his own and that neither the Joint Chiefs of Staff or the Pentagon had any idea that he was going to do that. The announcement came 69 years to the day that President Truman desegregated our military. Think about that for a minute. Sixtynine years ago, on the very day that President Trump said transgender people couldn’t serve, was the day President Truman integrated the military services. This is an insult to the approximately 15,000 transgender soldiers who sacrifice for our country every day. Transgender servicemembers are being attacked from both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. Just days ago, Republicans joined Democrats to defeat an amendment that would bar transgender servicemembers from receiving the necessary healthcare that they deserve. I will note that these same treatments would have been available to other servicemembers under this amendment. Apparently to the majority, it is not about the treatment, but the person who receives it. The amendment is especially cruel when you consider that a Pentagon report has found that gender transition related treatment costs between $2.4 and $8.4 million a year. That is the cost of just four of the President’s trips to MaraLago. Think about that: several millions dollars to go to MaraLago would have paid for operations for transgender persons. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  an article from USA Today that details this fact. 
[From USA Today, July 26, 2017] ONPOLITICS TODAY : T RUMP ’SMARALAGO TRIPS COSTMORE THAN TRANS SOLDIERS ’ HEALTH CARE (By Josh Hafner) President Trump tweeted this morning that the U.S. military wouldn’t allow transgender troops ‘‘in any capacity,’’ an apparent rejection of the military’s roughly 6,000 trans troops and the Obamaera policy that embraced them. The U.S. ‘‘cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail,’’ Trump said. Except trans troops don’t really cost that much, as many soon pointed out. A report for the Pentagon last year found that transitionrelated care would cost between about $2.4 and $8.4 million per year— less than 0.14% of the military’s medical budget. 
That’s roughly the cost of four of Trump’s trips to MarALago, GQ noted, even using a conservative estimate of $2 million per trip. And it’s way less than the $84 million spent on Viagra and similar meds by the Department of Defense in 2014, as others also said. It was, as Sen. John McCain noted, ‘‘yet another example of why major policy announcements should not be made via Twitter.’’ 
Ms. SLAUGHTER. I believe all of our soldiers deserve our thanks and support. They are Americans. They don’t need to be attacked based on who they are. Lastly, Mr. Speaker, it is also outrageous—and I saved this for the end— that the majority stripped from the bill Congresswoman BARBARA LEE’s bipartisan amendment to repeal the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force. Until this AUMF, which, as I said, came into law in 2001, is rescinded and replaced, the President of the United States can usurp our power and effectively declare war without Congress’ concurrence. In fact, that has already happened. Matters of war are the most serious issues that Congress considers. We should not—and we don’t want to— shirk those responsibilities. We want to fulfill our constitutional duties. Yet Speaker RYAN removed it from the bill without any debate or single vote because he was afraid of it. He replaced it with weaker language requiring a 30day study. After those 30 days, we are not assured of anything at all, just a study. That is not the type of open and transparent process that the Speaker promised. More than just bad process, it silences the debate we need to have. All Americans, especially our men and women in uniform, deserve better from us, as they volunteered to save us with their very lives. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CARTER ), the chairman of the Homeland Security Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee. Mr. CARTER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise in favor of the rule, which makes an amendment that I offered part of the security package by the adoption of this rule. I want to acknowledge the frustration of my colleagues at adding funds to construct three barriers on the U.S. Mexico border. Like many of you, I would have preferred a package which included all 12 appropriations bills. However, this is the process that we are going forward with, and, of course, I am supportive of it. Despite my reservations about the process, I believe that each of these three projects included in this amendment are absolutely necessary for national security. The funds that are in what we call the ‘‘wall’’ part of this bill are 28 miles of levee wall in Hidalgo County, Texas. Many people have asked me what that is. Mostly everybody knows a levee is a big mound of dirt that keeps the water from flooding. Well, it is a big pile of dirt with a 20foot wall on one side made of concrete to keep it from washing out and a 6foot fence on top of that. It serves for water retention, as well as defending our borders. The funds pay for the construction of 32 miles of bollard wall in Starr County, Texas, which is Rio Grande City and that area. Bollard fence is a bunch of steel poles about the size of a small corner post on a cedar post fence. They rise up about 20 feet in the air and have a cement base. Also, the funds pay for 14 miles of wall in San Diego, replacing an existing 14 miles of wall or fence with a better product because it has been deteriorating since the 1990s, when it went in. That is what is in this bill. Many people claim it isn’t necessary to put up barriers between the border of the United States and Mexico. They say the border is more secure than it has ever been, apprehensions are way down, and that border walls do not prevent people crossing. In fact, I disagree, and they do, too. It is a fact that apprehensions are down relative to the mid2000s. In fact, in the late nineties, in San Diego, before their barrier fences were built, 500,000 people stormed across that border. Last year, the number is 25,000. That is a substantial reduction. More than a million people crossed our Southern border every year in the early2000s. However, today, we continue to apprehend certain people, and it is down to 200,000 a year on the border. That is a substantial number. What concerns me more than the number of apprehensions is the fact that if migrants are crossing the border illegally, then so are terrorists, drug smugglers, and human traffickers. b1300 Mr. Speaker, many Members of this body probably remember illegal immigrants rushing the border in San Diego back in the 1990s. Illegal immigrant entries decreased significantly, as I said. The number of illegal crossings fell, crime rates declined, commerce increased, and neighborhoods became safe all because of fences and barriers on the border. The Border Patrol cautions that illegal border migration seeks the path of least resistance and that these commendable results do not mean that the flow has steadied. It has simply moved to another unprotected place like the Rio Grande Valley in my home State of Texas. We want to change that dynamic. This amendment is important because it is committed to dedicated men and women who stand in harm’s way on our behalf. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman. Mr. CARTER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask Members’ support for this bill and for this amendment. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GALLEGO ). Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Speaker, there is a really disturbing story in Politico today. Speaker RYAN was apparently afraid that he wouldn’t be able to pass the defense spending bill, including $1.6 billion for Trump’s dumb wall because conservatives wanted to block Medicare for transgender servicemembers, so he called the President asking for help. What did Donald Trump do to get Speaker RYANout of this jam? Trump decided to ban brave transgender Americans from serving. That is right, Mr. Speaker, Trump is kicking transgender men and women out of our Armed Services to make sure he can get money to build his stupid, irresponsible, unnecessary wall. He is implementing one bigoted policy in order to achieve another one. This is hatred in the service of injustice. This is transphobia in the service of racism. This is stupidity in the service of foolishness. Mr. Speaker, we need to stop doing Trump’s dirty work. Not only is President Trump’s border wall expensive and unnecessary, Members of this body who care deeply about our national defense shouldn’t be forced to decide between voting for this ridiculous proposal and voting to fund our military. More importantly, on such a momentous issue, the American people deserve to know where their elected representatives stand. Mr. Speaker, let us defeat this rule. Let us stop this wall. Let us enable every American patriot, regardless of their gender identity, to do what I did: to fight for this country with pride, courage, and selflessness. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, we do have a couple of speakers coming who are not here yet. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time at this point but look forward to having them participate as soon as they get here. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, first of all, let me thank the gentlewoman from New York for her consistent leadership. Being a frequent visitor to the Rules Committee as a Member, I want to thank the manager for the courtesies extended to all of us. Let me say that I am a member of the Budget Committee, and I want to associate my stance with the gentlewoman from New York. We do not have a budget, but, in fact, the budget is not a roadmap that we are even attempting to do. The budget was a slash and burn 
of Medicare, Medicaid, only to give tax cuts, and it had no vision but to plus up the Defense Appropriations. So now we come with a minibus that wants to do more damage. I have no quarrel with my friend from Texas, but it is very clear that this budget is based upon this wall, and this rule is based upon this wall. It is important for the American people to know that, while we are fighting for Medicaid and Meals on Wheels, better policing, and better education for our children, the wall that was supposed to be paid for by Mexico—let me say it again, the wall that was supposed to be paid by Mexico, as evidenced by the Commander in Chief—is now, in this rule, not for $100 million, not for $200 million, not for $50 million, but for $1,571,239,000. That is what this rule is all about. Frankly, I believe that this is a shame. Frankly, I oppose it because the Commander in Chief swore that Mexico would pay for the wall. Now we are paying for the wall, and, as indicated, a Member of Congress from Texas who represents the area is adamantly against it. I would only argue to say that there are other needs in this minibus that the American people desire. I also rise to express strong opposition to the fact that the Lee amendments were not put in. Congresswoman LEEhad an amendment for us to debate the AUMF, two amendments, and those amendments were rejected. Let us go back to regular order and pass appropriations for the American people and debate whether we go to war. Going to war is a point for the American people to hear and discuss. Mr. Speaker, I rise to register my opposition to the exclusion from H. Res. 478 of the amendments offered by colleague, Congresswoman BARBARA LEEof California. This rule makes in order 54 amendments to Division A of H.R. 3219, the Defense Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2018 and an amendment by Congressman CARTER , the chairman of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, providing $1.57 billion in funding to begin construction of the infamous ‘‘Trump Border Wall’’ that the presidential candidate Trump promises, assured, and guaranteed American and the would be paid for by Mexico. Mr. Speaker, it is passing strange indeed that the Lee Amendments, which were offered, debated, and approved in the regular order were excluded from the rule while the Carter Amendment, which was introduced at the 11th hour, was included. Lee Amendment No. 95 would repeal the 2001 AUMF after 240 days of enactment of this Act. Lee Amendment No. 96 does not repeal the 2001 AUMF but would prohibit the expenditure of any funds to implement, administer, or enforce the 2001 AUMF beginning 240 days of enactment of this Act. They knew that the decision to go to war was too important to be left to the whim of a single person, no matter how wise or wellinformed he or she might be. Over the last 16 years, we have seen 3 Presidents use the 2001 Afghanistan AUMF as a blank check to engage in serious military action. In 2016, the Congressional Research Service issued a report detailing 37 unclassified uses of this authorization in 14 countries, including for operations at Guantanamo Bay, warrantless wiretapping, and recent military action in Libya, Syria, Somalia, and Yemen. The overly broad 2001 AUMF represents a critical deterioration of Congressional oversight, which should be repealed, rather than repeated with respect to North Korea. As our brave service members are deployed around the world in combat zones, Congress is missing in action. As provided under the War Powers Resolution of 1973, absent a Congressional declaration of war or authorization for the use of military force, the President as Commanderin Chief has constitutional power to engage the U.S. armed forces in hostilities only in the case of a national emergency created by an attack upon the United States, its territories or possessions, or its armed forces. As a coequal branch of government, it is Congress’s right and responsibility to be fully consulted regarding any potential plans to conduct military operations in foreign lands and to assess whether such action is in the national security interest of the United States and its allies, and to withhold or grant authorization for the use of military force based on this assessment. As we have learned from the painful and bitter experience of the past 16 years, at the initiation of hostilities, the costs in terms of blood and treasure of U.S. military interventions abroad are often underestimated and the benefits overstated. For example, more than 6,800 American service members gave the last full measure of devotion to their country on battlefields in Afghanistan and Iraq, with hundreds of thousands more returning with physical, emotional, or psychological wounds that may never heal. The direct economic cost of the war in Afghanistan exceeds $1.07 trillion, including $773 billion in Overseas Contingency Operations funds, an increase of $243 billion to the Department of Defense base budget, and an increase of $54.2 billion to the Veterans Administration budget to address the human costs of the military involvement in Afghanistan. I am confident that affording Members the opportunity to debate and vote on the Lee Amendments would strengthen our democracy and help restore Congress’s preeminent constitutional role in the decision to take the nation to war. Mr. Speaker, I also rise in strong opposition to the Carter Amendment to H.R. 3219, Department of Defense Appropriations Act for FY2018. I oppose the amendment because it is ineffective, costly, and wasteful legislation for three reasons: it is costly and ineffective; President Trump broke his promise that Mexico would fund the wall; and a policy shift of this magnitude requires regular order with the Committees of Jurisdiction weighing in on the real cost to the American people should a wall be built. First, I oppose the Carter Amendment because it is costly and ineffective. It wastes $1.6 billion to build an unnecessary wall with our already peaceful neighbors to the south. Only $32 million dollars of that $1.6 billion would actually go towards the wall. That leaves over $1.5 billion simply wasted. The wall throws away American taxpayers’ money when it could and should be spent on a number of necessary initiatives like education, healthcare, transportation, infrastructure, or even military preparedness. Second, I oppose H.R. 3219 because Trump swore Mexico would pay for the wall. The President has broken his promise to the American people and is asking American taxpayers to foot a $1.6 billion bill for a useless, expensive wall. No wonder the wall is strongly opposed by Democrats and many Republicans. There is no assurance that Americans would ever be reimbursed by Mexico. Trump’s cost estimations do not include the cost of building in more treacherous terrain, access roads, maintenance, or acquiring land in Texas, where almost all border landholdings are privately held. Building this wall would require stripping landholders in my very own home state of Texas of their private land. Instead of wasting $1.6 billion on building a wall, that money could be appropriated to maintaining our effective border security and immigration practices, like those currently in place for asylum seekers. The United States already enforces the most extensive immigration and border security practices in the world. We have This is a bad business deal for the American people. Third, I oppose the Carter Amendment because it is represents a policy shift that will have dire consequences for our economy that far exceed the $50 billion estimated cost of this wall. A policy shift of this magnitude requires regular order with the committees of jurisdiction weighing in on the real cost to the American people should a wall be built. Mexico happens to be one of the United States’ strongest trading partners. U.S. goods and services trade with Mexico totaled an estimated $579.7 billion in 2016. Exports were $262.0 billion; imports were $317.6 billion. The U.S. goods and services trade deficit with Mexico was $55.6 billion in 2016. Mexico is currently our 3rd largest goods trading partner with $525.1 billion in total (two way) goods trade during 2016. Goods exports totaled $231.0 billion; goods imports totaled $294.2 billion. The U.S. goods trade deficit with Mexico was $63.2 billion in 2016. Trade in services with Mexico (exports and imports) totaled an estimated $54.5 billion in 2016. Services exports were $31.1 billion; services imports were $23.5 billion. The U.S. services trade surplus with Mexico was $7.6 billion in 2016. According to the Department of Commerce, U.S. exports of Goods and Services to Mexico supported an estimated 1.2 million jobs in 2015. Mexico was the United States’ 2nd largest goods export market in 2016. U.S. exports to Mexico in 2016 were $231.0 billion, down 2.0 percent ($4.8 billion) from 2015 but up 72.7 percent from 2006. U.S. exports to Mexico are up 455 percent from 1993 (preNAFTA). 
U.S. exports to Mexico account for 15.9 percent of overall U.S. exports in 2015. The top export categories in 2016 were: machinery ($42 billion), electrical machinery ($41 billion), vehicles ($21 billion), mineral fuels ($20 billion), and plastics ($16 billion). U.S. total exports of agricultural products to Mexico totaled $18 billion in 2016, our 3rd largest agricultural export market. Leading domestic export categories include: corn ($2.6 billion), soybeans ($1.5 billion), pork & pork products ($1.4 billion), dairy products ($1.2 billion), and beef & beef products ($975 million). U.S. exports of services to Mexico were an estimated $31.1 billion in 2016, 1.4 percent (441 million) less than 2015, but 30.5 percent greater than 2006 levels. It was up roughly 199 percent from 1993 (preNAFTA). Leading services exports from the U.S. to Mexico, in 2015, were in the travel, transport, and intellectual property (computer software, industrial processes) sectors. Mexico was the United States’ 2nd largest supplier of goods imports in 2016. U.S. goods imports from Mexico totaled $294.2 billion in 2016, down 0.8 percent ($2.3 billion) from 2015, but up 48.4 percent from 2006. U.S. imports from Mexico are up 637 percent from 1993 (preNAFTA). U.S. imports from Mexico account for 13.4 percent of overall U.S. imports in 2015. The top import categories (2–digit HS) in 2016 were: vehicles ($75 billion), electrical machinery ($62 billion), machinery ($51 billion), optical and medical instruments ($13 billion), and furniture and bedding ($11 billion). U.S. total imports of agricultural products from Mexico totaled $23 billion in 2016, our 1st largest supplier of agricultural imports. Leading categories include: fresh vegetables ($5.6 billion), other fresh fruit ($4.9 billion), wine and beer ($3.1 billion), snack foods ($2.0 billion), and processed fruit & vegetables ($1.5 billion). U.S. imports of services from Mexico were an estimated $23.5 billion in 2016, 7.0 percent ($1.5 billion) more than 2015, and 57.9 percent greater than 2006 levels. It was up roughly 216 percent from 1993 (preNAFTA). Leading services imports from Mexico to the U.S., in 2015, were in the travel, transport, and technical and other services sectors. The U.S. goods trade deficit with Mexico was $63.2 billion in 2016, a 4.2 percent increase ($2.5 billion) over 2015. The United States has a services trade surplus of an estimated $7.6 billion with Mexico in 2016, down 20.7 percent from 2015. U.S. foreign direct investment (FDI) in Mexico (stock) was $92.8 billion in 2015 (latest data available), a 3.5 percent increase from 2014. U.S. direct investment in Mexico is led by manufacturing, nonbank holding companies, and mining. Mexico’s FDI in the United States (stock) was $16.6 billion in 2015 (latest data available), up 0.2 percent from 2014. Mexico’s direct investment in the U.S. is led by manufacturing, wholesale trade, and depository institutions. Sales of services in Mexico by majority U.S.owned affiliates were $45.9 billion in 2014 (latest data available), while sales of services in the United States by majority Mexicoowned firms were $8.5 billion. We share one of the longest peaceful borders in the world with our neighbors to the north and to the south. We are not at war with our peaceful neighbors; we do not need to build an almost 2,000 mile wall to divide us from our neighbor. This tragic initiative is inconsistent with the American character of building bridges not walls. These are just some of the facts that Committees of Jurisdiction would have to weigh before we make any decision. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in opposing this Rule so that this bill can return to the Rules Committee to have Division E removed from this appropriations package. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, the American people spoke loud and clear last November. They voted to support a stronger military, an unyielding national defense, and that includes the need for a muchimproved border security. As the gentleman from Texas said, we have threats of human traffickers, drug smugglers, terrorists coming across our borders, and this is something that the American people said that they wanted, and we are responding to that with recommendations from the Customs and Border Protection agency. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER ), the Democratic whip. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, there is a lot of disorder in Washington, D.C.: There is chaos and conflict and confrontation in the White House. There is conflict within the majority party in the House of Representatives. There was a representation that we were going to follow regular order. We have not. There is no budget, which was supposed to be adopted some 3 months ago. A budget should have told all the Members of Congress and the country how much discretionary spending we were going to have. The majority party has been unable to bring a budget to this floor and to pass it because of the disarray and disorder that we find in this House. This rule represents a litany of broken promises and exposes, frankly, the hypocrisy of this Republican majority. This rule would add an amendment to the underlying bill that directs $1.6 billion of American taxpayer dollars toward the construction of President Trump’s proposed border wall. This was not in the original bill. The irony is, in the Rules Committee, an amendment that was in the original bill has been struck not by a vote of the Defense Committee or by the Appropriations Committee, but by the Rules Committee. They just struck out an amendment. Let me remind my colleagues, Mr. Speaker, of the words of our Speaker, PAULRYAN. He said this: ‘‘We will advance major legislation one issue at a time.’’ Mr. Speaker, as you probably know, I have been here for some years—36, to be exact. I have never seen, in 36 years, an omnibus or minibus brought to the floor before September. Why? Because the regular order is to consider the bills one at a time, or, as the Speaker said: ‘‘We will advance major legislation one issue at a time.’’ But what the Republicans have done, Mr. Speaker, is to bring a bill and put so much in it, they dare people to vote against it because of the national security. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, this rule ought to be rejected. It is not the regular order, it is not good policy, and it is not good for the institution of the House of Representatives or for the country. The border wall is controversial, and many people in the Trump administration do not believe the border wall will be effective, and they believe it is a waste of money. And, of course, the President told us all the Mexicans were going to pay for the wall. Well, this is $1.6 billion of about $20 billion that would have to come not to be paid for by the Mexicans, but to be paid for by the U.S. taxpayer for an ineffective effort to make this country more secure. Everybody on this floor believes we ought to know who comes into this country and that people ought not to come into this country unless they are authorized to do so. We all agree on that. I ask the majority leader: Bring this border wall to the floor; let us debate it; put it open for amendment. That is the regular order. The Speaker went on to say: ‘‘We will not duck the tough issues. We will take them head on.’’ That is Speaker PAUL RYAN, October 29, 2015. They had an amendment offered on the authorization bill by Mrs. HARTZLER of Missouri. It was controversial, and the majority party lost. So what did they do? They didn’t add it to the bill as Mrs. HARTZLER wanted to do, have an amendment on this floor so we could debate it again on its demerits or merits depending upon your perspective, but they went around not by regular order, not by taking issues headon, but by having the President issue some tweet that the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff says he never was talked to about it. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has again expired. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from Maryland. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, let us stand up for this institution. Let us stand up for regular order. Let us stand up for not ducking the tough issues. Let us reject this rule, and then let us go back to regular order and hopefully do so in a bipartisan way and do what the American public expects us to do: 
make tough decisions for them, for our country, for our security, and for our children. I urge my colleagues to vote against this rule. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I certainly appreciate the debate on both sides on this very important issue. Let me just say that this has been a very open process. Not all may want to acknowledge that, but let me just point out that this rule makes 54 amendments in order: 21 of those amendments are from the Democrats, 16 from Republicans, and fully, 17 are led by bipartisan cosponsors. So that tells me that the openness of this process, the ability for people to bring their perspectives, their opinions in this important debate is real. As far as the Rules Committee unilaterally striking language and reinserting other language, that is true. We struck section 9021 of the Defense Appropriations Act of 2018 and replaced it, though, with language from an amendment offered by Mr. COLEto the NDAA, the National Defense Authorization Act of 2018, which was adopted by the full House on July 13 of this year. It was replaced with language that was approved by this body. So again, Mr. Speaker, I think that points to the openness of this process. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. b1315 Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. PRICE), the distinguished ranking member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development. Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this so called security minibus. The Republican majority has rushed through the fiscal year 2018 appropriations process, passing 12 bills without benefit of a budget resolution. Now they have failed to secure the votes on the floor for that Republicanonly omnibus package, so they have decided to move forward with what is before us today—four appropriations bills stitched together that would bust the Budget Control Act defense cap and, if enacted, result in a $72 billion sequester against all defense accounts. The entire fiscal year ’18 appropriations process has been a Republican exercise in sham accounting and wishful thinking: ignore current law, jack up defense spending, and impose huge, unnecessary, and detrimental cuts on domestic appropriations. When future students learn about congressional appropriations, this episode should be exhibit A of what not to do. The four bills before us today are also full of objectionable and unreasonable policy riders, including the ridiculous inclusion in the rule of $1.6 billion to be spent on 74 miles of border wall. Nobody would know it from the President’s hysterical rhetoric, but there are already 700 miles of fence along the border—vehicular fencing and pedestrian fencing. I know about it because most of that fence was built when I was chairman of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee. When Congress appropriated funds to build that fence, we required segment bysegment analyses and environmental impact studies. This bill doesn’t include that. It doesn’t include any language regarding congressional oversight. There are no requirements for Homeland Security to submit a costbenefit analysis or to work with Congress through any modifications. Mr. Speaker, funding an unnecessary wall, especially without congressional oversight, is not a defensible use of taxpayer dollars. We would simply become complicit in what we all know was campaign demagoguery. Speaking of which, wasn’t the Mexican Government going to pay for this wall? Weren’t they going to pick up the tab? This $1.6 billion should be spent on much more important priorities, within and beyond homeland security, that would actually improve the lives of our citizens. It is time for Republicans to stop playing games with taxpayer money and start negotiating with Democrats. We know this is going to have to happen eventually. We need a bipartisan budget and appropriations package that actually has a chance of becoming law and that addresses the need of a great country for serious investment. Oppose the border wall. Oppose this sham appropriations minibus. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have remaining. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from New York has 8
1⁄2minutes remaining. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DOGGETT ). Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, for our Nation of immigrants, a wall rejects our very history. A wall is not about America leading the world. A wall is about trying to shut off the rest of the world. Ignored today, of course, is the history of how poorly laws have worked to stop desperate people. Most all of those who are coming to America—risking their lives, suffocating in the back of a truck, going over a perilous desert—are not here to cause us harm; they are not here to do wrong and mooch off of our social services. They are trying to escape violence or provide a little hope to their family. And they do it by taking the dirtiest, toughest jobs in our society, as immigrants have done since the very founding of our Nation. A wall only makes their path more perilous without offering us more security. Last year, Trump’s most famous and oft repeated claim was that he would build a wall that Mexico would pay for. But, this year, we just have one broken Trump campaign promise after another. Today, we have confirmation that Trump is just putting taxpayers on the hook to pay for another section of a wall—yes, a wall of broken campaign promises. Instead of a wall, we ought to be building opportunity. As Austin Mayor Steve Adler said, ‘‘bridges make money, and walls cost money.’’ Building Trump’s boondoggle in the desert, at the same time he says we can’t afford medical research or educational opportunity or job training, just shows how backward these priorities are. Let’s oppose a wall of ignorance, a wall of prejudice, and create a bridge of opportunity. To achieve both true security and economic growth, we need to reject this narrowminded approach in favor of comprehensive immigration reform. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I do know that even though some people would like to ignore the situation we have on our southern border, we do need to respond to those border protection agents who are asking us for help. We do need to respond to the crisis that we see along our southern border to keep our country as safe as possible. And we do need to confirm to people across the country that help is on the way. Certainly, the border is one aspect of this important piece of legislation, but there are many things in this bill that will help our country and help our military forces keep our Nation safe. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. BARRAGA ´N). Ms. BARRAGA´N. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the security minibus. I actually happen to sit on the Homeland Security Subcommittee, and I know what it is like to make sure that national security is our number one priority. I also happen to know that I have heard testimony from experts, and I have heard bipartisan opposition to this wall in my committee. Because when we hear from experts, they tell us a wall is not going to stop a terrorist, and they tell us that the drug cartels are not going to be stopped either, they are just going to build a tunnel under the wall. So when you talk about homeland security, I know exactly what you are talking about. The reality is that this $1.6 billion is just a waste of taxpayer dollars. It is a dubious political promise that was made, and now the American people are being asked to foot the bill. Let me repeat. I sit on Homeland Security. The border on the south is not our number one terrorist target. We know that what is there now is already 
an existing wall. We already have fencing there. Some of the areas we are talking about are even just areas in the Rio Grande, where it is not going to make the biggest difference. If we are going to secure our borders, we could spend money on technology and other areas, or we could secure our borders by putting more money into port security, where there is a greater threat of terrorism. This is just another way to bully Congress into funding a border wall that the majority of people don’t want. I hope that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will not be bullied by this because it is being packaged in with other bills that would otherwise get passed without the partisanship. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to allow the House to consider Representative LEE’s AUMF amendment—authority to use military force. This will provide all Members the chance for an upordown vote, which we have, thus far, been denied. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the amendment in the RECORD , along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from New York? There was no objection. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. LEE) to discuss our proposal. Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, first, let me thank the gentlewoman for yielding me time and for her tremendous leadership as our ranking member on the Rules Committee. It is a true testament to her love for our country and for our troops. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition, first, to this terrible rule, but, of course, also in strong support of this amendment to sunset funding for the 2001 AUMF, after 240 days after enactment of this act. This important amendment would provide Congress plenty of time to do our job and finally have a debate and vote on matters of war and peace. Mr. Speaker, last week, Republicans unilaterally decided to kill my bipartisan amendment to sunset the 2001 AUMF, which would allow 8 months to debate and vote on a new one before it would be enacted. This amendment was adopted on a bipartisan basis in the full Appropriations Committee. It was stripped out of the bill in the dead of the night, with no debate or vote from the Rules Committee. This undemocratic and underhanded behavior really makes me wonder: What is Speaker RYANso afraid of? I came to the Rules Committee this week and asked them to rectify a wrong and allow a debate and a vote on this important measure, and they refused. I even offered a second amendment, which we have before us today, which would sunset the funding for the 2001 AUMF, 240 days after enactment—that is 8 months—which would allow ample time to debate and vote on any replacement. This would be repeal, but remain in place, allowing 8 months to debate this. Even though this amendment was germane to the bill, Republicans refused to even allow a debate on this important measure and a vote. I understand Speaker RYAN has said that it was a mistake to include my original amendment and that it would endanger our national security. Initially, on June 29, according to press accounts, my colleague and friend, who supported this amendment, Chairman COLEresponded and said: It is time for leadership to wake up, and the administration to wake up, and send over a recommended AUMF, mark it up, and take it to the floor. I don’t know any other way to get their attention because we have been talking about it for years. Now, instead of listening to their own party, what do they do? They stripped our bipartisan amendment. Some Members have said that the funding would be cut immediately with this amendment, but that is furthest from the truth. That is very disingenuous. That would be irresponsible, and I would in no way offer an amendment like that. It would allow 8 months for Congress to debate and vote on any new AUMF. Some have said that this is political, and I say it is just the opposite. Our brave troops deserve us to come together and do this so they know their country has their back. I voted for the 2001 authorization because I believed it opened the door for any President to wage endless war without a congressional debate or vote. Quite frankly, unfortunately, history has borne that out. According to a Congressional Research Service report, the 2001 AUMFs have been used more than 37 times in 14 countries to justify military actions. This report only examines the unclassified incidents. How many other operations have been conducted without the knowledge of Congress or the American people? These authorizations have also been used to justify perpetual wars that are thousands of miles away. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Ms. SLAUGHTER. I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentlewoman. Ms. LEE. Let me conclude by saying, now any President can unilaterally wage war under the outdated authorization forever unless it is repealed. The American people—our constituents—know that Congress is missing in action. They deserve better. Surely, Congress can muster the courage to do our constitutional duty and debate and vote on a new AUMF within 8 months if that is our decision. We passed the 2001 AUMF within 3 days, and it never came to the Foreign Affairs Committee, where I served for 11 years. So let’s stand up for the Constitution, our servicemen and women, and our national security by bringing forward this amendment. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous question so we can finally have this debate, vote ‘‘no’’ on the rule, and vote ‘‘no’’ on the underlying bill. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, let me just say to my good friend from California, I agree that a new authorization on the use of military force is something that is necessary, something that we owe our military, and something that we should do. The language with the Cole amendment, I think, starts us down that path. In fact, the Foreign Affairs Committee, just this week, is holding hearings on this very important topic. I look forward to working with Ms. LEEon this, as well as all of us here in this House, to get us to the end result that I think is absolutely necessary, and I appreciate the gentlewoman’s comments. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. BIGGS). b1330 Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Washington (Mr. NEWHOUSE ), and I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this important issue. I am an Arizona native. I grew up in southern Arizona, and trips to the southern Arizona border were not infrequent and not unusual. I have gone from San Luis to Naco, to Nogales, to Agua Prieta. I have been along the border many times, most recently just a couple months ago, and during that time, I used it as kind of a factfinding expedition. I wanted to know what people who live right along the border talk about and think about as we in Congress consider things like a Presidential promise to build a wall, even in this bill, a partial wall, a good start. I will tell you what I know is that the number one drug and human smuggling corridor in the United States of America is through the Tucson sector. That is right through the heart of the ArizonaMexico border. It impacts, literally, 75 to 80 miles into the border. Where we have wilderness preserves, our agents can’t go in, they don’t go in, and yet roadways are cut in this pristine desert by those who enter from the cartels, cutting roads with their vehicles that they know that our agents cannot traverse. So I am familiar with the area. I am familiar with the issue. I had the privilege of talking to Border Patrol agents over the last few years, but in particular the last time I was at the border, and I talked to a 
number of them. I wondered what the men and women think who actually service the border for us. I asked them whether they supported a wall. It was 100 percent, it was unanimous: they want a wall. They want additional infrastructure. They want a road that parallels that wall so they can have access to that wall and make the apprehensions that they need to. I talked to ranchers and farmers. It was unanimous then as well. Everyone wanted that wall, all recognizing the need for additional infrastructure of a roadway. When you go to various portions of the border now, it is a single strand of wire. You can step over it. We had one of the ranchers, an 81yearold gentleman, demonstrate how he crawls underneath the wire at 81 years of age. Where there are small areas of fencing outside Nogales, either side from Nogales, that has cut down the number of folks who come that way; but since that fence only goes about 3 or 4 miles onto each side of the city, what happens is there is a flood of people who come around that fence. A border wall is important. It is imperative. Those of us who feel the direct brunt of the influx of people who come across the border, whether for hostile or benign intentions, we feel very strongly that a border wall would benefit our State. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support this initiative, and I can tell you that my constituency also supports this initiative. With that, I urge everyone to support this initiative. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, let me just say that one of the beauties of Congress is being able to hear from people firsthand their experiences, who speak not just in theoretical senses but because of the life they live and their constituents, and so I appreciate very much the gentleman from Arizona and his testimony. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. SANFORD ). Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Washington for the way that he has worked with other colleagues in terms of trying to move this bill and this process forward. It would take Solomon in all of his wisdom to get it completely right, and in that regard, I give you due deference in the way that you all have put this bill together. Mr. Speaker, I do want to rise in support of what my colleague from California spoke about just a moment ago, which is the fact that neither one of Ms. LEE’s amendments were ultimately made in order. I have a problem with that from the standpoint of the construction of this rule, because one of those amendments was tied to, in essence, the base bill that actually passed at the committee level, and then the other one was an adaptation of that same notion. What she is getting at, I think, is incredibly important. I think it is incredibly important, because the saying is that the road to hell is paved with good intentions, and we have been meaning and meaning and meaning and meaning to do something about the Authorization for Use of Force in the Middle East since 2001 in terms of bringing it up to date, but we haven’t, for whatever reason, done so. What she is getting at with her amendment is saying, simply, it is time, it is well past time, and I think there is real legitimacy to that point. I would say, secondly, what doesn’t work in life are blank checks. In essence, if you sign on to this notion that an Authorization for Use of Force back in 2001 will apply now, why doesn’t it apply 30 years from now or 50 years from now, if you follow that logic out. I think our Founding Fathers were so concrete in their constitutional premise that only Congress should declare war because what they knew was that body bags don’t return to Washington, D.C. They return to congressional districts and States across this country. And knowing that, they said you have got to go to the people’s House to have the Authorization for Use of Force so that you do not put people in harm’s way without Congress debating that subject and actually coming up with a decision to the affirmative. Finally, I would simply say this: This is important in terms of sending a clear signal to soldiers and to the public at large that we are behind them, we are behind the soldiers. We say this is what you ought to do. We are going to give you the tools necessary to do the job; and to the public: This is why we think it ought to be done. Authorization for Use of Force is about those two things. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT ). Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate Mr. NEWHOUSE ’s efforts here. Hearing a concern about the $1.6 billion for the wall, let me just say, living in Texas, spending a lot of time on the border, spending time in Mexico—it is where my wife and I went on our honeymoon—there is only one reason Mexico is not one of the top 10 economies in the world, and it is because the drug cartels make tens of billions of dollars they use for corruption to keep it from being that. The best thing we could do as a good neighbor to Mexico is to build a wall where it is needed, just like President Trump has talked about, stop that flow of tens of billions of dollars to Mexico used for corruption to keep down the Mexican people—hardworking, God fearing people—and bring that country up by being a good neighbor; because, in this case, a good fence or wall will make a good neighbor, and Mexico will have its rightful place in the economic hierarchy of the world. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. POE), my good friend. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, having lived in Texas all my life, I, like many other Texans, have been to the Texas border numerous times. I have been to the border from San Diego to Brownsville while I have been in Congress, the entire length of the border. Some things are working on the border, and one of those things that is working is a wall in the big cities. One of my friends from El Paso likes to talk about how El Paso is the safest city in America. Well, one reason is El Paso has multiple fencing, a canal, and a river between the U.S., Texas, and Mexico. The sheriff of El Paso told me after that fencing was created, crossborder crime is almost nonexistent. That is one reason—not the only reason—why El Paso is the safest city in America is because they have a wall, a fence, the Rio Grande River—a barrier. Let’s use that term. Sure, not everybody from Mexico is coming to commit crimes, of course not, but a wall works. It also works where they have fencing in San Diego. It also works where they have fencing in Brownsville, Texas, between Brownsville and Mexico. It stops and reduces the crossborder individuals coming in without permission. So a partial fence will work. This bill, let’s make it clear, is not a complete border wall of the whole border. It is only 74 miles. And we need to do everything. We need to have that 74 miles. We need to have aerostats in the air. We need to have more Border Patrol on the ground. We need to have all types of technology to have a virtual wall, if you will, to protect the United States’ security. People need to come to the United States. We want people to come to the United States, but come the right way. Lastly, as my friend from Tyler, Texas, said, the drug cartels are the major problem, and the criminal gangs, like the MS–13 gang, are the ones who come into the United States because there is no barrier to stop them. And that is just the way it is. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, if we hadn’t had this last election and the campaign that went with it, we wouldn’t be talking about any wall. One of the candidates threw out that he would like to have a wall and was sure—he gave us the absurd notion that somehow Mexico would pay for it. Not many of us believed that, but I will tell you, now that we have put in this $1.6 billion for this wall, I will bet you that we are going to finish it, and we don’t know how much it costs— somewhere between $20 billion and $40 billion for a wall. Now, if I have heard correctly what my colleagues have said over there, the walls are working already, the ones they have got. There are walls there. I 
heard San Diego had three. So the idea, I guess, if one works, we will build us another one. Oh, my goodness. This funding bill that we are talking about spending on a wall is needed to repair roads and bridges and bring down the cost of education, but the majority refuses to have debate on the AUMF, something that is critically important, life and death to many people who live in this country who are presently in the armed services. This amendment should have been included here. And I appreciate what my colleague, Mr. SANFORD , said. He is absolutely right. But if we were to get a new AUMF, it would put Congress back into its duty to declare war. That is something that the Constitution gave us that we no longer have. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the discussion we have had this past hour from all Members that have participated. Although we may have our differences, some difference of opinion, I believe that this rule and the underlying bill are strong measures that are important to ensuring the security and the prosperity of our country. The rule provides for further consideration of H.R. 3219, the Make America Secure Appropriations Act of 2018. Let me say again, while my friends on the other side may not want to acknowledge it, this rule makes 54 amendments in order; 21 of those 54 are from my Democratic friends, 16 are Republican, and 17 are bipartisan, led by bipartisan cosponsors. In fact, the majority of the amendments that were made in order under yesterday’s rule that provide for the initial consideration of this bill were also led by Democrats, so this reflects the balanced approach of the process under this rule. b1345 Mr. Speaker, it is our job, it is Congress’ job, to appropriate the necessary funds to keep our Nation safe and our defense strong. This rule allows us to complete our efforts to complete the appropriations process for our top priorities, those of national security. I look forward, though, to bringing the other eight appropriation bills to the floor to fulfill the rest of our duty. Certainly, as an appropriator, no one wants to see this effort completed more than our committee and as I do. I have appreciated the important advocacy my colleagues on both sides have brought forward through this process, from within the subcommittees of the Appropriations Committee, through the full committee, through the Rules Committee, and now, here on the House floor. The measures included in this rule will provide vital resources for our national defense and for our military infrastructure. As I said, it will boost the pay of our troops, support our military families who sacrifice so much for our country; it will strengthen the care we provide for our veterans and enforce our border security to protect all of the American people. This rule will also allow for further security improvements for the Capitol campus to protect all who visit here. It will also provide robust funding to improve our Nation’s waterways, our infrastructure, our important nuclear cleanup, as well as nonproliferation efforts. It also reinstates our top priority, providing funding for our national defense. We must begin to rebuild our Nation’s military, and I am proud of this as a major step forward, restoring military readiness in order to keep our country safe. Mr. Speaker, the underlying appropriations within this rule are of the utmost importance to the Nation, and we must move forward with this rule in order to get our job done. The men and women in uniform serving our Nation around the globe are depending on us. I hope our colleagues, my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, will support this rule so that we can do that, get our job done. The material previously referred to by Ms. SLAUGHTER is as follows: 
THEVOTE ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION : WHAT ITREALLY MEANS  This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the House of Representatives (VI, 308–311), describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.’’ To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition’’ in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R–Illinois) said: ‘‘The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.’’ The Republican majority may say ‘‘the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.’’ But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here’s how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ‘‘Although it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by voting down the previous question on the rule....  When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.’’ In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled ‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ‘‘Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon.’’ Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Republican majority’s agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous question. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 478, the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. GRANGER ) and the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. VISCLOSKY ) each will control 10 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chairman, the amendments included in the en bloc were made in order by the rule for consideration of division A of H.R. 3219 and have been agreed to by both sides. Mr. Chairman, I support the amendment and urge its adoption, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment. I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. ROSEN ). Ms. ROSEN. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to urge passage of my amendment which supports the Army’s unfunded requirements request for improved munitions precision. The continued development of missile cooling technology, which releases a refrigerant at predetermined temperatures, maintains the integrity of missile electronics when fired. This improves flight control, extends range, and provides greater targeting precision. My amendment improves current and future missile systems, furthering our ability to reach every corner of the world in defense of our Nation. As we grapple with threats from adversaries such as North Korea, Russia, and Iran and execute our counterISIL campaign, our military deserves the greatest technological edge so that our troops never find themselves in a fair fight. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment to maintain America’s military technology superiority as our servicemembers bravely safeguard our Nation. Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. WELCH ). Mr. WELCH. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment that would—it is shocking that it would have to even do this— prohibit spending money on these Afghan uniforms that met the sartorial taste of a general that corresponded to lush tropical forests. Number one, what the general wants for sartorial splendor of his troops is not our problem. Number two, his sartorial taste had to do with tropical forests, which is not what we have in Afghanistan. I am very happy that General Mattis himself was outraged by this, and I applaud him. But it is an opportunity for us to express our outrage as well. We all want to support our men and women in uniform, and we all want them to have good uniforms. But it is not up to an Afghan general to take taxpayer money on a vanity project that ultimately undercuts the security of our troops. So, Mr. Chairman, I believe I speak for everyone. Let’s not do it. Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, first of all, I want to commend the gentleman from Vermont for his amendment and for his thoughtful approach to this problem. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. LOWENTHAL ). Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the bipartisan amendment that I am leading on with Representative COMSTOCK , along with many of our colleagues on the STARBASE Caucus. I appreciate it being included in the en bloc package of amendments. This amendment would simply increase funding for the Department of Defense’s STARBASE program from 25 to $30 million for the fiscal year 2018, bringing funding back to the fiscal year 2017 enacted level. Providing science, technology, engineering, and math, STEM education, to America’s 
youth is critical to the global competitiveness of our Nation. The STARBASE program engages local fifth grade elementary students by exposing them to STEM subjects through an inquirybased curriculum. Serving communities from Los Alamitos, California, to Winchester, Virginia, and across the Nation, there are now 59 programs in congressional districts throughout 30 States, including the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Close to 1 million fifth graders across the Nation have now had the opportunity to participate in handson STEM classes on military bases thanks to STARBASE. Moreover, the Department of Defense’s STARBASE program is one of the most costeffective programs across the Federal Government. Mr. Chairman, I urge the adoption of this amendment. Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. DINGELL ). Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of Mr. DELANEY ’s bipartisan amendment included in this en bloc that would increase funding for the Fisher House Foundation. Fisher House has now served our veterans and their families for 26 years providing valuable housing opportunities as veterans receive medical treatment at military and VA medical centers across the country. When I first learned of them—longer than I want to admit—there were just a few of them. Now there are 72 and many more in the pipeline. They have served 305,000 military families. For many veterans and their families, the distance to their nearest VA medical center can be too far to travel on a routine basis, and the cost over time means many veterans are alone— nobody by their side—during their treatment or hospital stay—a situation no one should be in. No veteran who has served their country should have to face medical care or a hospital stay without the support of their loved ones by their side. Fisher Houses provide the lodging and transportation resources to help families stay together throughout the treatment process. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Maine (Ms. PINGREE ), who is a member of the full committee. Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member very much for yielding to me today. I rise during this en bloc amendment debate to discuss an issue that is raised in the amendment about the importance of the DDG–51 to our Navy. In particular, I am grateful to our committee for the clear guidance and language that was provided in the fiscal year 2017 Omnibus Appropriations Act that was passed in this body just 2 short months ago. That language called attention to the need not only to support the DDG–51 program but to ensure we do so with a design and upgrade that is technically mature and fiscally responsible. It was clear in that language, and in report language that is included in the bill before us today, that Congress continues to expect the Navy to comply with the direction that the additional fiscal year ‘16 DDG–51 ship be contracted and completed as a flight IIA ship. Because there are concerns raised by the GAO about the new flight III design radar upgrade for the DDG–51, there needs to be a thoughtful process in place. Again, I want to thank the chair and ranking member who have been incredibly supportive of the DDG program in the past and the work that it brings to States like Maine and across the country. Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I simply, again, reiterate my support for the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SOTO. Mr. Chair, I want to make a statement regarding the passage of H.R. 3219, the Make America Secure Appropriations Act, 2018. Specifically, I would like to make a statement about my amendment, Soto Number 20, to Division A, the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2018. My amendment moved $10 million from the Operation and Maintenance, DefenseWide account to the Defense Health Program’s PeerReviewed Prostate Cancer Research Program. Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in men and is the second most common cause of male death. In 2017, approximately 161,360 men in the U.S. will be diagnosed with prostate cancer and an estimated 26,730 will die from it. The Prostate Cancer Research Program is a unique research program in that it prioritizes research that will lead to the elimination of death from prostate cancer while enhancing the wellbeing of men experiencing the impact of the disease. I support funding prostate cancer research and thank my colleagues for their support of my amendment. Mr. Chair, I want to make a statement regarding the passage of H.R. 3219, the Make America Secure Appropriations Act, 2018. Specifically, I would like to make a statement about my amendment, Soto Number 19, to Division A, the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2018. My amendment moved $1 million from the Operation and Maintenance, DefenseWide account to the Defense Health Program’s PeerReviewed Gulf War Illness Research Program. If we are going to spend money on medical research within the Department of Defense, the Department must adequately fund research on those diseases that originate in war and wholly affect our servicemen and women. Over a quarter of a million veterans display symptoms of this disease, and the time has come to find, and fund, a cure for it. I support funding Gulf War illness research and thank my colleagues for their support of my amendment. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I want to thank Chairwoman GRANGER and Ranking Member VISCLOSKY for shepherding this legislation to the floor and for their devotion to the men and women of the Armed Forces who risk their lives to keep our nation safe and for their work in ensuring that they have resources needed to keep our Armed Forces the greatest fighting force for peace on earth. Mr. Chair, thank you for the opportunity to explain my amendment, which is simple and straightforward and affirms an example of the national goodness that makes America the most exceptional nation on earth. The purpose of Jackson Lee Amendment No. 1 is to provide the Secretary of Defense flexibility to allocate resources needed to provide technical assistance by U.S. military women to military women in other countries combating violence as a weapon of war, terrorism, human trafficking, narcotics trafficking. Mr. Chair, the United States is committed to combating violent extremism, protecting our borders and the globe from the scourge of terrorism. The United States Armed Forces possess an unparalleled expertise and technological capability that will aid not only in combating and defeating terrorists who hate our country and prey upon innocent persons, especially women, girls, and the elderly. But we must recognize that notwithstanding our extraordinary technical military capabilities, we face adversaries who adapt very quickly because they are not constrained by geographic limitations or norms of morality and decency. Al Qaeda, Boko Haram, Al Shabaab, ISIS/ ISIL and other militant terrorists, including the Sinai’s Ansar Beit alMaqdis in the Sinai Peninsula which poses a threat to Egypt. Jackson Lee Amendment No. 1 helps provide the Department of Defense with the resources needed to provide technical assistance to countries on innovative strategies to provide defense technologies and resources that promote the security of the American people and allied nation states. Terrorism, human trafficking, narcotics trafficking and their impact on women and girls across the globe has had a great adverse impact on us all. According to a UNICEF report, rape, torture and human trafficking by terrorist and militant groups have been employed as weapons of war, affecting over twenty thousand women and girls. Looking at the history of terrorism highlights the importance of providing technical assistance through our military might, as this enables us to combat terrorism which now can plague us here in the United States. Jackson Lee Amendment No. 1 will help curb terrorism abroad by making available American technical military expertise to military in other countries, like Nigeria, who are combating violent jihadists in their country and to keep those terrorists out of our country. Time and again American lives have been lost at the hands of terrorists. These victims include Christians, Muslims, journalists, health care providers, relief workers, schoolchildren, and members of the diplomatic corps and the Armed Services. This is why the technical assistance offered by our military personnel is integral to promoting security operation of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft for missions to empower local forces to combat terrorism. 
Terrorists across the globe have wreaked havoc on our society and cannot be tolerated or ignored, for their actions pose a threat to our national security and the security of the world. Mr. Chair, from the United States to Africa to Europe to Asia and the Middle East, it is clear that combating terrorism remains one of our highest national priorities. Collectively, helping our neighbors and their military build capacity to combat terrorism, eradicate human trafficking, stop narcotics trafficking and negate their impact on women and girls across the globe serves our national interest. I urge my colleagues to support Jackson Lee Amendment No. 1. Mr. Chair, I want to thank Chairwoman GRANGER and Ranking Member V ISCLOSKY for shepherding this legislation to the floor and for their devotion to the men and women of the Armed Forces who risk their lives to keep our nation safe. Mr. Chair, thank you for the opportunity to explain my amendment, which is identical to an amendment that I offered and was adopted last year to the Defense Appropriations Act for FY2017 (H.R. 5293). My amendment increases funding for the Defense Health Program’s research and development by $10 million. These funds will address the question of breast cancer in the United States military. The American Cancer Society calls several strains of breast cancer as a particularly aggressive subtype associated with lower survival rates; in this instance, it is a triple negative. But I raise an article: ‘‘Fighting a Different Battle; Breast Cancer and the Military.’’ Breast cancer can affect both men and women. The bad news is breast cancer has been just about as brutal on women in the military as combat. Let me say that sentence again. Breast cancer has been just about as brutal on women in the military as combat. More than 800 women have been wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan, according to the Army Times; 874 military women were diagnosed with breast cancer just between 2000 and 2011. And according to that same study, more are suspected. It grows. The good news is that we have been working on it, and I want to add my appreciation to the military. Jackson Lee Amendment No. 25, however, will allow for the additional research. That research is particularly needed since women are joining the Armed Services in increasing numbers and serving longer, ascending to leadership. Within increased age comes increased risk and incidence of breast cancer. Not only is breast cancer striking relatively young military women at an alarming rate, but male service members, veterans and their dependents are at risk as well. With a younger and generally healthier population, those in military tend to have a lower risk for most cancers than civilians—including significantly lower colorectal, lung and cervical—but breast cancer is a different story. Military people in general, and in some cases very specifically, are at a significantly greater risk for contracting breast cancer, according to Dr. Richard Clapp, a top cancer expert at Boston University who works at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on military breast cancer issues. Dr. Clapp notes that life in the military can mean exposure to a witch’s brew of risk factors directly linked to greater chances of getting breast cancer. So, I am asking that we do the right thing. We are on the right track, we’re on the right road. But with the expansion of women in the military, it is extremely important to move forward with this amendment to help ensure that the men and women who risk their lives to protect our freedom can live longer, healthier lives. I urge my colleagues to support Jackson Lee Amendment No. 25. Mr. Chair, I am pleased that the En Bloc Amendment also includes Jackson Lee Amendment No. 50 that was made in order under the Rule. Jackson Lee Amendment No. 50 increases funding for the PTSD by $5 million. These funds should be used toward outreach activities targeting hard to reach veterans, especially those who are homeless or reside in underserved urban and rural areas, who suffer from PostTraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Mr. Chair, along with traumatic brain injury, PTSD is the signature wound suffered by the brave men and women fighting in Afghanistan, Iraq, and far off lands to defend the values and freedom we hold dear. For those of us whose daily existence is not lived in harm’s way, it is difficult to imagine the horrific images that American servicemen and women deployed in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other theaters of war see on a daily basis. In an instant a suicide bomber, an IED, or an insurgent can obliterate your best friend and right in front of your face. Yet, you are trained and expected to continue on with the mission, and you do, even though you may not even have reached your 20th birthday. But there always comes a reckoning. And it usually comes after the stress and trauma of battle is over and you are alone with your thoughts and memories. And the horror of those desperate and dangerous encounters with the enemy and your own mortality come flooding back. PTSD was first brought to public attention in relation to war veterans, but it can result from a variety of traumatic incidents, such as torture, being kidnapped or held captive, bombings, or natural disasters such as floods or earthquakes. People with PTSD may startle easily, become emotionally numb (especially in relation to people with whom they used to be close), lose interest in things they used to enjoy, have trouble feeling affectionate, be irritable, become more aggressive, or even become violent. They avoid situations that remind them of the original incident, and anniversaries of the incident are often very difficult. Most people with PTSD repeatedly relive the trauma in their thoughts during the day and in nightmares when they sleep. These are called flashbacks; a person having a flashback may lose touch with reality and believe that the traumatic incident is happening all over again. Mr. Chair, the fact of the matter is that most veterans with PTSD also have other psychiatric disorders, which are a consequence of PTSD. These veterans have cooccurring disorders, which include depression, alcohol and/or drug abuse problems, panic, and/or other anxiety disorders. Jackson Lee Amendment No. 50 recognizes that these soldiers are first and foremost, human, who live their experiences. Ask a veteran of Vietnam, Iraq, or Afghanistan about the frequency of nightmares they experience, and one will realize that serving in the Armed Forces leaves a lasting impression, whether good or bad. Jackson Lee Amendment No. 50 will help ensure that ‘‘no soldier is left behind’’ by addressing the urgent need for more outreach toward hard to reach veterans suffering from PTSD, especially those who are homeless or reside in underserved urban and rural areas of our country. I thank the Chair and Ranking Member for including Jackson Lee Amendment No. 50 in the En Bloc Amendment and urge my colleagues to support the En Bloc Amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendments en bloc offered by the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. GRANGER ). The en bloc amendments were agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 8 OFFERED BY MR . LANGEVIN  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 8 printed in part B of House Report 115–261. Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 8, line 23, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(reduced by $10,000,000)’’. Page 34, line 18, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(increased by $10,000,000)’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 478, the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. LANGEVIN ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Rhode Island. Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I offer this amendment today to support the DOD Cyber Scholarship Program with strong bipartisan support from my good friends, Mr. RATCLIFFE , Ms. S TEFANIK , Mr. CORREA , Ms. R OSEN , Mr. L IEU, and Ms. SHEAPORTER . Mr. Chairman, since 2001, DOD has run the Information Assurance Scholarship Program in order to boost the Nation’s cyber workforce through scholarship and capacitybuilding grants. Scholarship recipients are required to fulfill a service obligation by working in a cybersecurity position at DOD upon graduation. Mr. Chairman, this program had been extremely successful, bringing nearly 600 students into the DOD workforce. However, due to budget constraints, the Department has reduced funding and stopped recruiting new students. This year we seek to reinvigorate the 
program, calling it the DOD Cyber Scholarship Program. As the ranking member of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities, I fully understand the budget pressure the Department has been facing. However, cutting the pipeline of cyber talent into the Department is incredibly shortsighted. We face a critical workforce shortage right now, as we speak, when it comes to cybersecurity across all sectors of the economy and in government. The challenges of building up our cyber talent is something that keeps me up at night. We know that cybersecurity is the national security issue of the 21st century and that no conflict, both today or in the future, will be fought without a cyber component as a part of it. Now, DOD has made significant strides in preparing to defend the Nation in this new domain, standing up USCYBERCOM and improving its cybersecurity posture through programs like the wildly successful Hack the Pentagon program and DARPA’s Cyber Grand Challenge. But these initiatives need talented network engineers, cybersecurity researchers, and, yes, hackers. The Cyber Scholarship Program encourages students to look at cybersecurity as an area of academic study and then exposes them to the amazing mission set at the Department. While we may not be able to compete on a dollartodollar basis with the private sector in terms of salary, public service certainly is its own reward, and DOD has the most challenging and rewarding problems facing us today and the honor that comes with protecting their fellow Americans. We need as many digital natives to enter this exciting field and experience the rewards of public service, which is why we must reinvigorate the Cyber Scholarship Program with this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I worked with the same colleagues who joined me on this amendment to include similar funding in the National Defense Authorization Act. I would like to thank my friends, Senators KAINE, PERDUE , and R OUNDS  for leading a similar effort across the Capitol in the Senate. So I would also like to, again, thank Chairwoman GRANGER and Ranking Member VISCLOSKY for their steadfast commitment to our armed services. This commonsense amendment will help ensure DOD is prepared for future fights, and I urge its adoption. Ms. GRANGER. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. LANGEVIN. I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to accept the amendment. b1445 Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Indiana is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. CORREA ). Mr. CORREA. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of amendment No. 8 offered by Mr. LANGEVIN to provide funding for the Department of Defense Cyber Scholarship Program. Our country is facing a severe shortage of trained cyber professionals, a shortage that includes about 10,000 cybersecurity experts in government alone, and estimated to be about 1 million shortages throughout our economy by 2019. We need to give young people the incentive to follow careers in cybersecurity to learn skills such as computer coding and ethical hacking. This amendment provides $10 million for scholarships for associate degrees at community colleges and assists with program execution from DOD and NSA. I cosponsored this amendment, and I want to thank Congressman LANGEVIN  for offering this important piece of legislation. I urge all my colleagues to support this amendment. Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, just briefly, I thank my colleagues that were speaking in favor of my amendment. I thank the majority for accepting the amendment and supporting the effort to build up our Nation’s cyber workforce. Cybersecurity is the national security challenge of the 21st century. We are doing great things to meet those challenges. We just need to make sure our workforce can meet those needs. I know this amendment will be a major step in helping us to achieve that goal. I thank all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, and I thank the chair and ranking member for their support of this effort. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. LANGEVIN ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 10 OFFERED BY MR . SUOZZI  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 10 printed in part B of House Report 115–261. Mr. SUOZZI. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 8, line 23, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(reduced by $34,734,000)’’. Page 14, line 13, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(increased by $34,734,000)’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 478, the gentleman from New York (Mr. SUOZZI ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. Mr. SUOZZI. Mr. Chair, I rise today to speak in support of a bipartisan amendment that I am offering with Congressman PETER KING and Congressman PAULCOOK. Amendment No. 10 under the rule is to division A of the Defense Appropriations bill. The purpose of the amendment is to match the $34 million in funding for the Navy’s Environmental Restoration Account, authorized unanimously in the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act, but was not included in the appropriations process. In my district, for almost four decades, the people of Bethpage and the surrounding areas have been dealing with an environmental crisis. Groundwater pollution, stemming from the Navy and defense contractor activity, has resulted in an underground plume of contaminated water that is moving south through Long Island’s sole source of drinking water, towards Congressman KING’s district. While costly remediation efforts ensure the water is safe to consume, it doesn’t change the fact that residents deserve to have this cleaned up before it spreads any further. The contamination, known as the NavyGrumman Plume, is one of thousands of sites at hundreds of locations that have experienced environmental degradation because of defenserelated activities. Congressman PETER KING, Congressman PAUL COOK, and I have submitted this bipartisan amendment that will increase funding for the Navy’s Environmental Restoration Account, which helps fund cleanup and remediation efforts for these sites. This is not a partisan issue. The funding levels sought by this amendment received bipartisan support in the NDAA. Chairman THORNBERRY ’s mark and my amendment together, which was joined by Congressman COOK and Congresswoman HANABUSA , increased the authorized amount by $42 million. The amount sought here, $34 million, will match the appropriated amount with the authorized funding levels. Our colleagues on both sides of the aisle supported that effort because this funding will help clean up sites from Maine to Hawaii, from Florida to Washington State, and were provided for with the appropriate payfor. I ask for my colleagues’ support for this bipartisan amendment so we can help fund efforts across the country to help clean up environmental contamination in our districts. People in my district and regions across the country deserve to have these sites fully cleaned. It is commonsense, bipartisan, and the right thing to do. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman raising this issue. I am supportive of efforts to ensure that the Department of Defense takes 
responsibility for any potential contamination issues. That is why this bill provides more than $1 billion for environmental restoration accounts, nearly $48 million more than fiscal year 2017. The bill includes an increase of $10 million specifically to support water contamination efforts. In addition, the committee provided an additional $57 million for those efforts in the fiscal year 2017 supplemental appropriations. The committee has already provided a generous amount of funding to address water contamination, and the Department of Defense has assured me that they are addressing each side on a priority basis. The amendment offered by the gentleman provides additional funding that the Department may not be able to execute, and the funding comes at the expense of the warfighter readiness account. Therefore, I must oppose the amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SUOZZI. Mr. Chairman, I would just like to point out to the gentlewoman, respectfully, that it will cost billions of dollars to clean up these sites in the United States of America. The increase that we are seeking here, in a bipartisan fashion, is $34 million to simply match the amount of money that was authorized in the NDAA. In addition, this percentage increase that we are seeking is commensurate with the overall percentage increase in the overall NDAA budget this year from last year. So we are just simply seeking the same commensurate amount increase in this portion of the budget that there is in another portion. We are looking to have the payfor to come from the operations and maintenance defensewide account, of which there is over $33 billion. We are looking for $34 million just to try to advance some of these cleanups. Mr. VISCLOSKY. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. SUOZZI. I yield to the gentleman from Indiana. Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I would point out that the gentlewoman is absolutely correct. The committee worked hard to increase funding for these accounts. Also, I would point out, representing the First Congressional District of Indiana, I am intimately familiar with the problems these environmental sites have. There is much to do, many resources we need to look for, and I would support the gentleman’s amendment. Mr. SUOZZI. Mr. Chairman, I would just like to close by saying that I do appreciate the hard work that has been done by so many on both sides of the aisle in this particular area. We all appreciate how important the cleanup of these environmental sites are. The people in my district have been suffering with this for 40 years, and we are trying to bring attention to the issue and trying to get the resources focused on this. We have met with people from the Navy, from the Army Corps of Engineers, from the EPA, from the DEC, and from local State officials in the State of New York that are interested. Congressman PETER KING and Congressman PAUL COOK both understand how important it is that we try and send the signal that we are trying to have a commensurate increase in this account with the overall increase in the budget. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. SUOZZI ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. SUOZZI. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO . 12 OFFERED BY MR . BRENDAN F . 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 12 printed in part B of House Report 115–261. Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 8, line 23, after the dollar amount insert the following: ‘‘(reduced by $60,000,000)’’. Page 14, line 13, after the dollar amount insert the following: ‘‘(increased by $30,000,000)’’. Page 15, line 8, after the dollar amount insert the following: ‘‘(increased by $30,000,000’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 478, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania. Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, this is a bit of a complex issue, so I will do my best to explain. It is, unfortunately, an issue that my constituents and a number in the suburban Philadelphia area have been dealing with now for the last 2
1⁄2 years. The chemicals with the acronyms PFOS and PFOA are part of a class of manmade, highly fluorinated chemicals that are highly persistent in our environment. In the 1970s, the Department of Defense began using a firefighting foam with the acronym AFFF. Unfortunately, that firefighting foam to extinguish petroleum fires contained these chemical compounds. These chemicals have subsequently been linked to problems in liver, thyroid, and pancreatic function, as well as changes in hormone levels. Some studies have shown developmental issues in children, decreased fertility, increased cholesterol, immune system deficiencies, and an increased cancer risk. Production of AFFF has ceased, but stockpiles remain. Today, the Department of Defense is evaluating and testing the drinking water systems of hundreds of communities nationwide due to PFOA and PFOS contamination on or surrounding these defense installations across the country that used AFFF. So far, water contamination has been found near 27 military bases in 16 States. This includes the community that I represent and that my colleagues share in representing. In my district alone, families surrounding Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Willow Grove, as well as the Horsham Air Guard Station, suffer from the uncertainty of wondering whether their child’s or their spouse’s illness is caused by the military’s contamination on the base in their local community. They have paid for endless stockpiles of bottled water and higher utility fees, as their communities have taken steps to reduce the water system’s exposure. I commend the steps the military has taken to date, but more can and must be done. I know that our communities in the Philadelphia area are, sadly, just the tip of the iceberg. This past year alone, since the EPA tightened its lifetime health advisory under the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Department has completed testing of 480 drinking water systems at locations where the Department supplies drinking water. It continues to conduct preliminary assessments and site inspections under CERCLA to identify sites where PFOA and PFOS may have been released by the Department of Defense. The Department spent approximately $200 million just last year in response to PFOA and PFOS contamination nationwide. This funding has been used to conduct preliminary assessments and site inspections, test drinking water systems, and provide mitigation such as bottled water or drinking water filtration systems where water system tests indicated PFOA and PFOS are above the EPA advisory levels. Unfortunately, though, the Department has been funding this response using existing funds that were originally programmed for other response actions. In order to support nearterm outreach and engagement in local communities that have this impacted drinking water system and adequately prepare for longterm remediation of what is likely to be billions of dollars’ and many years’ worth of response, I worked with the House Armed Services Committee to increase its authorization for the Navy and Air Force environmental remediation accounts by an additional $30 million each in the NDAA the House passed earlier this month. My amendment would bring the 
appropriation in line with that authorization. This funding is a necessary response to an ongoing environmental issue that is only going to get worse and more expensive for the Department, not to mention the countless innocent communities impacted across the country, both in Republican and Democratic districts. b1500 I want to thank my Republican neighbors PATMEEHAN and B RIAN FITZPATRICK for working with me on this issue in a truly bipartisan manner. I hope the House comes together in a similar manner today to strengthen our Department of Defense’s response to drinking water contamination it is causing in the communities we represent. Mr. Chair, how much time do I have remaining? The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania has 15 seconds remaining. Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chair, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK ), my neighbor and colleague from Bucks County. Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Chairman, with my limited time, I just want to say Brendan said it well. He has done a fabulous job working with Congressman MEEHAN and me, all of whom have districts that have been impacted by this real tragedy, and I stand in full support. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this amendment. Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chair, I share many of the gentleman’s concerns, and I appreciate him raising this issue. I support environmental remediation efforts that ensure that drinking water is safe in communities across the Nation. That is why this bill includes $1 billion for environmental restoration. The amount represents $48 million more than the fiscal year 2017 level and includes $10 million above the request to specifically address PFC contamination. In addition, we include an additional $57 million for drinking water cleanup in the fiscal year 2017 supplemental appropriations. This committee has included significant funding to address drinking water contamination issues, and I am concerned that the Department will not be able to execute the additional $60 million offered by this amendment; therefore, I oppose the amendment. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. BRENDAN F. B OYLE ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania will be postponed. AMENDMENT NO . 13 OFFERED BY MR . GROTHMAN  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 13 printed in part B of House Report 115–261. Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 8, line 23, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(reduced by $30,000,000)’’. Page 22, line 17, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(increased by $30,000,000)’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 478, the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. GROTHMAN ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Wisconsin. Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairwoman and ranking member for their collaborative effort to bring this bill forward. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment to H.R. 3219. Nothing is more important than the safety of our men and women in uniform, and I believe that we in Congress are committed to ensuring our armed services receive the best equipment possible. This equipment includes platforms like the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle, or JLTV. This vehicle is the centerpiece of the Army and Marine Corps’ tactical wheeled vehicle modernization strategy and closes an existing critical capability gap for both services. The JLTV demonstrates many significant improvements over the current vehicle fleet, including strengthened protection for passengers against current and future battlefield threats, more payload capacity, and better automotive performance. This is basically what replaces years ago what you would call your Jeep. Anybody who talks to veterans or hears about people being injured and all, so many of them died or were seriously injured driving in a vehicle that hit an explosive. These vehicles are going to be a dramatic improvement over what we have now as far as saving lives in our troops. As long as we have troops in Afghanistan, it is important that, as quickly as possible, we deliver the best equipment possible. To achieve that goal, Congress should maintain its support for the existing JLTV acquisition plan. Recently, we in the House passed the National Defense Authorization Act of 2018. My amendment to this appropriations bill would simply transfer funds from the operations and maintenance account in the bill and then appropriate those funds to the JLTV program to bring them in line with what we in the House authorized in the NDAA. The JLTV program supports American jobs with more than 300 suppliers from 30 States. Pure and simple, the JLTV platform will save lives and improve our troops’ effectiveness in the field. I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment. Ms. GRANGER. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. GROTHMAN. I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for his amendment. The amendment proposes to add funding back to the JLTV program, cutting the House defense bill due to a lack of information provided by the Army budget justification. The cut to the JLTV program reflects the committee’s concern with the Army’s failure to provide the full budget justification information for an $804 million program. Failure to provide this information makes it impossible for the committee to exercise its fiscal oversight responsibilities. However, the JLTV program is important to the warfighter and is executing well. I do not oppose this amendment. Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Chair, I would like to thank the Appropriations Committee for the hard work they have done. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. GROTHMAN ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 31 OFFERED BY MR . DUNN  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 31 printed in part B of House Report 115–261. Mr. DUNN. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows:

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 478, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DUNN) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. Mr. DUNN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chair, throughout the country, there are remote areas where the men and women of our armed services prepare for war in order to protect the peace. Although these places are often overlooked, our investments in military test and training ranges are returned 
to the Nation many times over in the projection of American military supremacy around the globe protecting the homeland and preserving international order. In the Southeast, the Joint Gulf Range Complex facilities are for testing and training of supersonic and hypersonic weapons systems, including combat training and livefire exercises of the frontline fighters like the F–22 and F–35. The 325th Fighter Wing and the 53rd Weapons Evaluation Group at Tyndall Air Force Base, the 96th Test Wing at Eglin Air Force Base, and the Special Operations Command at Hurlburt Field make extensive use of the Joint Gulf Range Complex. There is no comparable area in the United States near an established base with instrumentation infrastructure that can support advanced testing and joint training exercises like this. However, deployment of the instrumentation necessary to collect the data during the training on these fifth and sixthgeneration weapons systems is not in keeping with the U.S. Air Force needs. Instrumentation limitations have restricted the F–35 and F–22 training missions to the northernmost portion of the range. According to a study by the 96th Test Wing at Eglin Air Force Base, this limitation causes congestion and has obstructed at least 80 missions per year. This amendment, which I am offering with my Florida colleagues, Mr. TOM ROONEY , Mr. M ATT GAETZ , and Mr. FRANCIS ROONEY , will accelerate investments approved by Congress to deploy new infrastructure along the Joint Gulf Range Complex. The amendment will maximize the utility of this vast range, which is a true national treasure for combat training and advanced testing and evaluation. Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chair, will the gentleman yield? Mr. DUNN. I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chair, the committee has no objection. The amendment’s funding for major test facilities is critical to ensuring our military retains its competitive lead over our competitors. We are prepared to accept the amendment. Mr. DUNN. Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Indiana. Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chair, I am pleased to accept the gentleman’s amendment. Mr. DUNN. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. GAETZ ), my colleague and friend. Mr. GAETZ. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank our colleagues in the House for their agreement. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the brave men and women of the greatest military on Earth and to ensure that they are properly equipped for any and all challenges on the horizon. I support increased investments in our military test and training ranges with help from our Armed Forces to deal with the world’s challenges. In my district, the Gulf Test Range provides approximately 120,000 square miles of overwater airspace. It is used for highaltitude, supersonic air combat training, airtoair missile testing, drone targeting, hypersonic weapons testing, space launches, and much more. It is critical training space for our Armed Forces, including the Air Force Special Operations Command, the 96th Test Wing, the 33rd Fighter Wing, and others. This is why I ask my colleagues to support the amendment to increase funding for the test range program. I thank the Congressman from Florida, Dr. DUNN, for his leadership, for the men and women in the military. I thank Chair GRANGER for her agreement to this amendment. I thank the minority party. Mr. DUNN. Mr. Chair, I have no further comments or remarks; however, I would like to encourage my colleagues to support this amendment to enhance military readiness and national security. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DUNN). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 35 OFFERED BY MS . SPEIER  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 35 printed in part B of House Report 115–261. Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 37, line 23, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(reduced by $25,000,000) (increased by $25,000,000)’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 478, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. SPEIER ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California. Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Chairman, the American people are becoming more and more aware of the degenerative disease known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy, CTE, due to the crisis in the NFL. The NFL, of course, has been trying to sweep this under the rug. Very recently, the Journal of the American Medical Association, a premier journal that is peerreviewed, provided a study that found severe neurological damage in the vast majority of former football players’ brains that were donated for research after they developed mental symptoms during life. Eightyseven percent of all football players’ brains showed CTE, but a truly horrible figure, 99 percent of the brains of NFL players showed CTE. However, the dangers of CTE are not confined to football. Our servicemen and women are subject to similar—or, oftentimes, even worse—dangers in the line of duty for the service they provide to our Nation. Last year, I was honored to host Dr. Bennet Omalu for the State of the Union. He is the doctor portrayed in the film ‘‘Concussion,’’ exposing the impact of CTE on professional football players. He began his research covering his own expenses and exposing a coverup of the suicides of former athletes. However, his research and the research of others is limited by the funding, which is why I am offering this amendment. Today we have an opportunity to prevent a similar kind of coverup among our service agencies. This amendment would dedicate $25 million in funding as part of the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs to award grants to medical researchers and universities to support early detection of CTE. b1515 This amendment would not increase spending, but take the funding already allocated and put some of it—a very small part of it—towards CTE. Every hour, we lose another veteran to suicide. We have made great strides towards supporting PTSD research, but the exposure to IEDs and other blasts and blows to the head, may be doing similar damage, which goes unseen until it is too late. By diagnosing CTE early among servicemembers, perhaps we can begin to change the troubling trend of suicides among our veterans. You may hear arguments today that this amendment is not necessary, since DOD is already spending $125 million on TBI research. But this research is on shortterm trauma, not on long term effects of repeated head injuries and, what are called, subconcussive blows. Servicemembers at risk of CTE may not even have acute trauma. CTE can result from minor events over a long period of time. You may also hear that Congress shouldn’t dictate the DOD research. But it is absolutely Congress’ role to have input into DOD spending, and there is a huge need that is not being filled. And we already are requiring that they do TBI research as it is. Now, some have suggested: Well, there has been some projects funded. Of the $125 million of funding, the amount of money going to CTE projects has been, since 2012, only five projects, for a grand total cost of $2.9 million. And not one dime has been spent since 2013. It is time for us to accept that science is real here. JAMA has just put out a stunning report that suggests that this is a very serious problem, and it is time for us to combat this issue. Creating dedicated grants for the early detection of CTE has the potential to prevent suicides among our servicemembers and will have, I think, a very important impact on how we look at CTE in the future and how we make sure that our servicemembers are properly protected. 
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentlewoman’s concern to provide adequate funding for this very important research, and we have spoken about it. I am a strong supporter of funding for research in this area, and that is why the bill already provides $125 million toward grants for PTSD and traumatic brain injury research, including CTE, which has previously received millions of dollars in research grants under this program. A previous amendment would create a new research program, focused solely on CTE research. And since CTE research is already eligible under the PTSDTBI research program, it is much more appropriate to add funding to the PTSDTBI program, rather than create a new research program. Therefore, I oppose the amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. VISCLOSKY ). Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me time. Mr. Chairman, I reluctantly join with the chair in opposition to the gentlewoman’s amendment and share the chair’s concern over the issue raised. However, I don’t think the approach is an appropriate one in that we would carve out another budget line. Given my anticipation that we will not have a full 12month fiscal year for this money to be spent, I am very concerned that we will find enough projects for this money to be spent on. In the meantime, they would then be eliminated from the existing line for other possible research. Mr. Chairman, I would look to work with the gentlewoman to address this issue in a fulsome fashion, but not in this manner. Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for his remarks, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Chairman, I thank both of my colleagues for their expression of support for the concept of making sure that CTE is studied. I am just hopeful that we can guarantee, through this amendment, that of that $125 million, some portion of it is set aside for CTE research. The fact that only $2.9 million has gone to CTE research since 2012, and not a dime since 2013, makes me worry that it is not a high priority within the Department. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from California (Ms. SPEIER ). The amendment was rejected. 
AMENDMENT NO . 38 OFFERED BY MR . NADLER  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 38 printed in part B of House Report 115–261. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Strike sections 8094 and 8095. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 478, the gentleman from New York (Mr. NADLER ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes. Mr. Chairman, this amendment will strike sections 8094 and 8095 of the bill that prohibit the transfer of Guantanamo detainees to the United States and prohibit the use of funds to construct or modify facilities in the United States for Guantanamo detainees. These provisions are designed to further delay the transfer of detainees out of Guantanamo. Guantanamo is costing us a fortune. It costs the American taxpayer $10 million a year to keep a single detainee in Guantanamo, and only $78,000 to keep a detainee in a Federal maximum security prison in the United States. That is a waste of $440 million a year. Perhaps, most importantly, it is a question of values. What is most offensive is not that the prisoners are at Guantanamo, as opposed to some prison in the United States, but that we are holding people without any hearing, without any due process, essentially forever. That is against all American values. Mr. Chairman, we have debated Guantanamo amendments every year, multiple times a year. The last time was 2 weeks ago. It is an issue I care deeply about, and I offer this amendment again. However, yesterday, the President took an action that is so egregious, and so offensive, that I feel compelled to use a portion of my time to address it directly. Yesterday’s attack by the Commander in Chief on our military’s ActiveDuty transgender personnel is appalling. Transgender individuals are part of the fabric of America and have always been part of our military, whether we have historically acknowledged them or not. The arguments against allowing transgender servicemembers to serve openly in our military are the same arguments that have been used against every other group that has been prohibited from serving in our country’s history—including Black and Latino men, women, gays, lesbians, and bisexuals. Each time the doors of our military open farther to better reflect the diversity of our Nation, the same tired and discredited arguments are brought back: that any individual in the new group, regardless of his or her ability, is unfit to serve and that their service will disrupt unit cohesion. The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself an additional 1 minute. Not only should all willing and able Americans be allowed and encouraged to serve—they already do. A report prepared for the Department of Defense estimates thousands of transgender individuals serve today, without issue. The President must not impose blanket bans that prejudge servicemembers based on their identity, rather than their own merits. President Trump is attacking people who have shown a willingness—indeed, an eagerness—to risk their lives in the service of our country. It is apparent that the decision to ban transgender people from military service was taken without consulting Secretary of Defense Mattis, who seemed surprised by the tweets, or the military, which seems at a loss as to how to implement the order. Even if this bigoted order is motivated by political opportunism, it disgraces our country and must be rescinded. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chairman, these important revisions have been included in several appropriations bills for several years running. They represent a strong and enduring consensus in Congress that Guantanamo should remain open and that detainees should not be transferred to the United States for any reason. Striking these provisions would have unknown consequences for U.S. communities. It is impossible to know how many detainees might be brought here, where they might be held, and the impacts on communities and facilities holding them. It is also impossible to know what the potential costs could be. Putting detainees in U.S. prisons, as the administration originally proposed, would be disruptive and, potentially, disastrous. Former FBI Director Mueller has stated: ‘‘To transfer detainees to local jails could affect or infect other prisoners or have the capability of affecting events outside the prison system.’’ The idea of bringing detainees for trials in the U.S. quickly collapsed as local jurisdictions voiced their strong opposition. As everyone here is aware, several detainees who have been released from Guantanamo have gone back to the fight and killed and wounded Americans. The threat is real, and Guantanamo is already equipped to handle the detention and military trial of these individuals, as appropriate. Any proposal that results in these detainees being sent to the United States, for any reason, is simply the wrong policy. I, therefore, oppose the amendment, and I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment. 
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining? The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New York has 2 minutes remaining. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE ). Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time, and I thank him for his continued leadership on this issue. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of this amendment, which would remove a provision that prevents the Department of Defense from closing the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The continued use of this facility does not make our country safer and only serves to undermine our national security. Well respected military leaders and national security officials have said that Guantanamo remains a propaganda tool for terrorist groups that is used to incite violence against Americans. In 2015, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which is composed of 57 member states, including all NATO allies, concluded that Guantanamo serves as an obstacle to counterterrorism cooperation and that the facility should be closed. In addition, the cost of housing detainees and maintaining the facility continues to be a financial drain on the Department of Defense. According to Human Rights First, Guantanamo costs the U.S. approximately $445 million per year to operate. The average cost per detainee at Guantanamo is more than $10 million. At the same time, the cost per prisoner at the Federal supermax prison in Colorado, which houses such terrorists as 9/11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui, World Trade Center bomber Ramzi Yousef, and Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, is $78,000. Mr. Chairman, this should not be a partisan issue. National security experts on both sides of the aisle have concluded that keeping Guantanamo open is harmful to American interests. Secretaries of State from previous Republican administrations, including Henry Kissinger, James Baker, and Colin Powell, have all said that closing Guantanamo would improve America’s image around the world. Former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Martin Dempsey and Admiral Mike Mullen, have both said that the detention facility needs to be closed. Former President George W. Bush has said that the detention facility has ‘‘become a propaganda tool for our enemies and a distraction for our allies.’’ Senator JOHN MCCAIN, the man whose credibility on the horrors of war is unimpeachable, has repeatedly said that he favors closing the detention facility because of the imagine of the United States that it projects to the rest of the world. Closing the Guantanamo Bay detention facility will strengthen our national security and show the rest of the world the principle of equal justice under law is inviolable. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to send an important message about the values discussed and support the Nadler amendment. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, as the designee of the ranking member, I move to strike the last word. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Indiana is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I feel compelled to rise in support of the gentleman’s amendment, as it relates to the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, and would simply make a few brief remarks. This is, I believe, a very substantive and serious issue facing a constitutional government, our government of laws. I would point out that it is a sad state of affairs if somewhere in the United States of America we cannot find a secure facility to detain 41 individuals at this late date, given the fact that President Bush released over 500 people from Guantanamo, and President Obama released 197. Mr. Chairman, I would simply close by observing that, within the last week, the Attorney General of the United States of America could not find a justification to have an alleged terrorist, who recruits for alQaida, having been extradited from Spain, an Algerian, placed in Guantanamo. That person, as I understand it, as I speak at this moment, is being detained in the United States of America. That is what should happen with the other 41 people. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. NADLER ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York will be postponed. b1530 The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 39 printed in part B of House Report 115–261. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 41 printed in part B of House Report 115–261. 
AMENDMENT NO . 42 OFFERED BY MR . FOSTER  
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 478, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. FOSTER ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. 
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chair, I just have a parliamentary inquiry. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chair, I have a question on the procedure. I understand that Mr. FOSTER is recognized. Did I lose track of an amendment for Mr. POLIS? The Acting CHAIR. That amendment was called, and the gentleman was not present. Mr. VISCLOSKY. And Mr. POE? The Acting CHAIR. That amendment was also called, and the gentleman was not present. Mr. VISCLOSKY. I appreciate the information. Sorry for the interruption very much. The Acting CHAIR. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois. Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Chairman, as you know, the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2018 tasks the Missile Defense Agency with developing a spacebased ballistic missile intercept layer. There is no doubt that a spacebased missile defense, if it is technologically feasible and economically justifiable, would make an important contribution to our national security. So would the Star Trek transporter or the warp drive, but as a scientist and, in fact, the only Ph.D. scientist in the U.S. Congress, I think that we need to do our homework before investing hundreds of billions of dollars into attempting to develop this system. As such, my amendment would prohibit the use of funds to attempt to develop a spacebased missile intercept layer. It has been more than 30 years since President Reagan called for defending the United States against a first strike by developing a strategic defense system, commonly known as Star Wars. The idea of a spacebased version of this has gone in and out of fashion for the last 30 years, but every time this spacebased concept has been looked at by technologically competent outside experts, it was deemed to be unworkable, impossibly expensive, vulnerable to countermeasures, easy for an opponent to destroy, easy to overwhelm with a small number of enemy missiles, or all of the above. This approach was judged technologically unworkable in 
1983, and the status quo has not changed. In order to reach a ballistic missile during the first few minutes of flight, a large number of interceptors must be stationed in lowaltitude orbit. A report conducted by the American Physical Society in 2003 concluded that in order to ensure full coverage, a fleet of 1,000 or more orbiting satellites would be required to intercept just a single missile. To put that in perspective, the United States currently has slightly more than 600 satellites in Earth orbit, which includes commercial, scientific, and military satellites. Moreover, the amount of launch that is required to put this material into orbit in a reasonable amount of time would greatly exceed the current U.S. launch capability. The National Academies of Sciences estimated that it would cost at least $300 billion—in 2003 dollars—for just such a limited capability. And just last year, in his testimony to the House Armed Services Committee, the former Director of the Missile Defense Authority, Admiral Syring, concluded the same thing. Setting aside the high cost, a space based missile defense system has inherent vulnerabilities that greatly limit its effectiveness. Even with thousands of interceptors deployed, only a few would be within range to target an incoming missile, and those could be easily overwhelmed by the launch of several missiles from one location. And because interceptors must be stationed in lowaltitude orbit, they are easily detected, tracked, and destroyed. Finally, there is a more fundamental question that we must ask ourselves. And that is: Is it wise to deploy weapons in space, especially when the required technology is becoming widely available around the world? Deploying such a system would strain strategic relationships around the globe and almost certainly trigger a space arms race. There is no doubt that ensuring our Nation’s defense and national security are of paramount priority, but spending hundreds of billions of dollars on a system which will not work, without having serious debate and at least some concept for how this might be remotely practical or affordable, is indefensible. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting ‘‘yes’’ on my amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Chairman, the spacebased missile defense layer that we debate today will be one of the most significant technological advancements in our missile defense capability since Ronald Reagan first brought this possibility to the Nation. Mr. F OSTER ’s amendment would prevent the next revolution in missile defense as we seek to expand our umbrella protection into space, the ultimate high ground. Mr. Speaker, the most critical priority of this Congress is the defense of the Nation. If we fail that task, little else we might do will be of any consequence. To prohibit the development of the next generation missile defense capabilities because other countries will object is to grant our potential adversaries a veto over our national security. Mr. FOSTER ’s amendment would do just that. It should be noted that every significant missile defense milestone ever achieved by this Nation has been over the objections of gentlemen like Mr. FOSTER and his supporters. They have been wrong about missile defense for decades, and they have a consistent record of demonstrably bad judgment on this issue. They have imposed their philosophy on the science and physics involved. Theirs is a broken record which began playing back in the 1970s. If we had listened to them, we would have no missile defense today and we would all be completely vulnerable to the likes of North Korea. The reason it was called Star Wars was because they derisively renamed Mr. Reagan’s Strategic Defense Initiative to Star Wars and said it was impossible because it would be hitting a bullet with a bullet. But, Mr. Chairman, today we not only hit a bullet with a bullet, we hit a dot on the side of a bullet with a bullet. The technology is here. We have demonstrated it time and time again. It is important to defeat this amendment for the sake of the Constitution, for the sake of the United States of America. Ms. GRANGER. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chairman, I join Mr. FRANKS in his remarks, and I urge rejection of this amendment. Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Chairman, can I inquire how much time I have remaining? The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Illinois has 1 minute remaining. Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Chairman, I would like to point out that Ronald Reagan never illuminated the possibility of this to the American public, because the possibility never existed. What we have today is not a missile defense system. It has failed in the great majority of tests. It has been tested against a very small fraction of the countermeasures that are elementary to deploy against it. I hope that no one involved in the missile defense system is telling President Trump that we have an effective antimissile system today, because if he gambles counting on any defense from that system, he is putting our country at risk. Mr. Chairman, I yield the remaining amount of my time to the ranking member. Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman yielding. I simply would want to rise in support of his amendment. I would point out that in 2010, the Ballistic Missile Defense Review made no request for spacebased interceptors. Currently, this is a matter under review by the Department. I think we should allow that review to be concluded before we expend moneys. The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman from Illinois has expired. Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Chairman, can I inquire as to how much time I have remaining? The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman has 3 minutes remaining. Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Chairman, I think I would just say that the opponents to missile defense, especially to spacebased missile defense, have hilariously overstated the cost of this system. A regionally deployed system would cost in the range of $20 billion over 30 years, and the cost would go down, as launch costs often do. It is important to keep in mind that when two airplanes hit two buildings, it cost us $2 trillion. What would that cost have been like if it had been a nuclear warhead that hit New York? I would just suggest, Mr. Chairman, that it is important that we do all that we possibly can to make sure that that does not indeed occur. I don’t know what price we put on national security, but the systems that we are talking about, our GMD system—our Groundbased Midcourse Defense system—was just tested against an ICBM target recently, and it was successful. We have had 14 out of 14 successful tests with our THAAD system—our Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system. The technology has been proven time and again. We should not undersell the United States of America. We can build the system. We will build it. It will help us get to the left of the launch. It will help us to be able to have a boostphase defense against missiles when they are in their most vulnerable position and over enemy territory. This is vital for the American national security, for our future, for our children, and for our children’s children. I would hope that we would defeat this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. FOSTER ). The amendment was rejected. 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 43 printed in part B of House Report 115–261. Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. 
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 478, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. CARTWRIGHT ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania. Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment that would prohibit the Department of Defense from conducting what is called new A–76 studies. I offer this amendment on behalf of myself, as well as Mr. COLE of Oklahoma, Mr. J ONES of North Carolina, Mr. BISHOP of Utah, Mr. DONOVAN of New York, Mr. C OOKof California, Mr. RATCLIFFE of Texas, Mr. LOEBSACK of Iowa, Mr. K ILMER of Washington, Ms. SHEAPORTER of New Hampshire, and Mr. BEYER of Virginia. These flawed A–76 studies are relying on a process that both the GAO and the inspector general of the Department of Defense determined could not demonstrate any savings to the American taxpayer. That is why A–76 studies have been subject to a congressional moratorium since 2010. The amendment I am offering today would continue that moratorium. The fundamental flaw inherent in the A–76 process is the erroneous underlying methodology used to determine whether or not Federal civilian jobs would be outsourced. 2003 was the last time this process was updated. Mr. Chairman, the inspector general’s report notes that it simply fails to keep track of costs and savings. It has no anchor in reality, and incorporates an arbitrary 12 percent overhead factor cost for Federal employees as opposed to contractors. The inspector general concluded that: ‘‘. . . multimilliondollar decisions are based, in part, on a factor not supported by data . . . Unless DOD develops a supportable rate or an alternative method to calculate a fair and reasonable rate, the results of future competitions will be questionable.’’ Decisions involving taxpayer money should never be based on such a faulty process, especially when American jobs are at risk as well. We are debating the appropriation of hundreds of billions of dollars, the lion’s share of our country’s discretionary spending. This is as it should be. We should spare no expense to provide the best care for our veterans. We should not haggle over the national defense, but when we spend this much money, we have a responsibility to do it carefully and based on actual data. b1545 As legislators, we should exercise care to ensure that we represent the interests of our constituents as well as possible. A flawed process based on pseudocalculations has no basis, no place in that reputation. Ultimately, the A–76 process uses faulty, antiquated methodology to determine whether Federal civilian jobs should be outsourced, a matter we simply cannot approach so haphazardly. Both the GAO and the inspector general of the DOD concluded the process could not demonstrate any savings for the American taxpayer. This A–76 process is outdated, antiquated, and simply not anchored in reality. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. FRANKS of Arizona). The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I support competition, and these competitions, as a whole, have been beneficial to the Department of Defense. The OMB has reported that, regardless of whether the Federal Government or the private contractor win the competition, the act of competition alone has saved or generated a cost savings up to 10 to 40 percent—10 to 40 percent, just having the competition. This amendment would block opportunities for the defense industrial base, protect the status quo within the DOD civilian workforce, prevent cost savings at the DOD, and negate the natural innovation that comes from competition. I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on this amendment. Ms. GRANGER. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. CALVERT. I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. GRANGER. I want to thank the gentleman for his valuable contributions to the Defense Subcommittee. I join him in opposition to this amendment that would limit the Defense Department’s flexibility to achieve efficiency and save taxpayer dollars. I urge rejection of the amendment. Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Chairman, this body owes a duty to our warfighters, a duty to the taxpayers, and a duty to the civilian workforce. Allowing these flawed A–76 studies to move forward, it really is a breach to all three groups. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this amendment, to maintain the moratorium currently in place on these A–76 studies and protect our military readiness from a process in desperate need of radical revision. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I would say we have a duty to taxpayers to perform the best we can, to give the best product to our warfighters at the best price. I urge a ‘‘no’’ on this amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. CARTWRIGHT ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO . 45 OFFERED BY MR . DAVIDSON  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 45 printed in part B of House Report 115–261. Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 478, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. DAVIDSON ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio. Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Chairman, I rise to encourage my colleagues to support this amendment which simply says that none of these funds may be used in contravention of the War Powers Act in Yemen. We are involved in a critical effort to defeat enemies of our country who took action on 9/11. AlQaida and their affiliates have been declared enemies, an authorized force, for nearly 16 years now. And in Yemen, alQaida in the Arabian Peninsula has found sanctuary. Unfortunately, we also find ourselves in conflict with other enemies there. It is clear that the Houthis, who are Shia, are not affiliates of alQaida. In fact, they are engaged in a civil war there. Over the years, we have sold arms and munitions, built a great alliance with a good ally in Saudi Arabia, and they are involved there. An enemy of the United States, Iran, is also involved as supporters of the Houthis, and so it is important to maintain our relationship with our ally Saudi Arabia. It is important to recognize the strategic, operational, and tactical threats posed by Iran and their proxies like the Houthis, but it is also important that 
we restore the emphasis of Article I of our Constitution and our clear duty in Congress to authorize our Nation’s wars. So this amendment simply says nothing outside of the War Powers Act may be engaged in without further future authorization. I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chair, the gentleman proposes an amendment that cuts all funding for the introduction of U.S. Armed Forces in the hostilities in Yemen. U.S. Forces need the flexibility to enter any theater where terrorists target the United States. Just 2 months ago, American Special Operations Forces conducted a ground raid against alQaida’s Yemen branch, killing seven suspected militants. We consulted leadership at the Department of Defense regarding this amendment. The Department recommends a more thorough legal review of the implications of this amendment. Further, the Joint Staff asserts that a U.S. provision of limited support to the Saudiled coalition might be construed in this context as participation in civil war, in which case, removal of such support could have a damaging effect on the U.S. relationship with Saudi Arabia and create further implications for regional security. With Special Operations fighting terrorism around the globe to protect our safety, does Congress want to show its lack of support? This amendment is poorly timed and overly restrictive and has many unforeseen complications. Therefore, the committee strongly opposes this amendment. Mr. VISCLOSKY. Will the gentlewoman yield? Ms. GRANGER. I yield to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. VISCLOSKY ), the ranking member. Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentlewoman for yielding and join her in opposition; although, I must tell you I am always very reserved about opposing an amendment put forth by a Notre Dame graduate. But, in all seriousness, I would say that I do appreciate the gentleman’s concern with the devolving situation in Yemen in that we do not want to get involved in a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran. I am also in agreement with much of the intent behind the amendment and certainly agree that Congress has relinquished much of its oversight role over Presidential decisions about sending U.S. Armed Forces into hostilities provided under the War Powers Act. That is why I am a strong supporter of efforts to develop a new Authorization for Use of Military Force for the global war on terror. Congress needs to, finally, after 16 years, carry out its constitutional duty and stop hiding from this very important debate that the gentleman has raised in his amendment. However, I do have concerns that the gentleman’s amendment, as written, is overly broad and would place undue restrictions on U.S. Forces within the Middle East to respond to legitimate threats within Yemen. So, again, very reluctantly, I join with the chairwoman in opposition, and I appreciate her yielding. Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Chairman, I respect the arguments of my colleagues in support of our national command authority. I wholeheartedly support that. In fact, I wore our Nation’s uniform for nearly 12 years, served in Ranger Regiment, though I was not involved as a combat veteran. I would not want to do anything to limit our ability to fight and win the war on terror. Indeed, the sole intent of this is to keep us laserfocused where we can. Resources are scarce, and the need to focus on defeating our enemies who have already been authorized by combat to engage in combat is critical. In fact, it does alarm me to see that there is some concern that this is overly broad and limiting, as it is the law of the land. The War Powers Act is recognized as something that does give our Commanders flexibility. It gives them 90 days to engage in combat anywhere where there is a clear and present danger to the national security of the United States. That could very well happen in that region of the country. The waters are tight. The threats are real. As I said, there are strategic, operational, and tactical concerns at play. But this is nothing different than what President Eisenhower foresaw. In an enduring conflict, he said: ‘‘We face a hostile ideology global in scope, atheistic in character, ruthless in purpose, and insidious in method. ‘‘Unhappily, the danger it poses promises to be of indefinite duration. To meet it successfully, there is called for, not so much the emotional and transitory sacrifices of crisis, but rather those which enable us to carry forward steadily, surely, and without complaint the burdens of a prolonged and complex struggle—with liberty at stake. Only thus shall we remain, despite every provocation, on our charted course toward permanent peace and human betterment.’’ I couldn’t say it better, so I borrowed President Eisenhower’s words. I hope we can respect our Constitution, as our duty under it, the oath we have sworn to support and defend it, to limit the scope of our war to things that are Congressauthorized and not passiveaggressively through funding and cutting the checks, but through full authorization. We do not have such authorizations with respect to the Houthis, whether they are in Yemen or other Iranian proxies outside the scope of the War Powers Act. I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chairman, I urge opposition to the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. LAMBORN ). The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. DAVIDSON ). The amendment was rejected. 
AMENDMENT NO . 47 OFFERED BY MR . DESANTIS  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 47 printed in part B of House Report 115–261. Mr. DESANTIS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 478, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DESANTIS ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. Mr. DESANTIS. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is a very simple limitation amendment: No funds made available by this act may be used to purchase heavy water from the Islamic Republic of Iran. Why are we doing this? If you remember, the JCPOA provided Iran with $150 billion in sanctions relief, even had the appalling spectacle of planes hauling in $1.7 billion in cold, hard cash, dropped off in Tehran. So this regime has been flush with money as a result of the nuclear deal done during the Obama administration. One of the frustrating things about that was that, even after that deal is enacted, even after all this money is flowing as a result of the deal, the Obama administration—this was not even required by the deal—sent millions of dollars to Iran in order to get heavy water. And that was not required by the deal. That was a gratuitous transaction, but it certainly provided more economic—an even greater economic lifeline to Iran. This is still, to this day, the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism. They are fomenting discord all around the Middle East, in Lebanon, in Syria. They fund Hamas in the Gaza Strip. They are supporting the Houthis in Yemen. They have major control over portions of Iraq, and the Shiite militias that they back are running rampant. Remember, they were probably the leading source of U.S. servicemember deaths in Iraq during the Iraq campaign. They funded Shiite militias. They had their Quds Force from Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps on the ground in Iraq; and certainly, hundreds of our servicemembers, some estimates say as many as 1,500 servicemembers, were killed from some of these Iranian proxies. They have never been held accountable for that. 
b1600 Now this administration came in saying the Iran deal was a bad deal. They haven’t left the deal. They haven’t really done anything to fight back against the deal, and I hope that will happen. But in the meantime, I want to make sure that this administration is not repeating the mistakes of the Obama administration. No more taxpayer dollars to the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the gentleman’s amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Indiana is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I certainly would acknowledge that Iran is up to very nefarious purposes as far as sponsoring terrorism internationally. I also acknowledge the gentleman referenced the previous administration more than once during his remarks as far as the issue before the House today. In 2016, last year, heavy water was purchased by the Department of Energy and the State Department, but I would point out this is 2017 with a different administration, and essentially the amendment is a solution to a problem that does not exist. The current administration has recertified Iran’s compliance with the agreement twice. Iran does not have a nuclear weapon and is subject to intense scrutiny by the International Atomic Energy Agency. But importantly to the point raised today, I would suggest that the Department of Energy consistently has indicated at the time of the 2016 heavy water purchase from Iran that the United States would not be a regular buyer of Iranian heavy water. Since that purchase, the United States has not purchased any additional heavy water from that country. In fact, the U.S. has, through refraining from purchases of excess supply, forced Iran to ship excess heavy water abroad so that it can continue to adhere to the agreement entered into. It seems highly unlikely that the current administration would now seek out an opportunity to purchase this heavy water. Again, I believe the gentleman has a solution to a problem that does not exist, and I am opposed to his amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. DESANTIS. Mr. Chairman, I would just say, if you want money to go to purchase heavy water from Iran, then obviously you should oppose the amendment. But if you don’t think that is a good idea, then it doesn’t hurt us to have this in here, given what has happened in the past. I wish I had 100 percent confidence that we would not be repeating mistakes. I hope that is where we go, but I have not yet seen the real robust action to turn the tide away from a deal that has put Iran on the path to a nuclear bomb. The danger with the deal was always less that Iran would cheat on the deal. I think they probably are, but the danger is they get a bomb by keeping the deal. This is a major problem. This is one small area of this to protect the taxpayer. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes,’’ and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DESANTIS ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. DESANTIS. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida will be postponed. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, as we begin to conclude debate on H.R. 3219, the Make America Secure Appropriations Act, I am sure I join with Ranking Member NITALOWEY in thanking all the Members of the House for the manner in which this debate has been conducted over the last couple of days. I thank the subcommittee chairs, the ranking members, and the Members who presented well over 120 amendments that were made in order. Let me reiterate why this package of appropriations bills is so important. From 2010 to 2014, defense spending was cut 21 percent in real terms. We heard that from Chairman THORNBERRY of the Armed Services Committee. Yet, as we know, the world did not get 21 percent safer. In fact, we ask more of our military than ever before, and we need to support them here at home and abroad. Today—and I said this earlier in the debate—we have the oldest Air Force in history, the Navy’s fleet is smaller than it has been in decades, and the Army has just three combat brigade teams fully prepared to fight. Moreover, we have too many aircraft that can’t fly, too many ships that cannot sail, too many troops who cannot deploy. We need better equipment and training for our warfighters, and we need more of the warfighters. We need a cyber component that is really effective. In April—it seems like years ago—we began to rebuild our Armed Forces with the fiscal year 2017 consolidated appropriations bill. Today, this legislation we are considering continues that critical work. Mr. Chairman, this fourbill package is carefully crafted to fund our critical military priorities, reinforce our nuclear deterrent, support veterans, make our borders more secure, and strengthen protection for our constituents and for Members. Once again, I thank Chairwoman KAY GRANGER ; Chairmen M IKE SIMPSON , CHARLIE DENT, KEVIN YODER ; all chairmen and their ranking counterparts; and our remarkable staff for bringing us to the finish line this afternoon, earlier than we thought. I also thank the rest of the Members and the staff of the Appropriations Committee for their extraordinary efforts over the past several months. It was full speed ahead, and they performed in a remarkable way. I would like to note the work of our clerk Nancy Fox and her team, Jim Kulikowski, Carol Murphy, Shannon O’Keefe, Stephen Sepp, Maureen Holohan, Jennifer Hing, Marta Dehmlow Hernandez, Tammy Hughes, Rachel Kahler, David Roth. And in my personal office: Katie Hazlett. And those who work with Mrs. LOWEY —and this may be the short list—Shalanda Young, Chris Bigelow, Adam Berg, and Becky Leggieri. May I say that I didn’t mean to leave out Chairman CARTER of the Homeland Security Committee for the work that he has done. My colleagues, each and every one of these bills deserves to be sent to the President’s desk. I look forward to completing our work on all 12 appropriations bills when we return from the recess, or perhaps even before then. Mr. Chairman, I urge support of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 48 printed in part B of House Report 115–261. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from New York is recognized for 5 minutes. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I wish we were considering bills under regular order, but I hope that in the weeks ahead we can work together to raise the budget caps and enact bipartisan bills we can all support. I thank Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN , my friend; and KAYGRANGER , the chair; and, of course, PETEVISCLOSKY  for your hard work on this bill. However, this is not the regular way to proceed. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this bill which would waste $1.6 billion on Trump’s border wall, use fraudulent defense numbers, gut critical investments in clean energy, include poison pill riders, and leave the remaining spending bills with no path forward. Mr. Chairman, as I conclude, I thank again all of the Members, all of my hardworking staff on both sides of the aisle. On this bill, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my request for a recorded vote on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida to the end that the Chair puts the question de novo. The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Indiana? There was no objection. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DESANTIS ). The amendment was agreed to. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, proceedings will now resume on those amendments printed in part B of House Report 115– 261 on which further proceedings were postponed, in the following order: Amendment No. 10 by Mr. SUOZZI of New York. Amendment No. 12 by Mr. BRENDAN  F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Amendment No. 38 by Mr. NADLER of New York. Amendment No. 43 by Mr. CARTWRIGHT of Pennsylvania.

The Acting CHAIR (Mr. C OLLINS of Georgia) (during the vote). There is 1 minute remaining. b1656 Ms. STEFANIK and Mr. DENHAM changed their vote from ‘‘no’’ to ‘‘aye.’’ So the amendment was agreed to. The result of the vote was announced as above recorded. The Acting CHAIR. There being no further amendments, under the rule, the Committee rises. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. POE of Texas) having assumed the chair, Mr. COLLINS of Georgia, Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 3219) making appropriations for the Department of Defense for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2018, and for other purposes, and, pursuant to House Resolution 478, he reported the bill, as amended by that resolution and by House Resolution 473, back to the House with sundry further amendments adopted in the Committee of the Whole. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is ordered. Is a separate vote demanded on any further amendment reported from the Committee of the Whole? If not, the Chair will put them en gros. The amendments were agreed to. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. 
The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. 
Ms. ROYBALALLARD. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentlewoman opposed to the bill? Ms. ROYBALALLARD. Yes, I am opposed to the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to recommit. The Clerk read as follows: 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from California is recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. ROYBALALLARD. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended. In last year’s election, no campaign rhetoric was more infamous than the President’s promise to ‘‘build a great, great wall on our Southern border’’ and ‘‘make Mexico pay for it.’’ The reality is the funding would come from U.S. taxpayers, not from Mexico, as the President promised. This motion to recommit strikes the $1.6 billion appropriation for construction of nearly 74 miles of border wall. Beyond the initial 74 miles, we have no idea of how many miles of border wall the President plans to build or how much it will cost because we have not received the required report on the longterm plan and justification for border security investments. Even with the plan, we will need time to evaluate whether investments in the border wall are more cost effective than alternatives and more urgent than clearly established unmet needs. With $1.6 billion, we could buy two of the four heavy Coast Guard icebreakers we need to protect U.S. interests in the Arctic. This purchase would help minimize the danger highlighted in a National Academies of Science report, which concluded the Coast Guard requires four new heavy icebreakers to protect U.S interests in the Arctic, where Russia has an everincreasing presence. The Coast Guard is ready to solicit proposals for new icebreakers in fiscal year 2018. In this bill there is no funding for essential icebreakers. There is no acquisition funding for them in the Homeland Security bill. The $1.6 billion could also be used for investments in additional scanning technology in the hiring of thousands of Customs officers at every U.S. port of entry. This would reduce wait times for travelers, better facilitate the flow of commerce, and contribute to economic growth in many of our districts. It would also enhance our ability to intercept contraband and illegal narcotics mostly smuggled directly into the U.S. through our ports of entry, not where the wall would be built. The bill before us does not adequately address these and other areas of security vulnerabilities. As Members of Congress, protecting our Nation and the American public is our greatest responsibility. It is our obligation to act in their best interest and to invest their tax dollars wisely. If the only Homeland Security item in this bill remains the funding for 74 miles of border wall, we will fail to meet our obligations. Unfortunately, the President’s border wall is now a proxy for the broader immigration debate. There is a false and misleading assumption that building a border wall will solve the immigration challenges we face. The reality is we will never be able to fix our broken immigration system with an enforcementonly approach that turns a blind eye to the desperate circumstances that compels so many to make the often deadly journey to the U.S. We will never be able to address our immigration challenges by treating as criminals the millions of undocumented people in this country, many of whom are our neighbors and friends. For years or even decades, the vast majority have called the U.S. their home. They have paid their taxes, acted responsibly, contributed to their communities, and worked hard to provide opportunity for their family. Immigration enforcement is as much a moral issue as it is a legal one. Our Statue of Liberty has always been a welcoming symbol of hope for those who, like now, are fleeing poverty, oppression, famine, war, and violence in their home country. Many of our ancestors come from somewhere else, often within certain legal status, and made significant contributions to help our country become the greatest in the world. Today’s immigrants continue to contribute to that noble legacy. What we truly need is comprehensive immigration reform that protects our homeland and reflects our American values. Democrats stand ready to work with Republicans to achieve that goal, but Democrats will not support the use of taxpayer dollars for an illconceived border wall that has more to do with a campaign promise than the security of our homeland. In spite of the President’s assurances, Mexico is not paying for this wall. The American taxpayer is. My motion to recommit would prevent that from happening. I urge my colleagues to support the motion to recommit. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER ). Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, the United States Senate is now considering what is called a ‘‘skinny bill’’ on the Affordable Care Act. The Senators are being told that they are voting for that bill to send it over here so it can go to conference and be perfected. The Rules Committee has just met and a provision was offered to the martial law, which means that we can take something up right away, that what we can take up is to go to conference. That was rejected by the Rules Committee. There is a suspicion that I have—and I see the majority leader on the floor— that there may be an intent to send the bill immediately back to the Senate and have it go to the President without 72 hours of consideration, without hearings, without scoring. I would hope the majority leader could give us assurances. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I claim time in opposition to the motion to recommit. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, as we gather here, nearly 250,000 men and women in uniform are deployed in nearly 177 countries in all corners of the globe. Another 2 million Active Guard and Reserve are standing watch back here at home in the United States. They are doing their jobs. We should do our jobs by providing them with everything they need to complete their mission. They are trusting us to do our jobs. Defeat the motion to recommit, support national security, and vote ‘‘yes’’ on final passage. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to recommit. There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it. RECORDED VOTE  
Ms. ROYBALALLARD. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote. A recorded vote was ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XX, this 5 minute vote on the motion to recommit will be followed by a 5minute vote on passage of the bill.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I was absent during rollcall votes No. 430 through No. 435 due to my spouse’s health situation in California. Had I been present, I would have voted ‘‘yea’’ on the Souzzi Amendment. I would have also voted ‘‘yea’’ on the Boyle Amendment. I would have also voted ‘‘yea’’ on the Nadler Amendment. I would have also voted ‘‘yea’’ on the Cartwright Amendment. I would have also voted ‘‘yea’’ on the Democratic Motion to Recommitt H.R. 3219. I would have also voted ‘‘nay’’ on the Final Passage of H.R. 3219—‘‘Make America Secure Appropriations Act, 2018.’’ 
WOUNDED OFFICERS RECOVERY ACT OF 2017 Mr. HARPER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the Speaker’s table the bill (H.R. 3298) to authorize the Capitol Police Board to make payments from the United States Capitol Police Memorial Fund to employees of the United States Capitol Police who have sustained serious line ofduty injuries, and for other purposes, with the Senate amendment thereto, and concur in the Senate amendment. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the Senate amendment. The Clerk read as follows: Senate amendment: 
Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the following: 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Wounded Officers Recovery Act of 2017’’. 
Mr. HARPER (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be considered as read. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Mississippi? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the original request of the gentleman from Mississippi? There was no objection. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
RUSSIAN ENERGY THREATS (Mr. BACON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call attention to the growing threat to our overseas military facilities posed by the Russian Federation. Today, one of the serious risks to our bases in Europe is Russia’s corner on oil and natural gas. One such facility is the Army’s new medical complex in Germany, planned to be located near Ramstein Air Base, where I was the installation commander. It would be financially irresponsible and strategically reckless to spend $1 billion for a stateoftheart hospital, only to have the design of the new facility compromise the very reason it exists by relying on Russia as its primary source of fuel. There are local mixedfuel energy supply options readily available, and it would be inexcusable not to make them part of the design of this project. This is good strategy, good economics, and just plain common sense. We can’t allow ourselves to be put in a situation where Russia has the ability to cut off energy to our forward bases, especially when we could have averted this tragic vulnerability ahead of time. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the House and Senate to join me in exercising aggressive oversight of this threat to our national security. f 
POISON PILL RIDER ON A BORDER WALL IS JUST SHAMEFUL (Mr. RUIZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, our constituents sent us here to discuss our differences honestly and openly and come together to pass bipartisan legislation addressing our Nation’s most pressing issues. Every year I have been in Congress, I have voted in favor of bipartisan, clean funding bills to give our troops a pay raise and fund our military in the VA. I took those votes proudly, working with Democrats and Republicans. Today, I am outraged Republican leadership played politics with this critical funding. To include a poison pill rider that wastes $1.6 billion in taxpayer dollars on an ineffective border wall is just shameful. We all know this wall will not make us any safer. Even law enforcement officials oppose this funding. I am very disappointed GOP leaders would link President Trump’s divisive campaign rhetoric with what should unite all Americans: supporting our troops and veterans. Because of procedural trickery, debate was not allowed. That would have allowed a bipartisan agreement on a clean bill supporting our troops and our veterans. Shameful. 
BUILD THE WALL (Mr. HARRIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Speaker, a few minutes ago, the House delivered on one of the President’s promises to increase security in the United States to 
stop foreign infiltration into the States to protect us from terrorists possibly crossing our border. The bottom line is, Mr. Speaker, build the wall.
