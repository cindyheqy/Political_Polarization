Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, I guess for the second day in a row, this House voted for massive tax cuts for people at the very top and left behind a lot of working Americans. In fact, it gave permanent tax cuts to corporations and only temporary help for some American families. They said that the marketplace and corporations needed certainty. That is why those tax cuts were permanent. Now, we have a continuing resolution for 28 days of funding after 11 months of not doing anything about it. What about the certainty for veterans that they are going to get the healthcare that they deserve? It is not a priority. What about the certainty for children who depend on CHIP? It is not a priority. What about the certainty for those families who are struggling with a family member fighting opioid abuse? All the promises ring hollow because they are not a priority. Corporations are the top priority. With this tax bill, and now the continuing resolution, the American people, who struggle every single day, are just not a priority. After 11 months of complete Republican control and false promises, American families get left behind again. It is a shame. 
ARKANSAS STATE CHRISTMAS TREE (Mr. WESTERMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a truly talented group of students whose artistic abilities are on display here in our Nation’s Capital. Students from Washington Middle School and the South Arkansas Arts Center in El Dorado, Arkansas, designed ornaments adorning this year’s Arkansas State Christmas tree on the Ellipse here in Washington, D.C. The students used colored pencils, paper, markers, and glitter to create beautiful pieces of art which represent Arkansas’ natural resources and economy. I congratulate these students on highlighting the best of the Natural State in a truly wonderful way. I wish them, their families, and all of the Fourth District of Arkansas a Merry Christmas filled with joy and smiles, like I felt when I saw this remarkable art from home. 
HONORING CAPTAIN F.W. ‘‘ROCCO’’ MONTESANO (Mr. FARENTHOLD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a Navy veteran and retiring Executive Director of the USS Lexington Museum on the Bay, Captain F.W. ‘‘Rocco’’ Montesano. Following his graduation from the Naval Academy, Rocco served the U.S. Navy in numerous positions over his 30year career, completing more than 5,500 flight hours and 900 carrier landings. From serving as commanding officer in aircraft squadrons to manpower director for the Chief of Naval Air Training, Captain Montesano has always shown his dedication and commitment to our country. His bravery and service earned him many awards, including two Legion of Merit Medals, two Meritorious Service Medals, a Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal, and five Sea Service Ribbons, amongst many others. His service, however, did not stop when he retired from the Navy. In 1998, Captain Montesano became the Executive Director of the USS Lexington Museum on the Bay in Corpus Christi, where he served for 19 years. Throughout his time as Executive Director, Rocco brought innovation and creativity to his position and did a phenomenal job maintaining and improving the museum that sits on Corpus Christi Bay. Through his patriotism, loyalty, and service, he holds true to the values of an American citizen and he inspires us all. I thank Rocco for his commitment to our Nation. On behalf of everyone in the 27th Congressional District of Texas, I wish him a happy retirement. f 
CHIP REAUTHORIZATION (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning to once again implore this Congress to take bipartisan action to extend Federal funding of the Children’s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP. In my home State of Pennsylvania, more than 176,000 children have gained access to affordable, comprehensive healthcare coverage through CHIP, providing them with ageappropriate medical and developmental care. Since the program became law, the percentage of uninsured children nationwide has decreased by more than half, from 13.9 percent in 1997 to 6.6 percent in 2016. As a result of its reliability and effectiveness, CHIP has consistently enjoyed strong bipartisan support. In September, I joined a bipartisan group from across Pennsylvania in urging leaders of both parties to take action to ensure that children have access to highquality health insurance coverage during their formative years, a move we know yields an abundance of positive outcomes: fewer hospitalizations, increased earning power, and better healthcare outcomes as an adult. While this Chamber has already taken action, passing legislation last month to fund CHIP, the Senate has yet to act. It is crucial we provide certainty and security for children, parents, and providers and move to sign into law CHIP extension legislation as soon as possible. Mr. Speaker, the time is now for the Senate to act. 
REFORM FISA 702 PROGRAM (Mr. MASSIE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Speaker, on December 31 of this year, the FISA 702 surveillance program expires. Ostensibly, this program allows our intelligence agencies to spy on and stop terrorism. However, it is a well known fact that the FBI has used this program as a back door to our Constitution to spy on Americans. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues not to reauthorize this program before December 31 without significant reforms. We all took an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution. We need to stay true to that oath and require the FBI to get a warrant if they want to go into the 702 database to surveil Americans. 
RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. SIMPSON ). Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess subject to the call of the Chair. Accordingly (at 9 o’clock and 9 minutes a.m.), the House stood in recess. f 
b1221 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. HOLDING ) at 12 o’clock and 21 minutes p.m.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Georgia is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to my friend from Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN ), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. 
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia? There was no objection. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, most of what you just heard from the Reading Clerk you could have heard during the previous 4 hours of testimony that we have been taking in the Rules Committee this morning. I understand there was no other game in town going on this morning, so if folks were tuning in to C–SPAN, they were treated to my friend from Massachusetts, our ranking member from New York, our chairman from Texas, and all the gang there on the Rules Committee as we worked through this. But forbid the thought if someone else had something else on their mind this morning, I want to go through just briefly what you heard from our Reading Clerk. This is a single rule that provides for consideration of two measures. The first is the Senate amendment to H.R. 1370. It is continuing appropriations to make sure the lights stay on and the checks go out the door. It makes in order a motion to concur in the Senate amendment with an amendment consisting of the text of this continuing resolution. To debate that, Mr. Speaker, we provide an hour of debate divided between the chair and the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee. I think every Member of this Chamber understands the nature of this legislation, but we provided that time nonetheless. The second measure is H.R. 4667. It is the disaster aid package. Mr. Speaker, as you know, this House has been working through, in a bipartisan way, funding our neighbors who have been so dramatically affected by disasters, whether in the Virgin Islands, in Puerto Rico, in Florida, in Texas, or the devastating wildfires in California. This has been a national focus, and billions of dollars have already gone out the door to meet the initial emergency needs. This is an additional appropriations measure. b1230 It comes under a closed rule, Mr. Speaker, but it does selfexecute two amendments that had been offered: an amendment by Mrs. MIMIWALTERS and an amendment by Miss GONZA´LEZ COLO´N. It also provides for an hour of debate, equally divided between the chair and ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, and it provides for a motion to recommit for the minority. The rest of what you heard from the Reading Clerk, Mr. Speaker, was that typical language that you hear at the end of the year when Members are going to be traveling, to allow for the housekeeping that takes place here, to allow the House to continue to function as the traditional authorities provided in December and January during the district work period. With that, Mr. Speaker, again, I think we have exhaustively debated these issues. I urge my colleagues to support the rule. Let’s get on to the underlying measures. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. (Mr. MCGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, we are strongly opposed to this rule. Mr. Speaker, I have to say to my colleagues that this is really a sad day, not only for the institution, but for the United States of America. It is frustrating that we are here today doing a third continuing resolution. For those who are watching these proceedings, we should be actually passing appropriations bills that fund the government for an entire year. We shouldn’t be funding the government week to week, month to month. Yet my Republican friends have ended up doing just that. They can’t seem to get their act together, notwithstanding they are in control of the House of Representatives, they are in control of the United States Senate, and they are in control of the White House. They simply cannot govern. They are lucky that the American people can’t sue them, because they would be sued for political malpractice. The one thing that they are supposed to do is to keep this government running and to keep the lights on, yet we lurch from one crisis to another crisis to another crisis to another crisis. 
Today, what they are saying is: Let’s kick the can down the road until January 19. You know what will happen then? Another crisis. Then we will be in the same situation, and we will probably kick the can down the road another few weeks. That is not the way government is supposed to run. People need certainty, and this Congress has delivered anything but certainty. It has to stop. It is frustrating. A solution, if I can be so bold as to suggest a solution to dealing with some of the problems that the Republican leadership is confronting, might be a little bipartisanship, might be opening up this process a little bit, might be a little bit more deliberation on the floor of the House of Representatives. There are a couple of ways they can govern. One is, they can govern in a way where they respect all points of view, where they actually respect the viewpoint of the minority, where they open the process up so the minority can, every once in a while, offer some amendments and offer some alternatives, where they negotiate on spending bills in good faith, where they know they are not going to get everything and the minority knows they are not going to get everything, but they end up in a compromise that is good enough to get bipartisan support. That is the way things used to be done around here. I don’t know why it is so difficult to get back to those days, but if they want the government to run better, that is what they need to do. They have to stop this mywayorthe highway approach to every single piece of legislation that comes before this body. My friends have had more closed rules than any other session of Congress. This is the most closed session in the history of the Congress. That is what this session will go down in history as being: the most closed session in the history of Congress. They have used martial law, they have used closed rules, they have had emergency meetings, all to try to get us to this point where we are kicking the can down the road for a couple of weeks. That is it. What we should have been doing is working together not only to keep the government open, but we ought to have been working together to raise the caps. Democrats want a strong national defense. We also need an equal increase in our domestic budget, which includes critical national security functions and commitments to hardworking families. My friends ought to know that one third of the nondefense domestic budget goes to national security, veterans, homeland security, and the State Department’s and the Justice Department’s counterterrorism initiatives. I would also say that supporting housing initiatives and investing in education and environmental protection so that our fellow citizens don’t have to drink water that is contaminated with lead is also a part of our national security. We ought to have been working in a bipartisan way to resolve all of these issues together. We need to work to fund the opioid epidemic. What we have done in this Congress is given lots of speeches about how terrible this opioid epidemic is. We have talked about the need to support our local communities. We have done a lot of talking, but what we need to do is appropriate the necessary money so that local communities can implement the strategies to effectively deal with the opioid crisis in their areas. We ought to have been focusing on that. We need additional veterans funding. Democrats are urging Republicans to join us to provide urgently needed resources to veterans facing a dire shortfall at the VA, meeting our responsibility to ensure that no veteran is left behind or denied the care and opportunities they deserve upon return from the battlefield. CHIP, the Children’s Health Insurance Program, and community health centers are incredibly important to us and people throughout this country. We are calling for immediate reauthorization of these vital initiatives, one that doesn’t rob Peter to pay Paul, one that doesn’t say we are going to fund CHIP by taking money away from the prevention program that provides moneys for immunizations and dealing with issues like lead paint and other issues that affect our kids. We need emergency disaster relief that is adequate to meet the needs of all the States and localities and territories that have been impacted by these terrible natural disasters. We need to save Americans’ endangered pensions. Millions of hardworking Americans’ pensions are at risk, and we are calling for bipartisan action to enact a responsible reform plan to ensure that these struggling pensions will keep on going. We also believe that we ought to pass the bipartisan Dream Act that we spent a lot of time in the Rules Committee talking about today. Democratic Leader NANCY PELOSI ; Minority Whip STENY HOYER ; and the head of the Hispanic Caucus, MICHELLE LUJAN  GRISHAM , spent many hours at the Rules Committee today. Leader PELOSI  was there for 2
1⁄2hours testifying on the need to pass the bipartisan Dream Act. We ought to do that before we go home for Christmas. There are 800,000 plus people whose lives are in the balance because, on September 7, Donald Trump decided to end protection for the DREAMers. Here is what the President I don’t think appreciates and what some of my colleagues I think don’t appreciate, but we learned about this today in the Rules Committee: we don’t have until March to deal with the Dream Act. Each and every day, people are losing their status. On average, about 122 a day, we are told. So there are people who are here who had the protections under DACA who are losing their status, losing their jobs, losing their livelihoods, and their lives have been thrown into turmoil. Why in the world would we do that? The majority of Americans, overwhelmingly Democrats and Republicans and Independents, all believe we should protect the DREAMers. We heard in the Rules Committee: Well, we need more committee deliberation. Again, the President took their protections away on September 7. It is now December 21. What have you been doing? They said: Well, the Judiciary Committee needs to do more hearings. Well, what have they been waiting for? The Judiciary Committee recently set up a bill, the concealed carry reciprocity bill, which allows people from States that have almost no standards to issue permits for people to carry concealed weapons to be able to go to any State in this country, no matter what those States’ standards may be, basically endangering my constituents. They brought that to the Rules Committee. They had time to bring that before the Rules Committee and before the House. There was not a single hearing. None. We had this tax scam bill that we just voted on where 83 percent of the tax breaks go to the top 1 percent of the wealthiest in this country. Remember that bill that the President just celebrated with all my Republican friends? That came before this House, and there wasn’t a single hearing on it. But now we need to have hearings when it comes to protecting the DREAMers. It is outrageous. These DREAMers are contributing to the betterment of our communities. We should celebrate them. We should value them. They have served in our military. They are out front leading disaster relief efforts, saving lives. They are working in Fortune 500 companies. They are going to school. They are valued members of our community. And we treat them like this? Come on. If we brought the Dream Act to the floor, it would pass with Democratic support and a big chunk of Republican support. There is absolutely no reason to continue to stall on this issue. All that will happen as a result of our stalling is that more people will lose their status, more lives will be thrown into turmoil. I would just say to my colleagues: It is the Christmas season. This is a time, if ever, where the spirit ought to take over, and we ought to do something good for the American people, not just for the donors, but for the people. Giving a tax break to corporations and wealthy people will help with the fundraisers, but what we need is to help these people, these DREAMers whose lives are in the balance. We can’t wait. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this rule, allow us to bring up a standalone Dream Act or an amendment that would allow the Dream Act to be made in order, and I hope that we can get back to regular order. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, this time of year folks get rightfully exorcised about the issues of the day. We all came here to do something for the men and women whom we represent back home. Every time we get to the end of a year, we think: I have got to get it done; I have got to get it done; I have got to get it done. I recognize those passions are going to exist. I actually don’t believe for a minute that my friend from Massachusetts believes my vote in favor of the tax bill had anything to do with fundraising or my donors. He might believe that about somebody in this Chamber—I hope that he does not—but I know he doesn’t believe it about me. It just isn’t true. I have been fighting for tax reform since the day I was elected. In fact, I ran for this job to fight for tax reform. We do the American people a disservice when we suggest something nefarious is going on. Sometimes we just disagree, Mr. Speaker, and those disagreements are okay. In fact, those disagreements are expected. Our Founders intended them, and they created this institution to sort those disagreements out. So I hope we won’t sell either ourselves or the American people short in that regard. But I do want to agree with my friend that this is frustrating. It is frustrating to be here for a continuing resolution, Mr. Speaker. Remember that we passed the National Security and Defense Appropriations bill in July of this year. We have waited patiently for the Senate to be able to take it up, and it has not. We passed all of the appropriations bills, Mr. Speaker, before the end of the fiscal year, back in September, and we have been waiting for the Senate to take those up. It has not. It is an incredibly frustrating time. Now, my friend suggested a solution would be bipartisanship. I could not agree with him more. It takes 60 votes to move something through the Senate. I just barely have over 50 Republicans. The only way these funding bills are going to move through the Senate is with bipartisan support. For anyone in this Chamber to deny that is going to be to deny the reality of math. Bipartisanship is the solution. I remember, Mr. Speaker, when my President invited the Democratic leadership down to the White House to work on exactly this issue a month ago. Folks got frustrated with the tweet he sent out that morning and decided they were going to stay home. I understand the frustrations. What I don’t understand is missing out on an opportunity to build this bridge. It happens above my pay grade, I am going to confess. To the 700,000 people I represent back home, Mr. Speaker, let me go ahead and confess this deal is taking place way above my pay grade. But it is probably right there at the pay grade of the President of the United States, the Speaker of the House, and the minority leader. When folks don’t show up to the table for the conversation, it makes it harder to get there. Is there always a good reason to stay home? I am sure there is. Are there more good reasons to be there? I think the answer is: Yes. Mr. Speaker, I will advise my friend from Massachusetts that I don’t have any speakers remaining this morning. Folks have been exhaustibly elucidated by the 4 hours of discussion we had this morning, and I am prepared to close when he is. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. b1245 Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I have a lot of concerns about the way this process is unfolding. And, yes, the gentleman is right. I am exorcised. I am exorcised that we have gone through all of these gyrations, including being on hold trying to figure out what we were going to bring to the floor all night last night, and we end up with this: basically kicking the can down the road for a few weeks and not dealing with some essential emergency priorities that are a concern to most people in this country. Again, going back to this tax bill, that is an example of where bipartisanship might have been helpful. I don’t recall a tax reform package—I don’t even want to call it reform because, basically, it is a giveaway to big corporations and to wealthy special interests— that has been rammed through Congress purely on a partisan basis. But maybe it had something to do with the fact that Democrats weren’t welcome to the table. Maybe it had to do with the fact that Democrats were locked out. Maybe it had something to do with the fact that this socalled conference committee was a sham and, when Democrats showed up, a deal had already been struck. That is not bipartisanship. And maybe we are a little bit exorcised because, time and time again, when people go before the Rules Committee looking to offer legitimate, germane amendments to try to improve legislation, rather than being able to have the opportunity to offer those amendments on the floor and have a debate, we are shut out all the time. Again, this Congress, this Republican Congress, this session, has the distinction of being the most closed session in the history of our country. That is the distinction. So, yes, we are exorcised. And we are exorcised over the fact that, as we are about to adjourn for Christmas, hundreds of thousands of people, DREAMers in this country, their lives have been thrown into turmoil. These are people who have served in our military. They have led rescue efforts during these recent hurricanes. They contribute greatly to our community. A majority of people in this country want them to remain here, and we can’t even get a vote on the House floor, notwithstanding the fact that we all know that, if we brought it to the floor, we would pass it. Mr. Speaker, the Republican majority has prioritized their tax scam bill over reauthorizing the Children’s Health Insurance Program, community health centers, helping DREAMers, and even funding our government, which brings us to where we are now, days before Christmas, scrambling to fulfill our most basic responsibilities. But we should be doing more here than just trying to keep the lights on. We also have a responsibility toward the hundreds of thousands of young Americans—they are Americans in every way except on paper—who have been betrayed by this administration. We need to pass the Dream Act, and we need to do it now. Thirtyfour of my Republican colleagues have already spoken up and urged Speaker RYANto help these young people. The majority of this House is ready to do the right thing. Mr. Speaker, here is our chance to do just that. If we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up H.R. 3440, the Dream Act. The bipartisan, bicameral legislation has the support of the majority of this House and would pass if it were brought up for a vote. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the RECORD , along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Massachusetts? There was no objection. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DOGGETT ). Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, I am all in favor of keeping our government open. The difference that I have with my Republican colleagues is that I want to keep it open for everyone. Here, at Christmas, we think of the children first, but the children are not put first in this underlying bill. The Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) is barely left on life support. There are children out there right now, some with dreaded diseases or disabilities, and their access to a family physician is not assured because this Congress has not acted on the Children’s Health Insurance Program. Instead of Christmas cards, they are about to get cancellation notices. 
And there are children who were brought here to America, through no fault of their own, without a visa. They grew up here. They only know this country. They have since passed a criminal background check. They had paid a fee, but their future is uncertain. They are called DREAMers because they have a dream of giving back to America and being full Americans, which they are, in everything but those legal papers. And we, in Congress, have our own responsibility. It is a responsibility to respond to their passionate pleas. We should not support another partisan Republican continuing resolution or appropriations process that does not assure the future of our 800,000 DREAMers. I can tell you, from meeting with them personally, I think of a cardiac nurse, I think of a county prosecutor, I think of a number of teachers whom I have met and many students, all of whom are DREAMers, who want to be full Americans. And I think of the groups in Texas like RAICES and TOPS and JOLT and the University Leadership Initiative and a number of others that are working with these DREAMers to secure their future. Even President Trump, in one of his few reasonable tweets, in September, said: ‘‘Does anybody really want to throw out good, educated, accomplished young people who have jobs, some serving in the military?’’ I think the answer here, if given a free vote, Republicans and Democrats, the majority would say absolutely not; we need these young people. This holiday season is one that you would hope would open closed hearts to see the humanity in these young people. But amidst all the selfcongratulatory highfives and patting on the back yesterday down at the White House, nothing was said about the DREAMers. The Republican leadership has apparently decided to leave town without doing anything for them. I believe that the Dream Act, the DACA authorization they have now, was terminated by the President just to use them as a bargaining chip. That was way back in September. And since that time, the majority has had ample opportunity to act. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Texas an additional 30 seconds. Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, I would just say that all of us as Members of Congress are eager to return to our families as soon as possible across America, but our DREAMers are left with fear and uncertainty about returning to their families and about their future. These deserving young people should not be used as bargaining chips for a wish list of antiimmigrant policies. Let’s reject this rule, enact the Dream Act, reauthorize CHIP, and offer a truly Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to all of America’s children. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, here, in these cold days outside, it is easy to create a lot of rhetorical heat on the inside. I would argue that legislative light is what we need more often than not. We brought the Children’s Health Insurance Program bill to the floor that my friend from Texas just referenced, Mr. Speaker. We didn’t just bring it to the floor; we brought it through committee. We brought it through committee, and we passed it. We brought it to the House floor, and we passed it. We sent it to the Senate, and there it sits. But when it passed the House floor, my friend from Texas voted ‘‘no.’’ He voted ‘‘no.’’ Now, do I believe for a moment that is because he hates children? I do not. Do I believe for a moment that it is because he doesn’t want folks to have access to healthcare? I do not. I believe he had legitimate policy reasons for deciding not to reauthorize the program then that he has just taken to the floor and talked about the merits of reauthorizing. It is okay to disagree on those issues, and it is even okay to highlight those differences. What is not okay is to describe this Chamber as a Chamber that doesn’t care. What is not okay is to describe this as a Chamber that doesn’t act. My friend was absolutely right: it is a bipartisan priority to fund the Children’s Health Insurance Program, and we did. The Senate has not acted. It hasn’t gotten the full reauthorization done. If we pass the continuing resolution today, that funding will continue. Let’s disagree on those things that we disagree about, but let’s be honest with ourselves about the legitimacy of those disagreements. Let’s try to find more light than heat in this new year. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. HASTINGS ), my colleague on the Rules Committee. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, my dear friend that just spoke with reference to acting, let me tell you what action was undertaken with reference to CHIP. Prevention money was used as the payfor. So, somehow or another, that action doesn’t rub some of us in the right way. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  a letter from the Congressional Black Caucus to Speaker PAULRYAN. 
CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS , December 21, 2017. PAULRYAN, Washington, DC. DEARSPEAKER RYAN: On behalf of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC), I write today to strongly urge you to provide a more permanent solution for close to 9 million children enrolled in the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and more than 27 million people that visit Community Health Centers (CHC’s) for critically needed health care. It is completely irresponsible for Congressional Leaders to have created this crisis. Moreover, it is now unconscionable for Congress to head home for the holidays without taking action to right this wrong. The holidays are a time to reflect on how fortunate we are and help those in need. In that vein, the CBC will not support a Continuing Resolution unless CHIP is reauthorized and fully funded for five years and Community Health Centers are reauthorized and fully funded for two years. Moreover, the offsets for these programs must not harm other vulnerable communities by reducing funding for other programs, such as the Prevention Fund. For this to be the state of play one day after giving away $1.5 trillion to huge corporations and the wealthy is absurd and offensive. Close to 2 million children across this country are in danger of losing CHIP coverage in January, with another 1 million set to lose coverage in February. A short term approach to providing these children and their families with certainty is absolutely irresponsible. Without swift reauthorization and fully funded coverage, young lives hang in the balance. Congress’ failure to act will set off a chain of direconsequences for children, as well as their families, communities, and states. A family without insurance is a family more likely to fall victim to financial crisis related to medical costs, such as bankruptcy. Similarly, Community Health Centers play an essential role in lowincome communities as they protect and expand access to critical and affordable care. The Community Health Centers Fund (CHCF) provides mandatory funding for federal health centers, which provide primary, dental, and other supportive care in medically underserved areas. Robust and reliable support for Community Health Centers results in more health centers, an increased number of patient visit, and more available services. These services save lives, especially in communities struggling to provide affordable care to poor, largely minority communities. The CHCF is even more essential to the more than 27 million people it helps support in light of recent efforts to the dismantle our nation’s health insurance market. As you well know, the elimination of the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate will add 13 million uninsured Americans, increase premiums by 10 percent, and make it harder for sick people to get insurance. The Congressional Black Caucus has been the conscience of this Congress since its inception in 1971. We have provided moral leadership and courageous advocacy for our constituents and for all Americans that have felt disenfranchised or left behind. At the time of year when we are supposed to be most charitable, it is urgent that Congress act to reauthorize CHIP and Community Health Centers and provide robust funding for both. Children and families do not need to spend the holidays worrying about their health. It is time for Congress to do what it is responsible and moral. Accordingly, the CBC will not support any legislation to prevent a shutdown unless these critical programs are addressed. Sincerely, CEDRIC RICHMOND , Chair. 
Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I lift from it one paragraph that says: 
The holidays are a time to reflect on how fortunate we are and help those in need. In that vein, the Congressional Black Caucus will not support a continuing resolution unless CHIP is reauthorized and fully funded 
for 5 years and community health centers are reauthorized and fully funded for 2 years. 
Mr. Speaker, this morning in the Rules Committee, beginning at 8—I might add, we were noticed that we were going to meet last night at 10, but we did not meet, and then we came in early this morning—the distinguished minority leader and the minority whip, along with the leader of the Hispanic Caucus, appeared and stayed for 2
1⁄2 hours discussing the fact that we are leaving things on the table, but, more specifically, addressing the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. But let’s talk about the things that we are leaving on the table: We are doing nothing about long term flood insurance. We are doing nothing about Perkins loans that have expired. We are not funding or addressing the opioid epidemic. We are not offering legislation to help save failing pensions in this country. I talked with some teamsters from Michigan the other day with tears in their eyes concerned about their pensions. We are doing nothing with reference to longterm, bipartisan reauthorizing for CHIP and community health centers. We are doing nothing about the FISA reauthorization. We are not raising the defense and nondefense spending caps. We are leaving Medicare extension on the table. And that is just a todo list that is partial that we are not addressing. But let me get in the weeds on something that the public doesn’t quite understand. 196 people appeared right over here and signed what is called a discharge petition to bring DACA to the floor; 34 Members of the House of Representatives sent a letter to the Speaker. If you combine those numbers, you have 218. My distinguished Rules Committee chair and I had a colloquy this morning where we discussed that matter. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. HULTGREN ). The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Florida an additional 30 seconds. Mr. HASTINGS. And the fact of the matter is I believe that it would pass if it were put on the floor. But do you know what is more important? We had 58 closed rules in this Congress, completely closed. And to put that into context, we averaged 25 closed rules a year in the 4 years the Democrats were in charge. The Dream Act is a perfect example of this. As Members are well aware, we have tried time and time again to get a floor vote on the Dream Act. Mr. Speaker, we all know that this CR is the last train leaving town. You have given millionaires and billionaires help. Let’s give the DREAMers a Merry Christmas. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. My friend from Florida is a good accountability partner up on the Rules Committee. I have learned from his intellect, and I have learned from his experience in this Chamber. I value that, and I value his friendship. When he says that more closed rules have been passed in this Congress than any other, he is absolutely right. He is absolutely right. And that is worth talking about, as my friend does regularly in the committee. Unfortunately, we usually just have that half of the conversation. What we don’t talk about is that many of those closed rules were for bills that were so well worked out in a bipartisan way in committee that there were no amendments offered, that we had already come together in such a collaborative, productive, admirable way that we ought to be bragging about instead of denigrating that we didn’t have amendments that were offered. Other bills, Mr. Speaker, were bills that might not have been so generally agreed upon. But when my friend the chairman of the Rules Committee sends the call out to all 435 Members of Congress and says: If you have any ideas, bring them to the Rules Committee. For many of those bills, Mr. Speaker, there wasn’t one idea suggested, not one idea suggested to change the underlying bill. b1300 So did it come under a closed process? Well, of course, it did, if closed means we ask everybody for all of their ideas and no one had one, so there was no idea to debate on the floor. Mr. Speaker, there are so many ways that we can do better with one another, but I would suggest to my friends that the way to do better with one another is to build that on a foundation of trust, not a foundation of recriminations. We have an opportunity in this new year, Mr. Speaker, to turn a page in this institution. I want to say, in my time on the Rules Committee, Mr. Speaker, I have never had a chairman who worked as hard to open the process and hear from Members as the gentleman from Texas (Mr. SESSIONS ), the current chairman. Time and time again, where other folks would have walked away from the table, the chairman has stayed there to get input, to hear ideas. Time and time again, when the process would have been truncated, he has extended it to make sure folks had a chance to have their voice heard. I am grateful for that, Mr. Speaker. I am grateful to the chairman for that model that he sets in that committee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. SESSIONS ) to speak on this rule. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman from Georgia (Mr. WOODALL ) for yielding. Mr. Speaker, Mr. WOODALL serves not only the Rules Committee and this body in the Republican majority, but he is also our designee to the Budget Committee and has excelled in excess of understanding the intricate details that not only move this great Nation, but the arguments, a balance between them. I appreciate the gentleman very, very much. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer some advice that I just received from the Governor of the State of Texas, Governor Abbott, who took time to call me. I also want to address the distinguished gentleman from Florida (Mr. HASTINGS ), my very dear friend. During that recordsetting year, we also made in order over 560 amendments. That is 560 amendments that people came to the Rules Committee, had literally a committee that engaged them on the substance of their ideas, listened to it, believed that that substance had a good place for debate on this floor. Not necessarily every idea should be vetted here. Sometimes it is vetted in committee, subcommittee. Sometimes it is vetted at the Rules Committee, and sometimes we do not make those ideas in order. This morning was no different. There were a lot of great ideas. As a matter of fact, the minority leader, Ms. PELOSI , came to the Rules Committee for several hours. The gentleman, the minority whip, Mr. HOYER , came a slightly less amount of time, but no doubt came to the Rules Committee and offered us advice about not only what we are doing but presented the arguments about what they were for. They were given unlimited opportunity to discuss that. There was some limit that we had to offer our challenges back, but it was an open process, and I appreciate Ms. PELOSI and all the members of the committee doing that. Mr. Speaker, the reason why I came down is to say—and there are lots of stories that go on, but the story that I was just told by the Governor of the State of Texas is that Texas—not unlike the islands of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, the great State of Florida that were in the way of a hurricane—was recordsetting rain, 60 inches. It lasted 8 or 9 days. It did incredible damage. This body has taken time to now study getting money back to those affected areas, and the determination that was made by this body is some $81 billion. I just found out that the State of Texas has calculated their part of the $81 billion, and it is less than 15 percent of the total. Less than 15 percent of that total will actually be going to the largest storm in the history of America. I did not offer a complaint. I was surprised. I would have thought it would be in the 50 percent realm. I would have thought it would have been higher. But what I want to say is that not everybody gets everything they want in this town, not even if they are the 
Governor of the State of Texas, with a large delegation like Texas. It is a difficult time we all go through, and I offered and expressed my confidence to the Governor that I would certainly go look at this. It is the first time I learned of this. Less than 15 percent of the emergency funds that will be presumptively agreed to today, of this huge storm, goes to Texas. I just thought that was worthy of me to take time to come and pass on information that I had not known about, information that I was provided. It tells us how large the need is in this country when the largest storm only gets 15 percent. So I am a ‘‘yes.’’ I am a ‘‘yes’’ for the other 85 percent that is not going to be in Texas also. I am a ‘‘yes’’ because I have seen the fires in California, I have seen the damage from—and Judge HASTINGS kept us up to date. I have been aware of Ambassador Patrick Rooney, who talked with us about the devastation; and TOMROONEY in Florida; and certainly Byrne Buchanan, who spoke with us about the damage to the crops—lots of big problems. I am going to vote for the other 85 percent, too, not just the 15 percent for my home State. I want to thank the gentleman for allowing me time to share my ideas on the floor. I wish Judge HASTINGS a Merry Christmas. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. PELOSI ), who spent 21⁄2 hours today in the Rules Committee fighting on behalf of the DREAMers. Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I also thank all of the members of the Rules Committee for the exceptional service they provide to the House in reviewing legislation that will come to the floor. I particularly want to thank my colleagues on the Democratic side for honoring the values of our country by advocating for an amendment to include the Dream Act as we go forward. I would hope that most of our Members would vote ‘‘no’’ on this rule and not allow for the previous question to come forward so that it will allow for the Dream Act to be considered. I want to thank the chairman of the committee and the distinguished Members on the Republican side, as well as the Democratic side, for the hospitality extended to the Democratic whip, Mr. HOYER ; the chair of the Hispanic Caucus, Congresswoman MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM ; and to me. At that meeting, Mr. Speaker, I told the colleagues that we are in a tradition of having great Democratic and Republican Presidents who have been supportive of newcomers to our country and who recognize that immigration is the constant reinvigoration of America. When people come to our country with their hopes and dreams and aspirations to make the future better for their families, they are identifying with an American ideal: all of us having the responsibility to make the future better for the next generation. And their commitment, their courage, their optimism, their determination for a better future makes America more American. Every newcomer who comes here with that determination makes America more American. Among those people are our DREAMers. This is a very discrete group that we are hoping to protect in the Dream Act. Certainly, as our colleagues acknowledged this morning, we have important work to do on comprehensive immigration reform. We have a responsibility to protect our borders, North and South, and anything that flies in, East Coast, West Coast, and through the Gulf. But the fact is that—as was pointed out by our colleague, Congresswoman LUJAN GRISHAM , the chair of the Hispanic Caucus: think of the DREAMers as a discrete piece that needs protection now and not wait for the entire comprehensive immigration reform to be resolved before we deal with this emergency. Just as we treat CHIP, 9 million children are depending on CHIP, but we are not waiting until we revise the whole healthcare system in order to pass CHIP, nor did we. When we passed CHIP, it was before the Affordable Care Act had passed. But let me say why it is really important for this to happen now. Unfortunately—and, really, I was pleased that our Speaker registered his disagreement with President Trump when he took the action he did in regard to DACA in September. When he did that and said, ‘‘I will give Congress until March to pass a law,’’ what he didn’t understand is that he was putting these DREAMers at a distinct disadvantage. Every day, over 100, 120some DACA recipients, DACAeligible recipients, lose their status. That means, if they are working or whatever they are doing, they lose their status to do that in our country. Over 10,000 have lost status since the President’s announcement—well over 10,000. So we can’t wait until March to do this because it had consequences known to us but unforeseen by the White House and by the President. And I don’t think, in his heart, that the President intended to hurt these people in the very cruel way that they are being hurt by the actions that are being taken. We can’t wait until March. We need action. We need it soon. We need it to be bipartisan. That is what we have been working on—not me; Members, Memberdriven bipartisan cooperation in trying to find a path that addresses the concerns that some have about the border—and we all do—and also addresses the Dream Act. As the President said: Let’s call it DACA. Okay. We will call it DACA. So here we are. I said at the beginning of my remarks that we have been blessed in our country by Presidents who have recognized the value of immigration; that our country would be in stagnation if we didn’t have this constant reinvigoration of visitors to our country. When President Obama acted because Congress had not acted to protect the DREAMers and their parents, that was really important for him to do because Congress had not acted. However, it is important to note that President Reagan, when he was President and President George Herbert Walker Bush was at that time Vice President, Congress did act through the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. They did act. And President Reagan’s observation was they didn’t go far enough. So he took further executive action called Family Fairness to protect people in our country, immigrants in our country. Actually, President Reagan and President George Herbert Walker Bush protected a higher percentage of newcomers to our country than President Obama did with his DACA and DAPA action, a higher percentage because they understood the value to our country of newcomers. President Clinton continued all of that. President George W. Bush was a champion and continues to be a champion on recognizing the value of immigration. He has spoken about it intellectually, with respect, from the heart for people coming to our country, and he has urged us to do so. He couldn’t get the cooperation of his own party when he was President to cooperate for comprehensive immigration reform, even though when we had the power as Democrats, we supported it. But he could not get the 60 votes in the Senate. But, nonetheless, he continues to be a champion, really, for immigration reform. And here we have a new President who campaigned on the backs of newcomers to our country and who made immigrants villains. It is a complete change from the Republican Party, from a commitment to valuing newcomers and diversity in our country. It is a complete departure from President Reagan, President George Herbert Walker Bush, President George W. Bush, just to name the Republican Presidents. So we find ourselves in this situation, but that doesn’t change the fact that we have a responsibility to all of God’s children to treat them with respect, and when we can do something to be helpful, we should. b1315 There is harm that is coming to the DREAMers every day, because they are losing status. Regardless of what some may say, some are being deported. This may be unknown to the President, but it is not unknown to us in this Congress. I want to thank Congresswoman LUJAN GRISHAM , the chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, and her members. I want to thank Congresswoman JUDYCHU, the chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus; Congresswoman YVETTE CLARKE , 
who, working with the Congressional Black Caucus, has been a champion in that caucus; and all of the Members on both sides of the aisle who are striving to find a path. One path that we have open to us is to defeat this rule, to allow the Dream Act to come up, and to put that in the mix as we go forward. Again, this isn’t an issue, this isn’t a bill. It is a value, and that is the conversation we had with President Trump. This isn’t an issue, but it is a value. This is about who we are as a nation and how we respect who we are as a nation. That is why, I believe, that President Trump will be receptive to signing a bill. He does want—and we are all concerned for—border security. We will work with him on that, but let’s start by putting on the RECORD  the support of this House for a recognition that we are immigrants, by and large. Unless some of you are Native Americans—and how proud we are of our Native American community in our country and how blessed we are— most of us come from immigrant families. It was interesting to me in doing some reading on some of this. I am very proud of my own ItalianAmerican heritage. My grandmother was born in Baltimore, Maryland. Her parents were from Venice and Genoa. My father’s family from Abruzzo. We are very proud of all of that, which makes us respect the pride that other people take in their heritage. What was interesting to me in recent days, because I remember—I didn’t suffer this, but I know my father and others did: Italians were called ‘‘wops.’’ Do you know what wops means? It means ‘‘without papers.’’ That is what they were called: without papers. These people are without papers, but in every way they are American. I just want to tell you a couple of stories. One is Fernando Meza Gutierrez. Fernando lives in my district. Fernando’s family came to the U.S. Fernando came to the U.S. when he was 9 years old. In high school, Fernando was an AP scholar and received the International Baccalaureate Diploma and the Achievement Award in Foreign Language for French. Fernando continued to excel academically at Santa Clara University, where he graduated cum laude with a double major in biology and French. Now a thirdyear doctoral student at UC San Francisco, Fernando also works at UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, where he is working hard to provide new insights into many diseases and disorders. I just want to tell you one other story. Lisette Diaz was just 6 years old when her family brought her to the U.S. from Chile. Growing up in Long Island, Lisette excelled in school and was involved in her community. She went on to attend Harvard, where she received numerous awards and participated in a variety of extracurricular activities. Lisette recently graduated from Harvard with honors. Lisette and other DREAMers have so much to contribute to our country, but Donald Trump and other Republicans have made their agenda clear. They want to shut down DACA and DAPA and deport hundreds of thousands of DREAMers and parents of Americans. That is what DREAMers think. We don’t want them to think that. We want them to think that the President understands their value, the value of our DREAMers, and the challenges that they face. If we don’t do something soon, Lisette will be deported back to Chile, a country where she hasn’t lived since she was 6 years old. There are just thousands and thousands and thousands of stories of success, of those serving in our military, attending our schools, teaching our children, working in highlevel positions, because they all have that immigrant attitude of hard work, hard work ethic, a work ethic, a faith ethic, a family ethic, a sense of community. In the sense and spirit of community, let’s defeat this rule and allow the Dream Act to come forward. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, we talk a lot about what isn’t in the bill today, and we could actually talk a lot longer about what isn’t in the bill. It is a fairly narrowly focused bill, but what is in there, in addition to funding to keep the government operating, is funding for our community health centers that we all care so much about; is funding for the Children’s Health Insurance Program— that is a bipartisan issue across this Chamber—is funding for the Special Diabetes Program. Mr. Speaker, that is so important to so many families. I can go on and on and on. Are there things that are not in this bill? Of course there are, and I look forward to coming back with my colleagues to address each and every one of those, but there is so much good that is in this bill, Mr. Speaker. If we conclude this debate to pass this rule, we can get on and make those things a reality. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. BARRAGA ´N). Ms. BARRAGA´N. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts for yielding. We are in a critical and urgent time. People’s lives are on the line. On September 5, the President suddenly and cruelly terminated the DACA program. Since that date, 13,000 DACA recipients have lost their status and their protections, and every day that Congress delays a vote, another average of 122 lose their status. That is why this is urgent, that is why this is important, that is why we need to act now. Congress should not wait any longer to act. It cannot turn its back on these youths, on these immigrants who are leading productive, positive lives, who are giving back to our communities and contributing immensely to the economy. Congress has an opportunity today to show the world our values, that we are going to protect DREAMers, that we are going to stand with these young men and women who enrich our country, who only know the United States as their home. The nearly 800,000 DREAMers are our doctors, our nurses, our teachers, our neighbors, and they serve in our military and are protecting us here at home. But because Congress has not acted and because this Chamber has failed to act on the DACA issue, DREAMers are living in fear and uncertainty of their future. They are afraid to go to school. They are afraid of losing their loved ones at a moment’s notice. They are anxious about whether they will be able to continue to earn their paychecks and earn a living. DREAMers are feeling the pain now. They are experiencing the anxiety now. They are being detained now. These are real people. Now, I understand their fear and their uncertainty, because, for many of us, this hits real close to home. I have 8,000 DREAMers who live in my district. I also have a family member who is a DREAMer. Many are afraid of being deported to a place where they will be strangers, to a country they haven’t lived in since they were children. Mr. Speaker, this is the 16th time since DACA’s termination that Democrats are challenging Republicans to take real urgent action to protect DREAMers by bringing the bipartisan Dream Act to a vote on this floor. We must stand up for DREAMers. It is the right thing to do. It is what Americans want us to do. They want Congress to protect DREAMers from deportation by an overwhelming majority. It is the moral thing to do. Again, this is a bipartisan issue. I have talked to many of my colleagues across the aisle who want to see a vote on this. I believe we will pass it overwhelmingly if we could just get this vote. This is a moment of truth for our Nation. I ask my colleagues to vote against the previous question so that we can immediately bring the Dream Act to the floor and provide relief for the nearly 800,000 DREAMers in time for the holiday season. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, you likely did, as I did yesterday, get a wonderful Christmas card from our friend from California, which I very much appreciated. She was there with her beautiful family. I appreciate the sincerity of her words today. I will just remind this Chamber that we are having that conversation for 
one reason and one reason only. That is because, when Democrats had the White House, the U.S. House, and the U.S. Senate, but—much like Republicans today—didn’t have 60 votes to get around the filibuster, instead of President Obama and the Democratic leaders in the House and the Senate trying to find a bipartisan pathway forward that could get 60 votes, they chose to craft an administrative solution, one that I thought was illegal, one that I thought was unconstitutional, but chose to go it alone. Mr. Speaker, that is not a blame statement. It is an explanation of some systemic challenges that exist in this place. I can assure my colleagues, and I am happy to have someone disabuse me of the notion, but I have yet to see the issue that we have solved by blaming each other more for it. I have yet to see that pathway to success. The pathway I have seen is when folks turn the cameras off, when they roll up their sleeves, when they decide they don’t much care who gets the credit for a solution, they just want to solve it. I will put another one on my colleagues’ plate, because, again, I don’t doubt their sincerity. Raju is one of my constituents. He is here on an H1–B visa. His wife, Manju, is here on an H– 4 visa. He came to this country legally 11 years ago. Every few years, he has to renew his visa, which costs thousands of dollars. When his visa expires, when his driver’s license expires, he has to go back and do it. He is not complaining. That is what the law of the land said. When he agreed to come here, he agreed to follow the law of the land. He can’t start his own business. He can’t change employers. He is a captive of the visa program that he came in on. There is no pathway, Mr. Speaker, for Raju and Manju to get the same benefits that my colleagues are arguing so passionately for for 800,000 additional people. Mr. Speaker, the human stories don’t begin and end with the DACA program. Again, a problem that President Obama created; not solved, but created. I can go line by line by line of folks who are facing similar challenges, and I question where the justice is when I can name constituent after constituent after constituent who has done everything right, who has paid every dime the government has asked, who has applied for every piece of paperwork that the government has asked, who has stood in every line that the government has asked, and there is no pathway forward for them. Let’s not pretend that there is not common ground that we can come together on. Let’s confess that perhaps we haven’t spent enough time trying to do it. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY ). Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, all of us are anxious to go home to our families and our celebrations, but more and more Americans are seeing every single day, particularly in the last couple days, just how messed up the values and priorities of the Republican majority really are. They saw the Republicans go off to the White House and highfiving and cheering each other for a tax cut that provides 81 percent of its benefits to the wealthiest Americans and that blows about a $1.5trillion hole in the budget. That means debt and deficit. Who is left with the coal in the stocking? We are looking at 9 million children and their parents who are sick, who have been worrying about how they are going to have the Children’s Health Insurance Program. Yes, we extended it now until March. It expired in September, but we didn’t have time for those children. We don’t have time for the 800,000 young people who are serving this country right now as DACA recipients. We could pass the Dream Act today. Let’s get our values straight. Let’s do better than we are. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I would advise the gentleman from Massachusetts that I have no further speakers and I am prepared to close when he is. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I would inquire if the gentleman has any time to share. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I would advise the gentleman that it appears I have committed all of my time. b1330 Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, this has been a painful season for so many of us, from California to Texas to Florida, Louisiana, to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and so I am still here begging my colleagues for those who are begging in Texas. Right now, my local officials are letting my constituents from Kashmere Gardens share in the public view how desperate they are for housing money. So this CR and this emergency supplemental should be separated. But the CR, on the other hand, should be funding CHIP completely. And DACA, the DREAMers, should be protected completely. I introduced a bill when Hurricane Harvey came for $164 billion. That is where we should be, and I know that because of the sacrifice and loss and devastation. But also, a DREAMer lost his life trying to rescue my constituents, so, you see, we have a situation that should be corrected across the board. Fix the DREAMers, but provide for the hurricane victims. I will say that we are going to keep on pushing beyond the $81 billion. I am glad the $1 billion that I pushed for for small businesses is in this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. MCGOVERN. I yield the gentlewoman from Texas an additional 30 seconds. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, we have 300,000 homes underwater. Puerto Rico has no lights in homes; U.S. Virgin Islands, none, no homes. Key West still needs debris picked up. What my constituents are saying is, because the lights are out, we are forgotten; because DREAMers don’t have rights, they are forgotten. So I am not going to stand here and ignore our children, 9 million of them who need CHIP, or our DREAMers. But I am also going to say that, whatever is in this for us, which is not a lot, I am going to keep pushing and fighting for my constituents. And the money that we are getting, get it to us now—now. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, it is the Christmas season, so I do want to begin by thanking the gentleman from Georgia and the distinguished chairman of the Rules Committee, Mr. SESSIONS , for always being so polite to me and to other Democrats on the committee. But I want to say, in all candor, that, in spite of that, we are disrespected each and every day when our ideas are shut out and, in turn, our constituents are disrespected. I represent the same number of people as the Speaker of the House, as any Republican and any other Democrat in this Chamber, and yet, routinely, we are told that our ideas are not welcome. I believe, Mr. Speaker, that every Member of this House, Democrats and Republicans alike, are entitled to basic respect. We have just gone through the most closed session in the history of our country, more than 58 closed rules in this session. Over 1,500 amendments, both Democratic and Republican amendments, were blocked. That is not what we were promised by the leadership of this House. We are disappointed with what we are dealing with today. We are disappointed with the inaction and lack of support for the CHIP program and the community health centers funding. We think that is inadequate. We are disappointed that more funding isn’t provided to deal with the opioid crisis. I could go on and on and on, but today, we are asking the Speaker to allow a vote to help the DREAMers, men and women who came here as children, who have served in our military, who have been first responders saving lives in these disaster relief efforts, 91 percent who work and pay taxes. They are important. They are valuable. We should celebrate them. I would say to my colleagues this is a matter of decency. The right and decent thing to do is to help them, not rationalize inaction. Please, please, for the sake of all that is good about our country, join us in 
defeating the previous question so we can have an upordown vote on the Dream Act, so we can actually help these 800,000 people, these young individuals who are giving so much to our country. It is the right thing to do. This is the Christmas season. I hope you are all moved to joining us and to helping these people because, as we have learned, each and every day that we wait, more and more of them lose their status. They lose their jobs. Their lives are thrown into deeper turmoil. It is wrong for us to go home and not deal with this. The decent thing to do is to vote on the Dream Act. Vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous question. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. There has been a lot of productivity this week. There has been a lot of work that has gone on this week. I am looking around up there at the dais with you, Mr. Speaker. I see a lot of unshaven faces. I’m not just taking about Josef. I am talking about folks who intended to shave and might not have made it home last night to get that done. It takes an incredible amount of staff time to do this. So what Mr. MCGOVERN  and I do up in the Rules Committee, our staffs have been there past midnight time and time again this week and then back in at dawn. I wish that more of the American people, Mr. Speaker, could see the hardworking, dedicated staff, the team that goes into making all of this possible, because I think it would make them proud. I think, in a season like this, it would lift them up and make them feel better about who we are as a people and the things that we could accomplish together. One of those young people, Mr. Speaker, is Nate Blake on the Rules Committee. He is sitting right here behind me. He is leaving us after 5 years of service. I want to put that into perspective, Mr. Speaker. There is not a staff member up here that can’t leave today and get better hours and more money going anywhere else in town. You will work on Capitol Hill for one reason and one reason only, and that is that you believe, if only you work hard enough and long enough, you would make America just a little bit better. Mr. Blake is one of those believers. We will miss him on the committee. It is a great honor for me that his very last rule is to be one of mine, and I thank him for his service. Mr. Speaker, they often say everything’s been said but not everyone has said it. We don’t need to go down that path today. This House has done its job. It has done its job in a collaborative way. It has done its job in a way that the American people can be proud of. If we pass this rule, we will not only fund the government, send money to the troops, send money to community health centers, send money to education, send money to courts, send money to the environment; we will not only take care of those funding responsibilities; we will also provide those dollars needed for those men and women spread out from Florida to Texas to California to Puerto Rico to the Virgin Islands. There is a real human being behind each and every one of these dollars that will go out the door today. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues, vote ‘‘yes’’ on this rule so we can get to that underlying legislation. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on the Rule, and H.R. 4667, one of the two underlying bills made in order. H.R. 4667 provides $81 billion in aid to respond to the damage caused by Hurricanes Irma and Maria, and the wildfires in California. I thank the Speaker and Rules Committee Chairman SESSIONS for acting favorably upon my request to bring this emergency disaster supplemental to the floor for debate and vote as a standalone measure. Ever since the widespread and catastrophic destruction of Hurricane Harvey, I have been working closely with the Texas Governor and the Hurricane Harvey Taskforce to secure the help necessary for the region to rebuild. I have witnessed firsthand the pain of storm weary Houstonians who lost their homes, their belongings, and in many cases their jobs. They are struggling and hurting. So this is personal to me. The amount of funding provided in the disaster relief package is very disappointing because it is not nearly sufficient to ameliorate the suffering still being experienced by the people of the communities in the areas affected by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. Congress has had more than three months to develop an aid package that is commensurate to the challenge faced by the affected states and territories in rebuilding their devastated communities. Much of this time has been squandered by the Republican congressional leadership’s all consuming focus on ramming through the Republican Tax Scam legislation that gives 83 percent of its benefits to the top 1 percent, raises taxes on working and middleclass families, takes away health insurance from 13 million Americans, explodes the deficit by $1.5 trillion and the national debt by $1.7 trillion, and will be paid for by 5.4 trillion in cuts to vital programs Americans depend on, including an imminent $25 billion reduction in Medicare funding. Mr. Speaker, on September 6, 2017, ten days after Hurricane Harvey struck and joined by 44 of our colleagues, I introduced H.R. 3686, the ‘‘Hurricane Harvey Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2017,’’ which provides $174 billion in disaster relief for the areas affected by Hurricane Harvey, the worst superstorm ever to strike the mainland United States. The $174 billion in funding provided by H.R. 3686 represents a comprehensive response commensurate to the challenge; specifically, my legislation provides relief in the following amounts: 1. Housing and Community Development Fund: $50 billion 2. FEMA Disaster Relief Fund: $35 billion 3. Army Corps of Engineers—Construction: $15 billion 4. Flood Control and Coastal Emergencies: $13 billion 5. Public Transportation Emergency Relief Program: $33 billion 6. Small Business Disaster Loans Program: $2 billion 7. Emergency Conservation Activities: $650 million 8. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration: $321 million 9. National Aeronautics and Space Administration: $50 million 10. Legal Services Corporation: $10 million 11. Army National Guard: $10 million 12. Army Corps of Engineers—Civil Investigations: $150 million 13. Coast Guard: $450 million 14. National Park Service Historic Preservation Fund: $800 million 15. EPA Environmental Programs and Management: $2.5 billion 16. EPA Hazardous Substance Superfund: $7 million 17. Leaking Underground Storage Tank Fund: $15 million 18. State and Tribal Assistance Grants: $600 million 19. Employment and Training Services: $100 million 20. Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund: $2.5 billion 21. Airport and Airway Trust Fund: $90 million 22. FederalAid Highways Emergency Relief Program: $6.5 billion And that is just for Texas and the areas affected by Hurricane Harvey; the damage wrought by Hurricane Irma in Florida, and Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands was nearly as great in dollar terms and equal in the level of misery and suffering inflicted on the residents. Mr. Speaker, on September 20, 2017, Hurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico, along the southeastern coast, near the small town of Yabucoa. The devastation wrought on that beautiful Caribbean oasis and its 3.5 million inhabitants, our fellow citizens of the United States, is unimaginable, except perhaps to those of us who have lived through and survived similar natural disasters, like Hurricanes Harvey and Katrina. At least 48 people have died as a result of the storm as rescue and recovery operations proceed, a number likely to rise, especially with so many elderly, sick, and very young persons at risk. Much of Puerto Rico’s population is still without potable drinking water and large swaths of the population still lack electrical power. Hurricane Maria destroyed 80 percent of Puerto Rico’s agricultural industry, including banana, plantain and coffee crops, which translates into lost income of approximately $780 million. On August 30, 2017, Hurricane Irma struck, inflicting horrific damage on the U.S. Virgin Islands of St. Thomas, St. Croix, and St. John, the Caribbean nations of Barbuda, St. Maarten, Cuba, and Anguilla, before making landfall in the Florida Keys. In Florida alone, 6.4 million people were told to evacuate to safety, leading to days of jammed highways and frantic searches for gasoline amid one of the nation’s largest ever emergency evacuations. At least 124 persons are known to have lost their lives in Hurricane Irma, more than 
200,000 Floridians took refuge in shelters, and nearly 6.5 million homes and businesses were without power. Mr. Speaker, we do not yet know the full extent of the damage and devastation suffered by our fellows Americans in Florida, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico in the wake of Hurricanes Irma and Maria. But what we do know is that the costs of recovery and reconstruction will be extensive, best estimates place the cost in the range of $50–$100 billion. This puts in perspective the inadequacy of the amount of disaster relief provided under H.R. 4667 and why more, much more, must be done. Mr. Speaker, right now, at this very moment, approximately 300,000 Texans—in Port Arthur, in Port Aransas, in Houston and Harris County—remain homeless or are living in substandard homes with blue tarp roofs and infected with mold. Today, residents of the Cashmere Gardens community are meeting with local government officials to highlight their plight and those of other residents in the northeastern part of Houston. They are angry and frustrated and anxious, and who can blame them? Mr. Speaker, this is personal to them; and it is personal to me. That is why right now my highest priority is to ensure that funding that has been made available expeditiously gets in the hands of local governments so that relief can deliver the resources and services so desperately needed. And I will be working with the Texas General Land Office and HUD Secretary Carson to relieve the emergency housing crisis in my congressional district and state. Mr. Speaker, I wish to commend the bipartisan leadership of both Chambers, and my colleagues in the Texas congressional delegation for their diligence and commitment in bringing this package to the floor for debate and vote. I thank Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN and Ranking Member LOWEY , and Speaker R YAN and Democratic Leader PELOSI , and their Senate counterparts for the work that has been done thus far and for their assistance in the work that lies ahead. I also thank Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN and Ranking Member LOWEY , and THUD Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman DIAZ BALART , and Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee Chair SIMPSON and Ranking Member KAPTUR for including in the legislation before us the following beneficial measures that I requested, including: 1. Authority to establish and implement a $1 billion pilot program to provide small business disaster recovery grants, modeled on H.R. 3930, the ‘‘Hurricane Harvey Small Business Recovery Grants Act,’’ legislation I introduced on October 3, 2017 and cosponsored by 16 of our colleagues. 2. $75 million for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Investigations account, which is to be used in areas affected by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, and can be used to finance the $3 million HoustonArea Watershed Assessment Study I have worked to secure and previously approved by the House. 3. The bill also includes helpful legislative language to ensure that in awarding CDBG Disaster Relief funds to states, the Secretary of HUD should to the maximum extent practicable award grants to units of local government and public housing authorities that have the financial and administrative capacity to manage a grant awarded under the program. Let me describe briefly some of the major provisions contained in the Disaster Relief Supplemental: 1. FEMA Disaster Relief Fund: $27.5 billion to provide critical funding to assist the ongoing federal disaster response. Allows up to $4 billion to be provided for Community Disaster Loans (CDLs). 2. Community Development Block Grants Disaster Recovery (CDBG–DR): $26.1 billion for housing and infrastructure needs, $13.56 billion for grants to states, tribes, and territories for unmet housing needs and business losses. 3. $12.5 billion for mitigation efforts to help communities protect against future disasters. 4. This funding can provide for housing elevation, buyouts in the flood plain, water/sewer infrastructure enhancements, public infrastructure hardening (e.g. stormproofing public buildings). 5. Federal Highway Administration’s Emergency Relief: $1.4 billion to address all current damages to federal highways caused by designated disasters. 6. $12.11 billion for the Army Corps of Engineers to repair existing damages by natural disasters and for studies and projects to reduce the risk of future natural disasters, $75 million to expedite studies to help mitigate future disaster damage. 7. 2.9 billion to help displaced students get back to school. Funding can be used for both public and private schools. 8. $3.8 billion for agriculture assistance. 9. $1.66 billion for Small Business Administration Disaster Loans to assist small businesses and homeowners repair or replace real estate, personal property, machinery and equipment, and inventory and business assets. Mr. Speaker, there is much more work to be done in my city of Houston, and across the areas affected by the terrible, awesome storm that will be forever known simply as Hurricane Harvey, and by Hurricanes Irma and Maria. That is why I am disappointed that only $81 billion is being provided at this time. That is why it must be emphasized and understood that this can only be understood as a partial response because much more funding will be needed to provide our fellow Americans in Texas, Florida, Louisiana, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands the help and support they need to restore their communities to their previous greatness. The material previously referred to by Mr. MCGOVERN is as follows: 
ANAMENDMENT TO H. R ES. 670 O FFERED BY  MR. MCGOVERN  At the end of the resolution, add the following new sections: SEC. 8. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. 3440) to authorize the cancellation of removal and adjustment of status of certain individuals who are long term United States residents and who entered the United States as children and for other purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary. After general debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the fiveminute rule. All points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the bill. SEC. 9. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the consideration of H.R. 3440. 
THEVOTE ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION : WHAT ITREALLY MEANS  This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the House of Representatives (VI, 308–311), describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.’’ To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition’’ in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (RIllinois) said: ‘‘The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.’’ The Republican majority may say ‘‘the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.’’ But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here’s how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ‘‘Although it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.’’ 
In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled ‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ‘‘Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon.’’ Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Republican majority’s agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mrs. HANDEL. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 1766) to reauthorize the SAFER Act of 2013, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: S. 1766 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Sexual Assault Forensic Evidence Reporting Act of 2017’’ or the ‘‘SAFER Act of 2017’’. 
Section 304(c)(2) of the DNA Sexual Assault Justice Act of 2004 (34 U.S.C. 40723(c)(2)) is amended— (1) by inserting ‘‘, both adult and pediatric,’’ after ‘‘role of forensic nurses’’; and (2) by striking ‘‘and elder abuse’’ and inserting ‘‘elder abuse, and, in particular, the need for pediatric sexual assault nurse examiners, including such nurse examiners working in the multidisciplinary setting, in responding to abuse of both children and adolescents’’. 
(a) R EAUTHORIZATION .—Section 2(c)(4) of the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000 (34 U.S.C. 40701(c)(4)) is amended by striking ‘‘2017’’ and inserting ‘‘2022’’. (b) SUNSET .—Section 1006 of the SAFER Act of 2013 (34 U.S.C. 40701 note) is amended by striking ‘‘2018’’ and inserting ‘‘2023’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from Georgia (Mrs. HANDEL ) and the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Georgia. 
Mrs. HANDEL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on S. 1766, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Georgia? There was no objection. Mrs. HANDEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. S. 1766, the Sexual Assault Forensic Evidence Reporting Act of 2017, also known as the SAFER Act, will strengthen State and local law enforcement’s ability to reduce the number of untested rape kits and help take more offenders off our streets. Congress provides significant resources annually to the Department of Justice to help reduce backlogs of untested forensic evidence. This legislation will reauthorize the Attorney General’s authority to allocate 5 to 7 percent of funds made available to carry out the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program to help communities audit their backlogs, which is an important first step in any effort to eliminate a backlog. Despite the cases analyzed and improvements made with our Federal resources, backlogs persist due to the everincreasing demand for evidence testing. According to the National Institute of Justice, as the value of DNA evidence is increasingly recognized, more evidence gets collected and submitted to laboratories for analysis. Delays in analysis of forensic evidence often result in delays of justice: serial offenders can continue victimizing, and innocent individuals may be incarcerated. The SAFER Act helps address this common impediment to the response to rape and sexual assault at the State, local, and Tribal levels. Importantly, the SAFER Act also would clarify that pediatric forensic nurses are eligible for training and employment grants. This provision underscores the critical role that pediatric sexual assault nurse examiners can play in a community’s response to children who are victims of abuse. S. 1766 can help ensure that resources provided for DNA analysis are focused on grant recipients making a good faith effort to estimate and manage their backlog of untested samples and improve efforts to get sex offenders off of our streets. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important measure, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 1766, the Sexual Assault Forensic Evidence Reporting Act of 2017. This bipartisan legislation passed the Senate on October 23, 2017. I am glad that this House is moving this legislation, because it is about children. It is about the scourge that children, women, and others find themselves victims of—sexual assault. S. 1766 will reauthorize the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000 through the year 2022, by amending the language in section 2(c)(4) of 34 U.S.C. 40701(c)(4). Furthermore, this legislation also amends other sections of the DNA Sexual Assault Justice Act of 2004 by ensuring that role of forensic nurses pertains to both adult and pediatric care. The SAFER Act also amends this statute by making a provision after ‘‘elder abuse’’ for the need of nurse examiners, particularly where there is the need for pediatric sexual assault nurse examiners, including such nurse examiners working in the multidisciplinary setting, in responding to abuse of both children and adolescents. Finally, this legislation will sunset through 2023 by amending the SAFER Act. The SAFER Act is a critical program, administered by the U.S. Department of Justice, that allows: Local law enforcement programs to obtain funding for programs to reduce the rape kit backlog in communities across the country; Victims of sexual assault get justice more quickly than in the past; Thirtyfive percent of funds available under the Debbie Smith Act for grants to local law enforcement agencies to focus more resources on rape kit testing; Five to seven percent of the Debbie Smith Act funding to be used by local jurisdictions to conduct 1year audits of untested sexual assault evidence to identify serious areas of backlog; and 
Forensic testing to be done by both pediatric and adult sexual assault nurse examiners. This is a very important measure that will address the large volume of cases that fester due to the excessive backlog in our processing of rape kits. According to the National Institute of Justice, a multidisciplinary, victim centered approach and standardized, efficient evidence processing in sexual assault cases are the focus of its new report. The report, ‘‘National Best Practices for Sexual Assault Kits,’’ outlines 35 suggestions for laboratories and law enforcement to improve their sexual assault investigations, tackling issues such as evidence collection, storage, and maintenance; backlog tracking and processing; victim advocacy and notification; and sensitivity to trauma in sexual assault victims. A working group—consisting of victims and victim advocates, sexual assault nurse examiners and medical examiners, forensic laboratories, law enforcement agencies, prosecutors, and members of the judiciary—developed the suggestions over a 2year period following the Sexual Assault Forensic Evidence Reporting Act of 2013, the SAFER Act, a component of the Violence Against Women Act. We will soon reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, and we will be happy to have this expansion included in this. A victimcentered approach is the focus on the needs and the concerns of a victim to ensure the passionate and sensitive delivery of services in a nonjudgmental manner. A traumainformed approach considers the impact of trauma and victim safety considerations. Mr. Speaker, my colleague from Texas, Congressman POE, and my colleague from New York, Congresswoman CAROLYN B. M ALONEY , have worked on a number of these issues, and also Senator CORNYN , because this is a very important step. I remember the days, in our respective jurisdictions, that we had a mounting backlog of rape kits. Do you know what that means, Mr. Speaker? Women and children do not get either their day in court or do not get justice. Mr. Speaker, I believe that this is a timely and very important legislative initiative. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support the legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. HANDEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. POE), my colleague. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, one of the worst things that can happen to any of us is to lose their voice, and I have lost mine. I know some of the Democrats are glad about that. But I want to say this on behalf of the SAFER Act. There are, in our country, on shelves, in warehouses, and in law enforcement office buildings rape kits that have never been examined. That is shameful. And everybody is to blame, from the Federal Government to local government. It is shameful because victims—and I knew a lot of them at the courthouse as a judge—don’t know who committed this crime against them, and we have the ability to tell them, but we don’t because of bureaucratic incompetence. These haven’t been examined. They have the right to know who sexually assaulted them. Also, there are criminals running loose, who have never been prosecuted, because these rape kits have never been analyzed. And, yes, there are people incarcerated who are innocent, and the rape kit can prove their innocence. It is important that we pass the SAFER Act. Get those sexual assault kits analyzed. There are no more excuses. Mr. Speaker, in 1984, Michelle was raped at knifepoint by two men who broke into her home. They blindfolded her, tied her up with a phone cord, and gagged tit her before sexually assaulting her. During the assault, they laughed and bragged that they had been getting away with committing this crime for seven years. Much to Michelle’s surprise, they left without ending her life. But hers would now be a life filled with suffering and fear. Michelle called the police and had a rape kit taken. She hoped that by achieving justice against her attackers she would find some measure of peace and closure. Michelle waited for the results, but she waited in vain. The backlog of untested kits was too large, so her kit was never tested. Over the next years, while her rape kit sat collecting dust on a shelf, breakins and rapes continued to happen in her neighborhood. She was in constant fear that her attackers were still on the loose. Not only does the inability to test rape kits deny victims justice, it also puts the safety of other innocent people in jeopardy by keeping criminals on the streets. To address this issue, Congresswoman MALONEY and I introduced the Sexual Assault Forensic Evidence Reporting Act or SAFER Act, which was signed into law in 2013. This bill provides funds to states and localities to increase rape kit testing and expand forensic lab capacities. In the years since SAFER’s enactment there has been progress, but there are still hundreds of thousands of untested rape kits across the nation. SAFER was slated to expire at the end of this year, but thankfully, with bipartisan support, Congress has secured its reauthorization and continued existence. This legislation will continue to reduce the national rape kit backlog and help victims achieve justice. I want to thank Senator CORNYN who has worked with me on SAFER for many years. And I want to thank the Chairman for bringing this bill to the floor. I applaud its passage here today. And that is just the way it is. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, to my good friend from Texas, I am just a measure above your lost voice. I am suffering from somewhat of the same thing, but I have a little bit of a voice, so I can say thank you, again, for your very hard work on this legislation as a former judge in Harris County on the criminal bench. I know you saw injustices because rape kits had not been processed. I believe, as the chair and cochair of the Congressional Children’s Caucus and the ranking member on the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations, that we went through this as well. I was very pleased that the Justice Department understood the importance of grants to help our local law enforcement, but, more importantly, that the Judiciary Committee understood the importance of this legislation to really move forward to process kits. Can you imagine, Mr. Speaker, children having a backlog of kits that have been subjected to sexual assault—the most dastardly act and violence—not only against adults, but against children, like 3montholds, or toddlers, by sick people who sexually assault them. So the development and implementation of policies and procedures by the National Institutes of Health leads to more timely submission of evidence to forensic laboratories, enhances communications and investigative procedures, promotes better informed prosecutorial decisionmaking, and, as my friend said, it helps the accused and the accuser. These approaches are the most important because they get victim participation. Victims of sexual assault require justice that is swift, thorough, and expedient so they may begin to heal and attempt to put the pieces of their lives back together. They deserve the best efforts of law enforcement to help them along the way. When Houston was trying to rebuild its rape testing structure, we utilized the FBI. And I want to take a moment to thank the FBI for its deep abiding integrity and honesty and how it comes to the rescue of so many jurisdictions, local law enforcement. Let us be very clear on how important it is to maintain the integrity and the respect for the FBI, as opposed to demeaning the FBI. Today, on the floor of the House, I want to thank them for their service. So this legislation would reauthorize the SAFER Act, provide funding to conduct 1year audits of untested sexual assault evidence, and ensure that law enforcement agencies across the country are trained and armed with the skills and tools they require to stand against sexual assault and stand for those individuals who might be victimized. The SAFER Act would also ensure that forensic nurses are eligible for training under the program. These professionals are indispensable. Our citizens deserve to be protected and remain free from harm. Our children, women, and men, who are sexually assaulted, deserve to be protected, but their cases must move expeditiously. 
Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation, as we continue to stand for victims and against the viciousness of sexual crimes of any kind, protect them, and bring the perpetrators to justice. I ask for a ‘‘yes’’ vote for this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 1766, the ‘‘Sexual Assault Forensic Evidence Reporting’’ or the (SAFER) Act of 2017.’’ This bipartisan legislation passed the Senate October 23, 2017. S. 1766 will reauthorize the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000 through the year 2022, by amending the language in section 2(c)(4) of the (34 U.S.C. 40701(c)(4)). Furthermore, this legislation also amends Section 304(c)(2) of the DNA Sexual Assault Justice Act of 2004 (34 U.S.C. 40723(c)(2)) by ensuring that role of forensic nurses pertains to both adult and pediatric care. The SAFER Act also amends this statute by making a provision after ‘‘elder abuse’’ for the need of nurse examiners, particularly, where there is the need for pediatric sexual assault nurse examiners, including such nurse examiners working in the multidisciplinary setting, in responding to abuse of both children and adolescents’’. Finally, this legislation will sunset through 2023 by amending Section 1006 of the SAFER Act of 2013 (34 U.S.C. 40701 note). The SAFER Act is a critical program administered by the U.S. Department of Justice that allows: Local law enforcement programs to obtain funding for programs to reduce the rape kit backlog in communities across the country. Victims of sexual assault get justice more quickly than in the past. 35% of funds available under the Debbie Smith Act for grants to local law enforcement agencies to focus more resources on rape kit testing. 5%–7% of the Debbie Smith Act funding to be used by local jurisdictions to conduct one year audits of untested sexual assault evidence to identify serious areas of backlog. Forensic testing to be done by both pediatric and adult sexual assault nurse examiners. This is a very important measure that will address the large volume of cases that fester due to the excessive back log in our processing of rape kits. According to the National Institute of Justice, a multidisciplinary, victimcentered approach and standardized, efficient evidence processing in sexual assault cases are the focus of its new report. The report, National Best Practices for Sexual Assault Kits, outlines 35 suggestions for laboratories and law enforcement to improve their sexual assault investigations, tackling issues such as evidence collection, storage and maintenance; backlog tracking & processing; victim advocacy and notification; and sensitivity to trauma in sexual assault victims.

A victim centered approach is the focus on the needs and concerns of a victim to ensure the compassionate and sensitive delivery of services in a nonjudgmental manner. A traumainformed approach considers the impact of trauma and victim safety considerations. Utilizing both approaches in the development and implementation of policies and procedures leads to more timely submission of evidence to forensic laboratories, enhances communications and investigative procedures, promotes better informed prosecutorial decisionmaking, and ultimately may reduce re traumatization of victims by the criminal justice system. In fact, these approaches are more likely to increase victim participation and thereby, support more complete investigations, increasing the overall likelihood of successful prosecutions.’’ For these reasons, I support this bill. Victims of sexual assault require justice that is swift, thorough, and expedient, so that they may begin to heal and attempt to put the pieces of their lives back together. They deserve the best efforts of law enforcement to help them along the way. This legislation would reauthorize the SAFER Act, provide funding to conduct one year audits of untested sexual assault evidence, and ensure that law enforcement agencies across the country are trained and armed with the skills and tools they require to stand against sexual assault, and stand for those individuals who might be victimized. The SAFER Act would also ensure that forensic nurses are eligible for training under the program. These professionals perform indispensable functions within the investigation of sexual abuse cases. They also provide specialized care and attention to children, youth, and the elderly, who are sexually abused. This legislation would help local authorities make certain that state and local forensic nurses are fully capable of providing such an important service to child victims. Our citizens deserve to be protected and remain free from harm. We have a responsibility to do all that we can during those unfortunate times where one of them might be victimized. Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation as we continue to stand for victims and against sexual crimes of any kind. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mrs. HANDEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, let me start by recognizing the tremendous leadership of my colleague, Representative TEDPOE from Texas. I thank him for giving me the honor of being his wing woman in presenting this important piece of legislation today. And, indeed, the SAFER Act is an important piece of legislation to reinforce the efforts of our local and State law enforcement in their work to reduce the number of untested rape kits and help take these sexual assault predators off the streets. At the same time, this legislation underscores the critical role that the pediatric sexual assault examiners play in this process and makes them eligible for key training. So, again, I ask my colleagues to pass this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. b1445 The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Georgia (Mrs. HANDEL ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 1766. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore.

TITLE III—BUDGETARY EFFECTS 
This division is designated as an emergency requirement pursuant to section 4(g) of the Statutory PayAsYouGo Act of 2010 (2 U.S.C. 933(g)). 
In the Senate, this division is designated as an emergency requirement pursuant to section 403(a) of S. Con. Res. 13 (111th Congress), the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2010. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill, as amended, shall be debatable for 1 hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Appropriations. The gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN ) and the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. LOWEY ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to present H.R. 4667, a bill making emergency appropriations for hurricane and wildfire recovery. Parts of our Nation have been devastated by multiple backtoback hurricanes and wildfires that have caused tremendous loss of life, livelihoods, and property. Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria are three of the top five most expensive hurricanes in the last 25 years. Combined with the horrific wildfires that continue to rage in California, the toll that these disasters have taken is unprecedented. We must stand by our fellow Americans to get them the help and resources they need to recover. To this end, this legislation provides a total of $81 billion for crucial Federal programs that support ongoing relief, recovery, and rebuilding. This includes $27.5 billion for FEMA to provide relief and recovery assistance; $26.1 billion for Community Development Block Grants for shelter and housing and infrastructure improvements, and the means to help large and small businesses recover; and $12.1 billion for the Army Corps of Engineers to repair and rebuild infrastructure projects that help protect against future disasters, building in resiliency. The bill also includes $3.8 billion for the Department of Agriculture, which will support critical agriculture disaster assistance for massive crop and livestock loss. Funding is also included to repair Federal highways and local transit systems, to help children displaced by the storms of Puerto Rico get back to school, and for small business disaster loans, which will allow businesses to reopen their doors as quickly as possible. Our Committee on Appropriations will continue to monitor these recovery efforts to ensure accountability, transparency, and that every dollar is spent wisely. From Florida and Texas, to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, to California, and all areas dealing with major disaster declarations, this Congress is committed to helping you. Congress has already provided $51.75 billion in two separate supplemental bills for these ongoing efforts. With this third tranche of emergency funding, it will bring the total funding for fiscal year 2018 emergency response to $132 billion. This funding is desperately needed by thousands of American families, individuals, and communities to rebuild their homes and businesses, restore electric power and critical infrastructure, and to protect against further damage. It is the duty of Congress to provide this help to our fellow Americans in their times of need. Mr. Speaker, before I close, I would like to thank everyone who came to leadership and to the Appropriations Committee to make sure that Congress is getting the assistance to those hurricane and wildfire victims that they urgently need. I would also like to thank the clerks and professional staff and the chairs of the 12 Appropriations Subcommittees for their working tirelessly to bring this bill to the floor and, may I say, nearly 30 others this year. It is time to get this emergency aid to those who need it. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, this legislation is a failure of both process and substance. When Congress received the paltry and insufficient disaster request from the administration, the House and Senate Appropriations Committees began a bipartisan and bicameral process to develop an emergency assistance package that would come closer to meeting the massive scale of need resulting from hurricanes and wildfires in the summer and fall 2017. I sincerely regret that the majority leadership abandoned that process, choosing, instead, to disregard input from Democrats and even from Senate Republicans, and developed their own partisan supplemental. The results of that decision is a poor product that will not be enacted into law. Despite some robust funding levels, this bill fails to fix a potentially calamitous Medicaid system situation for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Without help from Congress, these programs will exhaust available funding within months. This bill also fails to waive unworkable and unjustifiable cost share requirements for FEMA and the Army Corps of Engineers’ projects, which could put Federal funding out of reach. These and other serious shortcomings must be fixed before an emergency supplemental is enacted into law. Even if this supplemental passes today, the House majority’s decision to exclude both Democrats and Senate Republicans from this process means that it will not be enacted this year because it cannot pass the Senate. Instead of the partisan product with no chance of advancement, we should be considering a responsible bipartisan emergency supplemental that both the House and the Senate could pass and enact into law. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CULBERSON ), the chairman of the Commerce, Justice, and Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee. Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN and Speaker RYAN for rejecting the Office of Management and Budget’s completely inadequate funding request that they sent to Congress. It is the job of the Appropriations Committee and Congress to write these emergency spending bills, and we have done so. I am one of eight subcommittee chairmen who held public hearings at the request of the chairman. I want to thank Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN for listening to all of us to change the legislation to ensure that the State of Texas, Florida, and Puerto Rico are a long way towards being made whole. This is a tremendous step in the right direction. We are grateful for the funding that is contained here. We are also grateful for a lot of the changes that the chairman and the committee have included. For example, we have got $12 billion here for the Army Corps of Engineers’ projects that is going to be prioritized 
and targeted to areas that have suffered repeated floods over the last 2 years, to areas that have been declared disasters by the President. That will help ensure that the people of Texas, in particular, who had 53 inches of rain over an area the size of New Jersey, the people of Texas and southwest Louisiana who suffered from Hurricane Harvey, those projects will receive priority consideration by the Army Corps of Engineers. That is going to help us get that third reservoir built in northwest Harris County. This funding is also sufficient to fully pay for all federally authorized flood control projects in southeast Texas. That means we will have front loaded funding for a critical project to finish out Brays Bayou, to build it to the 100year flood protection standard. The Army Corps of Engineers’ funding is also going to allow us to dredge the Port of Houston, the Port of Beaumont, and open up those ports to full capacity. Another important change that the chairman included at my request, and I am very pleased it is in there, is that we had a lot of people flooded because the Army Corps of Engineers opened the floodgates necessarily on Addicks and Barker. These folks were flooded by the action of the government in the Neches River Waterway and the Sabine Waterway and on the San Jacinto River. Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN included language that allows the Governor of the State of Texas to ask for a waiver of the prohibition against duplication of benefits. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from Texas. Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Speaker, it is important for the people of Texas to know that help is on the way to not only repair the damage caused by the flood, but if they were flooded by the action of the government, there is a provision in this legislation today that will allow the Governor to request that they be compensated, that they can take out an SBA loan at the front and they will pay the government back, and then receive a Community Development Block Grant at the end to help make them whole. Mr. Speaker, we will also be able to rebuild churches and synagogues. That is vitally important because we suffered so much damage in southeast Texas. I am proud to support this legislation, and I look forward to working with the chairman and my colleagues as we go forward, if there is additional funding needed. I am very grateful for the support of Congress. I urge Members to support this vital legislation to help the people of southeast Texas, Florida, and Puerto Rico have a better Christmas. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. SERRANO ), the ranking member of the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee. (Mr. SERRANO asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for the time. I rise to sadly oppose this disaster supplemental, which does not do enough to help Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. This is a bill created by Republicans with little Democratic input. At some point, they decided that rather than working in a bipartisan manner, they wanted to try and address these disasters without taking into account some of the most important Democratic priorities. In particular, it does not address many issues crucial to Puerto Rico’s recovery in the wake of Hurricanes Irma and Maria. For instance, it does nothing to address the looming Medicaid cliff, which will devastate health kits access and delivery on the island early next year. It does not waive numerous local cost share requirements, which will make it extremely difficult for the government of Puerto Rico to access large parts of the Federal funding made available here. It does not do enough to help States like New York and New Jersey and others that have generously opened their arms to our fellow citizens displaced by these storms. b1500 It expands the powers of the Puerto Rico Fiscal Oversight Board, giving them authority to approve the recovery plans of Puerto Rico’s government. The end result of all of this is further delay in Puerto Rico’s recovery. This is not the message that we want to send to 3.4 million American citizens this holiday season. As I look at my notes and as I look at what this debate may become today, it really comes down to one point: we as Americans, we as the United States Congress, we as the U.S. Government still have not come to grips with the fact that, yes, we have territories, that, yes, we have colonies. If you ask the American people, ‘‘Are the people of Puerto Rico American citizens?’’ you would be shocked before all this information went out on the hurricanes how many would say: ‘‘I don’t know. I served with some in the Army, but I don’t know if they are citizens.’’ Well, I think, more and more, we need to know that the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Marianna Islands, and Puerto Rico are part of the American family. It is not as a long gone member of my party once told me when I said: What are we going to do about Puerto Rico in this bill? He said: Well, we have no money left over. I said: Did you have money left over for the 50 States? He said: Well, they go first. I said: Why do they go first? Why can’t the whole family go together? So my plea that I have made for years, I continue to make. There is a bigger issue than the one we are discussing today, and that is the fact that we have territories. We have colonies. They are part of the United States. They should be part of our family. We should treat them as such. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CARTER ), the chairman of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Appropriations. Mr. CARTER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I recently flew in a C–130 with a gathering of my colleagues and members of the Senate the length and breadth of Florida, across the Gulf of Mexico, and up and down the Gulf Coast of my home State of Texas and looked at the devastation that, in 1 day, on about a 12hour flight, we could see all the devastation that took place from these terrible storms. That is why this supplemental is so very important, because this is not about numbers, this is not about anything; it is about people, human beings. We helped people move their ruined furniture out of their houses when we were on that trip. We saw the devastation. We saw the tears and the pain that these people were dealing with. As chairman of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Appropriations, I am proud to have had a small part in working on this project. Let me explain that the supplement provides $28.6 billion for the Department of Homeland Security; $27.5 billion is for the Disaster Relief Fund to provide for the continued response and recovery efforts for all recent disasters. These funds will provide for the recovery efforts of all disasters that have received a major disaster declaration, to include, Texas, Florida, California, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. This money is needed to ensure food, water, and temporary shelter is made available to disaster survivors. These funds are used for debris removal efforts, the first step in recovery. These funds will also support the longterm recovery efforts to help rebuild utilities, bridges, roads, and buildings. $4 billion of this can be used for community disaster loans to help communities pay for essential services while they get back on their feet. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman. Mr. CARTER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. The bill also includes $1.1 billion to address the damages to important Coast Guard, Customs and Border Protection, and Transportation Security Administration facilities. The supplement provides $4.4 billion more than requested, but we looked at 
each project to ensure that funding was only going to projects that address damages, improve resiliency, and increase disaster responses. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN for his leadership. He has been right on top of this, and we have got a good product here. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the supplemental. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. CROWLEY ), the chair of the Democratic Caucus. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New York for yielding me this time, and I thank her for her work. I thank Mr. FRELING HUYSEN , as well, for his work and my colleagues on the other side, but I have reservations, strong reservations about this bill. I appreciate the very real needs of those still recovering, our American citizens and friends and family in Florida and Texas, and that concern is genuine. I have always supported aid to other parts of the country, even when some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle refused to help New York and left New York hanging after Superstorm Sandy. I have never let that get in the way of my wanting to be helpful to my fellow citizens anywhere in this country who are under duress. But I can’t, in good conscience, vote for this bill. It leaves some of the hardest hit and most vulnerable Americans, American citizens, without the help that they need. It treats Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands as secondclass citizens—not secondclass people, but secondclass, literally, citizens—and will stall the efforts there to rebuild. I appreciate Mr. CULBERSON saying that the people of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands are a long way from recovery. I am paraphrasing what he said. I do appreciate those words. I do hope that it is an insight for my Republican colleagues and the leadership on the other side of the aisle that more help will be on the way for the people of Puerto Rico, but simply not enough is being done in this bill to help the men and women of Puerto Rico and the children of Puerto Rico today. Our fellow citizens of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands are no less American than those in any of the 50 States. I wonder if anyone would argue that point as to whether they are citizens of the United States or not. I would argue they are no less citizens of the United States than any other individuals in the rest of the 50 States, and they should be treated the same and with the same respect. The people of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands suffered direct hits not from one, but from two massive hurricanes, the likes of which we have never seen before, not in our modern history. Maybe you have to go back to Alexander Hamilton and the hurricane that he wrote about back in the 1700s that rocketed him to stardom. Here we are 3 months later. Millions—not hundreds, not thousands, but millions—of our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico and in the Virgin Islands are without power. Far too many still, because they are without power, lack clean drinking water. Thousands are unable to receive adequate healthcare, and earlier this week, the Governor of Puerto Rico ordered a recount of the storm’s death toll, which could number, now, into the thousands. If that is not a sign of how neglectful the response has been to this disaster, then I don’t know what would be. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. SMITH of Nebraska). The time of the gentleman has expired. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 additional minute to the gentleman from New York. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. We must provide the assistance that our territories need. We must fully fund Medicaid as the islands recover. We must eliminate disparities in the law that are holding back that recovery. We must stand up for not the people of the Virgin Islands, not the people of Puerto Rico, but the United States citizens who have fought in our wars, who have defended our freedoms, for the United States citizens of the Virgin Islands and the United States citizens of Puerto Rico. They deserve no less than how any other State is being treated after a disaster like this. They deserve no less. They deserve more than they are getting in this bill. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. CALVERT ), chairman of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee on Appropriations. Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 4667, which provides $81 billion in Federal disaster assistance to States and territories recently devastated by natural disasters. This is not a small amount of money. First, as chairman of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee on Appropriations, I am pleased to include $616.4 million for repairs, cleanup, and recovery at various agencies, including the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Park Service, and others. As chairman of the California Republican delegation, I have a particular interest in wildfire assistance in this bill. The coordination and collaboration between Republicans and Democrats on this bill to reflect the needs of California shows bipartisanship is alive and well. Mr. Speaker, I would certainly like to thank Congressman MIKETHOMPSON  for his tireless efforts in regard to the fires in northern California. Last month, I toured Santa Rosa, California, which was absolutely decimated after a wildfire tore through the area. Forty people lost their lives, and more than 14,000 homes were destroyed or damaged. As a lifelong California resident, I have seen a lot of fires and the resulting devastation, but I have never witnessed anything like I saw in Santa Rosa. The stories of survival and heroics of our first responders truly are incredible. Now, in the aftermath, we must come together to recover and rebuild. This bill is the first step towards recovery and provides $27.5 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund, a $4.5 billion increase from the request, a 90 percent Federal cost share for wildfire disasters; and $541 million for watershed and flood prevention efforts, which will be vital as the rainy season begins in California. California will be eligible for nearly all the various sources of disaster funding in this bill, including for crop losses, Army Corps of Engineers projects, Federal highway damages, small business assistance, displaced employees, and student assistance, among others. With my colleagues, I will continue to monitor the fire situation and respond as needed. The Thomas Fire in Ventura County has burned over 272,000 acres, on track to be the largest wildfire in California history; and, unfortunately, the fire rages on. Mr. Speaker, I especially want to thank Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN and the Appropriations Committee staff for their outreach and responsiveness to the fires in California. We greatly appreciate their assistance and ongoing support. Mr. Speaker, I would be remiss if I didn’t thank all my staff and the Interior Subcommittee, but in particular, my chief of staff, Dave Kennett, and on the Interior Subcommittee, Betsy Bina, both of whom went above and beyond to deliver results for California. On a quick note, best wishes for Betsy, who is getting married today. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this emergency supplemental funding bill. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from New York; I want to thank the chairman; but I do want to take a moment and particularly thank the gentlewoman from New York for the kindness that she showed the first victims of this horrific hurricane season. I remember coming back to Congress in the immediacy of Hurricane Harvey. Many don’t know, but I left my home in a firetruck—not out of desperation, but to go where my constituents were— and spent the rest of the time with 14,000 homeless evacuees in a shelter that had been set up immediately with concern about the city of Houston. We had meetings starting at 6 a.m. In the evening, as the waters started moving in different communities and different communities became flooded, we 
could see evacuees carrying their only belongings—pillows, just a paper bag— flooding into the George R. Brown Convention Center. This is serious for me. I remember seeing elderly persons being evacuated after the Addicks Reservoir, Barker Reservoir was released and family members standing on what was now the shore waiting for those loved ones. I know the family and went to the funerals of the six family members who died in Greens Bayou in my congressional district. I introduced a bill, H.R. 3686, which the gentlewoman from New York was quite interested in. It was for $174 billion. If we had that amount now, I would be more than happy to share that with Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. We don’t have that. And I am extremely disappointed that we have $81 billion, not because of the lack of the hard work of those who worked on the Appropriations Committee, because I know they wanted to do more, but there were other distractions—like a $1.4 trillion tax cut. b1515 The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mrs. LOWEY. I yield the gentlewoman from Texas an additional 1 minute. Ms. JACKSON LEE. I want to thank my Texas colleagues. We worked together, and I truly appreciate that and will thank them for it. Today, I indicated that I have constituents who are down testifying in Houston about their devastation, so I want to make this point. First of all, I fought very hard for a $1 billion grant program for small businesses. I want to tell my constituents it is in, and I want to tell the State of Texas they have to put that in their application that they want to give small businesses grants and not loans. There is $12 billion in CDBG programs. I want to make sure that the State works with us to ensure that the elderly, the people who have no resources, families that have no resources have their homes rebuilt or they have their homes fixed. I want to make sure that the watershed study comes under section title IV, that the Army Corps is listening, that the watershed program that I have passed in two sessions to study the bayous, as to why Greens Bayou and Buffalo Bayou and White Oak Bayou and Halls Bayou flood, and why people lose their lives. I want that watershed done, and the Army Corps of Engineers, I hope, will listen. There is a lot of work left to be done. We have got to get more money. And I am glad that Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands are in, but you can count on me, Texas, and count on me, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands and Florida. We will fight into the new year to ensure that we get more funding. But these items have to be considered. We fought hard for them. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on H.R. 4667, ‘‘Making Further Supplemental Appropriations for Fiscal Year 2017.’’ H.R. 4667, provides $81 billion in aid to respond to the damage caused by Hurricanes Irma and Maria, and the wildfires in California. I thank the Speaker and Rules Committee Chairman SESSIONS for acting favorably upon my request to bring this emergency disaster supplemental to the floor for debate and vote as a standalone measure. But the fact remains that the amount of funding provided in the disaster relief package is very disappointing because it is not nearly sufficient to ameliorate the suffering still being experienced by the people of the communities in the areas affected by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. Congress has had more than three months to develop an aid package that it is commensurate to the challenge faced by the affected states and territories in rebuilding their devastated communities. Much of this time has been squandered by the Republican congressional leadership all consuming focus on ramming through the Republican Tax Scam legislation that gives 83 percent of its benefits to the top 1 percent, raises taxes on working and middleclass families, takes away health insurance from 13 million Americans, explodes the deficit by $1.5 trillion and the national debt by $1.7 trillion, and will be paid for by 5.4 trillion in cuts to vital programs Americans depend on, including an imminent $25 billion reduction in Medicare funding. Mr. Speaker, on September 6, 2017, ten days after Hurricane Harvey struck and joined by 44 of our colleagues, I introduced H.R. 3686, the ‘‘Hurricane Harvey Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2017,’’ which provides $174 billion in disaster relief for the areas affected by Hurricane Harvey, the worst superstorm ever to strike the mainland United States. The $174 billion in funding provided by H.R. 3686 represents a comprehensive response commensurate to the challenge; specifically my legislation provides relief in the following amounts: 1. Housing and Community Development Fund: $50 billion 2. FEMA Disaster Relief Fund: $35 billion 3. Army Corps of Engineers—Construction: $15 billion 4. Flood Control and Coastal Emergencies: $13 billion 5. Public Transportation Emergency Relief Program: $33 billion 6. Small Business Disaster Loans Program: $2 billion 7. Emergency Conservation Activities: $650 million 8. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration: $321 million 9. National Aeronautics and Space Administration: $50 million 10. Legal Services Corporation: $10 million 11. Army National Guard: $10 million 12. Army Corps of Engineers—Civil Investigations: $150 million 13. Coast Guard: $450 million 14. National Park Service Historic Preservation Fund: $800 million 15. EPA Environmental Programs and Management: $2.5 billion 16. EPA Hazardous Substance Superfund: $7 million 17. Leaking Underground Storage Tank Fund: $15 million 18. State and Tribal Assistance Grants: $600 million 19. Employment and Training Services: $100 million 20. Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund: $2.5 billion 21. Airport and Airway Trust Fund: $90 million 22. FederalAid Highways Emergency Relief Program: $6.5 billion And that is just for Texas and the areas affected by Hurricane Harvey; the damage wrought by Hurricane Irma in Florida, and Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands was nearly as great in dollar terms and equal in the level of misery and suffering inflicted on the residents. Mr. Speaker, on September 20, 2017, Hurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico, along the southeastern coast, near the small town of Yabucoa. The devastation wrought on that beautiful Caribbean oasis and its 3.5 million inhabitants, our fellow citizens of the United States, is unimaginable, except perhaps to those of us who have lived through and survived similar natural disasters, like Hurricanes Harvey and Katrina. At least 48 people have died as a result of the storm as rescue and recovery operations proceed, a number likely to rise, especially with so many elderly, sick, and very young persons at risk. Much of Puerto Rico’s population is still without potable drinking water and large swaths of the population still lack electrical power. Hurricane Maria destroyed 80 percent of Puerto Rico’s agricultural industry, including banana, plantain and coffee crops, which translates into lost income of approximately $780 million. On August 30, 2017, Hurricane Irma struck, inflicting horrific damage on the U.S. Virgin Islands of St. Thomas, St. Croix, and St. John, the Caribbean nations of Barbuda, St. Maarten, Cuba, and Anguilla, before making landfall in the Florida Keys. In Florida alone, 6.4 million people told to evacuate to safety, leading to days of jammed highways and frantic searches for gasoline amid one of the nation’s largest ever emergency evacuations. At least 124 persons are known to have lost their lives in Hurricane Irma, more than 200,000 Floridians took refuge in shelters, and nearly 6.5 million homes and businesses were without power. Mr. Speaker, we do not yet know the full extent of the damage and devastation suffered by our fellows Americans in Florida, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico in the wake of Hurricanes Irma and Maria. But what we do know is that the costs of recovery and reconstruction will be extensive, best estimates place the cost in the range of $50–$100 billion. This puts in perspective the inadequacy of the amount of disaster relief provided under H.R. 4667 and why more, much more, must be done. Mr. Speaker, right now, at this very moment, approximately 300,000 Texans—in Port Arthur, in Port Aransas, in Houston and Harris County—remain homeless or are living in substandard homes with blue tarp roofs and infected with mold. 
Today, residents of the Cashmere Gardens community are meeting with local government officials to highlight their plight and those of other residents in the northeastern part of Houston. They are angry and frustrated and anxious, and who can blame them? Mr. Speaker, this is personal to them; and it is personal to me. That is why right now my highest priority is to ensure that funding that has been made available expeditiously gets in the hands of local governments so that relief can be deliver the resources and services so desperately needed. And I will be working with the Texas General Land Office and HUD Secretary Carson to relieve the emergency housing crisis in my congressional district and state. Mr. Speaker, I wish to commend the bipartisan leadership of both chambers, and my colleagues in the Texas congressional delegation for their diligence and commitment in bringing this package to the floor for debate and vote. I thank Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN and Ranking Member LOWEY , and Speaker R YAN and Democratic Leader PELOSI , and their Senate counterparts for the work that has been done thus far and for their assistance in the work that lies ahead. I also thank Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN and Ranking Member LOWEY , and THUD Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman DIAZ BALART , and Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee Chair SIMPSON and Ranking Member KAPTUR for including in the legislation before us the following beneficial measures that I requested, including: 1. Authority to establish an implement a $1 billion pilot program to provides small business disaster recovery grants, modeled on H.R. 3930, the ‘‘Hurricane Harvey Small Business Recovery Grants Act,’’ legislation I introduced on October 3, 2017 and cosponsored by 16 of our colleagues. 2. $75 million for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Investigations account, which is to be used in areas affected by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, and can be used to finance the $3 million HoustonArea Watershed Assessment Study I have worked to secure and previously approved by the House. 3. The bill also includes helpful legislative language to ensure that in awarding CDBG Disaster Relief funds to states, the Secretary of HUD should to the maximum extent practicable award grants to units of local government and public housing authorities that have the financial and administrative capacity to manage a grant awarded under the program. Let me describe briefly some of the major provisions contained in the Disaster Relief Supplemental: 1. FEMA Disaster Relief Fund: $27.5 billion to provide critical funding to assist the ongoing federal disaster response. allows up to $4 billion to be provided for Community Disaster Loans (CDLs). 2. Community Development Block Grants Disaster Recovery (CDBG–DR): $26.1 billion for housing and infrastructure needs. $13.56 billion for grants to states, tribes, and territories for unmet housing needs and business losses. 3. $12.5 billion for mitigation efforts to help communities protect against future disasters. 4. This funding can provide for housing elevation, buyouts in the flood plain, water/sewer infrastructure enhancements, public infrastructure hardening (e.g. storm proofing public buildings). 5. Federal Highway Administration’s Emergency Relief: $1.4 billion to address all current damages to federal highways caused by designated disasters 6. $12.11 billion for the Army Corps of Engineers to repair existing damages by natural disasters and for studies and projects to reduce the risk of future natural disasters, $75 million to expedite studies to help mitigate future disaster damage. 7. 2.9 billion to help displaced students get back to school. funding can be used for both public and private schools 8. $3.8 billion for agriculture assistance. 9. $1.66 billion for Small Business Administration Disaster Loans to assist small businesses and homeowners repair or replace real estate, personal property, machinery and equipment, and inventory and business assets. Mr. Speaker, there is much more work to be done in my city of Houston, and across the areas affected by the terrible, awesome storm that will be forever known simply as Hurricane Harvey, and by Hurricanes Irma and Maria. That is why I am disappointed that only $81 billion is being provided at this time. That is why it must be emphasized and understood that this can only be understood as a partial response because much more funding will be needed to provide our fellow Americans in Texas, Florida, Louisiana, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands the help and support they need to restore their communities to their previous greatness. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DIAZBALART ), the chairman of the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee. Mr. DIAZBALART. Mr. Speaker, let me first thank the chairman of the committee for his spectacular work on this bill. Look, this bill provides muchneeded relief and resources to Texas, Florida, the U.S. Virgin Islands, California, and Puerto Rico. I have heard a lot in this debate, but let’s be very clear. This bill treats Florida, the folks in Florida, Texas, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and California exactly the same—exactly the same. Significant portions, Mr. Speaker, of my district were hit hard by Hurricane Irma. Communities are still working to get back on their feet, communities like Everglades City, Chokoloskee, Plantation Island, Immokalee, and Montura Ranch. This bill helps meet our Federal obligation to ensure the full, appropriate Federal commitment is there for long term recovery. Mr. Speaker, for highways, this bill funds repairs for the 2017 storms and clears the backlog of prior years. On the housing side, this bill provides $26.1 billion for Community Development Block Grants. Of that, $13.6 billion is provided to meet all remaining unmet housing, business, and infrastructure needs for those hurricanes, and, yes, that includes the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. The remaining $12.5 billion is provided for mitigation grants, again, also to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands and Florida and California and Texas. All of those are treated exactly the same. So, again, these grants provide resources to our communities so that they can rebuild. Additionally, I am pleased that $3.8 billion is allocated for the Department of Agriculture. This will go a long way to help those affected, those farmers, like the ag industry and the citrus industry in the State of Florida. So, again, I strongly urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this important supplemental. I once again want to thank the chairman, Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN , for his leadership, for his courage, for bringing forward a good bill that helps the folks in our country and that treats everybody equally, equitably, and fairly. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. THOMPSON ). Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, this year has been the worst fire season in California history. The October fires included 21 major fires that were fought by over 11,000 firefighters. They were driven by powerful winds that reached speeds of over 80 miles an hour, and these fires moved, at times, as fast as 200 feet per second. That is 40 football fields in a minute. They burned nearly 300,000 acres. They forced over 100,000 people to evacuate their homes, and they destroyed over 9,000 homes and structures. And, most tragically, 44 people lost their lives. Our communities have been devastated, Mr. Speaker, but they have also come together and supported each other in inspiring ways, and now they begin the very long road to recovery. I am pleased to see this supplemental funding package will deliver much needed funds for fire recovery. I want to specifically thank Congressmen CALVERT , MCCARTHY , and P ELOSI , who came out and saw this devastation and have been working with us to make sure we get the funds that we need. I want to thank the appropriators and the appropriations staff for all their help as well. With the support of the entire California House delegation, the State of California has requested $4.4 billion for firerelated disaster relief. These funds will be vital to helping families rebuild their homes and their lives and to supporting our community as they rebuild critical infrastructure and restore essential services. It is critical that the Federal Government steps up and does its part to support our longterm recovery. This funding package is an important first step in that effort. I have a picture of one of the devastated areas. This is over 3,000 homes in one swath that were just burned to the ground. Folks in California who experienced this terrible disaster need our help. 
I ask for an ‘‘aye’’ vote. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. SHUSTER ), the chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding, and I thank the chairman and the Appropriations Committee for bringing forward this extremely important legislation, which includes important FEMA reforms which were approved unanimously by the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee partially in response to this year’s historic hurricane season. The bipartisan, bicameral Disaster Recovery Reform Act addresses the rising costs of disasters in the United States. It reforms Federal disaster programs to ensure our communities are more resilient and better prepared for the next hurricane, flood, earthquake, wildfire, or other disaster. It focuses on predisaster planning and mitigation and creates incentives for communities to build better and smarter to speed recovery when disaster does strike. This will save lives, and it will also save money. Putting our focus on mitigation is good government and is fiscally responsible. For every dollar we spend on mitigation, between $4 and $8 is saved in avoided disaster recovery costs later. This is good policy that will benefit every single congressional district across the country. I want to thank many Members who contributed, but especially to my Democratic colleagues who contributed to this effort: Congressmen JOHNSON , DEFAZIO, HUFFMAN , WILSON , MALONEY , RUIZ, SINEMA , FRANKEL , and N ADLER . And again, many, many others contributed to this important reform legislation. Many Americans are still recovering from hurricane damage, and California is in the middle of fighting massive wildfires. This is extremely important legislation. I would urge all my colleagues to support it. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. GRAVES ), the chairman of the Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for working with us on this and for yielding time. I also want to thank the chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and the ranking member for all their assistance. Mr. Speaker, this bill doesn’t just include money, which, of course, is very, very important. It also includes language and changes that I would consider to be priceless. It includes things like applying lessons learned, reducing disaster response costs, and, importantly, speeding up recovery—things outside Washington called common sense and applying it to how we handle disasters. It pivots from being reactive and spending billions of dollars after disasters to being proactive. You can look back since 1980. We have had well over 200 disasters in this Nation that have cost over $1 billion each. In fact, when you add it all up, we are looking at approximately $1.3 trillion in disaster costs in this Nation. As the chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee said, this bill includes text from H.R. 4460 and H.R. 4438 that transforms this process: instead of just coming in and picking up the pieces after a disaster, actually leaning forward and making sure our communities are more resilient, making sure they are prepared for disasters, making sure they are prepared for the future. This bill includes very important provisions to the State of Louisiana that address this duplication of benefits issue, some nonsensical policy that someone came up with that a loan is duplicative of a grant. It eliminates these barriers that prevent us from spending hazard mitigation grant programs on federally authorized Corps of Engineer projects to prevent flooding and prevent hurricane damage to our communities. It applies common sense. It ensures that deficiencies like the I–12 barrier in Louisiana are addressed. It provides funding to respond to the 2016, 1,000 year flood that we had in the capital region in Louisiana. It provides flexibility for these STEP program housing programtype concepts that ensure that we are not wasting money that is only ripped out later on, but it truly provides longterm solutions. Finally, Mr. Speaker, it addresses inefficiency in food banks and churches and others, and it makes them eligible. I urge adoption of this bill. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. BARLETTA ). Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4667, which includes provisions of my bill, the Disaster Recovery Reform Act. In 2017, 8 percent of the United States population was affected by at least one disaster. This startling statistic highlights the importance of investing in mitigation infrastructure before tragedy strikes. Studies have repeatedly shown that, for every $1 invested up front, we can save between $4 and $8 in avoided recovery costs. My bill would allow us to realize those savings by transforming how we approach disaster spending. It would provide FEMA with the programs, authorities, and resources to help our communities plan for, mitigate against, respond to, and recover from disasters. Every one of our districts, Republicans and Democrats alike, will be impacted by disaster at some point. In 2011, my own district was devastated by flooding from Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee. People lost everything, and homes and businesses were completely wiped out. I visited with families and employers affected by this tragedy, and it made me realize that we need to do something to help communities build better and smarter before disaster strikes. My bill, the Disaster Recovery Reform Act, will do just that. It will save lives, lessen damage, and speed up recovery. I thank Chairman SHUSTER and my colleagues on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and the Senate for their work on this bipartisan and bicameral agreement. Again, I urge swift passage of H.R. 4667. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS). Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, my congratulations go out to Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN and to Chairman SHUSTER for putting these FEMA reforms into law that were long overdue. I thank the gentlemen for their support. I rise in support of H.R. 4667, the critical disaster assistance legislation to help those affected by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria this year. I have said on the floor of this House numerous times that I believe it is important for Congress to come together when disaster strikes to help those impacted. Helping our fellow Americans after a disaster is the right thing to do. And, don’t forget, you never know when a disaster may hit your State. That is why I am thankful to Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN and Chairman S HUSTER  for including language important to my home State of Illinois in this bill. My bill, the Disaster Declaration Improvement Act, requires FEMA to place greater weight and consideration on the severe, localized impact of the damage following a disaster. b1530 I want to thank my colleague, Congresswoman CHERI BUSTOS , for working with me on this bipartisan bill. FEMA currently takes into account several factors when determining the need for public and individual assistance. However, there is no standard to determine which factor is more important than another, which leads to a highly subjective process, and one that has left rural counties in very populated States, like Illinois, left without help from the Federal Government. It is because one major factor used by FEMA is a State’s population. Currently, FEMA multiplies a State’s population by $1.39 to use it for the threshold to determine need, meaning, for Illinois to receive assistance, damages would have to be $18 million or more. As you can see by this chart, that is more than or nearly double that of all 
of our neighboring States. There have been multiple times where a storm hits both Illinois and our neighbors, but Illinois is the only one denied assistance. One of the most recent examples is, 2 years ago this Christmas, flood damage throughout 16 counties cost $15 million in damages. Missouri, who was also impacted by this same storm, received assistance, but Illinois did not. This is wrong. My constituents pay into the Disaster Relief Fund to help other States. It should be there when they need it. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. MIMIWALTERS ). Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. Mr. Speaker, California is experiencing the worst fire season in its history. Tragically, these fires have taken 46 lives, including one of our brave Cal Fire firefighters, Cory Iverson. California has lost nearly 10,000 homes and structures since the start of the October wildfires. The need for relief and assistance is immediate. Mr. Speaker, I support the swift passage of the Emergency Disaster Aid Package, which includes legislation I introduced, the California Wildfire Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2017. These specific provisions will allow victims to deduct property damages and access retirement funds without penalty, as well as encourage charitable giving. Passage of this bill will help mitigate the burden of these devastating wildfires and allow people to begin rebuilding their lives. Mr. Speaker, California faces a long road to recovery and rebuild from this devastating fire season. I urge my colleagues to aid in that recovery by voting for the Emergency Disaster Aid Package. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. SMITH). Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for yielding time to me and for his tremendous bill. It is a great bipartisan piece of legislation. Mr. Speaker, after Superstorm Sandy, I and others saw how leaders and volunteers of churches, synagogues, and other religious centers helped feed, clothe, and shelter tens of thousands of victims, yet they were left out and left behind when it came to repairs of their own facilities. The FEMA policy was and is unfair, unjustified, and discriminatory. Over 4 years ago, the House came together in the wake of Superstorm Sandy and passed legislation that I authored by 354–72. Surprise, surprise, the Senate never acted, so the policy continues to this day. I want to thank the chairman for including a provision in this bill that will ensure that houses of worship, churches, and synagogues get the kind of help they need on an equal basis with other nonprofits. I also want to thank him for including language that will get rid of this misnamed duplication of benefits clause. Imagine this: men and women who are victimized by Superstorm Sandy or any other storm, they go to FEMA, they are advised to take out an SBA loan, then a little later in the recovery time, they are told that there is a HUD grant available, and they are precluded from getting that grant to even pay off the SBA loan. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. RUTHERFORD ). Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this emergency supplemental bill. This emergency funding provides muchneeded and, frankly, overdue relief to my district in northeast Florida. In September, Hurricane Irma caused flooding that the city of Jacksonville had not seen in more than 150 years. Downtown was literally under water, power was out for many days, and homes and businesses were shuttered. In our more rural agricultural communities in Nassau County and St. Johns County, crops were wiped out, hurting our agriculture community for months, if not years to come. The city of Jacksonville recently projected that Hurricane Irma will cost the city $85 million. I would be remiss if I did not commend the quick Federal response, the leadership of our Governor, and the planning and coordination of local emergency management officials and first responders, who saved lives and made our community safe and quickly back up and running. But the Federal support in this bill provides the next phase in emergency response that we so desperately need. I would like to thank Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN and his committee and committee staff for their work to get this bill over the line. I urge my colleagues in the strongest way possible to support this bill. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCARTHY ), the majority leader. Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me and for his work. Mr. Speaker, it is only 4 days until Christmas. I look forward to going home and being with my family. I know every single Member in this body looks forward to that, too. I count my blessings that my family is safe and that I have a community and home to head back to. There are people in this country who don’t have that. Their homes were destroyed by wind, flood, and fires. Their communities were torn apart by hurricanes and flames. Mr. Speaker, I had the somber privilege of traveling to these places. I went to Texas and spent time with Members from both sides of the aisle, seeing the flooded homes and streets filled with water. We visited NRG Stadium to meet the people forced to evacuate their homes. I stood with Representatives like SHEILA JACKSON LEE, ALGREEN , RANDY  WEBER , and B RIAN BABIN. These folks don’t often agree on much in politics. But you know what we did that day? We all promised to help the people of Texas. I flew to the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico with Minority Whip STENY  HOYER , and I would like to thank Delegate STACEY PLASKETT and Resident Commissioner JENNIFFER GONZA´LEZ COLO´Nfor welcoming us and opening the eyes of the Nation to what was happening. In the Virgin Islands, we visited a hospital. The storm left half of it unusable. No dialysis machines. They had to come to the mainland. Nurses and doctors were working, doing the best they could to help people in the most difficult of circumstances. In Puerto Rico, we were the first congressional delegation to visit the interior after the storm. We were with Members like JEFFDENHAM , ANTHONY  BROWN , and N ORMA TORRES . We met people without power for weeks, low on food, low on medicine. We saw schools and homes destroyed and completely washed away. We then went to Florida to see the other towns hit by Hurricane Irma, places that face storms year after year. I returned to my home State of California with Congressmen MIKETHOMP SON and J ARED HUFFMAN during the worst wildfire season our State has ever seen. We saw the fires rage up north, where it destroyed entire communities. Fortysix people have lost their lives in the fires in California this year. You could see the devastation, block after block. Ash heaps of homes and trees, standing like barren pillars. I met with firefighters down south, still battling what may become the largest wildfire in California’s history. As it looks right now, they will still be standing on the front lines of those fires come Christmas day. Every single place I went, Democrats and Republicans stood together. We saw the devastation together. We spoke to the suffering that the people were having together, and together we made a promise that we would return here to Washington and work handinhand to help them as soon as possible. That is why you heard Minority Whip STENY HOYER , on September 26, say that he would ‘‘work with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to ensure Congress provides all funding necessary to ensure that all Americans affected by these storms can recover and rebuild.’’ That is why he said on November 2 that he believes ‘‘we can work together in a bipartisan way to ensure that the affected areas receive the resources they need from Congress.’’ 
That is why I appreciated joining him in an oped piece that was in The Washington Post on November 8, where we wrote: ‘‘We are determined to ensure that there is strong bipartisan support for the next supplemental emergency funding package so that affected areas, such as those we visited, have the resources they need.’’ Minority Leader NANCY PELOSI spoke similarly. She signed a letter with Members across California saying to President Trump that: We look forward to working with you to ensure that all Americans who have been severely impacted by recent natural disasters across the United States receive the Federal support they need and deserve. She told the Appropriations Committee that: Congress has an urgent responsibility to the California families, whose lives have been upended by disastrous wildfires. I couldn’t agree more with these statements. In the past few weeks and months, we did—we worked together. We analyzed the damage. We studied the requests from Governors and legislators. We even made significant reforms to respond to disaster in the most effective and responsible way possible. The legislation today is the result. It provides funding for every single State and territory affected by natural disasters. I remind all my friends from California that this legislation accommodates exactly what our entire delegation requested. In all this work, we did it together in a bipartisan way; the way the American people expect this body to work. Now, I know it is the habit of this town to play politics. Mr. Speaker, I do want to tell my friends on the other side: If they feel like they have to, play politics on tax cuts. Call it whatever you want to call it. Play politics on all the other legislation that comes to this floor. But if I can request one thing: Please don’t do it here. Don’t play politics on a vote to give aid to the people of Texas; to the people of Puerto Rico; to the people of the Virgin Islands; to the people of Florida, and to the people of California, who are still fighting the fires. Don’t play politics on a bill that you are going to hope to maybe stop another. That would be the worst of any politics I have seen played here. Mr. Speaker, I beg my friends on the other side: Please don’t do what they did 2 weeks ago when they whipped against the funding bill to shut the government down. If they don’t like tax cuts, I understand; vote against them. If they don’t want to vote for the funding of the government and they want to shut it down, fine, take that vote. But here and now, right before Christmas, don’t vote against aid for Americans who just lost everything. They don’t understand the politics in it. Don’t vote against aid we promised to deliver. Don’t vote against aid we worked so hard together to put on this floor. Washington, D.C., can be far from our homes. We may all be dreaming of being home with our kids, eating Christmas dinner, opening presents, and enjoying time with our family and friends; but what we do here and now has consequences. What we do here and now will either give tens of thousands of people something to hope for this Christmas, or take that hope away. We can deliver that hope if those who stood with me on the flood plains of Texas and on the burnt hills of California keep the promise they made. We can deliver that hope if those who worked with us for so long continue to work with us today. People need our help. Vote to give them the help they need, the help we all promised. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to address their remarks to the Chair. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Ms. PLASKETT ). Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding time to me. Mr. Speaker, at this moment I would like to speak on behalf of the people who I represent, the people of the Virgin Islands. I am thankful that this House has decided that they wanted to work in a bipartisan manner on supplemental aid for the unprecedented disasters that have occurred in the Virgin Islands. I did hear the voice of so many of my colleagues who said that they would be willing to do whatever was necessary to support the people of the Virgin Islands. But right now, as I stand here, people of the Virgin Islands, almost 60 percent of them, still do not have power. b1545 I have no power in my own home, and those of you in Florida, Texas, and in other places would not stand for that. But you expect us to stand for it. We are supposed to muddle through. We are only supposed to have hope this Christmas of what is supposed to come? Mr. Speaker, you can have hope at your Christmas dinner because you have got some lights on. My house I will go empty to, it will be cold, and it will be dark there until my husband and I crank up the generator and get it going for a couple of hours so that maybe we can wash, cook some food, and turn it back off again later in the day. Today, I am urging my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on H.R. 4667, not because I don’t want supplemental support, not because the people of the Virgin Islands don’t need it, but because I understand that I have said, when this measure was unveiled, that the funding in this bill is woefully insufficient, and it has not improved since that time. This measure provides only $81 billion to be split between Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and other places. If history is any indication, that money is not going to get to the people of the Virgin Islands, because while the California delegation and the Texas delegation can lobby in late hours to get what they need in the bill, I am the only person from the Virgin Islands here to support the people of the Virgin Islands. Not only do I not get invited to those negotiations, I don’t even have a vote when the bill that comes to providing for the people that I represent comes on this floor. One of the things that is noticeably absent from this disaster package is funding for Medicaid programs, the same type of funding that was put in, in discussions for Katrina, for the people of Texas and Louisiana. The government of the Virgin Islands cannot shoulder the current burden of the local matching requirements for Medicaid funding which the government of the Virgin Islands has recently submitted to be $64 million and an additional $50 million. The government of the Virgin Islands has respectfully requested that the Medicaid provisions, that the cap be removed, the arbitrary cap be removed for us for a period of time for us to be stabilized and for 100 percent the same way it was for Katrina in other places be given to us. Now, the people of the Virgin Islands and the people of Puerto Rico—I know it may be news to many people—but we are U.S. citizens. We decide to live on an island because that is where we were brought. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands. Ms. PLASKETT. Because of that, we have been treated disproportionately and unfairly in the ways that some of this funding has come about. In addition, the bill does not include important local costshare waivers for the Virgin Islands and contains unnecessary limitations on the ability of the Virgin Islands to use Federal assistance to rebuild with more resilience. Furthermore, the Virgin Islands cannot wait for the community development funds provided in this bill. HUD should immediately award community development funds to the Virgin Islands on the damage assessments that have been completed. Those are things that I can get around. Those are real support in a real bill that is really working in a bipartisan way to help all Americans—not just delegations who can get together in the dark of the night and in the cold of the night and make provisions for themselves leaving those of us. I have told my colleagues on this side of the aisle that they are going to pick off Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, we are going to be left out. Some of you are going to get what you want, and you are going to vote for 
this. Once again, the people who have no vote on this floor, the people who have no say in this country, although they are U.S. citizens, are going to be left out. Mr. Speaker, I am urging all of my colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’ Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute to close. Mr. Speaker, I would like to reiterate that the bill before us is insufficient to meet the needs of those living in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Months after hurricanes devastated the islands, hundreds, if not thousands, of Americans have died, and far too many people are living without basic necessities that all Americans should have. I include in the RECORD a letter from Puerto Rico’s Resident Commissioner, JENNIFFER GONZA´LEZCOLO´N, which requests Medicaid assistance and 100 percent Federal costs for FEMA and Army Corps projects which are not included in the bill. 
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES , HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , Washington, DC, December 20, 2017. Hon. THADCOCHRAN , Chairman, Appropriations Committee, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Hon. PATRICK J. L EAHY , Ranking Member, Appropriations Committee, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Hon. RODNEY FRELINGHUYSEN , Chairman, Appropriations Committee, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. NITAM. L OWEY , Ranking Member, Appropriations Committee, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR CHAIRMEN COCHRAN AND FRELING HUYSEN AND RANKING MEMBERS LEAHY AND  LOWEY : I write to draw your attention to several disaster supplemental appropriations matters that are important to Puerto Rico’s recovery from the catastrophic damage caused by Hurricanes Irma and Marı ´a. The revisions I propose to the disaster supplemental legislation that Congress is currently considering are necessary for rebuilding the lives of the 3.4 million U.S. citizens who live on the island. Regarding any federal funding for Medicaid in Puerto Rico, it is imperative that disaster supplemental legislation provide that for not less than two years Puerto Rico will receive 100% federal funding (FMAP). This funding is necessary because there is no question about Puerto Rico’s looming Medicaid crisis: within the first months of 2018, absent emergency funding, Puerto Rico’s Medicaid program will exhaust its current funds and the island’s Medicaid system will collapse, which will bring to a halt Puerto Rico’s entire healthcare system. The disaster supplemental legislation must be revised so to statutorily waive for two years Puerto Rico’s state cost share for FEMA Public Assistance. Moreover, the disaster supplemental legislation must be revised so to include a two year waiver of the costsharing requirements for all Army Corps of Engineers projects in Puerto Rico. As you know, the recent hurricanes have destroyed Puerto Rico. The lives of millions of U.S. citizens are now in the federal government’s hands. I look forward to continuing to work with you to move forward the proposals I have outlined in this letter. Together we can rebuild Puerto Rico better than ever and make the island anew. At this moment, the federal government has an opportunity to demonstrate America’s commitment to all its citizens, including those who reside in Puerto Rico. Sincerely, JENNIFFER GONZA´LEZCOLO´N, Member of Congress, PRAt Large. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, this bill—put together after eight public hearings, input from all Governors, all Members of Congress, and all Delegates, especially those who represent Texas, Florida, Louisiana, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and California—represents a fair and a compassionate treatment of all hurricane and fire victims. Like the first two emergency supplementals put together by our leadership, our committee, and Congress, we acted within days to help. I ask that we do it again this afternoon without delay. Get this $81 billion disaster package into the hands of the States, the territories, and the communities that continue to suffer. Let me associate myself with the remarks of our majority leader. Let’s get the money into those communities that have been suffering. That money is going to the Virgin Islands, it is going to Puerto Rico, and it is going to Florida, Texas, and California. There has been no discrimination at all. This bill has been put together with the cooperation of all the chairs and ranking members, and it deserves to be acted on promptly. People are suffering. Let’s get the money out the door to help them as we have done in the past on the first two supplementals. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of Division B of this bill, which has bipartisan, bicameral support of the leadership of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate. It includes H.R. 4460, the ‘‘Disaster Recovery Reform Act’’, and several other Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) bills that passed the House earlier this year. While there are many good provisions in Division B, I will focus my comments on a few provisions that I believe will have the most impact in making the United States a leader in disaster recovery. Under Division B, the Nation will be on the right track to build stronger and more resilient communities and it will encourage better behavior before and after disaster strikes. We know that for every dollar invested in mitigation to make our communities stronger before disaster strikes, the taxpayer saves $3 to $4 in future disaster costs. Section 2036 of this bill furthers the goal of investing in mitigation before disaster strikes by establishing a steady funding stream for FEMA’s Predisaster Mitigation (PDM) program. Under Section 2036, the President must provide a specific amount of additional funding from the Disaster Relief Fund for the PDM program. The specific amount of additional funding is equal to six percent of the estimated amount of disaster assistance provided for each major disaster. The President will then distribute these funds in accordance with existing law, with a certain amount provided to each State and the remainder made available through a competitive grant process. Section 2036 uses language similar to language in the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act) authorizing FEMA’s Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP), which is mandatory funding provided postdisaster with each disaster declaration. Although Section 2036 uses the term ‘‘may’’, the intent is that FEMA will set aside funds for the PDM program, just as they do for HMGP. We have had several bipartisan conversations with FEMA confirming that FEMA understands the intent of this section and will interpret the ‘‘may setaside’’ language included in section 2036 as mandatory. The mandatory funding for the PDM program from the Disaster Relief Fund required under this section will provide consistency to a program with a proven record of saving taxpayers money. In addition, section 2036 authorizes FEMA to withdraw and redistribute funds that remain unobligated three fiscal years after FEMA awarded the funds to the grantee. The intent of this provision is to provide FEMA with discretionary authority to move funding that is not being used to States and projects that will use it. However, FEMA is not required to withdraw these funds from grantees and shall make these decisions on a casebycase basis. For instance, a grantee may have commenced work on a project or is actively working on a project but the project is not at the point where funds need to be obligated. In this instance, we would not expect FEMA to withdraw the funds. In addition, while this section will apply to PDM funds awarded prior to enactment of this Division, the intent is to give grantees three fiscal years from the date of enactment of this Act to obligate these funds. Grantees with existing PDM funds are now on notice that they have three years to obligate these funds or at least be actively working on projects that will allow those funds to be obligated shortly thereafter. I have noted time and time again how nonsensical it is that the Federal Government pays to rebuild communities after a disaster to inadequate standards only to have those facilities destroyed again by a later disaster, with the Federal Government once again on the hook for the cost of rebuilding. Under this legislation, this nonsense will finally stop. Section 2037 requires communities to rebuild to the latest consensusbased, design standards and in a more resilient manner, thereby ensuring stronger, smarter facilities going forward. The cycle of repeatedly rebuilding and repairing disasterdamaged public infrastructure will end under this measure. Although FEMA must define ‘‘resilient’’ and ‘‘resiliency’’ pursuant to regulations within two years of the date of enactment of this Act, FEMA is required to adopt guidance to immediately implement the ‘‘resiliency’’ requirements of this legislation. The need for resilient construction has become even more apparent after the 2017 disaster season. FEMA must use this opportunity to invest taxpayer funds wisely while saving lives and reducing injuries. FEMA has the ability to ensure that the United 
States leads the way in disaster recovery and I urge FEMA to seize this moment. Accordingly, as FEMA works to develop the definition of ‘‘resilient’’ and ‘‘resiliency’’, the agency needs to ensure that it takes into account the extent to which the improved facilities: reduce deaths and injuries during and after a major disaster; sustain minimal damage allowing the facility to continue to provide the primary function and services of the facility during and after a natural hazard; prepare for and withstand all hazards that could result in a major disaster; and reduce the magnitude or duration of a disruption to the facility’s primary function and services to a facility. In addition, any ‘‘resilient’’ facility should be constructed: in consideration of current and future environmental conditions based upon the best available science, changes in demand, and extreme weather events; to reduce potential disruptions to the facility, including by building in operational redundancies, and increasing the ability of the facility to recover more rapidly; using techniques and materials that have the absorptive capacity, adaptive capacity, and recoverability to withstand a potentially disruptive event; to the maximum extent practicable, using durable and sustainable material; and to incorporate, to the maximum extent practicable, natural and naturebased measures and energy efficiency improvements. Currently, FEMA provides HMGP funds when a State receives a disaster declaration, but HMGP funds are not provided when a State receives a Fire Management Assistance Grant to respond to wildfires on nonFederal lands. Unfortunately, wildfires destroy the landscape often causing mudslides and flooding that then result in a disaster declaration. Under Division B, States will receive HMGP funds if they have received Fire Management Assistance Grants to respond to wildfires. With HMGP funds, States will be able to restore landscapes and vegetation destroyed by wildfires and make the land less susceptible to future mudslides and floods. This legislation also clarifies that wildfirerelated mitigation activities are eligible under both the PDM and HMGP programs. Together, these provisions will help prevent wildfires and related disasters and I commend our colleague from California (Mr. RUIZ) for his leadership on these issues. Division B also clarifies that earthquakerelated activities are eligible for mitigation assistance. The West Coast faces the most risk from multiple and extreme earthquakes, and Oregon is long overdue for an earthquake and tsunami on the Cascadia Subduction Zone. Yet, the United States’ earthquake early warning system lags behind those of other nations. Clarifying for grantees that mitigation funds are available for earthquakerelated activities will save lives and reduce injuries in a future disaster. Finally, important to the State of Oregon, section 2029 clarifies that for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), FEMA is not responsible for privately funded actions taken by private parties on private land. Under actions proposed by the National Marine Fisheries Service, the entire State of Oregon would become a critical habitat, seriously impeding economic development. The proposed requirements, are so onerous, the State of Oregon, which already has strict land use regulations, would have difficulty implementing them, as they violate federal and state property rights. This provision will help ensure that FEMA implements the NFIP in a manner that is consistent from statetostate and does not become a land use regulatory agency. I support all of these important provisions and urge their adoption. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 670, the previous question is ordered on the bill, as amended. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 10 of rule XX, the yeas and nays are ordered. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings are postponed. f 
DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY BLUE CAMPAIGN AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2017 
Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 1370. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New Jersey? There was no objection. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 670, I call up the bill (H.R. 1370) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to require the Secretary of Homeland Security to issue Department of Homeland Securitywide guidance and develop training programs as part of the Department of Homeland Security Blue Campaign, and for other purposes, with the Senate amendment thereto, and ask for its immediate consideration.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 670, the motion shall be debatable for 1 hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Appropriations. The gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN ) and the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. LOWEY ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to present the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 1370. This legislation keeps the government fully open, funds important national security priorities, and temporarily extends critical government programs like the Children’s Health Insurance Program, the National Flood Insurance Program, and section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Our duty to the American people is to keep them secure and to ensure they have access to the government programs and services they depend on. The House must pass this bill now, today. Without acting on this bill, existing government funding will expire tomorrow, and the government will shut down. This legislation provides a simple, clean extension of current funding levels through January of 2018. This additional time will allow House and Senate leadership to complete their negotiations on overall spending levels. Once that is determined, my committee will complete negotiations with the Senate on all 12 appropriations bills for the rest of fiscal year 2018. In the meantime, it is essential that Congress maintain government programs and services—for our Nation’s stability, the stability of our economy, and for the security and wellbeing of the American people. This bill also supports national security by providing an additional $4.7 billion in emergency funding to bolster missile defense, to protect against growing threats, and to repair damaged Navy ships. In addition, the bill also includes $2.1 billion in mandatory funding for the VA Choice Program. This funding will guarantee that our veterans continue to have access to the medical care they need and deserve. Along with important funding for our Armed Forces and veterans, this bill contains temporary extensions of several critical programs that millions of Americans rely on. These include the Children’s Health Insurance Program, the National Flood Insurance Program, and section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Mr. Speaker, before I close, again, I would like to thank the 12 Appropriations chairs, our 12 clerks, and the very professional staff of the Appropriations Committee for working overtime to bring this bill and others before the House today. We cannot delay on passing this critical legislation, funding the government, protecting our Nation, and extending essential programs that hardworking Americans rely on every day. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on the bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this epic failure of governing. Nearly 3 months into the fiscal year, the Republican majority is advancing 
its third temporary continuing resolution with no foreseeable path forward on enacting fullyear appropriations and no evident urgency to address priorities that are critical to American families and communities. Completely preoccupied with showering tax breaks on corporations and the wealthiest Americans, the majority has failed to clear the extremely low bar of charting a course to keep the government open and meet deadlines they have set for themselves. In short, the Republican majority has made a complete mess of the very basics of governing. Now they want Democrats to bail them out by carrying a bill that neglects our priorities. This continuing resolution should include the bipartisan Dream Act, protecting from deportation young people who were brought to this country as small children and only know the United States as home. But this bill tells those facing deportation that their plight is not our concern. It should include a bipartisan reauthorization of the Children’s Health Insurance Program, providing longterm certainty for 9 million children and families who depend on the program. Instead, this bill tells children and families their medical needs are not our priority. It should include an agreement to raise caps for defense and nondefense spending with parity so that appropriators can get to work on a fullyear spending package that keeps America secure and prosperous. Instead, the bill tries to make an end run around solely the defense cap by slipping in nearly $5 billion in new spending for the Pentagon. It should not clean up the mess the majority made triggering automatic reductions to Medicare because of their deficitbusting tax bill. The majority wants to pass this bill and go home for the holidays, somehow content with its performance on behalf of the Americans they represent. In every sense, this bill fails to live up to our responsibilities as legislators and as Representatives. Given these failures, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. b1600 Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN ), the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague, the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN , for his incredible and tenacious work to bring us this legislation. By the way, all 12 appropriations bills have already been passed by the House individually and sent to the Senate. A vote against the CR is a vote to shut down the government. It is that simple. Today is the day we keep the government operating. We are not going to take the irresponsible path of voting to shut it down. I stand here in support of the continuing resolution. This legislation before us today not only keeps the doors of the Federal Government open and the services to our constituents available, but also provides shortterm funding for the State Children’s Health Insurance Program, also known as CHIP. This program provides vital health coverage for approximately 9 million children nationwide. So, when my colleagues on other side vote ‘‘no,’’ know that they are also voting against these 9 million children who need access to this health insurance. While I am glad we have this short term funding, I, too, am disappointed to stand here today without Congress having completed its work to fully fund CHIP for the next 5 years. We did that in the House on a bipartisan basis. This bill also provides critical short term funding for community health centers. They are essential. In my district, 63 different facilities take care of men, women, and children in the community health center network. It takes care of teaching health center graduate medical education and special diabetes programs as well. So a ‘‘no’’ vote today is against all of those programs. It is worth noting yet again that the House passed a comprehensive bill, the CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act, in November. It was a bipartisan vote. It will fund the CHIP program for a full 5 years. Community health centers will be funded for 2 years, and the other public health programs will be funded for 2 years. It would also prevent billions of dollars of cuts to our safety net hospitals. Those cuts will be triggered in January because of inaction in the Senate. Unfortunately, our friends on the other side of the Capitol have yet to move our bill or reach full agreement on some different combination of offsets to pay for extending these important programs. This is disappointing since it means Congress has not yet been able to provide certainty to families across Oregon and the country who rely on these vital programs. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. HULTGREN ). The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute. Mr. WALDEN. We are well past the time in which we should have had this done. The Energy and Commerce Committee has acted. The U.S. House of Representatives has acted. The Senate Finance Committee has acted. But the full Senate has yet to do so. I know that Chairman HATCH and Ranking Member PALLONE believe this must be done as soon as possible. We have been working closely together, along with my fellow Oregonian, Senator RONWYDEN , to figure out how to get a bill to fund CHIP and public health extenders across the finish line. So, while we are frustrated we will not complete our work today, we are determined to continue to work with my colleagues to get this done early in January. I urge my colleagues to support the CR and these necessary funding extensions. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. MCCOLLUM ), the ranking member of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee. Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this continuing resolution. The Federal Government’s fiscal year started 3 months ago. The Republican Congress still hasn’t passed a full year of Federal spending. Rather than protecting our Nation and meeting the needs of the American people, we are now debating a third continuing resolution to kick the can into January. Republicans control this House, the Senate, and the White House, but, clearly, they do not take their responsibility to fund the Federal Government seriously. Frankly, they should be embarrassed. For the past 3 months, Democrats have sought to work with Republicans to secure a budget agreement and responsibly pass appropriations bills, but Republicans have been too busy to meet this basic responsibility. Instead, they have spent months working in secret on their deficitbusting tax scam. Let’s be clear: the Republican tax scam is part of this CR as well. The CR contains language to exempt the Republican’s lavish tax cuts for big corporations and billionaires from the statutory PayAsYouGo Act. Republicans passed their tax scam knowing it was fiscally irresponsible and that it would trigger cuts to Medicare, the Crime Victims Fund, and other vital programs, and trigger an increase in Federal student loans. Now they are asking Democrats to help bail them out. While I didn’t vote for the Republican tax scam and I am not going to paper over their mistakes so that President Trump can sign it into law, here is what I will do, Mr. Speaker. As the ranking member of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee, I know Republican appropriators are as frustrated I am. I want to work with them to find common ground and to responsibly fund our government. It is time for appropriators to do our jobs and for Republicans and Democrats to work together. It is time for us to get back to work and fund the Federal Government responsibly. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR ), the ranking member of the Energy and Water Subcommittee. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member LOWEY for yielding, and I rise in opposition to this continuing resolution that some might consider ridiculous. 
No matter how you look at it, Republicans have control of all of the reins of the Federal Government; yet we find ourselves, again, locked in an artificial crisis of their own creation on the third punt to try to run this government for another couple of weeks. First in September, then again 2 weeks ago, and now here again today, the government will be set on automatic pilot because President Trump and his fellow Republicans refuse to pass a real budget under regular order so the Appropriations Committee can get its work done within strict budget parameters. These last 3 months, Congress has been left to twiddle its thumbs while the list of unmet priorities for Americans has steadily grown. Most notably, let me address the Children’s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, that covers over 9 million children in our country and more than 220,000 in Ohio. In fact, that insurance program expired 81 days ago. It covers half the children in my district. How do you think it makes those families feel? What are they going to do after the end of March? Unfortunately, this spending bill only provides enough funding for the CHIP program through March 31, again kicking the can down the road. Let me mention, too, the budgets for community health centers, which also expired last September 30. They serve more than 25 million patients and are the Nation’s largest source of primary comprehensive care for people in need. Don’t they deserve full respect from this Congress for the lifegiving work they do? Mr. Speaker, I will close with this. Up to 10 million private pensions are at risk across our country through no fault of the workers. Congress must act. But where is the leadership? Our solution is the Butch Lewis Act, which ensures America’s private pensioners receive the benefits they earned. So whether it is helping our retirees or caring for our children, time and again Republicans are ignoring real middle class Americans. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Ohio an additional 15 seconds. Ms. KAPTUR. Yet, the Republicans had no problem finding trillions for billionaires who end up funding their campaigns, too. This prescription simply is bad medicine for America, and I ask my colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’ Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE), the chairman of the Veterans’ Affairs Committee. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the provision within this legislation that would authorize and appropriate $2.1 billion for the Veterans Choice Program. Choice was created by Congress in 2014, following a nationwide Department of Veterans Affairs access and accountability crisis. Make no mistake about it: Choice has certainly not been without its faults in the last 3 years; however, the program has also resulted in millions of veterans receiving care they otherwise would have had to wait longer or travel further for—or maybe not receive at all. Absent passage of this provision, the Choice Program is expected to run out of money in early 2018, which could jeopardize the care that veterans across the country are receiving in their communities. This is totally unacceptable. The committee has been working diligently to create a permanent care in the community program to replace and improve upon Choice. In fact, I was proud to introduce H.R. 4242, the VA Care in the Community Act, last month. That legislation was favorably reported out of my committee just this week, and I look forward to working with my colleagues on community care reform. In the meantime, we cannot allow the care our veterans receive in the community through the Choice Program to be jeopardized by lack of funding. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  a letter Secretary Shulkin sent me earlier this month. 
THESECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS , Washington, DC, December 12, 2017. Hon. DAVID P. R OE, M.D., Chairman, Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARMR. CHAIRMAN : I write to raise issues for your consideration regarding the financial status of the Veterans Choice Program (VCP), established by the Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act of 2014, Public Law 113–146, as amended (Choice Act). Current projections indicate that VCP could be unable to create new referrals or authorizations within several weeks. Without additional funding before the end of the year, there will be a dramatic impact on the ability of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to provide care to Veterans. As of December 7, 2017, VA has approximately $490 million in VCP funds remaining, once December obligations of approximately $300 million and reserve funding of approximately $300 million are accounted for. The average spend rate of VCP funds ranges from $200–$400 million per month, with the possibility that unexpected obligations would push this above and beyond the reserves. As a result, we believe we have 3 to 5 weeks of funds left, which could change based on Veteran utilization. Nearly 1.9 million unique Veterans have sought care through VCP since its implementation. VA has focused on improving VCP through streamlined business processes, contract modifications and implementation of statutory changes. Unless additional funds are provided, Veterans utilizing the current VCP will be less able to access timely health care as close to their homes as possible. The Veteran Coordinated Access & Rewarding Experiences (CARE) Act, proposed by VA to Congress, would satisfy the funding requirements if passed. The challenges of the transition from VCP to a new Community Care program should not be underestimated, and VA will need to take steps soon to responsibly prepare for the termination date. If no action is taken by Congress in the next 3 to 5 weeks, VA could have to discontinue authorizing VCP care and transition Veterans to VA or other community care programs. VA’s other community care programs will not have the capacity to handle all of the patients who will transition from VCP, and the wait time for appointments at VA facilities will rise if large numbers of Veterans return to VA to seek care. Taking these actions would have a number of negative consequences, including decreased access to care, damaged community partnerships and interrupted care continuity for Veterans. Should you have any questions, please have a member of your staff contact Mr. David Brant, Congressional Relations Officer. Sincerely, DAVID J. S HULKIN , M.D. 
Mr. ROE of Tennessee. In this letter, Secretary Shulkin explicitly stated: ‘‘Without additional funding before the end of the year, there will be a dramatic impact on the ability of the Department of Veterans Affairs to provide care to veterans.’’ A vote against the continuing resolution is a vote against funding medical care for our Nation’s heroes. The Secretary’s message is clear, Mr. Speaker. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting an additional $2.1 billion for the Choice Program. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. LEE), a member of the Appropriations Committee. Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding and for her tremendous leadership on so many issues as a ranking member. As a member of the Appropriations and Budget Committees, I rise in strong opposition to this continuing resolution, which really could be called the ‘‘Failure to Govern Resolution.’’ This bill, as my colleague from Ohio said, shamefully kicks the can down the road once again, this time until January 19. Why? Republicans have been too busy passing the greatest tax scam in history rather than responsibly funding the government. This reckless, shortterm resolution ignores our critical yearend priorities like passing a bipartisan, longterm reauthorization of the Children’s Health Insurance Program or a DACA program. Every day, 122, DACA recipients are losing their protections. They are afraid. They are fearful. There is so much anxiety. We should not do this today without protecting them. This continuing resolution does not honor the temporary protected status for immigrants. It does not raise the budget caps equally for defense and nondefense spending. Muchneeded funding for the opioid epidemic, community health centers, and our veterans is also not included. I could go on and on about the problems with the CR, but I just have to tell you that the reality is this bill, like the tax giveaway, underscores the majority’s complete lack of regard for everyday Americans and struggling families. 
Continuing resolutions leave the American people out on a limb, with no confidence in their Federal Government. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from California an additional 30 seconds. Ms. LEE. I guess we should not be surprised by this approach, since the playbook for this administration from day one has been, as Steve Bannon said early on, that their goal was deconstruction of the administrative state. That is exactly what is happening with this CR. This is unacceptable. By passing a shortterm spending bill that entirely neglects urgent and vital needs and underfunds job training, affordable housing, and education, we really are selling the American people short. Unfortunately, this is another effort to disregard the lives of millions of people. It is totally irresponsible, and it does nothing to help create jobs, better wages, or a better future for our children and their families. I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on this bill. We need to begin to try to do our job here. b1615 Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ ), the ranking member of the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Subcommittee. Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this continuing resolution, which is, yet again, a complete abdication of our responsibilities as Members of Congress. What we have before us today is evidence that the socalled Republican leadership simply cannot deliver on the promises they have made to the American people. Instead, this Congress has decided to continue taking the ludicrous approach of funding the government for just a few weeks at a time, while ignoring the pressing issues that demand our attention. Over the last few weeks, Republicans in this Congress have decided to focus only on pushing through legislation designed to further enrich giant corporations, while adding $1.5 trillion to the deficit. Yet, to the DREAMers who teach our children, care for our sick, and serve our Nation, Republicans continue to say: You just have to wait. For millions of our most vulnerable— young kids suffering from illness and debilitating disease, who are reliant on the Children’s Health Insurance Program—Republicans have made it clear their priorities lie elsewhere. And to those who have served our country with dignity and pride, the Republican majority has failed to provide urgently needed resources to address the dire shortfalls at the VA. Well, Mr. Speaker, the DREAMers cannot wait. The threat of deportation looms over these courageous individuals every single day. Sick children deserve our attention now. They should not be used as bargaining chips in this reckless debate. And our Nation’s veterans need to know we have got their backs without delay. We cannot deny them the healthcare that they have earned. Don’t tell me that we don’t have the funds to support those who need us the most, when this Congress just gave a handout to those who need it the least. This pathetic continuing resolution fails to address the needs of the people who sent us here. It doesn’t even come close. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting ‘‘no.’’ Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DELAURO ), the ranking member of the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Subcommittee. Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I strongly oppose this continuing resolution. Yet again we are punting one of our core obligations as Members of Congress: funding government programs. The Republican majority has failed to respond to the needs of the American people. They put services and investments that are critical to our families and our communities at risk: from apprenticeships to education for students with disabilities, child care, afterschool programs that help working families make ends meet, and financial aid for students attending college. We should be negotiating spending levels for 2018 for both defense and nondefense spending. We should have spent the last 2 months fulfilling our responsibility as legislators by writing bipartisan bills to fund programs that help the middle class and the vulnerable, support evidencebased scientific research, and help working people get the skills that they need to find good jobs with good wages. Instead, the Republican majority squandered the last 2 months focused on their tax scam, rewarding big corporations, millionaires, and billionaires who wrote the rules to make government work for them. Our Republican colleagues were their comrades in arms in rigging the game against the middle class. I am horrified by the majority’s decision to put the future of the Children’s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, in jeopardy: kids’ checkups, shots, prescriptions, dental and vision care, hospital care, and the list goes on. States are beginning to cut children off because of the majority’s delay—my own State of Connecticut. The hardworking families that depend on CHIP deserve to know that it will be there for their children for the long term. How can the majority go on vacation while millions of children worry about losing their health insurance? This is a disgrace. This bill also cuts $750 million from the Prevention and Public Health Fund, which supports programs such as heart disease and stroke prevention, diabetes prevention, immunization and vaccination programs. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Connecticut. Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, it was only yesterday that our Republican colleagues voted to spend $1.5 trillion of taxpayers’ money on tax cuts for millionaires. Eightythree percent of the tax cuts go to 1 percent of the people in this Nation. Instead, they are cutting nearly $1 billion from public health programs that protect them and their family. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject this continuing resolution because it fails to meet the obligations that we are entrusted with, the moral responsibility that we have to the American people. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER ), the Democratic whip. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mrs. LOWEY for yielding. Here we are again, Mr. Speaker. Two weeks ago, the Republican majority asked for another 2 weeks to write an appropriations package to fund the government, yet now they are asking to kick the can down the road one more time. We all knew that those 2 weeks were a pretense for getting the votes to pass their tax bill. We didn’t make any progress on a bipartisan appropriations bill. Before that, Republicans asked for an additional 12 weeks in September. We all voted to give that 12 weeks. All of us know exactly why the can keeps being kicked farther and farther down the road. It is because the majority cannot muster a majority of their own Members to support bipartisan funding bills. Because the governing party, which controls the House, the Senate, and the White House, has not been able to govern. Senate Republican Whip JOHN CORNYN said on Sunday: ‘‘The can always seems to be kicked down the road.’’ Yet here we are again with Republicans doing exactly that. Mr. Speaker, let’s call the CR for what it is: a chaotic retreat from rational, regular, and fiscal responsibility. We have alongside it a supplemental funding bill that provides some 
additional emergency relief to those affected by natural disasters, but it ought to do more, in my opinion, to help those in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. It has been 3 months since Hurricanes Irma and Maria devastated Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, and since Hurricane Harvey visited so much water on Houston. Many still do not have electricity or running water in Puerto Rico. These are our fellow Americans. We owe it to them and to ourselves to help them in their time of need. Mr. Speaker, Congress can do better, and it should do better. We should act in a bipartisan way. I was on the Appropriations Committee as an active member for 23 years. I was a member of the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Subcommittee. I told people that you could take the 13 of us—we were eight Democrats and five Republicans—and thrown us up in the air, we would have come down in random seats, had a markup, and you would have been hardpressed to identify the Democrat or the Republican, because we believed our responsibility was to fund the priorities of this country. Now, I know that we passed 12 bills. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from Maryland. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, the Appropriations Committee used to be an extraordinarily bipartisan committee where we worked together, not on a partisan basis, but on a basis of trying to determine which priorities were important for our country, what funds were needed so that agencies could operate in an effective way. That, unfortunately, is not happening the way it did. So, Mr. Speaker, I urge my Republican friends, who control this House, and all the levers of government, to work with Democrats on making sure that all those who need emergency disaster relief, as well as those who need funds to operate their government agencies in a way that serves America best—I urge us to work together toward that end. I urge us because nobody believes these CRs are good policy, but they, unfortunately, are becoming regular, if not regular order. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, once again, this is an epic failure of governing. How many more times will we have to pass a continuing resolution, which not only denies certainty to men and women in uniform and all Federal employees, but is an inefficient waste of taxpayer dollars? How many more times would the majority stumble from crisis to crisis, narrowly averting a shutdown? It is long past time that the majority work with Democrats to increase the budget caps and write fullyear spending bills. The Appropriations Committee stands ready to do our job. I hope that Republican leadership finally does its job and agrees to permit reasonable spending bills that invest in America’s future. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ to keep the government open for business, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. ROYBALALLARD. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this Continuing Resolution because we can’t keep kicking the can down the road, and that is all this CR will do. Since Republicans took control of the House in 2011, their approach to governing has been to pass short term extensions and Continuing Resolutions that merely delay the hard work of making decisions on the big issues facing our country. Eventually, after not completing their work on time, Republicans regularly force through an extension in order to deal with another crisis of their own making. This has happened over . . . and over . . . and over. And here we go again. We passed a CR in September and another one two weeks ago, and now we are being asked to give Republicans even more time to get the job done. Governing by repeated CRs means federal agencies can’t plan for the future or begin new initiatives. This undermines our national security; endangers our homeland security, restricts investments in groundbreaking research to treat and cure diseases, and threatens the accuracy of the next decennial Census. This repeated inaction means we must now worry about keeping our government open at the same time we are trying to address several other large national challenges. For example, we are about to hit the nation’s debt limit; Americans need help recovering from the hurricanes that hit Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Florida, and Texas and the wildfires that have ravaged California; people who depend on community health centers and the Children’s Health Insurance Program are about to lose their healthcare; and we must protect the hundreds of thousands of Dreamers whose immigration status has been thrown into question. President Trump himself created this particular crisis for the millions of Dreamers living in this country. These young men and women are American in every way but their citizenship, and due to the President’s actions, nearly 13 thousand of them have lost their DACA protections, an average of 122 per day. Tens of thousands more Dreamers will eventually lose their jobs and their protection against deportation if we do not take action. As the author of the Dream Act in the House, I believe it is inhumane to force Dreamers to live in fear and uncertainty for longer than absolutely necessary. We must act now. We can’t afford to wait until the last minute for a solution, as Republicans have done so often while running Congress. We cannot keep kicking the can down the road. I oppose this CR and urge my colleagues to vote no so we can get the job done now. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the continuing resolution before us today. First, I’d like to acknowledge the Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN . Under his leadership, the Committee reported, and the whole House considered and passed, all twelve appropriations bills for fiscal year 2018. That doesn’t happen very often anymore, and the fact that we did it this year is a credit to our Chairman. We’ve heard complaints about considering another CR rather than full appropriations bills. And I agree that continuing resolutions aren’t an ideal solution to funding our government. Ideally, all twelve appropriations bills would be enacted by October 1st. That process provides the Congress with its best opportunity to set priorities across government programs, and it provides the most stability for agencies to carry out those programs in an efficient and effective manner. But sometimes we need more time to complete those negotiations. For example, in 2010, the Democrats controlled both the House, the Senate, and the White House. Guess what happened when they hadn’t completed the appropriations process on time? They passed a CR until the end of September. When they hadn’t completed their work yet, they passed another CR until December 2nd. When they hadn’t completed their work—they passed another CR until December 22. Then, when we took the majority, we ended up finishing the appropriations process. So while CR’s aren’t ideal, supporting a CR to keep our government functioning is the only responsible vote today—for national security, for our economy, and for the general welfare of the American people. As Chairman of the Energy and Water subcommittee, I am very familiar with the positive impacts the federal government has in each of these areas—whether it’s the Department of Energy maintaining our nuclear weapons stockpile, the Corps of Engineers dredging our ports and waterways so goods and materials can move freely, or the Bureau of Reclamation providing tens of millions of people with water. We must avoid disruptions to these vital activities by passing the continuing resolution before us today and then working towards completing our work on final appropriations bills as quickly as possible. Will we get all our work done by the end of this next CR? I don’t know. But one thing I can guarantee is that we will not get it done by tomorrow, and a vote against this resolution is a vote to shut down the government. I urge my colleagues to vote yes on the continuing resolution. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, Republicans have moved on from doing nothing to help middleclass America, to actively undoing everything America’s middle class relies on. First, they cut taxes for corporations and the wealthy, instead of lifting up the middle class. And they did it twice. Now they’re kicking the can down the road while millions of Americans suffer through the holidays. They’ve left millions of kids in the lurch for months by letting the Children’s Health Insurance Program expire instead of protecting sick children in need of care. They have woefully underfunded recovery efforts in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Florida and Texas instead of guaranteeing clean water and electricity to our fellow Americans. And the icing on the cake: Republicans would leave 800,000 DREAMers— 
Americans in every way but on paper—wondering whether their Christmas gift will be deportation papers. I cannot support Republicans’ heartlessness. I cannot support Republicans’ recklessness. I cannot support this bill without a fix for DREAMers. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak about H.R. 1370, ‘‘Department of Homeland Security Blue Campaign Authorization Act of 2017’’ [Further Continuing Resolution]. This resolution is an imperfect vehicle for appropriations for FY 2018, because it does not reflect an effort to include bipartisan solutions to remaining Democratic priorities. H.R. 1370 not only fails to address remaining unsolved issues, but it also fails to fund the government through the end of FY 2018. Republicans have not consulted Democrats on anything that is included in this yearend legislation, accordingly the majority should not expect Democrats to vote on a bill that does not include the following priorities: A bipartisan, longterm reauthorization of the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP): CHIP, which provides health coverage to 9 million children, expired nearly three months ago. Republicans have only put forward legislation that cuts other critical health programs, an unacceptable tradeoff. States have already begun taking steps to shut down their CHIP programs, and I will not vote for a Continuing Resolution (CR) that prevents children from obtaining health coverage. Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program: According to a report by the Center for American Progress, 122 DREAMers are losing their protection every single day that Congress fails to act. Disaster aid: My district—Houston, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands are shortchanged in the supplemental proposed by the majority. Among other glaring omissions, the Republican supplemental fails to include funding for their Medicaid programs, which are facing unprecedented demands following these ruinous hurricanes. An agreement to lift the Budget Control Act (BCA) spending caps: In the three months since a CR was passed in September, Republicans have not worked on a budget agreement that ensures Congress can adequately fund defense and nondefense priorities and adhere to the principle of parity between defense and nondefense spending. H.R. 1370 would provide $4.5 billion in emergency funding for the Department of Defense, as requested by the Trump administration on November 6. Most of that money is allocated for missile defense programs primarily targeting North Korea, an area that President Trump has failed to approach diplomatically and instead, has resorted to inflammatory threats, tweets, and other nonpresidential approaches typical of this administration. In contrast, H.R. 1370 would provide a mere fourweek extension of current funding for domestic needs. This continuing resolution would force both parties to revisit the domestic programs in January. Mr. Speaker, I will not accept this scheme and I highlight the importance of parity between defense and domestic programs in order to provide adequate funds for veterans’ health, a pension bailout, opioidfighting programs, and medical research. Another major concern of this bill includes the unrevised extension of government surveillance powers; Congress has yet to agree on a proper revision of Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Section 702 of FISA was intended to be revised this month; however, the majority has failed to address that issue, adding one more unresolved priority to the list of neglected legislation. Mr. Speaker, I am disappointed that we have again been placed in the position of having to fund the government through the device of a continuing resolution rather than through the normal appropriations process of considering and voting on separate spending bills usually reported by the Committee on Appropriations. The reason for this last minute resolution is due to the Republican leadership being solely focused on cutting taxes on the wealthy rather than coming up with a plan to keep the government open and serving its citizens. Republicans control the House, Senate, and the White House—they should have the votes to pass a CR on their own if they refuse to compromise with Democrats. The government shutdown of 2013, which was manufactured by the Republican majority lasted 16 days and cost taxpayers $24 billion. The enormous harm and disruption of the lives of federal employees and the people they serve, however, was irreparable. As I stated, Mr. Speaker, this Continuing Resolution is not perfect and it only funds the government until January 19, 2018. As seasoned Members of Congress, we have been in this challenging position before. But working together in a spirit of goodwill, bipartisanship, and realism, I believe we can reach a longterm agreement that will avert a shutdown of government operations and the disruption a shutdown causes to the lives of millions of Americans who depend upon federal programs to do their jobs, educate their kids, care for their parents, and contribute to their communities. Our constituents look to the Congress and the President to make responsible choices and decisions to keep the nation safe, the economy prosperous, and to make necessary and prudent investments in education, healthcare and research, transportation and infrastructure, economic development, science, the arts and humanities, and the environment. This is, after all, just another way of saying that the American people expect their leaders in Washington be guided by the Constitution’s Preamble and pursue policies and provide the resources that will: 
establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty. 
The funding priorities that have been floated by the Trump Administration fail this essential test of leadership because they are irresponsible, impracticable, unrealistic, and, in many respects, insensitive or indifferent to the deleterious impact they will have on the lives of real people living in the real world. They do not command majority support in the Congress or of the public. To win such support, I believe that it is essential that any subsequent continuing resolution or omnibus appropriations bill achieves the following goals and objectives: ‘‘To establish justice’’ and ‘‘To promote the general welfare’’: 1. Full funding for the U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division and the Department of Education Office of Civil Rights so that they have funds needed to enforce laws protecting civil rights, voting rights, and prosecuting hate crimes. 2. Fully funds community development block grants and low income housing programs in urban and rural communities. 3. Fully funds the Legal Services Corporation so that working and lowincome persons who lack an army of lobbyists to represent them in Washington will at least have the assistance of counsel to defend their legal rights in courts of law. 4. Fully funds programs providing food assistance to housebound seniors, such as Meals on Wheels. 5. Fully funds programs that provide students from low and moderateincome families access to affordable access to higher education and provides students with special needs the support needed to receive the free appropriate public education (FAPE) in the least restrictive environment (LRE) guaranteed by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA Act). 6. Fully funds before and after school programs and other student enrichment programs that help students succeed. 7. Fully funds programs that make federal housing safer through energy efficient heating and cooling systems. 8. Preserves tax credit programs that help revitalize low income communities. 9. Fully funds the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Energy programs developing the next generation of clean energy and transportation technologies. ‘‘Provide for the common defense’’: 1. Provides robust funding for the Department of State and USAID to advance national security interests in places like Iraq and Afghanistan and to end violent conflicts in trouble spots which could threaten the security interests of the United States. 2. Provides adequate funding for United Nations peacekeeping missions throughout the world and distribution of food aid to people in developing and famine stricken countries, such as South Sudan, Somalia, Yemen, and Nigeria. ‘‘To ensure domestic tranquility’’: 1. Fully funds costsharing reduction subsidies, or CSRs, to compensate insurers for reducing deductibles and outofpocket maximums for lowincome customers on the Affordable Care Act exchanges. 2. Protects the adequacy, solvency, and integrity of the Medicare and Medicaid programs, which provide health sustaining support for 70 million Americans. 3. Fully funds the National Institutes of Health research programs so that patient access to lifesaving treatments is not delayed. 4. Does not convert funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention into block grants which would hindering the nation’s ability to respond swiftly and effectively to public health crises like Ebola, Zika, and HIV/AIDS. Mr. Speaker, I believe that if all members of the House and Senate work together, we can reach agreement on an appropriate budget framework that that invests in the American 
people, preserves our national security, and keeps faith with the values that have served our nation well and made the United States the leading nation on earth. The SPEAKER pro tempore.

b1715 DECLARING NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO UNUSUAL AND EXTRAORDINARY THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY, FOREIGN POLICY, AND ECONOMY OF THE UNITED STATES—MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (H. DOC. NO. 115–83) The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following message from the President of the United States; which was read and, together with the accompanying papers, referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on the Judiciary and ordered to be printed: To the Congress of the United States: Pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, as amended (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), I hereby report that I have issued the enclosed Executive Order (the ‘‘order’’) declaring a national emergency with respect to the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States posed by serious human rights abuse and corruption around the world. In addition to taking action under IEEPA, the order implements the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act (PublicLaw 114–328) (the ‘‘Act’’) and delegates certain of its authorities. The order blocks the property and interests in property of persons listed in the Annex to the order. It also blocks the property and interests in property of any foreign person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General: (1) to be responsible for or complicit in, or to have directly or indirectly engaged in, serious human rights abuse; (2) to be a current or former government official, or a person acting for or on behalf of such an official, who is responsible for or complicit in, or has directly or indirectly engaged in: (a) corruption, including the misappropriation of state assets, the expropriation of private assets for personal gain, corruption related to government contracts or the extraction of natural resources, or bribery; or (b) the transfer or the facilitation of the transfer of the proceeds of corruption; (3) to be or have been a leader or official of: (a) an entity, including any government entity, that has engaged in, or whose members have engaged in, any of the activities described in (1), (2)(a), or (2)(b) above relating to the leader’s or official’s tenure; or (b) an entity whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to the order as a result of activities related to the leader’s or the official’s tenure; or (4) to have attempted to engage in any of the activities described in (1), (2)(a), or (2)(b) above. The order also blocks any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General: (5) to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of: (a) any activity described in (1), (2)(a), or (2) (b) above that is conducted by a foreign person; (b) any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to the order; or (c) any entity described in (3)(a) above where the activity is conducted by a foreign person; (6) to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to the order; or (7) to have attempted to engage in any of the activities described in (5) or (6) above. In addition, the order suspends entry into the United States of any alien listed in the Annex or determined to meet one or more of the criteria above. I have delegated to the Secretary of the Treasury the authority, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to take such actions, including adopting rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA and the Act, as may be necessary to implement the order and relevant provisions of the Act. I have delegated to the Secretary of State the authority to take such actions, including adopting rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA and the Act, as may be necessary to implement the provisions of the order and the Act suspending entry into the United States of certain aliens. All executive departments and agencies are directed to take all appropriate measures within their authority to implement the order. DONALD J. T RUMP .THEWHITE HOUSE , December 20, 2017. 
CHIP IS NOT A BARGAINING CHIP (Mr. MEEHAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call on my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle to work together to pass the longterm extension of the Children’s Health Insurance Program. 178,000 Pennsylvania children rely on CHIP to get their healthcare, thousands of them in my own district. It is a bipartisan program, and for decades it has continued to earn bipartisan support. The House did its job last month, passing a 5year extension of the program, and I am grateful for Chairman WALDEN and his leadership and support for CHIP. But just a few minutes ago, the House passed an extension through March, and that is good, but it is not good enough. Unless the House and Senate can reach a real agreement, Pennsylvanians and their children will again face the prospect of losing their care, and it isn’t right to jeopardize kids in the name of partisan bickering. We have done a lot on the agenda this week: tax reform for the middle class, keeping the government open, important tasks. But CHIP is important, too, and I say to my friends on both sides of the aisle: Don’t let this become a bargaining chip. Get it done. 
CALIFORNIA IS ABLAZE (Mr. RUIZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, right now, my home State of California is ablaze, and the communities of Idyllwild, Anza, and Mountain Center in my district are still bruised from the 2013 wildfires and are on high alert for the next fire. Today, we passed my bill and delivered a win for our firefighters and victims of fires by increasing Federal funding to recover, rebuild, prevent future fires, and keep communities safe. The 2013 Mountain Fire in my district burned over 27,000 acres, destroyed homes, and cost over $25 million. I worked with Cal Fire, Idyllwild Fire Protection District, and Mountain Communities Fire Safe Council to author the bipartisan Wildfire Prevention Act, which will deliver tens of millions of dollars to recover, rebuild, prevent future fires, and keep our communities safe. This bill puts people above partisanship and solutions above ideology to improve the lives of the people we serve. It makes government work for the people. Thank you to these incredible local partners for working with me to deliver this pragmatic solution for the district and for the community. 
TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I am grateful that President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans are delivering on the first meaningful tax cuts in a generation. These tax cuts are in the tradition of Ronald Reagan, allowing American families to keep more of their hard earned paychecks and creating jobs. Over 80 percent of hardworking American families will keep more of their own money. As early as February, American families will see more of their own money revealed in their paychecks. Additionally, by lowering the corporate tax to 21 percent, American businesses will become more competitive overseas and jobs will be created, such as Nephron Pharmaceuticals, led by Lou and Bill Kennedy of Cayce. I am grateful for the success of Speaker PAUL RYAN, Chairman K EVIN BRADY , and all House Republicans in delivering tax cuts for American families. In the words of the great President Ronald Reagan: ‘‘Whenever we lower our tax rates, our entire Nation is better off.’’ In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. I want to thank Ambassador Nikki Haley for standing tall with President Donald Trump for recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. God Bless Guatemala, courageously led by President Jimmy Morales, for being a friend of America today in the United Nations. 
IMPORTANCE OF CULTURAL STUDIES (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, our public schools and public universities are essential for economic growth and educating future generations. But knowledge alone is not enough. Our Nation’s future depends on innovative ideas, and innovative ideas require diverse people working together. In the public schools and public universities across the country, educators are helping foster diverse ideas through cultural studies. One such educator, Dr. Antoinette EllisWilliams of New Jersey City University, has used poetry, film, scholarship, and service as a way to help young people explore issues that affect women and minorities. She has spent her career helping public university students understand the experiences of marginalized communities in the United States. Mr. Speaker, I commend Dr. Ellis Williams and cultural studies educators like her for helping future leaders develop the knowledge and wisdom to work together for a better future. She has been an asset to educating young people in the State of New Jersey for years, and I commend her. RECOGNIZING CONGRESSIONAL APP CHALLENGE WINNER FROM ARKANSAS’ SECOND CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT (Mr. HILL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Congressional App Challenge winner from Arkansas’ Second Congressional District, Anne Li. Currently a sophomore at Central High School in Little Rock, Anne aspires to major in computer engineering and has the goal of pursuing a career in programming. STEM education is education for the future, and having serious skills in computer programming and coding open up tremendous opportunities for our youth. It gives them the skills to compete in a 21st century job market as well as the skills to act on their imagination and engage in their entrepreneurial exploration. I wish Anne the very best as she continues her studies at Central High School and beyond in this critical field. As a member of the Congressional STEM Education Caucus and the dad of a STEM student at the university, I want to continue to support the growth of STEM education throughout Arkansas and America. f 
SAVE NET NEUTRALITY (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, last week the FCC abdicated its responsibility to serve the public interest and put at risk the free and open internet that we have all come to depend on when its three Republican commissioners voted to repeal the Obamaera net neutrality protection. Net neutrality keeps access to the internet equal for everyone. It protects free speech. It protects equal access to the marketplace of ideas. It has been the fundamental principle underpinning the massive innovation and opportunity that the internet has unleashed. But that is all at risk now. Fortunately, Congress has a say. I am proud to support Congressman MIKEDOYLE ’s resolution to overturn the FCC’s decision and restore our net neutrality protections. I also believe the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee should investigate the reports and allegations of fraudulent public comments. Repealing net neutrality will inhibit innovation, stifle competition, and threaten free speech. It is time for Congress to overturn this decision. 
HONORING AMY WRIGHT, 2017 CNN HERO OF THE YEAR (Mr. ROUZER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Amy Wright, the cofounder of Bitty & Beau’s Coffee Shop in Wilmington, North Carolina, on being named CNN Hero of the Year. When Amy and her husband, Ben, found out that 70 percent of adults living with disabilities do not have jobs, they opened the doors of Bitty & Beau’s in January 2016 with the goal of providing these worthy individuals the opportunity to interact, contribute, grow, and succeed in the workplace. As those in Wilmington know, Bitty & Beau’s is more than just a place to grab coffee. It is a warm, inclusive environment with exceptional customer service. Named after their two children who have Down syndrome, the coffee shop employs 40 exceptional individuals with disabilities. Congratulations to Amy on this very special honor. Her and Ben’s contribution to our community and our fellow man is truly remarkable and an inspiration for us all. 
HONORING KEVIN LYNCH (Mr. MESSER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MESSER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a dear friend, Kevin Lynch, who passed away following a 5 year battle with cancer just this week. Kevin was a great Hoosier, a public servant, a tremendous leader, and a tireless advocate in advancing southeastern Indiana. He served as a Dearborn County commissioner and as the president of the OhioKentuckyIndiana Regional Council of Governments. Kevin was a giant Reds fan and a loyal friend, with a positive spirit, quick with a smile, and an encouraging word. Kevin served Lawrenceburg and Dearborn County with pride, but his most important priority was his family. He was the loving husband to Mary Jo—‘‘Joey’’—for 27 years and the proud father of Michael. Mr. Speaker, my thoughts and prayers are with the entire Lynch family and all those who knew Kevin well. Congratulations to my good friend Kevin on a tremendous life well done. Godspeed my friend. 
b1730 HONORING MR. SAM POLLAK (Mr. FASO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. FASO. Mr. Speaker, it is with great respect that I rise today to recognize the distinguished career of Mr. Sam Pollak on the occasion of his retirement. Mr. Pollak is retiring after 20 years of dedicated service to the Oneonta and Otsego County community as editor of the Oneonta Daily Star. Having worked for decades in newsrooms throughout the Nation, Mr. Pollak brought many years of experience and a proactive leadership to The Daily Star. I thank Mr. Pollak for his commitment to the people of the State of New York, and I wish him and his wife, Julie, every happiness as they embark upon this new chapter in life. f 
TAX CUTS (Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in light of the passage of oncein alifetime, onceinageneration tax relief for millions of middleincome families, including the vast majority in my district. Some, however, are not satisfied with cutting taxes for every income level and are unnerved at the thought of seeing more money in their own monthly paycheck. I am here to tell those people today that there is a very simple solution to their problem. As you can see here—outlined on page 92 of the IRS handbook, those individuals who feel right now that they are undertaxed and want to pay more of their income to the U.S. Government can do exactly that. When filing their income tax return, one can simply include a check payable to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service. The best part is they can help pay down the debt without raising taxes on everyone else—America’s hardworking families who deserve a tax break. So just a reminder, no one is stopping those who are feeling undertaxed from paying as much additional money to the government that they would like. I am sure Uncle Sam would appreciate the Christmas present. So don’t complain about what your neighbor is paying. If you are feeling guilty about it, when you have the opportunity, feel free. Send it in. 
UNITED NATIONS JERUSALEM VOTE (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express deep disappointment in the United Nations General Assembly Resolution A/ES–10/L.22 and state my serious concern over the anti American and antiSemitic behaviors of the United Nations. Today, the United Nations continues its ugly legacy of singling out Israel for condemnation. According to the NGO, UN Watch, 86 percent of the U.N. General Assembly resolutions criticizing countries between 2012 and 2015 have targeted Israel. It is a sad and confounding sight to watch Syria, North Korea, Cuba, and other human rights abusers degrade our ally, Israel, and attempt to nullify a decision made by the United States regarding our own Embassy. I applaud Ambassador Haley for her resolute remarks and strength of spirit as she stood against rogue regimes for democratic values and American interests. I look forward to working with the administration and my colleagues in Congress to reassess our foreign aid commitments and realign them with our values and our strategic interests. f 
44 YEARS OF HOME RULE FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor this evening to commemorate 44 years of home rule. The Home Rule Act was signed by President Richard Nixon on Christmas Eve 44 years ago after the Home Rule Act was passed by a bipartisan vote. Although it was a Democratic Congress, I think it is worth noting what President Nixon said in his signing speech. I am going to quote a few of his sentences: ‘‘As a longtime supporter of selfgovernment for the District of Columbia, I am pleased to sign into law a measure which is of historic significance for the citizens of our Nation’s Capital. I first voted for home rule as a Member of the House of Representatives in 1948, and I have endorsed the enactment of home rule legislation during both my terms as President.’’ Then he went on to say: ‘‘It is particularly appropriate to assure those persons who live in our Capital City rights the privileges which have long been enjoyed by most of their countrymen.’’ The bill enjoyed bipartisan support throughout those congressional deliberations. Mr. Speaker, surely we can get back to that moment. The District of Columbia is proud and pleased that it has been steeped in American history ever since the site of the Nation’s Capital was chosen by George Washington himself. We are proud to be not only hometown D.C., but the Capital of our country. So this evening, I want to speak about those two roles and about the role of Congress as we move past December 24, 44 years ago—1973—to today, when D.C. residents have every reason to believe that our country is ready and overdue for D.C. statehood itself. Now, my Republican colleagues understand fully our role as the Nation’s Capital. They understand it because they welcome their own constituents, 
the tourists who come here. There are something upwards of almost 20 million. Many of them come to their own congressperson’s offices first. But Republicans often dissolve the District’s role into their role without making the appropriate distinction. Now, I appreciate it is not easy to understand a jurisdiction that has a double identity, a hometown identity and a Capital identity. No, we are not schizophrenic here. So let’s discuss this evening what this means. I want to discuss it in part because the inevitable turnover in the Congress means that I should come to the floor and explain this dilemma of our creation periodically. The first thing we want to do is to avoid the slander that the Framers of our Constitution, the Founders of our country, meant to create a Capital City whose residents were not the equals of residents everywhere in the country, because if that had been the case, you wouldn’t have had the Capital in the first place. The Capital was created from two jurisdictions, Maryland and Virginia, where residents had the right to vote and where they had every single right of American citizens. Those two States were convinced to give the territory that is now the District of Columbia for the Nation’s Capital. They were not about to give up their votes in the Capital and did not. Isn’t it interesting, during the transition period, the Representatives from Maryland and Virginia continued to vote as they always had and continued to be recognized in their own jurisdictions, all the while, for a 10year period, when the land was, in fact, being transferred to become what is now the District of Columbia? The relationship that the District has to the Federal Government, to the Congress of the United States, is an accident of history. It is an anachronistic accident that you would have thought would have been put aside within a few years after the District became the Nation’s Capital in 1801. During the Revolutionary War when the Capital was Philadelphia, Revolutionary War soldiers marched on the Capitol, then in Philadelphia. They wanted their pensions, and they wanted funding. When the Founders saw these men marching on their Capitol, confusion reigned. Whom to turn to bring order? Who was going to protect the Capitol? Was it Philadelphia? Was it Pennsylvania? There certainly weren’t any Federal police as yet. So what developed was fear that the Capital might find itself with that dilemma wherever it was located. Of course, that is not the case. The District is protected by 31 Federal police forces, and the D.C. National Guard and from the Capitol Police to the Park Police. I won’t even name them all, there are so many of them. That is not to mention, and I already have said, of course, the National Guard, and if necessary, the Armed Forces of the United States. Remember, we are talking about a Federal Government in formation. We can understand that mistake then. What we cannot abide is that mistake being part of the denial to American citizens the same rights that others enjoy. Protection of the Federal sector is certainly not an issue, or the Federal sector and the Capital itself, more than two centuries later, is not an issue. But what should also not be an issue is that anybody, any resident, any American, would pay taxes and not be represented on this floor and in the Senate. As I stand here this evening, I represent almost 700,000 American citizens who have been put precisely in that position though—and this is a number to be remembered—they are number one per capita—number one—in taxes paid to support the Government of the United States. Thus, one of the oldest U.S. jurisdictions, the District of Columbia, is the most—indeed, the only—unequal jurisdiction, that pays taxes without full representation. To be sure, I vote in committee, and everybody knows that in the committees is where the primary work is done. But imagine the insult to the people I represent who pay huge taxes—$12,000 per person every year—that matters come up on this floor including matters affecting them, and nobody whom they have voted for can represent them on this floor. The D.C. budget was just in that continuing resolution that passed. What is it doing over here? Nobody in Congress looked at the D.C. budget. Nobody in this body except me would know what to do with the D.C. budget. But it has to come here to be passed along with the Federal budget. This is form without substance, Mr. Speaker. The sole reason that the D.C. budget comes here is for Members to try to overturn some of D.C.’s laws that they happen to disagree with. But, in a Federal Union, you can pass your laws. I don’t like your laws, but you can’t do anything about my laws—except if it is the District of Columbia. So I think I ought to call the roll on what the District has to abide from Members of this body and the Senate and why, on this 44th anniversary of the Home Rule Act, the District of Columbia is seeking to become the 51st State. Let’s take guns. Senator MARCO  RUBIO from Florida and Representative TOMGARRETT from Virginia have a bill to eliminate all the District’s gun laws. b1745 It hasn’t passed, and most of the bills I will speak of are pending but won’t pass, because I have to spend a good deal of my time not only working affirmatively for what the District of Columbia wants, but for keeping bills like this from being passed. Imagine your Nation’s Capital as a city where anybody can have a gun. The most controversial figures in the world come to your Nation’s Capital. They eat in our restaurants. They stroll in our streets. You sometimes see that police stop traffic to let their cars pass in the street. We keep this City as safe as we can for ourselves, the 700,000 or so who live here, but also for the millions of people who come to do business or to have leisure or to see their iconic monuments. Representative TOM MASSIE from Kentucky has introduced a bill. We were able to keep it from being passed. But imagine this bill that would say that the District of Columbia had to recognize any and every concealed carry permit as long as you had it from another State. Some States have very strong concealed carry requirements. Others are very lax. Whatever your State has, just bring it into the District of Columbia. Mind you, this body, this Congress, my Republican colleagues have seen to it that you can’t bring a gun into this Chamber. They want to be protected here, but they don’t want to protect even their own constituents in the streets of the District of Columbia and in the hotels and restaurants of the District of Columbia. Senator TEDCRUZ from Texas and Representative MARK MEADOWS of North Carolina have introduced a bill that would require the District of Columbia to use its own funds to send children to private schools. All you have to do is come and ask the District for it. There have been bills on this floor to allow private school vouchers—none of them have ever passed—but here come two Members wanting the District to give our local funds to anybody who wants to go to a private school. Are you joking? I am standing here to say that will never pass as long as I have anything to do with it. Senator JAMES LANKFORD from Oklahoma and Representative BRAD WENSTRUP from Ohio have introduced a bill to wipe out the District’s death with dignity law. That bill was actually passed in committee. It didn’t get to the floor I think because there are six States that have such laws and two of them are States of our Republican leadership. This is a controversial bill, but other States have similar laws. It allows people to take their own lives if they follow a very strict protocol. You don’t like it here? Well, you don’t live here. You don’t pay taxes here. President Trump’s budget also had this provision. Again, these are pending, and I am telling you that most of them will not pass. But that is because I have had to fight them tooth and nail to keep them from passing. That is unfair to the District and it is an unfair use of my time. The Local Budget Autonomy Act that passed by 83 percent of the voters in the District of Columbia to keep our own local funds—we raise almost $8 billion on our own—from coming here for 
no purpose except to attach amendments to overturn our laws. The Local Budget Autonomy Act still stands, but Congress has continued to appropriate the budget. ‘‘Appropriate’’ means simply pass it without looking at it, when it comes to the District of Columbia. Congress has not repealed the Local Budget Autonomy Act. I will stand firm to keep that from happening. We have been able to overcome attempts to overrule a D.C. law passed to protect private reproductive decisions. The District passed a law that prohibits discrimination within the District—it has nothing to do with the Congress—against any family because of the reproductive health choices of family members. What am I doing, what is Congress doing, what is the District doing even knowing what your reproductive choice is? What kind of Congress that believes in local control would so intrusively insert itself into such private matters? Here is another that was almost laughable. It is a wipes labeling bill. Representative ANDY HARRIS from Maryland offered—and I thank him for withdrawing it—an amendment at markup. Representative HARRIS is a member of the Appropriations Committee. He would have prohibited the District from using its own funds to keep certain kinds of nonflushable products from being sold in D.C. Pardon me, but what is Representative HARRIS doing in our toilets and sewers? To his credit, he did withdraw his proposed amendment. It was important to the District because these nonflushable materials stop up sewers. They are our sewers. It is our town. Stay out of our business. The marijuana matter. First, Congress tried to overturn the District’s law that enables possession of a couple of ounces of marijuana. I was able to find a flaw in the proposed language. So the marijuana law still stands. But Congress keeps D.C. from commercializing marijuana, as is done in several States. I think there are eight States. It keeps D.C. from regulating marijuana further. That is dangerous. D.C. ought to be able to regulate marijuana to keep it out of the hands of children, for example. The interference of this body in the affairs of a local jurisdiction about which it knows nothing is not only outrageous on its face, but yes, it can be dangerous. The abortion rider or amendment comes annually. It keeps the District from spending its own local funds on abortions for lowincome women, although there are upwards of 17 States that use local funds for abortions because they have the autonomy that we seek. Then, at the last minute this year, there was something that Representative STEVE KINGdecided that he had to do. You see, I think when Members intrude in D.C. affairs, they must not have enough to do, and I am calling on their constituents to watch them. If you have a Member that does what— and here I am going to indicate this one shortly, but the ones I have just spoken of—if they have a Member that spends his time writing laws about someone else’s jurisdiction, they ought to call him to account. Representative STEVE KINGis from Iowa. He introduced a bill that would make it a Federal crime to commit violence within the District in connection with a legitimate labor dispute. Well, maybe it ought to be a crime and there may be some Federal legislation that deals with this matter nationwide, but if not, and it takes place within the District of Columbia and there is a legitimate labor dispute and there is violence, we have got enough cops to take care of that, Representative KING. We do not need this to be a Federal crime in D.C. alone. So, after calling the roll on those proposed antihome rule provisions, let me indicate most of them I have been able to keep off of the D.C. appropriations bill, the only way they get them passed. It would be very difficult to get them passed by coming here, get the votes, and then go to the Senate and get the votes. So Members try the easy way: just attach it to the D.C. appropriations bill that should not be here in the first place. The budget matter really does gall us. More than 7 in 10 Americans believe that the District of Columbia should control its own budget. That is what this board graph shows. More than anything else, the American people guard their own money. That is why this is so important. Republicans pose as the champions of local control. In fact, they want the Federal Government out of much of its own Federal business and let the States and the localities handle it. How could they then abandon their cherished principles when it comes to the Nation’s Capital? Look at these numbers, red and blue on this chart. The numbers show that Democrats and Republicans believe D.C. should control D.C.’s budget, slightly more in red or Republican States. I think numbers like that show that what I am saying about local control and about equality in this body represents the views of the American people. I defy anyone in this body to show differently. Ultimately, we recognize on this 44th anniversary of the signing of the Home Rule Act that there is no substitute for statehood. I should mention that Congress experimented with home rule for some time before the Home Rule Act was finally passed in 1973. It gave D.C. home rule in 1820. Sometimes it would take it back, and then try again. Imagine living in a city where they can take back your local control. To their credit, after the Civil War, the Republican Congress gave D.C. home rule and a Delegate. I am called a Delegate and a Congresswoman. They gave D.C. home rule. That version of home rule is precisely what D.C. has today. The 1973 Home Rule Act essentially is a replica of the home rule given to D.C. by the Republican Congress after the Civil War. How did we lose it? The Democrats, controlled by Southerners, took back home rule after Reconstruction and left the District for 100 years struggling to get back the selfgovernment that the Republican Congress had given the District after the Civil War. This all started with Republicans. It ended with the Home Rule Act, Richard Nixon, and bipartisan support in the Congress. There is no substitute for being equal to the States. You can’t have some second class citizens in the United States today, not in 21st century America. b1800 We are seeking the major elements of statehood, even before we get statehood. For example, the District of Columbia government has actually shut down when the Federal Government is shut down, even though the D.C. budget is balanced and nobody in the Congress has even looked at it. I have now been able to get a bill every year that allows the District to stay open even if the Congress closes the Federal Government down. We don’t know what will happen over in the Senate even today. We have just passed a continuing resolution—pitiful, though it was—to keep the government open for just a few more weeks. That passed this House. It has to pass the Senate. I can’t take the chance that the District will close down for no reason except that the Congress doesn’t know how to take care of its own business. I was finally able to convince the Congress to extricate the District from their fights to keep open, whatever you do to us—and you certainly haven’t extricated us altogether because our budget still comes here. But you certainly don’t mean to close down a big city like the District of Columbia, its budget, which handles vital matters like the police and keeping order. I don’t mean to say that all Republicans have failed to see this. My hat is off to Representative DARRELL ISSA, who headed the committee that has jurisdiction over the District of Columbia. He called witnesses from the District of Columbia—the mayor, the city council chairman, the chief financial officer—on a routine hearing since, yes, Congress can do that. It rarely does. He heard—even more important, he listened to—their testimony. And when he heard these officials from the District of Columbia testify about the financial condition of the District of Columbia, its reserves, that its growth 
was among the best in the Nation, Representative ISSA—listened. Maybe you don’t think Members of Congress are always listening to your testimony. He was listening to this testimony. Because after hearing that testimony, Representative ISSAfrom California endorsed D.C. budget autonomy, and he has worked tirelessly with local officials and with me to secure the autonomy of the District’s budget so it wouldn’t come to Congress. I haven’t asked him, but he may not be for statehood, and I doubt that he is. He is a Republican. But I think he understands, perhaps better than most of his colleagues, that no one has any business, in a Federal public handling somebody’s local budget in this Chamber, and I will be forever grateful. I want to say my thanks, as well, to former Representative Tom Davis, who resigned from the Congress a few years ago, and was instrumental in helping the District get votes for a vote for D.C. in the House and in the Senate. That bill, the D.C. Voting Rights Act, actually passed the House and passed the Senate. So why don’t we have at least the vote in the House now? The reason is that the National Rifle Association convinced some Members to place an amendment that would have wiped out all of the District’s gun laws; and, therefore, the residents of the District of Columbia, after helping me for years to achieve their first vote on this floor, had to leave that vote on the table. I will be forever grateful to Representative Tom Davis for his help. Now, what kind of jurisdiction are we talking about? It is very important for us to remember that we are talking about a city with a $14 billion budget, which is larger than the budget of 12 States. Why shouldn’t D.C., therefore, have statehood like those States? We are talking about a city that has a $2.5 billion surplus. That is the envy of the States. Ask my colleagues how many of them have a surplus that large. The per capita income of the people I represent is higher than that of any State. Now, that is an interesting figure that should be explained. There are many poor people in the District of Columbia, but there are many high earners, too; and when you put them together, that is one of the reasons you get the highest per capita taxes paid. That is why you get $12,000 per year in Federal taxes from D.C. residents. The personal income of the people I represent is higher than that of seven States; the per capita of personal consumption in expenditures is higher than that of any State; and the total personal consumption expenditures are greater than those of seven States. This is a very productive, a very hardworking city that pays its own way and contributes, as well, mightily to our country. And Americans understand that because the District is attracting residents in large numbers. We have had, in this city, a 15.3 percent increase in residents since the last census. That becomes, on a monthly basis, 800 new residents coming to live in your Nation’s Capital every month— almost 700,000, a larger population today than Wyoming and then Vermont, but these States, they have two Senators. They have the same number of Representatives as the District of Columbia—one. If the truth be told, the District is about the same in population as seven States. Those seven States have two Senators each and one Representative who votes on this floor. They and I are equivalent in every respect except, of course, for the taxes per capita D.C. residents pay, and yet they have the vote. Notwithstanding that the District is number one per capita in taxes District residents pay, those seven States have the congressional vote and we do not. This week, in fact, just today, we passed a new tax bill. So imagine how the residents I represent feel about a new tax bill. They are going to end up paying more taxes because SALT, the State and local tax deduction, has been capped. It has been with us for almost 100 years. So instead of taxation without representation, my constituents will have double taxation, at least when it comes to that particular matter, the State and local taxes, double taxation without representation. So when the bell rang for the tax vote, I did not come down because I could not vote for the citizens of the District of Columbia. When there are votes on this floor for matters involving our military and life and death, I do not come down because I cannot vote. Still, I remember the purple fingers from the citizens of Iraq and Afghanistan, where they not only were signifying that they had voted, but they were signifying who gave them the vote: members of the military from the United States, including members from the District of Columbia, who have fought and died in every war since the war that created the United States of America. District residents have overpaid for the equal citizenship they seek, and this chart illustrates it tragically: World War I, 635 District of Columbia residents lost their lives in that war. That was a figure greater than three different States. World War II—that was a big one— 3,573 District of Columbia residents lost their lives. That was five times greater than the District’s losses in World War I, and it was greater than losses in four different States. Moving on to the Korean war, 547 District residents lost their lives. That figure was greater than the loss of life by the military in eight different States. And finally, the Vietnam war, 243 casualties in that war. That was a figure greater than 10 different States. All told, this city, which is a relatively small city, has had almost 200,000 residents serve in the military, and that is only since World War I. I hasten to add that there has never been a war—and I have not counted the 19th century wars—there has never been a war where the residents of your Nation’s Capital were not among those who fought and died. Now, I must ask if there is any Member of Congress who would stand for the Federal Government dictating a local budget or her local matters coming to the House floor after showing what I have shown here this evening about the District of Columbia. Maybe there will be some understanding of why we must protest and resist the treatment of the District of Columbia until the District is given the equality to States by becoming the 51st State. As I have indicated, it is impossible to lay our present predicament on the Framers of our Constitution. Remember, they went to war, it is they who gave us the slogan of ‘‘taxation without representation.’’ They were willing to die, to commit treason, largely because they were paying taxes to the crown and had no representation. How can we possibly lay the present predicament of the District on the Framers? It is not them. It is on us today. b1815 In the 21st century, Congress cannot continue to ask the residents of the Nation’s Capital to watch democracy in operation for everybody else except them. If a matter involves the District of Columbia and has to come before us, then everybody gets to vote on that matter except the Representative of the District of Columbia. You can’t justify that alongside American principles, given how much in Federal taxes the people I represent pay, given their sons and daughters who have always gone to war for their country, all of that without a vote in the House and the Senate required by consent of the government. Well, we have two choices, but when you think about it, we have only one. Congress can continue to exercise autocratic authority over the American citizens who live in their own Nation’s Capital, treating them—if I may quote the words of the great Frederick Douglass, whose bicentennial we will be celebrating in 2018 (who was a resident of this City), and who said our country was ‘‘Treating the District and its citizens as aliens, not citizens, but subjects.’’ We are not subjects. We are American citizens. The only alternative today is to live up to the Nation’s promise and ideals and pass the Washington, D.C. Admission Act to make the residents of your Nation’s Capital equal by affording them the right to live in the 51st State of the Union of States called the United States of America. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
ISSUES OF THE DAY The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, it has been quite a week: ups and downs and not knowing whether bills would be passed or the government would be funded, whether we would be able to help America with a muchimproving economy in the new year by passing the tax cut bill. But we got it done, and it ended up being a good week, and here we are. This will be the last opportunity to speak before we are out for Christmas, and I heard some good news today about Ukraine. We have the annual Presidential Prayer Breakfast the first Thursday of February each year, except when the first Thursday is on the 1st, and then it is on the 8th, which it will be this February. We had representatives from the Ukraine Government come to our National Prayer Breakfast here, and they started one there and began to grow. Now, for the first time, Ukraine legislature has passed a bill recognizing a celebration of Christmas, the day of Jesus’ birth. We celebrate Jesus’ birth on that day, December 25. Apparently, from what we are told, it emanates from them coming over, being part of our Prayer Breakfast, where the President comes, and then starting one. And then now we are going to be celebrating the birth of Jesus in America—all those who care to—at the same time the Ukrainian Government will do so. So that is a big bit of news there. I was listening to the Delegate from the District of Columbia and it took me back to when I first got here as a Member of Congress and I saw the license plate saying, ‘‘Taxation Without Representation.’’ I know from studying history—never ceasing to study history that that was one of the war cries for the Revolution: Taxation without representation is tyranny. And as Benjamin Franklin once said: If we do not get to select even one of the people in Parliament, then that Parliament has no right to place any tax on us. And then upon hearing that, Puerto Rico, Guam, Mariana Islands, U.S. Virgin Islands, all of the territories where they have a Delegate or Commissioner but they don’t have a full voting member, those are areas that are not required to pay any Federal income tax. In fact, when I found out, the more I looked into it, there is only one place in America where people do not elect a full voting Member of Congress, yet they have to pay Federal income tax, and that is here in the District of Columbia. For that reason, I filed a bill—because they had tried to get a full voting Member of Congress. But to do that, you have to have a constitutional amendment. Everybody knew that and agreed to that back in the late 1970s. The proponents of having a full voting Representative got it through the House, got it through the Senate, but they never did get the requisite number of States to sign on, so it failed without ever being ratified by enough States. I feel sure that would be the case if that were attempted again, but it does require an amendment. And since that doesn’t appear it is going to happen anytime soon, then I believe in each of the sessions of Congress I have been, I have filed a bill that would correct that injustice, because it truly is an injustice for the people who live in the District of Columbia, and it is very simple. It just says, basically, that until when and if the District of Columbia has a full voting Representative, they are like any other U.S. territory, they will not have to pay Federal income tax. I felt like that would certainly make people appreciate that, that they were treated like those in other places that don’t elect a full voting Member of the House. So far I haven’t been able to get Ms. HOLMES NORTON to sign on as a cosponsor. I am hoping to get her to sign on at some point because it really would help those people who live here in the City of Washington not to have to pay any Federal income tax. Of course, Puerto Rico pays no Federal income tax, yet they have a higher local income tax than the Federal income tax. You know, a lot of States— I think somebody told me that Californians are paying 10 percent or so. But Puerto Rico, where, I think, over one third or about onethird or so of the people there work for the government, then the government load is just overwhelming. Puerto Rico is so beautiful. Even after all the disaster that needs to be cleaned up and fixed, I would hope at some point they become less heavy on the government and more heavy on freemarket opportunities. I could see Puerto Rico becoming the Hong Kong of the United States, where that is where people want to go, that is where businesses want to locate because it is such a great place to live. But the taxes have run people out of that area, even though they don’t pay Federal income tax. I don’t think that would happen here in Washington. Mr. Speaker, here we are, the last session before Christmas. It has been amazing. The most often cited book in Congress for our country’s entire history has been the Bible. There is no book that comes close to the recitations from it that has the Bible. Throughout our history, we were recognized as a Christian nation. I believe President Obama was right when he said we are not a Christian nation. We were, but we are not anymore. But even the Supreme Court, when it was a much more enlightened Supreme Court well after the Civil War—in fact, 30 years after the Civil War was over—the Supreme Court looked at all of the evidence and declared in an opinion that the United States was founded as and is a Christian nation. Not that everybody has to be a Christian here. They absolutely don’t. I would humbly submit that the only way any people can truly have freedom of religion is if they have a constitution that is founded on JudeoChristian principles that recognize that all true rights: life, liberty, pursuit of happiness—you don’t have a right to happiness, but a right to pursue it—those come from God, and the Founders recognized that. It is a shame to hear people deceiving young people in school, teaching them that, no, the real Founders were only deists. They didn’t believe in God; Ben Franklin being the leading deist. If they would just teach the children what Ben Franklin said in June of 1787 at the Constitutional Convention. After 5 weeks of nothing but arguing back and forth, 80yearold Ben Franklin, 2 or 3 years away from meeting his maker, got recognized. Somebody wrote that President Washington looked so relieved when Dr. Franklin sought recognition. He finally stood up. He had gout and he had terrible arthritis. He was well overweight, but he got up and gave the speech that so many Christians are aware of, where he said what no deist would ever say, despite how many teachers these days say he was a deist. His words were—we know what his words were because he sat down and wrote it down afterwards when he was asked for a copy of what he said. And he said: ‘‘I have lived, Sir, a long time; and the longer I live, the more convincing proofs I see of this truth— God governs in the affairs of men. If a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without his notice, is it probable that an empire can rise without his aid? We have been assured, Sir, in the sacred writings, that ‘except the Lord build the House, they labour in vain that build it.’’’ He said: ‘‘I firmly believe that.’’ Mr. Speaker, which means he wasn’t a deist. He said: ‘‘I also believe that without His’’—without God’s—‘‘concurring aid, we shall succeed in this political building no better than the Builders of Babel. We shall be divided by our little partial local interests . . . and we ourselves will become a power down through the ages.’’ Mr. Speaker, it was at the conclusion of that day’s session in the Constitutional Convention that Randolph from here in Virginia, or across the river in Virginia, made a motion that since here we are at the end of June, we are about to celebrate our Nation’s birthday, and we all know we have not been able to accomplish anything. As Franklin said: ‘‘We have been going for nearly 5 weeks. We have more noes than ayes on virtually every issue.’’ And then Franklin went on to say: ‘‘How has it happened, Sir, that we 
have not . . . thought of humbly applying to the Father of lights to illuminate our understandings?’’ b1830 So Randolph’s motion is, since they haven’t been able to accomplish really anything, just yelling back and forth— it was all the big 6foot4 Washington could do to keep things under control. And, yes, I know in Chernow’s biography, he said he was less than 6 foot 2, because he was standing by a guy 6 foot 2 and he was shorter, but he is just wrong on that. George Washington, 1799, when dead, flat on a slab, was measured as 6 foot 3
1⁄2. Undeniable, 6 foot 4 in the height of his time, but he couldn’t control things. Randolph’s motion passed. His motion was that they recess the Constitutional Convention and reconvene together in one of the local churches they agreed on and worship God together and then come back and try it again. That one passed. They went to the Reformed Calvinist Church—I was sharing that with my friend DAVE BRAT earlier since he attends a Calvinist church—Reverend William Rogers presiding. You can go online and find at least one of the prayers that he prayed. I have this little book from Dr. Richard G. Lee, what a great man of God, great little booklet. ‘‘In God We Still Trust,’’ it is called. It has some great stories from our history. He noted that Warren Earl Burger, Chief Justice of the United States from 1969 to 1986, delivered the Supreme Court’s opinion in the 1985 case of Lynch v. Donnelly, which upheld that the city of Pawtucket, Rhode Island, did not violate the Constitution by displaying a nativity scene. Noting that Presidential orders and proclamations from Congress have designated Christmas as a national holiday in religious terms for two centuries and in the Western world for 20 centuries, he wrote: ‘‘There is an unbroken history of official acknowledgement by all three branches of government of the role of religion in American life. The Constitution does not require a complete separation of church and state.’’ In fact, I would insert here, those words, ‘‘separation of church and state,’’ unlike what many say when asked, they are not in the Constitution, they were not intended to be in the Constitution. The Founders did not want church to be separated from state. They wanted the state to stay the heck out of the church business. That is what they wanted. But Thomas Jefferson mentioned a separation of church and state, a wall of separation, but it was going to be a oneway wall where the state stayed out of people’s religion, but expected religion because it was part of our founding and the Bible was so often mentioned as a source of wisdom as they tried to put together a government. Chief Justice Burger, talking about the Constitution, said: ‘‘It affirmatively mandates accommodation, not merely tolerance, of all religions, and forbids hostility toward any. . . . Anything less would require the ‘callous indifference’ we have said was never intended by the Establishment Clause. . . . Indeed, we have observed, such hostility would bring us into ‘war with our national tradition as embodied in the First Amendment’s guarantee of the free exercise of religion.’’ He goes on on the next page, talking about John Hancock. He said: ‘‘To celebrate the victorious conclusion of the Revolutionary War, Governor John Hancock of Massachusetts issued a proclamation for a day of Thanksgiving on December 11, 1783.’’ Just over a week ago was the anniversary of this proclamation from Governor John Hancock, the president that signed as president of the Continental Congress on the Declaration of Independence. John Hancock said: ‘‘Whereas . . . these United States are not only happily rescued from the danger and calamities to which they have been so long exposed, but their freedom, sovereignty, and independence ultimately acknowledged. ‘‘And whereas . . . the interposition of Divine Providence’’—and they capitalized ‘‘Divine Providence,’’ another expression meaning God—‘‘in our favor hath been most abundantly and most graciously manifested, and the citizens of these United States have every reason for praise and gratitude to the God of their salvation. ‘‘Impressed therefore with an exalted sense of the blessings by which we are surrounded, and of our entire dependence on that Almighty Being’’—‘‘Almighty Being’’ both capitalized—‘‘from whose goodness and bounty they are derived; I do by and with the advice of the council appoint Thursday the 11th day of December next’’—the day recommended by the Congress to all the States—‘‘to be religiously observed as a day of thanksgiving and prayer; that all the people may then assemble to celebrate . . . that He’’—‘‘He’’ is capitalized, meaning God—‘‘hath been pleased to continue to us the light of the blessed Gospel; . . . that we also offer up fervent supplications . . . to cause pure religion and virtue to flourish . . . and to fill the world with His— capital H—glory.’’ That was John Hancock. As he pointed out, that was directed by the Congress of the United States that that day be recognized, but that was just his proclamation as Governor of Massachusetts. It seems when I mention God, mention some of our heritage, we often get a lot of calls from people who just become irate, which also testifies probably to the importance and to the genuineness of our founding and our founding reliance on God, because nothing else provokes that kind of anger and hatred. But some people say that has no place in the Capitol of the United States. And bless them; they just are a bit ignorant. Just down the hall, the original House Chamber was the largest Christian church in the Washington, D.C., area for most of the 1800s. A guy named Thomas Jefferson, that coined the expression ‘‘separation of church and state,’’ ‘‘wall of separation,’’ he put in a letter to the Danbury Baptists why we should not have, in essence, an official denomination, that that is not the government’s role. Jefferson saw no problem in having Christian worship services down the hall because it was nondenominational. Every Sunday that he was in Washington during his 8 years as President, he would come. Normally, he would ride a horse, according to the Congressional Research Service. You don’t have to rely on my historical interpretation. The bipartisan, objective Congressional Research Service said he usually came riding a single horse. Unlike Jefferson, Madison, who is given credit for writing much of the Constitution, when he was President for those 8 years, he normally came in a horsedrawn carriage with multiple horses drawing his carriage. Jefferson, on the other hand, came to church here in the Capitol normally on a horse by himself, before the days, obviously, of the Secret Service. Jefferson, in fact, since it was a nondenominational Christian service, saw no problem with inviting the Marine Band to come do the accompaniment many Sundays for the hymns that were to be sung. The first woman to officially address a group in the U.S. Capitol occurred in the early 1800s, a Christian evangelist, who gave the sermon just down the hall in what was then the House of Representatives Chamber. I have a book, ‘‘Miracles in American History.’’ Susie Federer did this, adapted from William J. Federer’s ‘‘American Minute.’’ This is a typical story from our history and our Founders, who knew how valuable God’s assistance was in getting this little bubble in time and space where, for the first time in history, Christians were not persecuted for being Christians. For the first time since Jesus came over 2,000 years ago, this America, this United States was a place where you weren’t persecuted for being a Christian. Obviously, that is changing, and now we have governmental entities that are afraid of Christians as potentially a big hate group; although, anyone who professes that Christian groups need to be violent in order to accomplish our purposes can’t truly be Christian and based on the Bible unless they are enacting government in so doing and acting under Romans 13. But, otherwise, they miss the whole point of Jesus’ preaching. In this book from the Federers, the Battle of Cowpens was January 17, 1781. 
Also, January 17 happens to be my father’s birthday. I won’t tell the age, but he is over 90. ‘‘The Battle of Cowpens, January 17, 1781, depicted in the movie ‘The Patriot,’ involved American General Daniel Morgan having a line of militia fire into the British General Cornwallis’ and Colonel Banastre Tarleton’s dragoons, regulars, Highlanders, and loyalists. ‘‘When the Americans hastily retreated, British Colonel Tarleton, known as ‘The Butcher,’ gave in to the temptation to pursue, only to be surprised by American Continentals waiting over the hill, firing at pointblank range. ‘‘In the confusion, the Americans killed 110 British and captured 830. ‘‘The Battle of Cowpens is widely considered the tactical masterpiece and turning point of the war.’’ This is talking about the Revolutionary War, of course. ‘‘General Daniel Morgan met up with American General Nathanael Greene, and they made a hasty retreat north toward Virginia. ‘‘Cornwallis regrouped and chased the Americans as fast as he could, burning extra equipment and supplies along the way in order to travel faster. ‘‘Cornwallis arrived at the Catalpa River just 2 hours after the Americans had crossed, but a storm made the river impassable, delaying the British pursuit. ‘‘Cornwallis nearly overtook them as they were getting out of the Yadkin River, but rain flooded the river. ‘‘Now it was a race to the Dan River, but General Nathanael Greene again made it across before the British arrived. ‘‘British Commander Henry Clinton wrote: ‘‘‘Here the royal army was again stopped by a sudden rise of the waters, which had only just fallen, almost miraculously, to let the enemy over . . .’ ‘‘In March 1781, General George Washington wrote to William Gordon: ‘‘‘We have . . . abundant reasons to thank Providence’’—with a capital P; he often referred to God as Providence—‘to thank Providence for its many favorable interpositions in our behalf. It has at times been my only dependence, for all other resources seemed to have failed us.’ ‘‘British General Henry Clinton then ordered General Cornwallis to move 8,000 troops to a defensive position where the York River entered the Chesapeake Bay. b1845 By this time, Ben Franklin and Marquis de Lafayette, which is the gentleman depicted in this painting right over here—it is the only fulllength portrait of a foreigner in our U.S. Capitol—were finally successful in their efforts to persuade French King Louis XVI to send ships and troops to meet the Americans. French Admiral de Grasse left off fighting the British in the West Indies; sailed 24 ships to the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay where, in the Battle of the Capes, he drove off 19 British ships which were trying to evacuate Cornwallis’ men. De Grasse’s 3,000 French troops, and General Rochambeau’s 6,000 French troops, hurriedly joined General Lafayette’s division as they marched to help Washington trap Cornwallis against the sea. They joined the troops of General Benjamin Lincoln, Baron von Steuben, Mordecai Gist, Henry Knox, and John Peter Muhlenberg. All together, 17,000 French and American troops surrounded Cornwallis, and, on October 19, 1781, he surrendered. Yale President Ezra Stiles wrote on May 8, 1783: ‘‘Who but God’’—and by the way, this Yale University president, for those who are shocked that Yale had such a strident Christian leader, but actually, originally, Harvard and Yale, you couldn’t even get in unless you swore that Jesus was your Lord and Savior in very stark terms. But Yale University President Ezra Stiles, in 1783, says: ‘‘Who but God could have ordained the critical arrival of the Gallic or French fleet so as to assist in the siege of Yorktown? Should we not ascribe to a Supreme energy the wise generalship displayed by General Greene, leaving the roving Cornwallis to pursue his helterskelter, illfated march into Virginia. It is God who had raised up for us a powerful ally, a chosen army, an enabled force, who sent us a Rochambeau to fight sidebyside with Washington in the Battle of Yorktown.’’ ‘‘To diffuse the general joy through every breast, the general orders’’—I am sorry. This is from George Washington. George Washington wrote this. This was one of his orders. ‘‘To diffuse the general joy through every breast, the general orders’’— these are his orders. I am quoting from Washington. ‘‘Divine service is to be performed tomorrow in the several brigades. The CommanderinChief earnestly recommends troops not on duty should universally attend with that gratitude of heart which the recognition of such astonishing interposition of Providence demands.’’ And then the next year, on October 11, this is what the Congress passed. Congress said: ‘‘It being the indispensable duty of all nations to offer up their supplications to Almighty God the United States in Congress assembled do hereby recommend it to the inhabitants of these States in general to observe the last Thursday of November next as a day of solemn thanksgiving to God for his mercies.’’ September 3, 1783, the Revolutionary War was officially ended with the Treaty of Paris, signed by Ben Franklin, John Adams, John Jay, and David Hartley. And I was surprised, I was going through the State Department with my wife and my pastor, David Dykes, and his wife, Cindy, and we were going through, and there was a copy, an original copy of the Treaty of Paris. I looked at the big letters that started it, and I was shocked. I said: ‘‘Did you know it started that way?’’ Because David is quite a historian himself. He has written a lot of great books. But he didn’t know. We didn’t know how it started. But then it made sense. If you are going to get the British to sign a document swearing that the United States has the right to be free and independent of the most powerful country in the world, the most powerful army, the most powerful navy, which I agree with Washington, it was the grace of God, we were able to defeat. Without the grace of God, there is no defeat. We are not an independent country. So what do you start that with to make the British swear under that would be something they would not want to break the oath to? This is how it starts. These were the big letters, huge print, ‘‘In the name of the Most Holy and Undivided Trinity,’’ then smaller letters for the rest of the document, ‘‘It having pleased the Divine Providence’’ or God ‘‘to dispose the hearts of the most serene and most potent Prince George III, by the grace of God, King of Great Britain . . . and of the United States of America, to forget all past misunderstandings and differences.’’ Anyway, it was signed: ‘‘Done at Paris, this third day of September, in the year of our Lord, 1783.’’ And, of course, our Constitution is dated the same way, in the year of our Lord, 1787. But those were Founders. Those were things that got us started. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON ). 
CELEBRATING THE BORDEN COUNTY COYOTES DI VISION 1 , 1A SIX MAN FOOTBALL STATE CHAM PIONSHIP  
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT ), my new friend, great colleague, and mentor as I have made my transition into this great body. He tells me that all freshman Members come in and have big wins like tax reform and these big, tremendous wins, not for the Republican Party, but for the American people. I am so proud to have been a part of that. I am proud to call Mr. GOHMERT  my friend. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to celebrate the Borden County Coyotes’ hard fought victory over Jonesboro in the Division 1, 1A SixMan Football State Championship. This was the Coyotes’ seventh State championship appearance, fifth State championship win, and the second year in a row these two teams faced off in the sixman State championship game. Going into the championship game, only six opposing teams had scored against the Coyotes all year long. They boast the best sixman defense in the State, have been named the best six man team in the Nation, and are ranked number 1 in the class 1–A division rankings. 
With the discipline and determination they showed all season long, this team turned a twopoint lead at halftime into a 60–22 win in the State championship. I want to commend both teams on their tremendous success and sportsmanship and congratulate, especially, Coach Richey on preparing our Coyotes to achieve a perfect season. I would be remiss if I did not thank the parents and the teachers and the administrators and the fans who were always there throughout this season to ensure the Coyotes always gave their Borden County best. There is nothing like high school football in west Texas. Go Coyotes, and go west Texas. 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise to wish a happy birthday, 80 years, to a dear friend, a Lubbock native, and a legend at Texas Tech, Dr. Bill Dean. Dr. Dean has always been a leader and has always had a servant heart when it comes to serving his community and the campus community at Texas Tech. I don’t know anyone who loves Texas Tech University and the students at Texas Tech like Bill Dean. He was elected to the student body presidency when he was a student at Tech. He got 3 degrees and became a professor, an associate dean, and, ultimately, in his current role, serves as CEO of the Texas Tech University Alumni Association. He was named the best teacher nine times by his students. Dr. Dean, you are the very best, and you represent the very best of west Texas and Red Raider Nation. I want to say, blessings to you, and I hope you have many, many more years on that college campus because you have had an amazing impact on thousands of the lives of young people who come through that university, like me. Thank you for your commitment. Thank you for your service and your leadership, and God bless you and Peggy. ‘‘Guns Up.’’ Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I am always happy to share time with my friend from west Texas. We are on opposite sides of the State but same sides of the heart caring for this country. We have got a lot to be thankful for in this country, and I am thankful that we are going to have 11 months for people to realize that all the gloom and doom that was preached in this room about what the tax bill was going to do. The tax cuts, the reforms, it wasn’t made as simple as I would hope, just a flat tax across the board. But there will be more people who don’t pay tax, and most everybody should pay less tax. It is just amazing the things that have been said. One person even said this is the worst bill ever, the tax bill, when—wow, I would have thought those bills that were really punishing slaves and allowing the continuance of slavery, those might have been, well, in my opinion, just nowhere near the same category. But according to at least one source here across the aisle, this tax bill was worse than all of those, the worst bill ever. But people are going to have 11 months to see that, even though the stock market was doing better, people weren’t really doing better. Incomes had been pretty well flatlined. I think there is going to be a great deal to be grateful for. Now it is not just going to be the stock market going up, it is going to be Americans having more money in their own pockets. There are going to be more jobs. There are going to be people making more than they have in the past. There will be a chance for many in the upcoming generation to experience what many of us did coming out of school, but most of them haven’t, and that is having multiple firms, companies, employers, wanting them. It is just going to be a new experience for so many. And I hope when it happens, they will do as our Founders did and know where to give the proper credit. John Adams, in the fall of 1798, to the officers of the First Brigade—he was President at the time, having succeeded Washington. President Adams said: ‘‘We have no government armed with power, capable of contending with human passions, unbridled by morality and religion. Avarice, ambition, revenge, gallantry would break the strongest cords of our Constitution as a whale goes through a net. Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people.’’ b1900 It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other. John Adams, on December 25, 1813, what we call Christmas Day, wrote to his new friend. They had been friends, then when Jefferson had been greatly unfair in the election, defeated Adams, they had nothing to do with each other for many years. Then at Benjamin Rush’s recommendation, Adams wrote Thomas Jefferson, and they rekindled a great friendship. December 25 of 1813, former President John Adams wrote to former President Thomas Jefferson, and said: ‘‘I have examined all religions as well as my narrow sphere, my straightened means, and my busy life would allow; and the result is that the Bible is the best Book in the world. It contains more philosophy than all the libraries I have seen.’’ Thomas Jefferson. This is inscribed in his monument. Mr. Speaker, I share this as we leave session the last time before Christmas, because I find that so many people get upset when we mention God or mention the Bible here in Congress, when actually that is the most oftcited thing in our whole history of Congress. People have been miseducated, and this is the one chance to thank God, Mr. Speaker, and help people realize how we came to be as we are. Thomas Jefferson said: ‘‘God who gave us life gave us liberty.’’ ‘‘And can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the people that these liberties are of the gift of God? That they are not to be violated, but with His wrath? Indeed, I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just: that His justice cannot sleep forever.’’ Mr. Speaker, this was a time when people had turned from God, and it was scaring Jefferson because he knew, as Adams did, if we were not a religious and moral people, the Constitution would cease to serve the needed purpose. Madison has such great pronouncements. As Madison himself said in 1815: ‘‘No people ought to feel greater obligations to celebrate the goodness of the Great Disposer of events and of the Destiny of nations than the people of the United States. To the same divine author of every good and perfect gift, we are indebted for all those privileges and advantages, religious as well as civil, which are so richly enjoyed in this favored land.’’ He also referred to our Heavenly Benefactor. Monroe, same type of messages. John Quincy Adams, he wrote his son, 1811: ‘‘ . . . so great is my veneration for the Bible, and so strong my belief, that when duly read and meditated on, it is of all books in the world, that which contributes most to make men wise and happy—that the earlier my children begin to read it, the more steadily they pursue the practice of reading it throughout their lives, the more lively and confident will be my hopes that they will prove useful citizens to their country, respectable members of society. . . . ‘’ Abraham Lincoln said this, and it was official. This was his proclamation. Those that think it is inappropriate for government to say these things, this was Abraham Lincoln, who knew wherein our hopes lie. Lincoln said in his official proclamation: ‘‘ . . . it is the duty of nations, as well as of men, to own their dependence upon the overruling power of God, to confess their sins and transgressions in humble sorrow, yet with assured hope, that genuine repentance will lead to mercy and pardon, and to recognize the sublime truth, announced in the Holy Scriptures and proven by all history, that those nations are only blessed whose God is the Lord.’’ In his second inaugural, just 45 days before he was struck down by an assassin’s bullet, Abraham Lincoln was trying to make sense of such a bloody, horrific war between the North and South, and it is inscribed on the inside wall of the Lincoln Memorial on the north side. Thank God, literally, thank God no one has required that those beautiful words be removed. But he was trying to reconcile how there could be something so bloody and 
awful if there were a good and just God. Obviously, he had done a lot of theological wrestling with that issue, and in talking about the North and South, Abraham Lincoln said: ‘‘Both’’—North and South—‘‘read the same Bible and pray to the same God.’’ ‘‘The prayers of both could not be answered. The prayers of neither has been answered fully. The Almighty has his own purpose.’’ But then he quotes Scripture: ‘‘Whoa unto the world because of offenses.’’ Lincoln continues on: ‘‘Yet, if God will that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondsman’s 250 years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with a sword, as was said 3,000 years ago, so it must be said.’’ And again quoting the Bible: ‘‘The judgements of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.’’ All Presidents have had these types of proclamations. I like the proclamation Grover Cleveland had in November 1885. Official U.S. Government proclamation. He said: ‘‘The American people have always abundant cause to be thankful to Almighty God, whose watchful care and guiding hand have been manifested in every stage of their national life, guarding and protecting them in time of peril and safely leading them in the hour of darkness and of danger. ‘‘It is fitting and proper that a nation thus favored should on one day every year, for that purpose especially appointed, publicly acknowledge the goodness of God and return thanks to Him for all His gracious gifts.’’ Moving to Franklin Roosevelt, Franklin Roosevelt delivered this Christmas Eve message just weeks after we were attacked at Pearl Harbor. Franklin Roosevelt said: ‘‘Sincere and faithful men and women are asking themselves this Christmas: How can we light our trees? How can we give our gifts? How can we meet and worship with love and with uplifted spirit and heart in a world at war, a world of fighting and suffering and death? How can we pause, even for a day, even for Christmas Day, in our urgent labor of arming a decent humanity against the enemies which beset it? How can we put the world aside, as men and women put the world aside in peaceful years, to rejoice in the birth of Christ?’’ Franklin Roosevelt went on to say: ‘‘Looking into the days to come, I have set aside a day of prayer, and in that proclamation, I have said: The year 1941 has brought upon our Nation a war of aggression by powers dominated by arrogant rulers whose selfish purpose is to destroy free institutions. They would thereby take from the freedomloving peoples of the Earth the hardwon liberties gained over many centuries. The new year of 1942 calls for the courage. Our strength, as the strength of all men everywhere, is of greater avail as God upholds us. ‘‘Therefore, I’’—this is Franklin Roosevelt—‘‘do hereby appoint the first day of the year 1942 as a day of prayer, of asking forgiveness for our shortcomings of the past, of consecration to the task of the present, of asking God’s help in days to come. We need His guidance that this people may be humbled in spirit, but strong in the conviction of the right. Steadfast to endure sacrifice, and brave to achieve a victory of liberty and peace. Our strongest weapon in this war is that conviction of the dignity and brotherhood of man, which Christmas Day signifies. Against enemies who preach the principles of hate and practice them, we set our faith in human love and in God’s care for us and all men everywhere.’’ He had so many beautiful, beautiful messages. One ended like this: ‘‘It is significant that tomorrow, Christmas Day, our plants and factories will be stilled. That is not true of the other holidays we have long been accustomed to celebrate. On all other holidays, work goes on, gladly, for the winning of the war. So Christmas becomes the only holiday in all the year. I like to think this is because Christmas is a holy day. May all it stands for live and grow throughout the years.’’ Harry Truman, who succeeded him after his death, finished one of his Christmas proclamations this way: ‘‘Our thoughts and aspirations and the hopes of future years turn to a little town in the hills of Judea where, on a winter’s night 2,000 years ago, the prophecy of Isaiah was fulfilled. ‘‘Shepherds keeping the watch by night over their flock heard the glad tidings of great joy from the angels of the Lord singing: ‘Glory to God in the highest, and on Earth, peace, good will toward men.’’’ It is not just from the Bible. This is the President of the United States’ official proclamation, government proclamation. Truman said: ‘‘The message of Bethlehem best sums up our hopes tonight. If we as a nation, and the other nations of the world, will accept it, the star of faith will guide us into the place of peace as it did the shepherds on that day of Christ’s birth long ago. ‘‘We shall find strength and courage at this Christmastime because so brave a beginning has been made. So with faith and courage we shall work to hasten the day when the sword is replaced by the plowshare and nations do not ‘learn war anymore.’ ‘‘Selfishness and greed, individual or national, cause most of our troubles.’’ b1915 ‘‘He whose birth we celebrate tonight was the world’s greatest teacher. He said: ‘Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men would do to you, do ye even so to them; for this is the law and the prophets.’ Through all the centuries since He spoke, history has vindicated His teaching. ‘‘In this great country of ours has been demonstrated the fundamental unity of Christianity and democracy. Under our heritage of freedom for everyone on equal terms, we also share the responsibilities of government. Our support of individual freedom—free speech, free schools, free press, and a free conscience—transcends all our differences. Although we may not hope for a New Heaven and a New Earth in our day and generation; we may strive with undaunted faith and courage to achieve in the present some measure of that unity with which the Nation’s sons and the sons of our allies went forth to win the war. ‘‘We have this glorious land not because of a particular religious faith, not because our ancestors sailed from a particular foreign port. We have our unique national heritage because of a common aspiration to be free and because of our purpose to achieve for ourselves and for our children the good things of life which the Christ declared He came to give to all mankind. ‘‘We have made a good start toward peace in the world. Ahead of us lies the larger task of making the peace secure. The progress we made gives hope that in the coming year we shall reach our goal. May 1947 entitle us to the benediction of the Master.’’ ‘‘Master’’ is capitalized. He is talking about Jesus. He quotes Jesus saying: ‘‘‘Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God.’ Because of what we have achieved for peace, because of all the promise our future holds, I say to all my countrymen: Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, and may God bless you all.’’ I just want to conclude, Mr. Speaker, with this best message, Ronald Reagan’s 1988 official Christmas message. He said: ‘‘The themes of Christmas and of coming home for the holidays have long been intertwined in song and story. There is a profound irony and a lesson in this because Christmas celebrates the coming of a Savior who was born without a home. ‘‘There was no room at the inn for the Holy Family. Weary of travel, a young Mary, close to childbirth, and her carpenter husband, Joseph, found but the rude shelter of a stable. There born the King of Kings, the Prince of Peace—an event on which all history would turn. ‘‘Jesus would again be without home, and more than once; on the flight to Egypt and during His public ministry when He said: ‘The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man hath nowhere to lay his head.’ ‘‘From His very infancy, on, our Redeemer was reminding us that, from then on we would never lack a home in Him. Like the shepherds to whom the angel of the Lord appeared on the first Christmas Day, we could always say: ‘Let us now go even unto Bethlehem 
and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us.’ ‘‘As we come home with gladness to family and friends this Christmas, let us also remember our neighbors who cannot go home themselves. Our compassion and concern this Christmas and all year long will mean much to the hospitalized, the homeless, the convalescent, the orphaned—and will surely lead us on our way to the joy and peace of Bethlehem and the Christ Child who bids us come. For it is only in finding and living the eternal meaning of the Nativity that we can be truly happy, truly at peace, truly home. ‘‘Merry Christmas, and God bless you.’’ Official proclamation of the United States Government by the President of the United States, words well to remember. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. SENATE BILLS REFERRED Bills of the Senate of the following titles were taken from the Speaker’s table and, under the rule, referred as follows:
