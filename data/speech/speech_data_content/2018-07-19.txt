Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. The SPEAKER. The question is on the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. The question was taken; and the Speaker announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present. The SPEAKER. Pursuant to clause 8, rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn. PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman from California (Mr. GOMEZ ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. GOMEZ led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. GOMEZ. Mr. Speaker, William Nguyen is a 32yearold from my district. His graduation from graduate school was last week, but he missed it because he was jailed while vacationing in Vietnam, imprisoned after taking part in a peaceful demonstration. I am here to stand up for my constituent and ask that he be treated humanely. This young man is a son, brother, and a friend to many. I see his passion for justice in the millennials I represent. Will is part of a generation that cares deeply about the world beyond our borders. They are advocates for the most vulnerable, voices for the voiceless, and now William needs our voices. He needs our collective resolve to help him through this difficult time. Will’s case has unified Democrats and Republicans to work together on his behalf. For weeks, we have done everything to build diplomatic efforts needed to bring him home. Today, I am asking all Americans, regardless of their politics, to join us in supporting the Nguyen family. Keep them in your thoughts, in your hearts, and in your prayers. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF PAUL STOUT (Mr. BOST asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, 100 years ago today, a young marine from Murphysboro, Illinois, gave his life on the front lines during World War I. Paul Stout graduated in 1916 from Murphysboro High School and then enlisted in the Marine Corps in February of 1918. In June of 1918, he was deployed to the front lines. At age 20, he was killed in action in France in July of 1918. For his heroic actions, he was awarded the Purple Heart and Bronze Star with a V device for valor. The Paul Stout American Legion Post 127 is my hometown American Legion Post in Murphysboro. It is named after Private Stout. I had the opportunity this last year to visit the battleground at Belleau Wood, where he fought just a month and a half before passing in a battle later on farther into France. I can tell you it was a truly moving experience. Although memories may fade over time, we must never forget those who served and gave their lives in defense of freedom and liberty in every war across this great globe. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF BRONSON KALILOA (Ms. GABBARD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Hawaii County Police Officer Bronson Kaliloa, who died yesterday after being fatally shot Tuesday night during a traffic stop in Mountain View. Bronson was just 46 years old, a father of three, a graduate of Waimea High School on Kauai, a 10year veteran of the police force and a public servant recognized by his community, fellow officers, and family and friends as oneofakind because of his dedication to service, his kindness, and heart of aloha. He was part of the Puna Patrol Division, who, over the last few months, have been working around the clock to support their community in crisis, due to the ongoing volcanic activity and lava flow, helping residents who have been displaced from their homes, businesses, and farms. We mourn with the community of Puna, the Hawaii Police Department, and Bron’s ohana he left behind: Casey, Samson, Grace, and Nathan. We can never forget the sacrifices our law enforcement officers and their families make every single day to serve and protect. 
YOUTH EXCHANGE AND STUDY ABROAD PROGRAM (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the KennedyLugar Youth Exchange and Study Abroad program, otherwise known as the YES program. Sponsored by the Department of State and funded by Congress, the YES program is celebrating 15 years of connecting the world. Established after the September 11 attacks, high school students from across the country spend an academic year in countries with a significant Muslim population. The students live with a host family, attend a local high school, and engage in activities to learn about their host country’s society and values. In turn, the students share American culture and values with the people of their host country. I recently met with a YES program participant from Pennsylvania’s Fifth District, Jocelyn Krieger from Port Matilda. This past academic year, Jocelyn lived and learned in Bosnia. She and numerous other students were able to participate in this important cultural exchange that fosters understanding and collaboration between people of different backgrounds. Mr. Speaker, I know that this great program will continue to grow and connect cultures to truly build a global community. f 
ENDING HARASSMENT IN THE WORKPLACE (Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support the bipartisan, bicameral EMPOWER Act. The goal of this consequential legislation is simple: create safe workplaces and a society where everyone can thrive. We all have the right to work in a safe environment, but over the past months we have heard stories of individuals from all walks of life. We have seen how widespread harassment is, and the culture of silence. In fact, according to the EEOC, it is estimated that 90 percent of harassment incidents never get reported. That is why we need this bill. The EMPOWER Act outlines what sexual harassment is, creates systems that foster accountability, and removes the fear of retaliation that keeps so many victims from coming forward. By removing that fear of reporting, eradicating deceptive nondisclosure agreements, and increasing transparency, we are taking meaningful steps to make our workplaces harassmentfree and creating a culture of respect throughout society. From Harvey Weinstein to factory floors to Time’s Up and the #MeToo movement, we are going from a moment to a movement to action. I ask that my colleagues join me in supporting this bill. 
SUPPORT FOR ICE (Mr. ALLEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in overwhelming support for the officers who carry out the important mission of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, better known as ICE. These brave individuals are saddled with the responsibility of facing some of the world’s most dangerous and violent criminals, like MS–13 and many who traffic drugs and humans, and others who wish to do us harm. Yesterday, 35 Members voted against supporting this important area of our law enforcement. Not supporting our law enforcement and ICE is just plain wrong and endangers American lives. ICE ensures the defense and security of the United States through the identification, investigation, apprehension, and deportation of foreign nationals that pose a threat of any kind to U.S. national security. We are a country of laws, and they must be enforced. I will vote time and again to support these brave officers, and I stand here today to thank them for their service and for the sacrifice that they and their families make each and every day as they keep our communities as safe as possible. f 
CLIMATE CHANGE (Ms. LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H. Con. Res. 119, which is a shameful denial of the clear evidence of climate change and its impact on our planet. Let me be clear. There is no greater threat to the future of this planet than climate change. But instead of offering solutions, Republicans are burying their heads in the sand once again. Here are the facts. Climate change is real, it is manmade, and every day that Congress fails to act, we are making the problem worse. The cost of inaction is astronomical. If we do nothing it is our grandchildren who will be left with the price tag. The truth is, Mr. Speaker, that we can pass policies that dramatically reduce greenhouse gases and build our economy. California, my home State, is 4 years ahead of schedule on our greenhouse gas emission reduction goals and green jobs have grown exponentially. We have over 300,000 people working in the green job industry, by far the most in the country. So, no, Mr. Speaker, this carbon tax fearmongering won’t work because Americans understand that the true threat to our economy is from climate change, which is already wreaking havoc on our planet. I urge my colleagues to reject this resolution and, instead, get to the real work of addressing climate change. 
b0915 EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT A CARBON TAX WOULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO THE UNITED STATES ECONOMY Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1001, I call up the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 119) expressing the sense of Congress that a carbon tax would be detrimental to the United States economy, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House. The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. VALADAO ). Pursuant to House Resolution 1001, the concurrent resolution is considered as read. The text of the concurrent resolution is as follows: 
H. C ON. RES. 119 Whereas a carbon tax is a Federal tax on carbon released from fossil fuels; Whereas a carbon tax will increase energy prices, including the price of gasoline, electricity, natural gas, and home heating oil; Whereas a carbon tax will mean that families and consumers will pay more for essentials like food, gasoline, and electricity; Whereas a carbon tax will fall hardest on the poor, the elderly, and those on fixed incomes; Whereas a carbon tax will lead to more jobs and businesses moving overseas; Whereas a carbon tax will lead to less economic growth; Whereas American families will be harmed the most from a carbon tax; Whereas, according to the Energy Information Administration, in 2016, fossil fuels share of energy consumption was 81 percent; Whereas a carbon tax will increase the cost of every good manufactured in the United States; Whereas a carbon tax will impose disproportionate burdens on certain industries, jobs, States, and geographic regions and would further restrict the global competitiveness of the United States; Whereas American ingenuity has led to innovations in energy exploration and development and has increased production of domestic energy resources on private and State owned land which has created significant job growth and private capital investment; Whereas United States energy policy should encourage continued private sector innovation and development and not increase the existing tax burden on manufacturers; Whereas the production of American energy resources increases the United States ability to maintain a competitive advantage in today’s global economy; Whereas a carbon tax would reduce America’s global competitiveness and would encourage development abroad in countries that do not impose this exorbitant tax burden; and Whereas the Congress and the President should focus on progrowth solutions that encourage increased development of domestic resources: Now, therefore, be it Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that a carbon tax would be detrimental to American families and businesses, and is not in the best interest of the United States. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The concurrent resolution shall be debatable for 1 hour, equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. MARCHANT ) and the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. NEAL) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. 
Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H. Con. Res. 119, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I thank leadership for bringing this resolution to the floor for consideration. I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 119, which would express the sense of Congress that a carbon tax would be detrimental to the U.S. economy. This resolution will send a clear signal to the American people that we oppose policies that would drive up energy prices for families and for businesses. A standalone carbon tax generally would have such detrimental effects on the economy and would be an unwarranted and transparent grab for revenue. The adverse economic effects of such a tax would be felt throughout the economy, falling hardest on the most vulnerable: the young, the poor, the elderly, and those living on fixed incomes. An Obama administration proposal in 2016 for a $10 tax on every barrel of oil would have translated into an increase at the gas pump of approximately 25 cents per gallon for every American consumer. Similarly, a standalone carbon tax would increase the price of gasoline, natural gas, home heating oil, and electricity. American families would feel the pain immediately when they buy gas or diesel to get them to their jobs every day. American families would also feel the pain when they turn on the lights or adjust the thermostat in their homes every day. The cost burden of a carbon tax also would, correspondingly, increase the price of everything consumers buy every day—in short, everything from a carton of milk to a pair of shoes, to a bicycle, to an automobile. The price increases on goods with fixed demand that would result from such a tax would directly harm millions of Americans whose incomes mean that they must budget carefully in advance to afford just the basic necessities of life. In addition, a carbon tax would hit at a time when the industries that it targets are just now recovering from a very damaging economic period of our lives. With a reformed Tax Code built for growth and rollback of burdensome regulations, American businesses and their workers are finally making a comeback, and we are seeing great optimism about our economic future. Now is not the time to debate placing additional burdens on industries that are trying to help us keep the lights on. This resolution makes clear that we oppose policies that would drive up energy prices, damage the U.S. economy, reduce the American GDP, and hurt American jobs. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am discouraged to come to the floor today as we squander the valuable time of this body arguing over a pointless resolution that will accomplish nothing for the people of America, whether it is accepted or rejected—nothing. Let’s be clear about what this resolution does and does not do. We are not arguing today over whether this body will or will not adopt a tax on carbon emissions. This resolution, and I am quoting, expresses the sense of Congress about a carbon tax. So what we are trying to achieve, apparently, this morning is a discussion of the mood of Congress. Well, we should hold some hearings about the mood of Congress, because I would submit that it is not a very pleasant time to be working on Capitol Hill. Nothing in this exercise is going to have anything to do with a carbon tax. This is better suited to a high school debate than it is to the United States House of Representatives. There are plenty of people across the country who need real help and real action from this Congress. Every day, American families, people far from this building, far from this city, are struggling with real problems and real challenges. They feel their standard of living has not improved. They want to feel some security, security that their jobs will stick around—how about holding some hearings on pensions?—security that they can count on health insurance, security that one day they will be able to retire with dignity, security that they will be able to launch their kids into a successful and happy life. So, on this Thursday morning, the Republican leadership has brought up a sense of the mood of Congress on carbon. We could choose to bring forward legislation that actually would help American families today. We could help them meet many of the challenges that they have. Instead, we are using our precious remaining legislative days to hold an amateur hour on a debate about something that is not going to happen. This is a vacuous gesture, empty in every form. It is a political stunt. It is not worthy of the time or the attention of this body. 
When I go home and talk to my constituents and my neighbors, they want to hear what I, along with the Members of this Chamber, intend to do to ensure that their hard work still translates into a decent life. Something around us is clearly out of step. There is a growing anxiety around the country that is bigger than our political differences and divide. It is a building sense that, at some point when we all perhaps were not looking, the system became stacked against ordinary people; the rules changed, and hard work isn’t enough any longer to guarantee that you can make it in America. The unemployment rate, for sure, is low, but 65 percent of Americans worry about having enough money to pay their bills. Yes, we can say this morning that downward pressure on wages, essentially, has kept those wages flat for the American people despite the fact that the unemployment rate is advertised at about 4 percent. One in five Americans has more credit card debt than emergency savings. Less than 40 percent of the people in this country have enough savings to cover a $1,000 emergency room visit or, for that matter, car repair. It is plain to see in my own district. We have seen the challenges that the people back in western Massachusetts face every single day. Despite the talk of growth in the stock market—which, by the way, has been going up since October of 2009—their salaries have barely moved. Home prices have gone up by 9 percent in our market last year. A gallon of gas costs 28 percent more than last year. Electricity bills in Massachusetts are up 21 percent over last year. Childcare, saving for college, and, again, retirement and pensions, healthcare premiums—Mr. Speaker, people are having trouble keeping up. Teachers have to pick up jobs waiting on tables or driving for Uber. Families need to juggle multiple jobs just to get by. But today’s economy, apparently, isn’t hard on the top 1 percent in America. Last year, the average bonus on Wall Street—and listen to this number, average—$185,000. It rose 17 percent after our Republican colleagues passed their tax bill last year. That is three times what most American families bring home in an entire year. It seems like things used to be easier. Do you know why? Because they were easier. Americans born in the 1940s had a 92 percent chance of earning a higher income than their parents had at age 30. Those born in the 1980s have a 50 percent chance of doing so. The tax bill that Republicans passed last year, without a single hearing in all of 51 days—and not, incidentally, with one Democratic vote—will make things substantially worse for these families. People don’t really need to hear these statistics. Intuitively, they know what has happened. Three out of four Americans are not confident that their children will grow up to be better off than they were, and they have every right to be worried. Healthcare used to be easier to afford. The new Republican tax law raised premiums by 15 percent and weakened protections for millions of Americans with preexisting conditions. Then Republicans wanted to slash $500 billion out of the Medicare program so that many of our family members who depend on it will be even more challenged. What have families gotten from the Republicans on healthcare? Higher deductibles, higher costs, and plans that cover much less. The cost of a 4year degree at a public college has doubled since 1996. The basic ticket into the middle class is out of reach for too many of our young people today. The ones who do manage to scrape by far too often accumulate debt that makes homeownership or starting a family a long way off. Other family budget essentials just keep climbing, too. As I noted, gas prices are up 27 percent from last year. Childcare costs rose for the fifth year in a row. This year, a week of infant childcare at a daycare center is $211. Mr. Speaker, there are concrete actions that we might take right here in this Chamber to support these families. We could spend today working on college affordability. How about some pension hearings to talk about what is happening in the central States as well as the challenges that retirement faces for the American family? And how do we help more people afford that first home or help their parents, once again, prepare for a secure retirement? We are nearly out of time to get things done in this Congress. We are down to less than 25 legislative days before the midterm elections. If we plan to do anything about the pressing issues facing Americans, this is the time to step it up. But, instead of trying to broker solutions or offer ideas, the Republican leadership has opted to hold a shadow debate. It doesn’t matter how this vote turns out. Let me repeat that. It doesn’t matter how this vote turns out. The outcome is going to be identical. Nothing on this issue will change because of what we are doing this morning. Nothing will change. That contentment with the status quo may be fine for my Republican colleagues, but it is not going to help the families whom I represent. In fact, it pretty much reinforces their doubts about the very work of Congress. Listen, if you want to debate a carbon tax, let’s hold some hearings. Let’s hold some discussions about a carbon tax. Let’s find out what it would mean for the economy. We might use that moment to test what offshore drilling does for oil as part of the carbon tax discussion or for the families in western Massachusetts. Let’s find out what impact it would have on fossil fuel emissions and economic growth. Let’s think strategically about how it might affect our geopolitics. If you want to have this debate, then let’s have a real debate through hearings in the regular order. This resolution is really meaningless. The outcome will be nothing, no matter what the final vote turns out to be. It is a waste of all of our time this morning, and we ought to be devoting that time to meeting the challenges that the American people expect us to meet. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. MARSHALL ). Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for introducing this resolution. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support this resolution. This anticarbon tax resolution expresses the sense of Congress that a carbon tax will be detrimental to the United States economy and certainly is not a waste of anyone’s time. As a physician, typically, what I like to do is examine the risk and benefit analysis of any treatment plan, and I apply that same standard to a situation like this. b0930 I want to know the risk and benefit of any new tax that might be considered. A carbon tax would raise costs on everything Americans buy, from electricity and gasoline to food and everyday household products, with little or any benefit. Mr. Speaker, when we introduce a new tax or consider a new tax, I want to know who it would impact the most. Who I think this would impact the most is that single mom I delivered about 10 years ago. She has 2 children at home. She is working 60 hours a week. This is going to impact her more than anybody else, because she is just trying to get by with the income she is making. This is going to drive the cost up for her children’s school lunches. It is going to drive the cost up for her gasoline to get to and from work. That single mom will be impacted by this carbon tax. This resolution will put Congress on record against a carbon tax, which would result in massive job losses, lead to higher prices for American families and small businesses, and jeopardize America’s energy security. Mr. Speaker, this President and this Congress have been fighting for American energy dominance, and a carbon tax would undermine that goal. I am so proud of what my producers back home have done in the oil and gas industry to have a cleaner product. What the refineries are doing today compared to when I was growing up, a little boy in El Dorado, Kansas, living between two refineries, I am proud of how the electrical generation has improved ecologically as well. This resolution will affirm the position of Congress that a carbon tax 
would counter the goals of American energy dominance, economic growth, and national security. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. THOMPSON ), a very important member of the Ways and Means Committee. Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding. Mr. Speaker, let’s be real clear. There is not a carbon tax bill before us today. This is a political stunt, and this stunt comes at the same time that the Republican majority is undermining access to affordable healthcare for all our constituents. They are working with this administration to sabotage the healthcare marketplaces and drive up prices, legislating away coverage and protections for our constituents. They have gutted resources that help people enroll in the plans that are best for them. They are expanding junk healthcare plans that don’t provide care if you are sick or injured, that can charge more for preexisting conditions, that charge more for older people. Their scam of a tax bill eliminated the individual mandate, driving healthier folks away from coverage. That means risk can’t be spread and prices go up. Kids born with heart problems or young adults diagnosed with cancer will pay a penalty for the rest of their lives. On top of all of that, the administration has frozen the risk adjustment payments, which prevent insurance companies from cherrypicking only the healthiest people to cover. According to PricewaterhouseCoopers, Republican sabotage efforts will increase the cost of health insurance by as much as 24 percent this year alone. These are some of the issues that are hurting the middle class now, and these are some of the issues that we should be focusing on. We should be holding hearings on these issues. If you have concerns with other issues, have hearings on them. But don’t bring some political malarkey on the floor and pretend that we are doing something for the American people. This is a failure by the majority party. We should be working for our constituents on real bills that are before us now. Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. SCALISE ), the majority whip. Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Texas for yielding and for bringing this legislation to the floor. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support as the lead author of H. Con. Res. 119, along with my colleague from West Virginia (Mr. MCKINLEY ). Mr. Speaker, the question is real simple, and that is, do we support or oppose a carbon tax? I think the case is very clear by anybody who looks objectively at what a carbon tax will do to the economy. It will be devastating to our manufacturing base. It will kill jobs. I think most devastating, Mr. Speaker, it would raise and increase costs for families all across this country. If you look at this chart right here, it talks about the estimate, what this would do to families. There would be an increase by an estimated $1,900 per family on the cost of things that they buy all across this country. The resolution is simple. It says: ‘‘Be it resolved by the House.’’ That is, it is the sense of Congress that a carbon tax would be detrimental to American families and businesses, and is not in the best interest of the United States. ‘‘Yes’’ or ‘‘no,’’ it is a clear ‘‘yes’’ vote if you are concerned about families. Why don’t we talk about some of the groups in support. The Council for Citizens Against Government Waste says that: ‘‘A carbon tax would harm the U.S. economy by raising the cost of all goods and services, imposing an unfair burden on the lower and middle class, and deterring new investment, thereby killing jobs.’’ Why don’t we listen to what the American Farm Bureau Federation said about a carbon tax: ‘‘Agriculture is an energyintensive sector, and a carbon tax levied on farmers and ranchers would be devastating.’’ Then, Mr. Speaker, let’s listen to what Grover Norquist from Americans for Tax Reform said: ‘‘A carbon tax would kill American jobs by the millions.’’ Why would we want to allow the possibility? Believe me, there are some people in Washington who are talking about trying to bring a carbon tax. To act like, oh, there is no talk about it at all, clearly, there are people here in this Chamber that want to impose a carbon tax. Let’s be clear about how devastating that would be to the American economy. Everybody gets to take a position on this today, Mr. Speaker. You are either for a carbon tax or against it. I would urge strong support for H. Con. Res. 119. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I wonder what the Farm Bureau says about the tariffs on agricultural products across the country. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. LARSON), my neighbor and good friend, a wellinformed member of the Ways and Means Committee. Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, let me associate myself with the remarks of Mr. NEAL and talk about what a fraud this whole process has become. I have great respect for the gentleman from Louisiana, but can you imagine never having a hearing on this. Let me tell you who would like to come to that hearing: Jim Baker, a devout, you know, liberal. You have George Shultz, Martin Feldstein, Greg Mankiw, Hank Paulson, Art Laffer, Gary Cohn, Rex Tillerson, to name a few, who say that Congress ought to at least be open to looking at a carbon tax. According to the other side, it is a choice between a carbon tax or not a carbon tax. They don’t talk about passing on the benefits to the consumer. They don’t talk about the transition that is needed or strengthening the pension funds or even from the standpoint of an infrastructure bill that they have never addressed in 8 years while China moves ahead of us every single day. Nothing gets done in the House of Representatives. Here we have a fake debate and fake legislation that is going nowhere instead of actual, real hearings. We don’t have real hearings on Social Security and its outcome. We don’t have real hearings on gun violence. We don’t even have real hearings here on the state of what is going on with this administration and the FBI and our intelligence people. This is the sad state of affairs that we find ourselves in. So if you see frustration on this side of the aisle, it is primarily because, in the most demonstrative democracy in the world, not even a hearing, a suggestion about bringing experts to talk about what this could possibly do. What a sham. Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. GROTHMAN ). Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I came down to the floor today to address the resolution we have talked about regarding the carbon tax, but since then, I think something else has come up. We just heard one of my colleagues, I think, kind of belittle Uber drivers and waiters and waitresses. I tell you, when I take an Uber, I don’t think it is something that you have to resort to, to take that job. I think it is a very hard job, going all about the city, being able to get along with sometimes difficult people, working nights. Waiters and waitresses, same thing. I have worked in kitchens. I don’t think one should say that one has to resort to these jobs. It is kind of a thing that some Congressmen have around here that I don’t like. They become removed, and they sometimes think that they are more important than people doing other jobs. I think those are both fine jobs. I respect the Uber drivers who drive me around this city. I used to work in a kitchen, and I respect the waiters and waitresses. I don’t believe one should describe working as an Uber driver or a waiter and a waitress as something people have to resort to. They are fine jobs. Now, I guess I came down here for the carbon tax. I will point out that I think the carbon tax, if implemented and people throw it out there, the carbon tax will fall on the average guy the most. It is something that falls on people who drive a car, which will be a regressive tax. It falls on people who heat 
their homes, which will be a regressive tax. It bothers me, particularly when disproportionately it comes from the party that purports to represent the average guy, that when they think of a new tax to apply out there, they are going to promote a tax that disproportionately affects the average guy, because everybody has a heat bill, almost everybody has a car. I think, among the other things that would cause a damper on the American economy, I don’t like taxes that disproportionately hit the average guy. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I don’t think anybody was demeaning the work that people do, on this side. I think we were talking about the challenging nature of our economy. I don’t think the gentleman would dispute the fact that the gig economy has created a downward pressure on wages. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS), the voice of Chicago and a well known and wellregarded member of the Ways and Means Committee. Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise to express strong opposition to this resolution, which is nothing more than political posturing. This nonbinding resolution does nothing to control increases in healthcare premiums. Republican actions have wreaked havoc in the healthcare market, driving up healthcare costs for Americans, especially older Americans. This nonbinding resolution does nothing to limit skyrocketing drug prices after giving tens of billions of dollars in tax cuts to the drug industry. The Chicago Fire Department was in to see me this week, and they talked about the high cost of drugs. For example, the cost of nitroglycerin tripled over 4 years from $37 to $120. The cost of naloxone more than doubled during this time period. If the Chicago Fire Department is having trouble paying for pharmaceuticals, then you can imagine what smaller entities would be experiencing. This resolution does nothing to increase jobs, nothing to help parents afford the high cost of childcare and college. It is indeed a donothing resolution. That is exactly what it does. I will vote against it. Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. MULLIN ). Mr. MULLIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of my colleague’s resolution, H. Con. Res. 119, which expresses the sense of Congress that a carbon tax would be detrimental to the United States. A carbon tax is a tax on the American consumer and our economy. A carbon tax would significantly—I want to repeat that—significantly drive up the cost of the fuels that drive our way of life, and result in millions and millions of jobs lost. This burden would be unfairly shouldered by the lower and middle class incomes. The nonpartisan—I want to say that—the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, CBO, in 2013 stated: ‘‘A carbon tax would increase the price of fossil fuels in direct proportion to their carbon content. Higher fuel prices, in turn, would raise production costs and ultimately drive up prices for goods and services throughout the economy.’’ A study from the National Association of Manufacturers found that a carbon tax could drive up gasoline costs between $6 and $14 per gallon, and lead to as many as 21 million jobs lost, a continually shrinking economy, and lowering our Federal revenue, all without doing anything to improve global greenhouse gas emissions. b0945 Just yesterday, the House passed my amendment to prohibit funds from implementing the Obama administration’s social costs of carbon rule. The facts are clear. A carbon tax is not the way to protect our environment and economy. The social costs of a carbon tax far outweigh the potential benefits. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. JUDY CHU), a very knowledgeable woman from the Ways and Means Committee. Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H. Con. Res. 119. This resolution is nothing more than an election year stunt by Republicans to distract from the growing list of issues they failed to address this Congress. Let me be clear: This vote is a sham. If Republicans truly wanted to debate the merits of a carbon tax, they would allow the Ways and Means Committee to hold hearings with expert testimony and robust discussion. In fact, multiple members of our committee have already introduced bills that tackle the everpressing issue of climate change, which is impacting the health and well being of American families and future generations more and more each day. This is not just a Democratic concern either. There is even a Republican carbon tax bill expected to be introduced in the coming days. Instead, here we are, wasting what little time we have left this Congress, debating a pointless resolution while there are urgent problems waiting to be resolved. Congress should be passing legislation to address the doubledigit increases in healthcare premiums caused by the repeal of the individual mandate by the GOP tax scam or reuniting immigrant children with their parents. The fact is, Mr. Speaker, this vote is a wasted opportunity and just another example of Republicans placing political expedience over regular order. As a member of both the Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition and the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus, I would love to participate in a real debate about how we can address climate change. My constituents are clamoring for us to act. But if Republicans are going to continue to ignore and deny the existence of this crisis, the least they can do here, in Congress, is to use this time to legislate, not electioneer. Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. JOHNSON ). Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning in strong support of the resolution, and I thank my good friend and colleague from Louisiana, STEVE SCALISE , for bringing it to the floor. The carbon tax is one of those endlessly recycled bad ideas. A carbon tax would put a tax and increased costs on coal, oil, and gas carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and other sources. In simpler terms, a carbon tax is a tax on productivity. As anyone with the slightest familiarity with economics will tell you, the more you tax something, the less you get of it. It is just common sense. Late last year, Congress was able to deliver historic tax reform. Just 7 months after we passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, nearly every economic indicator is showing recordbreaking success. The free market has been unleashed again, and our economy is thriving as a result. We are on pace for a quarter of economic growth that we haven’t seen in more than a decade. Imposing a jobkilling carbon tax minimizes the gains we have made and will stunt our economic growth. Of course, the carbon tax would run counter to the goals of American energy dominance and national security, another priority this administration and this Congress have been able to make great progress in. A carbon tax would have a negative effect on consumption, investment, and jobs; increase the cost of coal, natural gas, and petroleum products; and lead to lower real wage rates, lower labor productivity, and decreased worker incomes. Imposing a carbon tax on hardworking Americans sets the Nation backward. After all the accomplishments we have made in the last year and a half, that is something we simply should not tolerate. A carbon tax asks the entire Nation to make enormous sacrifices, and the only thing we get in return is falling behind our competitors in the global marketplace. We have a broad array of leaders across the spectrum in the economy who support and agree with these principles. Harry Alford, president of the National Black Chamber of Congress, said: ‘‘Our great Nation is at a crossroads. We can continue to reduce regulations and watch our economy rise with the recent tax reform. Bringing unnecessary hurdles before us like a 
carbon tax will preclude that growth and hurt our economy immensely.’’ I have pages and pages of these. Heather Higgins, CEO of the Independent Women’s Voice, said: ‘‘A carbon tax would be devastating to millions of American women and their families, causing their electricity bills and transportation costs to skyrocket, as well as suppressing their wages.’’ Chet Thompson, president of the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, said: ‘‘Energy is the engine of progress. Making it more expensive will hurt our economy and disproportionately impact middle and lowincome families who can least afford it.’’ If we had time, Mr. Speaker, I could be here all day. I have pages and pages of these quotes in support of the principle that we are advocating here this morning. Mr. Speaker, we have to support this resolution, and I urge my colleagues to do that. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DOGGETT ), a wellregarded member of the Ways and Means Committee. We are certain he will add clarity to this debate. Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, in this very troubling week, when these same Republican enablers here in Congress have endangered our national security by failing to confront Donald Trump’s surrender to Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, today, we again witness their total indifference to another very serious national security concern. Unfortunately, just as their refusal to stand up to Trump’s denial of this ongoing Russian aggression won’t make it go away as a grave threat to our democracy, neither will their ignoring the national security challenge of climate change eliminate reality. In recent years, the war, the challenge, that these Republicans have been most willing to fight is the war on reality. They particularly find troubling any scientific fact that conflicts with their last campaign rally or their rigid ideology. This Administration actually prohibited the Centers for Disease Control from including, in its budget documents to Congress, the terms ‘‘evidencebased’’ or ‘‘sciencebased.’’ They don’t want to rely on science as fact. They have questioned and harassed scientists across America so much that you have to begin to wonder whether they still believe in gravity. Across America, we are seeing, with our own eyes, what they refuse to acknowledge: soaring temperatures, severe and erratic records being set in our weather, massive 100year floods that seem to recur every 100 months, deep freezes, and ravaging hurricanes that dumped 60 inches of rain in one short period of time on the City of Houston. Often at the same time that these disasters are occurring in other parts of America we see: record droughts, and wildfires destroying thousands of acres, livelihoods, and homes. All across the country, particularly in the southern States, seldom seen diseases, like West Nile virus and Lyme disease, are afflicting more and more of our neighbors. During the lifetime of my grandchildren, I know that my home State of Texas, America’s number one greenhouse gas polluter, is on schedule to become a very different place, with more of the State looking like the Sonoran Desert. At the same time, our coastal areas, like those that stretch all the way to New England, will find themselves submerged and major metropolitan areas subject to serious harm from storm surges. Meanwhile, we will see, not in the future, but right now, thousands of premature deaths every year because of air pollutants that are associated with carbon emissions. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas. Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, around the world, the very severe impact of climate change has already been identified as a major contributing factor to the disaster in Syria, conflict in Africa, and what is becoming a growing number of climate refugees. Trump’s own Defense Secretary has acknowledged the need to address climate change and the impact on our military. The Scientific American has reported that climate change presents a significant and direct risk to the U.S. military, its readiness, operations, and strategy. We must treat this as a national security threat. When you have a security threat, you don’t just rely on one weapon. A carbon tax that is revenue neutral, that does not take any new tax revenue than the tax it replaces, is one of the tools that should not be rejected without even having a hearing to evaluate it. The likelihood of a carbon tax in our future will not be changed by this silly resolution. But as Republicans continue to reject all ways, any ways, of addressing the climate change national security challenge, the future of our planet and our families remains endangered every bit as much as they endanger us by yielding to Vladimir Putin. Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. MCKINLEY ), who was an original cosponsor of this resolution. Mr. MCKINLEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank Majority Whip SCALISE for his work on this issue. Mr. Speaker, as the lead cosponsor on this legislation, I, obviously, rise in strong support of H. Con. Res. 119. Throughout the years, despite what we are hearing from the other side, there have been numerous efforts promoting a carbon tax. There have been bills debated in committees; hearings held; and, subsequently, time devoted on the House floor. None were passed. Carbon taxes, however, create uncertainty in the marketplace. Such a tax might reduce the amount of energy produced from coal and natural gas. I understand that. But as you have heard, it will also raise the cost of everything else Americans consume: gasoline, diesel fuel, food, clothing, and supplies. All would become more expensive. We heard also that CBO and Stanford studies have warned that a carbon tax is the most regressive tax that could be implemented. And its impact on the poor and the middle class is at a rate of twice others. This is a simple resolution stating that a carbon tax would be detrimental to American families and businesses, and it is not in the best interest of this country. Now, just last Congress, this very same resolution passed 237–163, and it is our hope that this year’s effort will reflect the same bipartisan level of support. Thanks to tax cuts and regulatory reform, America’s economy is clearly on the rise. Implementing a carbon tax at this juncture could very well put the brakes on that progress. So instead of reverting to put an ideologically driven tax on everything, there are better ways to address environmental concerns. We could invest strategically in research and innovation to deliver clean energy technologies, like has been done at NET Power, Petra Nova, or Longview. We could provide incentives, like 45Q, to capture and utilize carbon emissions. Or, lastly, we could advance energy efficiency. Mr. Speaker, America doesn’t need more taxes. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. SHIMKUS ). (Mr. SHIMKUS asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, to my friend RICHARD NEAL, I understand the frustrations of this debate and some of the processes, but this gives us a chance to come down to the floor and just talk about the basic policy of: Is a carbon tax good, or is it not good? I can’t speak to the process. All I can talk about is the policy. Congressman DOGGETT was down here talking about national security issues. I deal with this quite a bit in my role as the chair of the Baltic Caucus and doing some NATO Parliamentary Assembly things. Let me just speak briefly about a concern of what a carbon tax does in international energy fights and disbursements. Here I hold a picture—and I wanted to get it on the chart, but I wasn’t able 
to—of an LNG terminal called Independence. Now, this terminal is in Lithuania, and they are able to decrease their reliance on Russian natural gas because they have built this import terminal. b1000 They are able to now have two folks in which to import natural gas, thus relieving themselves of being extorted by the Russian Federation. A carbon tax would increase the cost of our exported goods to countries like Lithuania, making them more susceptible to energy extortion by the Russian Federation. So in an international debate of an energy policy which the Russian Federation does extort—how do I know this? I know this because, in the early days of the reestablishment of freedom, a U.S. company bought a refinery in Lithuania. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. MARCHANT. I yield the gentleman from Illinois an additional 1 minute. Mr. SHIMKUS. So the Russians didn’t like a U.S. company buying an old refinery, so what did the Russians do? They turned off the flow of oil. So just in the international world, if we want to help our allies decrease their reliance on imported crude oil from the Russian Federation or, in this case, liquefied natural gas, a carbon tax will make that more difficult. So that is why I think it is important that we have this debate on the international perspective. I also know that a lot of the organizations that are important to me—the American Energy Alliance, Americans for Tax Reform, the Farm Bureau, Western Energy Alliance, American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, National Black Chamber of Commerce, Competitive Enterprise Institute, and FreedomWorks—all support the resolution that says a carbon tax is kind of the wrong way to go because it increases costs on everybody, from the goods that we sell till we transport them to the market, across the board. So I appreciate the time. And again, we want to be the world leader in oil and gas exports, and a carbon tax will prohibit us from being able to do that. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I want to compliment the previous speaker, my friend, Mr. SHIMKUS , on the notion of process, calling up the notion of process. So here we have had a debate where we have sparred for the better part of an hour, and we are debating a topic on which there have been no hearings. Now, let me guess. This is consistent with how the tax bill was done in, incidentally, 51 days, without a hearing or without a witness. So we are being asked to vote on something today, here, on which there has been no opportunity to place the magnifying glass of critical scrutiny on the proposal that is in front of us because, the truth is, what is in front of us is a question about the mood of Congress. I think all 435 of us could testify to what the mood of Congress is right now, so I don’t think it would be one of the more challenging events that we would confront. But the idea that this is brought in front of the Congress without any opportunity for anybody to examine the underlying legislation and the thrust of what the regular order might impel contributes to the frustration that the American people feel about the institution and its priorities. So as we have wrapped up this debate over a piece of legislation that will accomplish zip, zero, nothing, it literally does not matter how the vote turns out because the sole purpose of this resolution is to express, once again, the mood of Congress. I am happy to express the mood of Congress any time that they want, happy to have a hearing on the mood of Congress if that is what they think might get us to a more sound proposal of energy independence, the use of renewables. But no, instead they bring up a piece of legislation here that is going to test how we feel about things this morning. I think that the mood we should focus on is the mood of the American people. The people I talk to are under stress. They are tired. They are exhausted from working one, two jobs. Labor participation rates at 62.9 percent, 2 million people with opioid addictions, I wonder what their mood is as they listen to the discussion that we have had here on this floor. They are anxious about their future. They are feeling squeezed because, for years now, the economy has been leaving them a little bit further behind. And I say that about wage growth. Wages have flatlined for the better part of almost 13 years in America. And now, even as we see some glimmer of hope, the truth is the cost of gasoline and the cost of inflation is going to stagnate their wages again. So paychecks have been stuck at the same level, and all the things that families need to get by have been getting more and more expensive. Housing, healthcare, college, childcare, utilities, those bills keep growing, but the salaries somehow don’t keep up. Why don’t we have a hearing about the mood of people who have not seen any real wage increases—then we would get a better flavor for the debate that we are having today—rather than the mood of Congress on a piece of legislation that has had no hearings and no vetting? So what about a hearing on the mood of our retirement system? What about a hearing on the mood of a child’s education? Why don’t we begin to talk about some of those issues? Why don’t we just have some hearings on some of these issues? Young people are going tens of thousands of dollars into student loan debt just to try to get a decent start in life. What about their mood? Seniors are seeing their fixed incomes stretched until they break, forcing far too many to choose between paying for their prescription drugs and their groceries. Let’s have a hearing on their mood. Parents cope with high childcare costs that can eat up most of their paycheck, but the small margin that is left over is important to keep that family going. Let’s have a hearing about their mood. The people I talk to, they are not asking for too much. Their expectations for their families aren’t out of line. Nobody is asking for a handout. They are asking for a hand up for opportunity. Everybody is working hard, but people feel like they are running as fast as they can up the down escalator. Let’s have a hearing on how they feel about those costs. It takes us an unreasonable amount of effort to stay in exactly the same place. Getting ahead feels more challenging and more difficult all the time. Last December, Republicans passed a catastrophic tax bill that gave away $2.3 trillion over 10 years—without a hearing, without a witness—in 51 days. What about the mood of the American people as they examine it? And we have seen the mood in public polling. The legislation we have today could have offered some relief to low and middleincome families, but Republicans chose to leave them out in the cold. In fact, it did so little for the average family that their cuts won’t begin to keep up with the rise in healthcare premiums or, for that matter, gasoline prices at the pump. Instead, the tax bill heaped giveaways on people who are already completely comfortable and thriving— more concentrated wealth. The people who elected us sent us here to do a job on their behalf, and we ought to take into consideration their mood. They have hired us to get things done for them, and we all take, I hope, that responsibility seriously. Our activity today has been unworthy of the trust they have placed in us. It has really been a hoax. They have just wasted all this time arguing over a sense of Congress about a carbon tax and the mood of Congress. I could have told them what the mood was here; they just have to ask me. This is going to be a pointless vote, meaningless in stature, and there will be no outcome whatsoever. This is political theater. It is not governing like responsible Representatives. I urge my colleagues in the majority to focus this body on accomplishing things in the future that really might help people who sent us here to do precisely that. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
For many years now, Republicans in Congress have been clear: A new stand alone carbon tax will raise consumer costs and hurt the economy. It is not a solution to any challenge but, rather, it would create additional challenges. If American businesses and workers in industries are targeted by a carbon tax, they will suffer economically under such a policy. They are just now recovering from the recession that we went into, and they are just now, because of the tax bill that was passed this past year, just now beginning to see a brighter economic future. We should not debate putting new obstacles in front of them at this time. Together, we should be focused on working to advance policies that hold down energy costs, improve the U.S. economy, its GDP, and create jobs. That is what we did last year, and that is what we are doing today. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 1001, the previous question is ordered. The question is on the concurrent resolution. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered.

DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2019 The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. BYRNE ). Pursuant to clause 1(c) of rule XIX, further consideration of the bill (H.R. 6147) making appropriations for the Department of the Interior, environment, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019, and for other purposes, will now resume. The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman from Illinois opposed to the bill? Mr. QUIGLEY. I am opposed. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve a point of order on the motion to recommit. The SPEAKER pro tempore. A point of order is reserved. The Clerk will report the motion to recommit. The Clerk read as follows: 
Mr. Quigley moves to recommit the bill H.R. 6147 to the Committee on Appropriations with instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith with the following amendment: Page 151, line 10, after the dollar amount pertaining to the ‘‘Fund for America’s Kids and Grandkids’’, insert ‘‘(reduced by $380,000,000)’’. Page 215, line 15, after the dollar amount pertaining to the ‘‘Election Assistance Commission’’, insert ‘‘(increased by $380,000,000)’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Illinois is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill which 
will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended. The Russians attacked our democracy. They will be back and we are not ready. The President is unwilling to meet this challenge, but we must be willing to meet this challenge. The last time our electoral process was called into question postBush Gore, this government spent $3.5 billion to upgrade our election systems because we treasured the integrity of our democracy. I hope we still do. Earlier this year, we appropriated $380 million to the Election Assistance Commission to provide grants for training, equipment, and software which will help States fortify and protect our election systems. This amendment appropriates an additional $380 million to grants that continue to improve those defenses because our election infrastructure remains outdated, low tech, and nowhere where it needs to be to prevent future intrusions. In the leadup to the 2016 elections, the Russians targeted the election systems of at least 21 States and as many as 39. Through the special counsel’s investigation, we now have the names of 12 Russian intelligence officers that carried it out. When President Trump was given the opportunity to challenge President Putin in Helsinki this week, he, instead, condemned his own intelligence agencies while praising the Russian President. Mr. Speaker, it was embarrassing, it was unAmerican, and it was a clear sign from the President that he will continue to stand by as President Putin orchestrates additional attacks on our democracy. This latest episode of capitulation to the Russians was a step too far for many of you. But tweets will not stop the Russians. This moment demands action. The Director of National Intelligence, Dan Coats, recently confirmed that the Russians continue to target our elections. Fortytwo States continue to use outdated voting machines susceptible to cyber intrusions. Thirteen States continue to use voting machines that fail to produce a paper ballot or record. The overwhelming demand for assistance is there. The EAC issued a public announcement just 3 days ago that every single State and eligible territory has requested grant funding with almost 90 percent of the existing funds already transferred out. But the amount distributed is only a fraction of what the States need. Election experts believe that the bare minimum required is $1.25 billion while this bill zeros out those grants. We now have the chance to do the right thing. Equipped with the new revelations from the Mueller investigation and the realization that President Trump will do absolutely nothing to defend our elections systems from foreign interference; and with Russia attempting to cast doubt, uncertainty, and suspicion over the integrity of our election process, now is the time to double down on our efforts to prevent election hacking. The American people are watching, and we must ensure that we, unlike our President, are on the right side of history during this pivotal moment in our democracy. Mr. Speaker, I yield the remainder of my time to the distinguished gentleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER ). Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, it would be inaccurate to say that this is a vote about process. It is a vote about substance. In fact, Mr. QUIGLEY ’s amendment is about one of the most pressing issues of our time. The Director of National Intelligence has said that there is a flashing red danger signal similar to the one that happened before 9/11. This amendment responds by providing for us to partner with our States to slam the door in the face of the Russian bear or any other adversary who seeks to steal the integrity of our elections. The flashing red light calls us to action. Surely we can rise above pandering to party and Putin to act on behalf of our freedom and our security. We have sworn an oath to defend our Constitution and our liberty against all enemies foreign and domestic. Mr. Speaker, you have the opportunity to do that today. Do so. Vote ‘‘yes’’ on this amendment for your country. Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reservation of my point of order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The reservation of a point of order is withdrawn. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to recommit. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, this legislation before us contains two important Appropriations bills: the Interior and Environmental bill and the Financial Services bill. The first of these two bills, the Interior bill, funds important programs that protect and promote our Nation’s resources. This includes vital funding to fight wildfires that threaten our communities across the Nation. The bill also invests in critical infrastructure that ensures American families have access to clean and safe drinking water; and, yes, this bill streamlines our Federal Government, returning the EPA to its core mission and cutting back regulatory red tape. The second bill, the Financial Services bill, helps make our Nation a safer place to live and helps our economy grow. The bill also targets resources to programs that will boost economic growth and opportunity, particularly for America’s small business people, as well as protects consumers and investors. In addition, the Financial Services bill helps enforce our laws providing necessary funding to support the Federal Court system, stopping financial and cybercrime, and fighting the opioid epidemic. Funding these Federal programs is a responsibility given to Congress by our Founding Fathers as part of the Constitution. Mr. Speaker, our committee has exercised the power of the purse through robust debate over the past 2 days, and now it is time to move forward with this legislation. Passage of this legislation will put us one step closer to completing all of our Appropriations bills as we promised in a timely fashion. Mr. Speaker, these are solid bills. They are worthy of your support. I urge my colleagues to reject the motion, and vote ‘‘yes’’ on the underlying bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to recommit. There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it. 
Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote. A recorded vote was ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule XX, this 5minute vote on the motion to recommit will be followed by 5minute votes on: Passage of the bill; and Agreeing to the Speaker’s approval of the Journal, if ordered.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise for the purpose of inquiring of the majority leader the schedule for the week to come. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCARTHY ), my friend, the majority leader. Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I am thankful that he is back with us, but at times I wish he weren’t as healthy as he is. I am just joking. (Mr. MCCARTHY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the House will meet at noon for morning hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business. Votes will be postponed until 6:30 p.m. On Tuesday and Wednesday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning hour and noon for legislative business. On Thursday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business. Last votes are expected no later than 3 p.m. On Friday, no votes are expected in the House. Mr. Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next week, a complete list of which will be announced by close of business tomorrow. In addition, the House will consider several bills aimed at giving Americans more affordable healthcare choices: First, the Protect Medical Innovation Act, sponsored by Representative ERIKPAULSEN . This bill would permanently repeal ObamaCare’s burdensome medical device tax. Doing so will create jobs, promote research, and allow for innovation that could lead to the next generation of lifesaving medical technologies; Next, the Increasing Access to Lower Premium Plans and Expanding Health Savings Accounts Act, sponsored by Representative PETER ROSKAM . This package would expand access to lower cost healthcare options, encourage healthcare savings, and put a 2year delay on ObamaCare’s health insurance tax, which drives up costs of insurance for almost every American; Finally, the Restoring Access to Medication and Modernizing Health Savings Accounts Act, sponsored by Representative LYNNJENKINS . This bill would transform and modernize health savings accounts and allow for more innovation in healthcare delivery. I look forward to the House passing all three of these critical bills without delay. Mr. Speaker, we also hope to vote on the conference report to accompany H.R. 5515, the National Defense Authorization Act. This House is committed to rebuilding our military and ensuring our brave men and women in uniform have the equipment and training they need to successfully carry out their mission. I want to thank the Armed Services Committee for their hard work on this bill, especially their chairman, MAC THORNBERRY , and I look forward to another big bipartisan vote. Finally, Mr. Speaker, additional legislative items are possible in the House. As soon as our schedule is finalized, I will be sure to inform all Members. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his exposition of the schedule. I want to speak briefly to the appropriations process. I think the Appropriations Committee is fairly close to the completion of its bills. Can the gentleman tell us when the balance of the appropriations bills might be coming to the floor and when we can perhaps expect the next appropriations bill on the floor? I yield to my friend. Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, the Appropriations Committee has now passed all 12 bills out of subcommittee. By next week, all 12 bills will have also cleared the full committee. By passing the Interior and Financial Services bills today, the gentleman knows the full House has adopted for the fullyear appropriations half of those, six bills, making up over twothirds of the discretionary budget authority. House and Senate conferees on the first package are working to produce a conference report, and I look forward to continuing work on FY19 appropriations in the weeks to come. As soon as the items are scheduled for the floor, I will be sure to inform all Members. As the gentleman knows, this is a different year, as just last year we were able to pass all 12. But what is different about this year is, over in the Senate, there is action being taken, which is positive for us. That is why we are already into conference. I look forward to having those conference reports coming back and moving those bills to the President’s desk to be signed. I am proud of the fact that twothirds of all the discretionary spending will have already passed this floor as of this day. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his observation. I share his delight that the Senate is moving bills. I would observe that they appear to be moving them in a bipartisan fashion, which I think is positive for an outcome on the appropriations process. In that vein, I know we are in conference on the MILCON and Legislative Branch minibus. Does the gentleman have any idea when that might conclude and we might be considering that conference? I yield to my friend. Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I do not know at this time. I know they are continuing to work. As soon as they get their work done, I will advise the Members. I will bring it to the floor then. b1115 Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, let me just mention, we just had a vote, and, obviously, I was disappointed in the outcome. I was the sponsor, probably as the gentleman knows, of the Help America Vote Act, which created the Election Assistance Commission. The Election Assistance Commission bill, the HAVA bill, passed with a big bipartisan vote and was signed, as the gentleman knows, by President George W. Bush in a very bipartisan effort. The premise was that, for 200 years, the Federal Government had not participated in assisting the States in running Federal elections. I will repeat that. The vote for President, the vote for Senate, and the vote for the House were all done through State administrations with no participation by the Federal Government. In 2002, the Congress and the President made a determination that we would contribute to making sure that our elections ran correctly. The gentleman will remember the issue of hanging chads and the question of whether or not votes were properly counted. It was of great concern across the aisle. So we passed the legislation. Unfortunately, however, we have not continued to pursue that. And today’s vote, we have a greater challenge today. The challenge in the 2000 election was inappropriate administration, domestically, of our election. The problem in 2016, as Speaker RYAN pointed out and the Intelligence Committee found and the intelligence community has found, was that there was clearly an outside attack on America by Russia, and perhaps others, to undermine the integrity of our elections. 
The vote that we held just a few minutes ago was about the Federal Government continuing to partner with the States to ensure the integrity of our election system and its safety from outside attack, interference, and undermining. I hope, Mr. Leader, that we could visit that issue. I hope the Senate visits that issue. Perhaps we can visit it in conference, and, together, Republicans and Democrats could join together in an effort to work with our partners in the States to ensure the integrity of the administration of our election and to ensure that votes are cast correctly, counted correctly, and reported correctly. As the sponsor of that bill that was cosponsored, as the gentleman may remember—no, you weren’t here in ’02— by Bob Ney of Ohio, but overwhelmingly supported on both sides of the aisle, I hope that we could move ahead, in the weeks ahead, as we move toward the November 6 election, to make sure that Americans—Democrats, Republicans, independents, all others, and not only in this country but around the world—have confidence in the results of our election. Mr. Speaker, I don’t know whether the gentleman wants to respond to that. I yield to my friend. Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, there is one part of what the gentleman said with which I disagree. The vote we just had was a motion to recommit. We all know what motions to recommit are. The good news about this is, last year in the omni, we fully funded the Help America Vote Act. That vote was a different vote. That was a vote that moved on to the President and was signed into law. Now, of that funding that we fully funded—because we believe, just as the gentleman does, that we want to make sure our elections are fair, honest, and that people do not try to manipulate them—40 percent of that money that we fully funded is still available. The challenge here is that we have 19 States that have yet to apply. So we should work together to make sure those States are applying, because the money is sitting there, and the money has been fully funded. We want to make sure, in the Help America Vote Act, that it continues, that States apply for that money, and that the elections are safe and sound and honest. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his observation. I would simply be constrained to say, I listened to Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN . I listened to his opposition to the MTR. The pretense that the amendment that was offered is somehow a procedural or nonconsequential amendment is incorrect. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN didn’t even try to make the argument. He said it was a good bill; we ought to pass it. Fine. The amendment would have not undermined the bill in any way. Now, there is a provision in that bill, as the gentleman knows, to, in effect, undermine the agreement that was made last year, with respect to the funding levels, by putting $500 million into a grandchild’s or a children’s fund by the chairman of the subcommittee. It is a little bit like your rescissions. The gentleman who put that in voted for a $2 trillion deficitcreating document and put $500 million in a trust fund to bring down that deficit. I know my friend is happy that that will, at that rate, take 4,000 years to fill that $2 trillion hole. So I disagree with my friend that the amendment would have had any adverse effect on the bill that was passed. Now, I voted against the bill, but the bill passed the House of Representatives. Nothing would have adversely affected that bill. I appreciate what the gentleman said about last year’s action, which I supported, which I thought was correct, and which I appreciated the Congress taking. Next, Mr. Speaker, we had a vote on ICE. The gentleman can argue it one way or the other. I know you criticized us; we criticized you. The fact of the matter is, what it did not deal with— and you will indicate that there was a bill that dealt with this in a fashion. But, again, I would remind you that your pledge, through your Speaker, was to take issues headon, one at a time, discretely, not confuse them. I would urge the leader, the Speaker, and the majority party to bring a bill to the floor that deals simply with an issue with which we believe the overwhelming majority of Americans agree: Do not rip children from the arms of their parents. Do not estrange children from their parents for weeks and months. Do not traumatize children, perhaps permanently, by this policy of separating children. I would hope and urge the majority leader to bring a bill to the floor that would deal with that discrete issue. Mr. NADLER has a bill, H.R. 6135, to prohibit the Department of Homeland Security from pursuing this policy of separating families. JOHN MCCAINhas said that that policy of separation offends the dignity and decency of the American people. That is JOHNMCCAIN, former candidate for President in your party, Mr. Leader, and I would agree with him on that issue. I would urge the leader to bring a bill to the floor to deal with this issue directly, and I believe—perhaps I am wrong—that it would receive a very significant majority of support in this House. I would ask the gentleman, is there any plan to bring such a bill to the floor in the near future? Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend. Mr. MCCARTHY. Correct me if I’m wrong, but you voted against the omni, correct? Mr. HOYER. The omni last year? Yes. Mr. MCCARTHY. So you voted against the funding—— Mr. HOYER. I am going to reclaim my time, Mr. Leader, for this. Mr. MCCARTHY. If I can finish, you had stated at the end of your last statement that you voted for that funding. I was just correcting. By voting against the omni, you voted against the funding for that. Mr. HOYER. Of course, I supported that policy. Now, the reason I was going to reclaim my time, very frankly, Mr. Leader, I have done some research on bills you voted against. I could go through them and pick out this, that, and the other that everybody in the world was for, and I could say you voted against it. I have not done that. The reason I have not done it is because I don’t think that would be intellectually honest on my part, because I know that there are things I would pick out that you clearly supported but you didn’t support some parts of the bill and, therefore, indicated your objection by voting against them, which is exactly what I did in the omni. The gentleman, my friend, knows that to be the case. My friend brings up CHIP all the time. My friend knows that I have supported CHIP at its very inception and in every step of the way of its development and reauthorization. My friend knows that, but he continues to pretend, because I voted against the omni, that I voted against CHIP. I didn’t like the omni. I thought the omni was wrong. Very frankly, I think I was correct in that vote. Now, the omni passed, and it passed with a very substantial number of Democratic votes. I didn’t lobby against the omni with my Members. I did indicate that I did not agree with things you had left out and did not put in the omni, and I, frankly, did not agree with some things that were in the omni. Having said that, let’s not go back and forth. I can get a lot of bills the same way and show that you voted against motherhood and apple pie in this bill, that bill, and the other bill. You know that to be the case. I would hope we can stop doing that. Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend. Mr. MCCARTHY. The only reason I brought it up is your statement at the end was that you voted for it. Mr. HOYER. You are correct. Mr. MCCARTHY. At any time, if I may finish, if I state that I voted for something that is incorrect, please bring it up. Mr. HOYER. I will do that. I will tell you, you are correct in saying that I did not support the omni, but I did support the proposition. Mr. MCCARTHY. In saying that, you just recently said you supported CHIP, but you voted against it because you voted against the omni. Also, is it not true, when CHIP was by itself on the floor, you voted against CHIP there? Because we brought CHIP to the floor three times. But if I could move on, that was the case. So you voted against CHIP even when it wasn’t in the omni, so there are other reasons to vote against CHIP. You had a question about a bill. 
Mr. HOYER. Separating children from their parents. Mr. MCCARTHY. As we all know, America is a Nation of immigrants. Almost all of our ancestors came from somewhere else in search of a better life in this land of freedom and opportunity, and we want to maintain that. Mr. Speaker, America is also a Nation of laws. We support immigration, but it also must be legal immigration. We must have the security, especially, along our southern border. As we speak, our men and women at the border are doing their absolute best to maintain both order and decency. Since 2014, Border Patrol has completed more than 13,000—let me say that again, 13,000—lifesaving rescues along the border, including many children. We would be naive to think that there are not certain individuals hoping to enter this country illegally and to do us harm. Yesterday, when we talked about ICE, one of the elements that came up was the thousands of gang members that they stop. We all know the most vicious gang out there is MS–13. We know it because we know it in our communities. We see the murders. We see the drugs. We know the hundreds of MS–13 members that they have stopped from being a part of our communities. That is why we had that vote. Simply put, the entire immigration enforcement community deserves our support because they work under very difficult circumstances. I think everybody would agree with that, which is why, if I can be very honest with my friend, I was upset to see many Democrats refuse to stand with the men and women of ICE yesterday. Why? Six individuals who work for ICE gave the ultimate sacrifice of their life. One was murdered by the Los Zetas cartel. The gentleman asked if I would bring up a bill. I offered to bring up a Democrat bill, but the author of the bill who put it across the desk and asked people to cosponsor said he would vote against it. What was most shocking to me is the number of people who voted ‘‘present.’’ The gentleman can argue with me all day on things I vote ‘‘yes’’ and things I vote ‘‘no’’ on. The only time he will ever see my vote up there for ‘‘present’’ is a quorum call, because I believe the American public and my constituents expect me to make a decision when I come. I think it was very clear yesterday. You can make a decision. I know my friend and his beliefs, but I also know his party has a new movement. It is a socialist party, and they are gaining steam. But that new party and that new movement in there, I still believe, would want you to make a decision one place or the other. Just last year alone, ICE made almost 5,000 gangrelated arrests. They seized nearly 1 million pounds of narcotics and opioids. The gentleman knows, those 2 weeks we spent on this floor dealing with the opioid epidemic, there will be more than 100 Americans who will die today because of opioids, and tomorrow will be the same. That is why we did CARA in the last Congress. That is why we came back with billions of dollars of funding to combat the epidemic. That is why we came back and spent 2 weeks on this floor passing more than 50 bills. b1130 But think for one moment. If my friend on the other side, his colleague, was able to abolish ICE, that would be 1 million more pounds of narcotics. And it is more than just opioids. It is fentanyl. A small dose will kill you. They rescued more than 900 sexually exploited children. They stopped thousands of predators. My friend knows that, too, when we were able to finally stop human trafficking on the internet. Backpage.com is no longer there because this Congress acted, and they are being prosecuted. Seventy percent of all human trafficking happens online. But do you know what? We can celebrate that that has changed because of this Congress. Now, Mr. Speaker, we want America to remain a land of opportunity, but demeaning the individuals who keep this country safe and calling to abolish ICE is certainly not the way to do it. I thank my friend, and I think we have a difference of opinion, and I think a strong difference of opinion, and that is healthy. But sometimes when you have a difference of opinion, it is a ‘‘no’’ and a ‘‘yes,’’ not just a ‘‘present.’’ You might come to the debate, but you ought to participate and you ought to take a stance. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman talks a lot about law enforcement, correctly so. We ought to honor those who protect us and who put their life and limb at risk daily to do so. We ought to honor them whether they are ICE agents, whether they are Border Patrol agents, whether they are DIA agents, whether they are members of the Armed Forces, whether they are members of the sheriff’s departments or police departments in our various communities around the country. We ought to have compassion for those who are victims whom they are protecting and compassion for those whom we lose in the performance of their law enforcement duties. There is not a Member of Congress who has been at more memorial services for law enforcement officers that we have lost through the centuries than I have, period. Yesterday’s vote was because of the patently political nature of the resolution that was offered. The majority leader says he wanted to offer a bill of one of our Members who suggested the elimination of ICE—small number. And that Member, apparently, according to the majority leader, told him: Look, I am going to vote ‘‘no’’ on that if you bring it to the floor, obviously trying to raise a point about wanting to stop the policies and practices—not the ICE agency, but the policies and practices of ripping, literally ripping children from the arms of their fathers and mothers and estranging them at places that neither knew where the other was. The gentleman talks about the opioid epidemic being on the front page. It is there, and properly so, because it is a crisis, and we have dealt with it in a bipartisan way, which was correct to do so. We believed it was underfunded for some period of time. We have come up with some more funds. We are glad about that. But he did not answer my question, and he distracted us from the focus. There was a bill, which we didn’t like, because the bill had a lot of other stuff in it, which is why the Speaker said we ought to consider things discreetly, individually, one at a time. Don’t confuse and obfuscate the issue. So bring a bill to the floor that says that the policy that the President was pursuing, that he then changed—and the courts have now interjected themselves; we don’t know for how long—to say that we ought not, that is not who we are as Americans, Mr. Speaker. These 2 and 3 and 4yearold children whom we see on the front pages of our paper, they are not MS–13. There is not a Member on this floor who will defend MS–13. There is not a Member on this floor who does not want to see the folks who gain some status by being an MS–13 caught, stopped, and taken out of our country if they are not citizens of this country, not a one of us. So that is a red herring dragged across this floor back and forth yesterday and today. Mr. Speaker, you would think that we could say that America’s values do not support taking children, small children, infant children. An instance was cited on the floor yesterday where a mother was nursing her child and that child was taken from her and the mother was put in handcuffs. Is that America? Is that the compassionate country of which George Bush talked? Is it that bright and shining city on the hill of which Ronald Reagan spoke? I think not, Mr. Speaker. Lastly, I know that flood insurance is going to expire July 31. I see the ranking member, Ms. MAXINE WATERS , on the floor. I know she has been working on this with Mr. HENSARLING . Does the leader know whether or not that bill might be coming to the floor or some extension coming to the floor next week? I yield to my friend. Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. To answer his last question first, yes, we will extend flood insurance through November 30 as we continue to work through the other differences we have. We do not want flood insurance to lapse, and we will have that on the floor. But the gentleman brought up a couple of other points. If I may, I come from a family of immigrants. I come 
from a family in which nobody was a Republican. I chose to be in this party based upon its philosophy. If you come to my office, I have two Presidents’ hanging portraits: Abraham Lincoln. The greatest challenge ever to this Nation was the Civil War. Abraham Lincoln was the first Republican President. And the other one is, the other reason why—both of those men—I chose to, and that was Ronald Reagan. Ronald Reagan did talk about that shining city on the hill. There was another President at the time, and I saw the difference, and I made my selection. But the gentleman talks about the challenges with the rule of law, the challenges at the border. Nobody on this side wants children to be mistreated. That is why we dealt with the issue, and we brought it to the floor. There was an executive order that dealt with it. But we moved two pieces of legislation dealing with immigration. Not one Democrat on the other side worked with us. Maybe there were problems. Maybe they disagreed with having greater security on the border, having a wall. I understand that, but maybe that is the difference. But the question you brought forward was the bill on the floor yesterday. It had nothing negative in it. It had nothing about children. It talked about: Do you support ICE? Do you support the families of those six individuals who were murdered in the line of duty? Do you support the stopping of drugs coming across the border? Do you stand with those children who get exploited? Those ICE agents actually find them. Do you stand with ICE when they stop those human traffickers, the modernday slavery of today, and stop those people? Well, we had an opportunity for that. I know this other side of the aisle and I know the new Democratic Socialist Party feels differently, probably feels differently than my friend. They want to abolish it. They never put a bill in to reform it. They said, ‘‘Abolish it.’’ If we were proposing a bill that said ‘‘support it,’’ I would allow your bill to come up as well so we could have a clear choice. But when you were given that offer, the author of the bill said, ‘‘I would vote ‘no.’’’ The people you asked to cosponsor, ‘‘We vote ‘no,’’’ makes me wonder. But the most shocking part to me—I know we take tough votes on this floor. I know there are tough decisions to be made. But at the end of the day, you have to make a decision because that is why the American people sent you here. I have never been in a debate, in a primary or a general, where they ask me: If a bill came to the floor, will I vote ‘‘present’’? I have never been asked that by my district. Republican or Democrat or Independent or Green Party: ‘‘I want you to go to Washington. I want you to be on that floor. I want you to make a strong debate down in the well. And when you get the opportunity, you press that ‘present’ button,’’ never, never have I heard that and never would I have thought I would see that. I have never seen so much color on that board as I saw yesterday. And if you truly felt your convictions of what you said, your own ‘‘present’’ vote made it pass, then go back to the individuals you talk to, go back to that new Socialist Party and tell them what you did, because I didn’t see convictions yesterday. I saw you play politics. Our issues are too important. People have lost their lives, and you vote ‘‘present.’’ Now, we have more work to be done. We take this job seriously. Ronald Reagan talked about that shining city on the hill, about everybody rising up. This is the exact same debate we had when we wanted to pass tax reform. Not one person on the other side of the aisle could vote with it, but there are 1 million more Americans working today. When I look at the last 49 years of America—because there are a lot of people in this Chamber who are younger than that—there has only been 7 months where unemployment has been below 4 percent. And do you realize that 2 of those months, you just lived through it in April and May? You have never seen the opportunity that you grasp for today. And do you know what happens with that opportunity? More people want to come, and that is good for America. But we should come legally. We know our system is broken, and I know my friend knows it, too, because we spent hours talking and trying to work something out. So, yes, we brought a bill to the floor, and we had a pretty good idea that probably it wouldn’t pass. Why? Because nobody on the other side of the aisle wanted to step forward. You know the process; it would go to the Senate. Maybe it is not just perfect, but I think this country is too important to vote ‘‘present,’’ and I am going to take risks and I am going to bring bills to the floor that take risks. So I thank the gentleman for the question. But what I really ask—the election is still a ways away. Stop playing politics. Be a part. That voting card, I don’t even know why we have a ‘‘present’’ button here. We want quorum, let’s just all say it. But the idea of something so important that people have lost their lives over, what do you think those families felt like today? What do you think those families felt like? Or what do you think about that young child who got saved from being exploited or got put back to the family and saved? What do you think about the drugs that didn’t come through, the number of lives that continue to live today because of that? Or what do you think about those men and women, a part of ICE, who question does this government even support them. And every day they risk their lives for that. It is not a day to vote ‘‘present.’’ If you disagree, if you are part of the Socialist Party, stand up and take a stance. Let the American public know where you stand. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, the gentleman knows damn well that is not the case, and I am tired of hearing him demagogue about that. I expect him to do it between now and the election, but the gentleman is not honest when he does it, and he knows that, Mr. Speaker. Mr. MCCARTHY. May I ask the gentleman what am I not saying correctly? Were there ‘‘present’’ votes in that Chamber? Mr. HOYER. He says something about the Democratic Socialist Party— it is my time. It is my time, Mr. Speaker. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. DUNN). Members are reminded to direct their remarks to the Chair. Mr. MCCARTHY. May I ask the gentleman—the 133 ‘‘present’’ votes, did they not take place yesterday? Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, it is my time. This is the most autocratic Congress in which I have served. It has had the most closed rules. And the majority leader brings to the floor his version of what he wants to say and how he wants to characterize it. No consultation with us, no amendments allowed, and then we say we are not going to vote against ICE agents. We honor the work that they do. We honor the sacrifices they make. We honor the critical role they play in defending our country and enforcing our laws. b1145 But, Mr. Leader, we are not going to take it or leave it. We are not going to vote ‘‘no’’ on a resolution that purports simply to honor our ICE agents. If it were simply that, it may have been a different matter. But, Mr. Speaker, I would hope that the majority leader would stop talking about—there are some people in his party who say absolutely absurd things at the very highest level of his party, and I haven’t brought them up. Mr. Speaker, I asked a simple question. The Speaker of this House said he was going to bring issues to this floor individually, vote them up or down. I asked the leader: Will you bring a bill to the floor which will stop the separation of children from their parents? He says he did. 113 of his colleagues on his side of the aisle thought it was a bad bill and voted ‘‘no.’’ Mr. MCCARTHY. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. HOYER. I yield to the gentleman from California. Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, they didn’t vote ‘‘present.’’ Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, they didn’t vote ‘‘present.’’ I voted ‘‘present’’ because I wanted to say to the leader, Mr. 
Speaker, I am not going to take it or leave it. He wants to make me look like I am not for law enforcement when I have been for law enforcement in the 50 years I have been in public office, without fail—without fail. Mr. MCCARTHY. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. HOYER. I yield to the gentleman from California. Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, then why did he vote ‘‘present’’? Mr. HOYER. I voted ‘‘present,’’ Mr. Speaker, because I was not going to take it or leave it. I was not going to just take what the majority leader wanted to shove down my throat and the throat of others. Because, Mr. Speaker, the rhetoric in that bill—and let me say to the leader, Mr. Speaker, he and I worked on a lot of resolutions regarding Israel, and we want to keep the Congress united on Israel, and we keep the Congress united on Israel. How do we do it, Mr. Speaker? We work on the language. We work on the language of the whereas clauses and the resolved clauses so that we can create a broad majority. We could have done that with the ICE bill, easily— easily—an overwhelming support for their role and for their courage and for their character. Now, Mr. Speaker, I asked about the bill that deals with flood insurance. I think the gentleman has told me that that is going to come to the floor, and I am prepared to yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MCCARTHY. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. HOYER. I yield to the gentleman from California. Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I know he misspoke earlier on a couple of things, and I think he may have misspoken again. He made a comment. He said we are autocratic. He said we are the most closed. So I just want to go to facts. This Congress has a 20year high for bills enacted with bipartisan cosponsors, a 20year high. Those are not my words. That is from Quorum, a company that only deals with data and measures all. So that means we are the most bipartisan Congress in more than 20 years. Mr. Speaker, does the gentleman want to know something else, just on facts? He said we close everything. There have been over 1,650 amendments. 745 of those were Democratic amendments. So I looked back to Speaker PELOSI . She allowed less than 1,000 amendments in the entire 111th Congress. So, I am sorry, those statements were not correct. Now, we can have differences of opinion. He has a right to vote ‘‘present.’’ If he gets mad about it, he can get mad about it, but that is what the RECORD  shows. And he said because what were the resolved clauses. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman knows that bill was on suspension. The rules of suspension have a higher threshold to pass, but it also means there are no amendments. If you want to be fair, instead of just the bill that was coming forward, I offered to bring a Democratic bill up that would abolish ICE. So, for the American people to know, let’s see what the resolved clauses say, because this made so many Democrats vote ‘‘no’’ or ‘‘present.’’ Resolved. That the House of Representatives expresses its continued support for all United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement, ICE, officers and personnel, who carry out the important mission of ICE; Denounces calls for the complete abolishment of ICE; and Supports the efforts of all Federal agencies, State law enforcement, and military personnel who bring law and order to our Nation’s borders. 
That is what the resolved said. That is what moved the other side to vote ‘‘present.’’ That is what we voted on. He may be upset. I am upset he voted ‘‘present,’’ too. But I don’t know what in this clause drove all the Democrats here, because you know on suspension he helped it pass. But is it because that announcement denounces calls for the complete abolishment of ICE, because that is the bill he put across the desk? If that is what he is asking for, he can stand with his convictions. Don’t put a bill across the desk, cosponsor it, and then when he has something on the floor that is only positive, that is only standing with the people of ICE, say he has to vote ‘‘present.’’ I don’t know where the courage is there. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I don’t know who ‘‘we’’ is. Somebody who introduces a bill on either side of the aisle doesn’t make it a ‘‘we’’ bill. And the reason they brought the nonbinding resolution to the floor, when they really wanted to bring the bill to the floor, is because it wouldn’t have served their political purposes because everybody on our side of the aisle would have voted ‘‘no.’’ He knows it. That is why he didn’t bring it to the floor, for politics; not for principle, for politics. And to his credit, I understand the Speaker didn’t want to bring it to the floor either. At least that is what is reported in the papers. Now, Mr. Speaker, my question has still not been answered. There have been more closed rules in this Congress than any Congress in recent memory, during the time I have served. Now, there have been a lot of bills passed, and we passed them on bipartisanly. We had about six, seven, eight, or nine naming a post office the other day. Mr. MCCARTHY. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. HOYER. I yield to the gentleman from California. Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, that is a lot less than under his leadership. Mr. HOYER. Isn’t that wonderful. I voted for all of them, either by voice vote or by card. They were bills that we all agreed with. But more closed rules on this floor, including today’s bill that we passed, than any Congress in recent memory. My question to the majority leader was: Will he bring to the floor a free standing bill which provides that children will not be separated from their parents—which JOHNMCCAINsays is inconsistent with the decency of the American people—so that we can vote on that proposition and that proposition only. The majority leader has not answered that question. He talks about voting ‘‘present,’’ which he didn’t like. I am sorry he didn’t like it, but I would vote ‘‘present’’ again to express my opposition, the only way it was possible to do, because, unlike his characterization, I did not want to say to ICE agents, ‘‘I do not respect you.’’ Therefore, I did not want to vote against a resolution, the resolved clause of which I agreed with. But it didn’t deal with the most critical issue. It could have—it didn’t—and it is nonbinding. To argue about that is to dissemble about the question that I asked. I am prepared to end this because I don’t think we are going anywhere. I don’t think I am going to get an answer from the majority leader, and I don’t think he will bring it to the floor, freestanding, any more than he will bring a comprehensive immigration reform bill, which is so necessary to this country, to the floor, no more than he will bring a Dreamers protection act to this floor. He is gesticulating, Mr. Speaker, as if: What do you mean by that? He brought a bill to the floor that he said solved the problem that 113 of his Members voted against. It got over 300 votes against. That is not a viable option to bring to the floor. He knew it was going to fail. He knew it was another message bill. So I asked him: Will he bring that bill to the floor individually, discretely, to protect these children, or not? I haven’t gotten an answer to that. The second thing I asked him, which he did answer, is that we are going to bring a bill to the floor, apparently, hopefully, to protect those who live in flood zones and who are going to have trouble getting flood insurance on August 1. He says he will bring that to the floor. Now, I am prepared to close and to yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MCCARTHY. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. HOYER. I yield to the gentleman from California. Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I asked the gentleman to yield because I just think the RECORD needs to be corrected. The gentleman knows, Mr. Speaker, that we brought two immigration bills to this floor that would solve the problem. The gentleman also knows there was an executive order signed that stopped this action being taken before this even went forward. 
But I also heard the gentleman say that he voted ‘‘present’’ because he didn’t want the ICE agents to think he didn’t support them, and that he supported those things in the resolved. Prior, he said that is why he voted against it. I read what was in the resolved. I don’t understand how anybody in America looks at voting ‘‘present’’ with an idea you support it. That is the only thing that I question. Now, the gentleman also knows that this is the most productive Congress in modern history. It has passed more bills out of committee than any Congress in the last 25 years. It has passed more bills in this Chamber than any one in the last 25 years. He sees the openness to the number of amendments; and it is not just the number of amendments to Republicans because there are hundreds upon hundreds for Democrats. The gentleman also knows that the immigration bills that came to this floor had an opportunity. But what is interesting to me is that people want just one that they can support. Earlier, I heard he voted against CHIP because it was in the omni, but CHIP was on the floor by itself and he voted against it then. He can vote for the post office bills and that didn’t deal with the immigration either, but he can vote for that. But then when it came to supporting ICE, the majority of Democrats voted ‘‘present.’’ That is not a profile in courage. That is walking away from a situation. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, this has gone on longer than it should have. But it has given us time to look at a MILCONVA vote on May 15, 2008, in which the majority leader, on a substantive vote, not a resolution that was nonbinding, but a substantive appropriations bill, voted ‘‘present.’’ Mr. MCCARTHY. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. HOYER. I yield to the gentleman from California. Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I can’t believe that to be true. Mr. HOYER. Voted ‘‘present,’’ Mr. Speaker, voted ‘‘present.’’ Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
ADJOURNMENT FROM THURSDAY, JULY 19, 2018, TO MONDAY, JULY 23, 2018 Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet on Monday, July 23, 2018, when it shall convene at noon for morninghour debate and 2 p.m. for legislative business. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection.

DOCKUM DRUGSTORE SITIN ANNIVERSARY (Mr. ESTES of Kansas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. ESTES of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 60th anniversary of the beginning of the Dockum Drugstore sitin. In 1958, 20yearold Ron Walters and his cousin, Carol ParksHahn, were inspired by a California campus restaurant sitin, the Little Rock Nine, and the Montgomery bus boycott. Bravely seeking to challenge the status quo of segregation in Wichita, they planned a sitin at a downtown drugstore with a lunch counter for White customers only. On July 19, 10 students walked into the Dockum Drugstore and sat down. They were described as well dressed and polite, and sought only to be served a soft drink at the counter. For 3 weeks, the students entered the drugstore every day, boldly sitting through cursing, questioning, and even threats. Finally, on August 11, the store manager declared: ‘‘Serve them. I’m losing too much money.’’ Following their success, similar efforts became a hallmark of the civil rights movement. And today, on this 60th anniversary, their actions continue to inspire. Mr. Speaker, I am grateful these young men and women took action to end segregation in their community. 
b1200 SOVEREIGNTY OF TRIBES IN OUR NATION (Mr. RUIZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, the United States Constitution defines Tribes in our Nation as sovereign governments with a unique relationship with the United States Federal Government. Many treaties and Supreme Court cases show legal precedent that they are sovereign nations, and the United States has a trust responsibility to ensure they have Social Services like healthcare in exchange for taking their land. The Trump administration is not recognizing the legal right Tribes have. They are solely considering Tribes as a racial group as their justification to impose Medicaid work requirements that we know will disproportionately result in less healthcare for Native Americans. This is wrong, illegal, and a dangerous precedent. What happened to the treaties our government signed? What happened to the Federal trust responsibility? And what other social and legal responsibility will they negate next? I will not stand by and watch the sovereignty of our Nation’s first people attacked, and neither should you, Mr. Speaker. f 
AMERICA IS FINALLY BETTER OFF (Mr. RUTHERFORD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because, after years of struggling to get ahead, America is finally better off. America is stronger at home and abroad, with a booming economy, safer communities, and a revived military. Thanks to the historic tax reform, unemployment is at an alltime low; job openings are at record highs; paychecks are increasing; wages are rising; and small businesses are expanding. I hear it from people in Florida all the time: My constituents are better off. Mr. Speaker, I represent Florida’s Fourth Congressional District, which is home to many military families; and I am proud to say that we have begun to rebuild our military and support our men and women in uniform. We have passed legislation giving our troops the largest pay increase in almost 9 years, and investing $144 billion in upgrading and maintaining our military facilities. Our military men and women are better off. The work that we have done and continue to do is creating a better way for the people of northeast Florida and for all Americans. Although there is much more to do, the economy is soaring, and Republican policies are helping to improve people’s lives, making it easier for families to get ahead with a renewed sense of confidence. 
CHILD ABUSE AT OUR SOUTHERN BORDER (Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak about the child abuse at the southern border. Three months have passed since the Trump administration announced the zerotolerance policy that led directly to the humanitarian crisis we now witness today. Three months later and, still, thousands of children remain separated from their families. This week, Federal judges announced a complete, oneweek pause on all family deportations, as well as mandatory 
counseling for traumatized children. The courts seem almost as fed up with this administration as the American people and have set deadlines for the Trump administration to act. The deadline to reunite all remaining separated families is just 6 days away. If the Trump administration fails to meet the deadline for even just one single child, then Congress must hold all those responsible for this national tragedy accountable. 
HONORING MONROE MURPHY (Mr. MITCHELL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 82yearold United States Navy veteran Monroe Murphy of Dryden, who recently graduated with his high school diploma, 68 years after he put his education on hold and bravely enlisted in the Navy at the age of 16. Monroe served in Korea as an engineman. He received an honorable discharge, returned home, and married his high school sweetheart, Ann, and raised their seven children on the family farm in Michigan. Monroe worked at Selfridge Air Field, General Motors, and at his own service station in Romeo. With the help of his daughter, he enrolled in adult education and began a 3 year journey of attending classes to receive his high school diploma. He graduated in June of this year, at the top of his class, and gave the commencement address to his family and friends present. Monroe’s impressive journey will continue, as he plans on enrolling in college classes. Congratulations, Monroe, and keep up the great work. 
RECOGNIZING THE REOPENING OF HIGHWAY 1 (Mr. PANETTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I am proud today to recognize the reopening of Highway 1, located south of Big Sur in Monterey County in my district on the Central Coast of California. Two winters ago, after a long drought and then a large amount of rain, there were a number of landslides along scenic Highway 1, just south of Carmel and north of Morrow Bay. One of those landslides occurred 14 months ago, when close to 8 million cubic yards of dirt and trucksized rocks came sliding down off that mountain, taking Highway 1 and putting a quarter mile of it right into the Pacific Ocean. This was the largest landslide and the longest closure along that stretch of the world’s most scenic roadway. Unfortunately, it prevented many people from traveling on that route and many businesses in Big Sur from benefiting from that tourism. But now, 3 months ahead of schedule, the California Department of Transportation, Caltrans, finished rebuilding this road, literally on top of the slide, and it will open today. I recognize the opening of Highway 1 because it is an example of what can happen when people work hard, work smart, and, most importantly, work together. Congratulations, and all of us in this body can learn from this. f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF JOHN MCGOVERN (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of my friend, John McGovern. He was a beloved friend, family man, and a staple in Illinois politics. He passed away unexpectedly on July 14. For decades, John worked in numerous State, congressional, and U.S. Senate offices and campaigns in our home State of Illinois. He was more than just a brilliant spokesperson and a political strategist, but also a mentor and a friend to everyone he worked with or worked for. He was even the best man at my good friend former Senator Mark Kirk’s wedding. He always remained a loyal and genuine person, which is something you don’t always find in politics. No matter the situation, even with policy and ideological differences, he stayed true to his impeccable ethics and to his civility. John was also involved in his community. He served on the board of the Boys and Girls Club of Chicago, the Elawa Farm Foundation, and on the auxiliary board of the Art Institute of Chicago. Words cannot describe how much we will miss his counsel, his wit, and his friendship. I offer my sincerest condolences to his wife, Wentworth; his two young sons; and to all of us and all who knew John McGovern. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF MICHELLE VO (Mr. KIHUEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Michelle Vo. Michelle attended the Route 91 festival in Las Vegas on October 1. Michelle was a very hard worker at her job as a financial adviser with the LAX Coastal Chamber of Commerce. During the month before her death, she had been named the top producer of her company. Michelle was passionate and would religiously donate blood every 2 weeks. In her free time, she enjoyed volunteering with the Red Cross, rock climbing, and golfing. Everything Michelle did, she did with 150 percent effort. Michelle is remembered as being fun, charismatic, brave, and vibrant. I would like to extend my condolences to Michelle Vo’s family and friends. Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada, and the whole country grieve with you. f 
HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE OF JACK EDWARD SCHURMAN (Mr. SHIMKUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise before you today to speak about Mr. Jack Edward Schurman, a longtime resident of Shelbyville, Illinois, in my 15th Congressional District, a disabled veteran, an advocate for former military men and women throughout the Nation, and chairman of my Veterans Advisory Committee, and, I am proud to say, my friend. Born in Iowa in 1939, Jack joined the Navy in 1959 and rose to the rank of yeoman third class before a disability cut short his service in 1964. Jack made his way to Illinois, and, in 1976, he married Nancy Ellen Cranford. They raised two daughters, Kelli Ann and Kim Marie. As chairman of my Veterans Advisory Committee, Jack has led our meetings for years, bringing valuable experience and perspective. Unfortunately, Jack’s health has declined to a point where his mobility is limited, and doctors have declared that he should no longer live on his own, which is what he has done since his beloved wife passed away in 2016. Jack is now in Mississippi, thanks to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, which located a suitable residence for him near the home of one of his daughters. Mr. Speaker, members of my Veterans Advisory Committee and I will miss Jack. We want to thank him for his tremendous service throughout the years and wish him the best of health and happiness in this next chapter of his remarkable life. 
CONCERNS OF THE DAY (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, the American people expect corrective actions by this body and the other body, and so I rise today to reinforce the importance of the translators’ notes as it relates to the meeting between the President of the United States and President Putin. If there is anything more important for the American people, it is to know whether we are safe, whether our military is safe, and whether we are secure. Secondarily, I am so disturbed that there is some thought of providing our public servants—Ambassador McFaul’s name was mentioned as being an exchange target, if you will, for President Putin to play with. 
I will be introducing legislation to protect all our ambassadors from foreign nations that may desire to undermine their leadership here in the United States. Also, I am intending to announce next week my introduction of a temporary protective status to help those Central Americans and others who this administration has precipitously taken away their TPS and jeopardized them in 2018. Finally, Mr. Speaker, we must reunite the children, and we must do it now. 
SEXUAL ASSAULT ON OUR CAMPUSES The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. POE) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I wish to address the House, Members of Congress, and the Chair about what I consider one of our most serious things that is happening in our country, and it has to do with sexual assault on our campuses, our universities, our colleges, and what is taking place there while students, our children, our grandchildren, go to these universities. I want to recognize a group of individuals who have started a program, a cause is really the right word, that they call the 12th Woman. They are all members, students, former students of Texas A&M University in College Station, Texas. The 12th Woman is a phrase that is a takeoff on another phrase that that university uses, calling the 12th Man. I look at the 12th Woman as a team, 11 on a team, and there is one more. It makes it 12, all 12 supporting each other in their cause to eliminate sexual assault on campuses, not just Texas A&M, but all the universities and colleges through the United States. b1215 So these remarkable ladies started using social media to see if other people, students, former students, had encountered sexual assault on campus and what happened and what didn’t happen after that was reported. Then they formed this organization called the 12th Woman. Several of those members of the 12th Woman are here today watching Congress, and later today, they are going to go to their respective Members of Congress and talk about some of the things that are on their heart. Constituents in the State of Texas, the reason for this request of time is that there are bad things that are happening on our university campuses. It happens because of a lot of reasons. We are talking about a lot of people, a lot of kids, in my opinion, going away from home and spending time trying to get an education at one of our universities. I believe wholeheartedly that our universities in this country are the finest educational institutions anywhere in the world. That is why we have people from all over the world coming to our universities. So I am going to start by telling some of their stories, things that happened to them, things that they have made public. They have been bold to talk about the bad things that happened to them while they were in school. Mr. Speaker, it takes a lot for a crime victim, especially a sexual assault victim, to come forward and publicly talk about these things. For the last, I guess, 30 years before I came to Congress, I was a prosecutor in Houston, Texas, and then I spent 22 years on the criminal bench hearing only criminal cases. And I have met, unfortunately, a lot of sexual assault victims who have come my way either when I was prosecuting their cases or as a judge. It is tough, really, it is tough to make those statements public and come forward. But I want to read a few of these statements and these stories that happened to some of our ladies that they call the 12th Woman. Abbie’s family was based around the values of Texas A&M that it instills in its students. She was raised by two Aggie alumni, and there was never a doubt about where she would ultimately attend college: it was always Texas A&M. But like so many others, what should have been an outstanding experience, just turned sour. One night, while hosting a Christmas party at her own apartment, she was raped. That is correct, Mr. Speaker, she was sexually assaulted. So when she woke up the next morning, she didn’t remember how a portion of that night ended. Bruises, scratches covered her arms, her legs, and her clothing was ripped and torn. So doing everything that I think a rape victim should do, she had a rape kit conducted just a few hours later. The hospital nurse ended Abbie’s SANE exam—SANE stands for sexual assault nurse examiner—and she told her, ‘‘I will see you in court,’’ describing it as the most evidence that she had ever seen. Abbie thought that she had a good case against her assailant. She was advised by the College Station Police Department to seek justice through the school and proceed to file her report through them. So she filed a report. The university called a hearing. The hearing began with what Abbie and her mom thought would be a fair playing field, until it became evident that she faced a series of well prepared attorneys at this hearing and she had no legal representation of her own. Not a single person at the university, the police department, or the hospital advised her that she had the right to retain legal representation. During the hearing, she was, in her opinion, ambushed by her assailant’s attorney, who peppered her with a lot of questions. The fact that she had created a Facebook event for the party and offered accommodation to those who were drinking to crash at her apartment was called into question. It was if the university panel thought that Abbie’s rape was her fault. Let’s get one thing straight, Mr. Speaker. Let’s make this perfectly clear. Sexual assault is never the fault of the victim. It is the fault of the perpetrator, and that is the way it should be, because it is the perpetrator who caused this. The victim shouldn’t feel like they did something wrong, but in our culture, sometimes they are put on trial. Following the hearing, she was referred to a student counseling service, where she met an individual who had no training in working with sexual assault victims. So what was the point of talking to the school counseling if there was no training to handle these types of cases? After a lengthy process and dealing with an investigative panel that she thought and believed was cold and uncaring, her assailant ultimately faced no consequences. Abbie felt betrayed by the university that she highly regarded. Her assailant just went back to class. Abbie was forced to see the man who raped her walking freely around the campus, a campus where she should have felt safe. Ultimately, she made the decision to graduate early, ending her time at Texas A&M prematurely. She feels like the university that she highly spoke of failed her. She says: 
The university I speak so highly of has failed. Who knows if it failed before me. There just wasn’t anyone to speak out about it. 
Abbie joins the 12th Woman to demand change, not at just Texas A&M, but colleges across the country. Abbie says: 
It is time for Texas A&M to follow the Aggie code of honor. They should follow it themselves and unite with the sexual assault survivors to be an example of fearless change among the very best American universities. 
Mr. Speaker, the Texas A&M code of honor says, ‘‘An Aggie does not lie, cheat, or steal, or tolerate those who do.’’ That is Abbie’s story, and I think we should thank her for making her story available for all of us. Meghan was a fourth generation Texas A&M Aggie. Her decision to attend this prestigious school was never a question in her mind. It was an amazing experience until things went bad. One morning, while serving as a tutor in the athletic department, a member of the Aggie football team, twice her size, exposed himself to her not 2 feet away. He made sexual advances toward her, becoming aggressive. Terrified and shocked, she abruptly walked out of the room, trying to remain calm as he followed her. Despite reporting the assault to her supervisor, something just went wrong. 
The remainder of her assailant’s tutoring sessions were not canceled. And get this: the very next morning, Meghan’s assailant exposed himself to another tutor, becoming aggressive. Mr. Speaker, Meghan feels she did not get justice against her attacker. She feels and tells me she was failed by a university that was not really committed to helping victims. She was scared in the process, scared to go back to work, terrified she might run into this individual again. Before the hearing, the university claims she did not need a lawyer, she was not facing charges. She received no notice that her assailant, however, had hired legal representation, which he has the right to do. Months later, Meghan’s assailant was found not responsible for exposing himself to both tutors. The panel stated that it appeared he had a skin condition and just couldn’t control himself. A skin condition, Mr. Speaker? The response she received was nothing short of appalling. The school said: 
Sorry, Meghan, that you were offended, but there is nothing else we can do. 
Meghan has appealed that case, and did appeal that case. She still believed the university would come to provide justice for her. At the appeals hearing, she was informed that the charge against her attacker had been downgraded from sexual exploitation to sexual harassment. What that meant was, in the university’s eyes, she was removed from the remainder of the hearing and couldn’t be considered as a victim. The university supposedly has several systems in place to aid victims. Texas A&M employs a victim advocate, but no one from the Title IX office contacted Meghan. She didn’t receive any information regarding what sanctions her assailant received, if any, and of course her assailant was allowed to be back on the athletic team. Mr. Speaker, he stayed on the team until she told the media about all of this, and then he was later removed from the team and two misdemeanor charges were filed against him after she went to the media. Meghan felt abandoned by the university. She thought the accused was protected due to his status. Texas A&M spends a lot of money on teal ribbons, according to her, for athletes to wear for sexual assault, and she says that the ribbon is not enough. Universities must put the safety and care of sexual assault victims first. I agree with her. She says: 
A&M has a chance to be fearless on every front and to be fearless in the face of such horrible things that are happening to our victims. 
She wants A&M to take the lead on this that is taking place on our university campuses. I applaud Meghan for having the courage to come forward and tell her story to the world. Kirsten, she loved being at Texas A&M University. She considered it one of the friendliest campuses, and enjoyed her time at one of the country’s finest educational institutions. After she returned from the winter break in the second semester of her freshman year, her happygolucky bubble of college was shattered. She was invited to hang out at her guy friend’s apartment, and was led to believe that several of their mutual friends would be there. When she arrived at the apartment, she realized that they were alone. Her socalled friend proceeded to sexually assault her. The next day, her friends and sister pushed her to report the assault, but she didn’t want to. She was made to feel like the crime was her fault. She told her resident assistant, who warned her that as an RA, she was required to report it. So a few days later, she received an email from the Division of Student Affairs inviting her to tell her story. Time and time again, she had to relive the story in graphic detail almost directly after it happened. One thing about sexual assault victims that unfortunately seems to happen, when they first tell the first person about what happened to them, it is not going to be the last time. Generally they tell people who are strangers, people they don’t know, and they have to tell that story over and over again, and because of that, they have to relive that experience. That is what happens when sexual assault victims have to come forward. They go through that, but we should be understanding of that process. She says: If I hadn’t already been traumatized by this, the university officials revictimized me, certainly cementing the damage to my mental health. 
It is true that any investigative panel must understand what happened before drawing conclusions, but there is a way of doing that and getting that information without being insensitive. Kirsten says she felt as if the investigators were cold and devoid of empathy. During the disciplinary appeals panel after the deadline to submit new evidence had passed, she was informed that the assailant’s fiancee, who wasn’t even present the night he attacked her, was permitted to serve as a witness. This witness served only the purpose to disparage Kirsten’s character. Right before the panel began, she discovered that her assailant had, like some of the others, obtained legal counsel. Unable to have representation of her own, she ran to the Student Legal Services. They refused to help her. They wouldn’t offer her legal advice. They had no victim advocate there to speak to her or on her behalf. Kirsten, like many other victims, was alone, and she felt alone. There was no other choice. The investigation continued. At one point, the officials at the university asked her why didn’t she scream, as if it is Kirsten’s fault she was assaulted and raped. Kirsten says the university official in the investigation became increasingly irritated, and it was abundantly clear to her that that person viewed this as a waste of the university’s time. Ultimately, the university concluded that Kirsten had likely been sexually harassed, but it was not up to the university to sanction her offender, because there was no impediment to her educational opportunity. b1230 Let me repeat that. Nothing happened because, according to them, there was no impediment to her educational opportunity. Mr. Speaker, Kirsten fully believes, in the end, the panel turned her words, her desire to complete her education, and her commitment to her family against her. And they used her resilience and her loyalty to the university as a weapon against her to absolve themselves from any responsibility. Mr. Speaker, I am going to tell Nikki’s story, as she recounts it. I have a total of six. For Nikki, a semester’s worth of studying was about to pay off. Finals week was here. One week was all that stood between Nikki and a short break before the next semester began— that is, until she was sexually assaulted. Following her assault, she reported to the Texas A&M clinic, creating even more stress on her. Before she left the clinic, Nikki recalls the head physician came over to her and told her: Things happen for a reason. It was shocking to her, and it was traumatic. Following this traumatic experience at the clinic, she decided against engaging in the reporting process, feeling that the university was not sensitive enough. She was aware of the process, because she sat on the university disciplinary appeals panel, listening to the appeals of cases similar to hers. She did return to a private hospital for a SANE examination—once again, sexual assault nurse examination—by someone who is qualified to examine, on a medical basis, sexual assault victims. She returned home for a short break, where she says she had time to process everything. Mr. Speaker, deciding to come forward and report the sexual assault, as I have said, is overwhelming to these victims. After some serious soulsearching, she began the reporting process. She told the story to the university officials, like so many others, over, and over, and over again. After her shocking experience with her visit to the Texas A&M clinic, she says it felt like the reporting was getting nowhere. After weeks of attempting to report the behavior of the school clinic, she finally received a call back, but she was dissatisfied. The school apologized, but no change ever occurred that she knows of. She says that: ‘‘After encountering three different women’s clinic physicians 
with such poor manners in a sexual assault case, it is clear to me that something is wrong at the institutional level.’’ It felt like she was the bad guy, forced to justify over and over again her reasons for reporting. Feeling attacked, she tried to withdraw her case. Mr. Speaker, no victim should be forced into a situation where they feel more discouraged by reporting a rape than they do by staying silent. But it was too much. Her grades started dropping. She started receiving Ds and Cs on tests. She had never gotten Cs and Ds. Her professors questioned her excused absences, asking if she was in trouble, only forcing her to explain the situation more and more. Upon finding out her assailant had hired legal counsel, she asked the university if she could obtain her own legal counsel. The university discouraged her from doing so and set a quick panel date. Ultimately, her attacker was found guilty of sexual abuse, sexual misconduct, dating violence, and sexual harassment. He was suspended for the remaining three semesters of Nikki’s time at Texas A&M. She felt lucky because many survivors never receive, in her opinion, justice. Just in my opinion, if a person is guilty of sexual abuse, sexual misconduct, dating violence, and sexual harassment, a threesemester suspension doesn’t seem to be much punishment, if any. She says: ‘‘If I felt lucky my rapist, who was found guilty, was suspended for three semesters, one of which was already halfway over, then, clearly, something was wrong procedurally,’’ if that happened. Many times, so many other victims never receive any justice, and the question remains: Why is a threesemester suspension unheard of as severe punishment? Mr. Speaker, something here is wrong. The reporting process for sexual assault should never continue to traumatize the victim at every turn. Nikki says: ‘‘The trials of the reporting process at A&M served to exacerbate an already traumatizing experience, leaving me feeling punished, trapped, and deceived.’’ She called on the university’s support program for survivors of sexual assault. It is an interesting note that, during this process, she received a cease and desist letter from a lawyer wanting her to tell the university it never happened, and to pay $10,000—I presume legal fees—to the attorney. I think that is just outrageous that that happened. Sydney was at Texas A&M, the school she loved, a school she always wanted to go to and did go to. It was her dream school. She was in the second semester at Texas A&M and, over a welcome weekend break, she was sexually assaulted. Her assailant took advantage of her as she was unconscious, intoxicated, and unable to fend for herself. In accordance with title IX rights, she reported the rape. Ninetysix days after reporting, she was granted an 8 hour hearing. She was told that any individual can serve as her support during the hearing, but was never advised to seek legal counsel. Here are a few lines from her victim impact statement: ‘‘Over the spring break, I decided that I didn’t want to live anymore.’’ Let me read that again: ‘‘Over spring break, I decided that I didn’t want to live anymore. I consciously decided that this was too much for me to take. The waiting. . . . The constant paranoia. The fact that this boy did something to me that made me want to take my own life should speak for itself. I am an optimistic person. I excel at creating my own happiness. But no matter what I tried, I could not find the silver lining in this situation.’’ Mr. Speaker, Sydney did seek help. She was diagnosed with PTSD. Her impact statement continues: ‘‘What happened to me 4 months ago has impacted me in the most tremendous way—academically, spiritually, mentally, physically, in how I handle my relationships. What happened to me has ultimately changed my life and my perspective of life forever.’’ Mr. Speaker, this is one of the rare cases, in my opinion, where there is some hope. Sydney did receive justice after going through all this physical and mental anguish and pain that she is going through. Her assailant was expelled, given a nocontact order, and restricted from A&M property indefinitely. Is it the outcome that we would expect? I would hope so. To put it into words she said: ‘‘The weight lifted off my shoulders when I heard that A&M chose to expel him . . . a weight that nearly smothered me for over 96 days. The fear of running into him on campus, the fear of seeing him around town, the fear that haunted and controlled my every move on campus, it was finally gone.’’ That, to me, is justice. It means being free from the fear of constantly being attacked. The rapist has given Sydney a life sentence of mental pain. When defendants—I will call them perpetrators, predators, whatever you want to call them—commit an act of sexual assault, whether they are punished, suspended, go to prison or not, whenever that consequence under society is over, they go on with their lives. The victims don’t get to go on with their lives. This is the type of offense where they think about it almost on a daily basis. That is why I say that it gives them a life sentence of pain and anguish and turmoil. Sydney stands with her fellow Aggies, demanding justice for the victims of sexual assault. She says: ‘‘I wouldn’t be the Aggie that Texas A&M taught me to be if I remained silent after receiving justice for myself. I wouldn’t be the Aggie that Texas A&M taught me to be if I didn’t have the backs of these other Aggies, other survivors,’’ these other members of the 12th Woman. ‘‘Texas A&M taught me to be, if I was afraid, to stand here and be counted as another one of its oneinfive victims on college campuses’’ of sexual assault. Because of the time, Mr. Speaker, I am going to just relate one more story and make some comments about what we are going to do about these cases. Kendra was a proud member of the Texas A&M Corps of Cadets. Holding an executive officer title, she could not be prouder to attend the school and be part of this outstanding university that prides itself on respect for men and women in our military service. She was on track to be commissioned as a second lieutenant in the United States Army—that was, until the repercussions of her sexual assault at the hands of a fellow cadet sent her world, like the others that I have talked about, into an uproar. Texas A&M has an ageold tradition called the Aggie Ring Dunk. She and her fellow cadets, one by one, dropped their new class rings into pitchers of beer. Then they started drinking until they surfaced with the gold rings appearing in the foam. What should have been a fun night ended in tragedy. One of her fellow cadets, who happened to be engaged to someone else, her friend, walked her and her friend to the dorm room. However, he followed her into her room, locked the door, and began assaulting her. Despite being weakened from the alcohol, she told him ‘‘no,’’ pushed him away, did everything that a lady, a victim in this case, should do to get him away from her. At one point during the attack, he began suffocating her. She feared for her life. Since her assault occurred in a campus dorm room, she was told that there would be a crime alert email sent out to the entire campus. That alert never went out. No one was warned that a violent sexual assault on campus had been reported. Not a single A&M woman was any wiser. Kendra says: ‘‘I believe Texas A&M endangered the lives of every single A&M student that came into contact with my rapist from the time the university knew’’ what he had done. She was then told that she would meet with the commandant of the corps, along with both of her parents, to address the safety and her lack of safety. Suddenly, her parents were barred from the room, not allowed to provide any support for her. Rest assured, the general would have two assistants in the room with him. Three against one, the 20yearold cadet versus three highranking military officials, to discuss rape, rape against her. After much debate, the meeting never occurred. Instead, the dean of student life met with Kendra and her parents. She described that meeting as that individual ‘‘implied that my report of the assault was causing her 
trouble, and I wasn’t helping anyone by coming forward. . . . And then there were several ways that I was requesting not to see my assailant, because we lived in very close quarters and had common classes and common activities.’’ Every single one of those requests by her was denied to keep him away from her. They offered to move Kendra’s parking spot; not the assailant’s. They offered to change Kendra’s schedule; not the assailant’s. They offered to move Kendra’s dorm to another dorm, but not the assailant’s. A nocontact order was issued, but, you guessed it, it was up to Kendra to leave if the individual showed up in a classroom or the building. Throughout the entire process, she said the university said that lawyers slow things down and aren’t necessary. But Kendra obtained a lawyer that night. Shortly afterward, she received justice against her assailant. As soon as her attorney met with school officials, the school quickly found a way to suspend the assailant until the hearing. Kendra’s case was decided by the university’s student conduct panel composed of three faculty members, and they found him responsible for 21 charges, including sexual abuse and sexual contact. And he was expelled. b1245 It seems to me that because she hired her own private attorney she got the justice that she wanted and she deserved. To this day, Kendra hopes university police will pursue a criminal case against her attacker. With the current backlog of DNA testing, it would take a year for her sexual assault kit to be analyzed. Until then she will continue to speak up, be part of the 12th Woman, and ask for change for her beloved university and all universities to make them safer for all students. Those are six cases, individuals, young women, who went to college and bad things happened to them. Their statements speak for themselves. In some cases they felt like the university helped them; some cases they don’t feel like the university helped them. But to a person—I was starting to say to a man—but to a woman, they all want improvements on college campuses about what has taken place on our campuses. After all of these things came out in the public domain, the 12th Woman group met with university officials. They presented a 12th Woman report outlining specifically what happened and what they want changed on their university, and really what should be changed on other universities. Mr. Speaker, I include the report in the RECORD . 
12THWOMAN REPORT  This report outlines the information shared between the 12th Woman and the administration of Texas A&M including Chancellor John Sharp and President Michael Young on Monday, June 25, 2018. About 12th Woman—The 12th Woman is a group of survivors and advocates dedicated to transforming Texas A&M University policies for providing justice in cases of sexual assault that are reported. INTRODUCTION TO MEETING WITH TEXAS A&M  
ADMINISTRATION  My name is Abbie Hillis, and I want to welcome everyone here tonight. Thank you to the victims for being brave enough to share your story and thank you to the administration and President Young for making this meeting a priority. It is fair to say that we all know this meeting shouldn’t even be a meeting we are forced to have. As survivors, we know the administration has had meetings like this before, recently in fact, where you were forced to listen to stories about how the policies and procedures at Texas A&M need to change. We are here tonight because there has been complete and utter failure by the leadership at Texas A&M. You all have declined to make sexual assault advocacy, policy, and procedure a priority. Instead, you continue to issue what are titled ‘‘messages to the community,’’ in the hopes that a carefullyworded statement will keep current and future students satisfied. Well, we are saying no more. The constant gaslighting and victim blaming must end. We come to you today with huge hearts for Texas A&M, but we also come to you with broken hearts, because you have chosen to prioritize the university’s brand over justice for victims. For a university that portrays itself to the public as unique by priding itself on its core values, it is unconscionable to hear the neverending stories over and over and over from survivors. These stories are all the same and demonstrate in each and every case that the university prioritizes athletes, money, and perceptions of safety over providing advocates and support for victims who have been sexually assaulted. Victims are silenced, shamed, and encouraged not to hire an attorney. Victims go to the Student Counseling Center only to be told not to report their story or that the issues are far greater than the SCC can handle. Victims are forced to walk on campus next to their assailant, or worse, to watch their assailant compete and represent the university on a global stage. Our stories today will illustrate the inconsistencies in Texas A&M’s reporting procedures for sexual assault crimes. There is no uniform reporting process and no one is held accountable. Current policies encourage those in charge, like some of you sitting in this room today, to brush stories aside and sweep victims under a rug. Texas A&M is spending money on ribbons for athletes to wear for sexual assault awareness but can’t provide a qualified trauma counselor to support sexual assault victims. The university also spends money duplicating services that are already provided for free through the government. But this isn’t new information to any of you. Beyond hearing our stories today, I hope you all also know that we are investigating your Clery Act alerts with reports of sexual assault, as we believe there are discrepancies. We are aware that the university has hired Husch Blackwell LLP to do a ‘‘thorough’’ review of your sexual assault investigations related to Title IX. But we also know that this is the exact same firm that found Michigan State University compliant with Title IX prior to Larry Nassar being convicted of over 200 counts of sexual assault. Maybe if MSU actually hired a team of attorneys that genuinely had the university’s best interest at heart, they wouldn’t find themselves in a $500 million settlement. We are curious, is this the same outcome you all want for Texas A&M? As I mentioned before, none of this information is new, yet these issues still come up and we get the same response from the administration with no results. There is no doubt that the university is proficient in providing a statement in attempt to address an issue, but we all know that words only go so far and actions speak so much louder, actions that you all, to date, have not had the decency and respect to make a priority. Our goal is not to spread awareness to this administration; you know very well these issues exist. Instead, our goal is to invoke action with the leadership of the university. Texas A&M has the ability to be a leader among universities across the nation. You have an opportunity to address these issues and create a system that actually works to protect and advocate for victims of sexual assault. We can either choose to work together and create change or we will have to work against each other and force change. Ultimately, it is up to you, the leadership of Texas A&M, to decide which route we will take. What we are asking for is simple: a commitment to integrity, to ensure that all Aggies are safe to attend Texas A&M University. 
Mr. POE of Texas. Also, the school, Texas A&M, has responded. The president met with the 12th Woman, the ladies in this group, and had a meeting with them and has issued a comprehensive statement, as they call it, comprehensive reviews and actions and next steps by the president of the university. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  what Texas A&M’s response to all of this is. 
COMPREHENSIVE REVIEWS , ACTIONS AND NEXT STEPS (July 2, 2018) Dear Aggie Community, I would like to provide you with an update regarding review plans recently announced that seek ways to improve how the university addresses sexual assault investigations. Since the last update, below are some of the efforts underway now and in the near future: Robin MeansColeman is, as reported earlier, leading the internal review. She has begun the following initiatives, to which she and those involved will add additional actions throughout the review: Assemble the internal review committee. The committee is comprised of a team of experts, to include: students including sexual assault survivors; faculty whose scholarship focuses on sexual assault; staff including student assistance services; a representative from the community Sexual Assault Resource Center (SARC); and others; Analyze related university rules and Standard Administrative Procedures (SAPs); Examine Student Affairs Title IX processes, from intake to postprocess; Identify ways to improve communications with students regarding available resources, advocates, and advisors; and Understand staffing allocations and needs. EVP and Provost Dr. Carol Fierke is, as reported, the lead liaison to the thirdparty review firm, Husch Blackwell (HB). HB will be on campus beginning this month to interview students, faculty, staff, community advocates and others. HB was selected because of their expertise and deep level of scrutiny as it pertains to assessments of policies and, importantly, challenges in implementing those policies. Primary interview input, process analysis, training review and benchmarking to other universities will be some of their work. We will make available 
to HB the information and resources that they require. Significantly, as is essential to any meaningful results in a thirdparty review, we will also stay out of their way so that they may do their work independently and unfettered. During the course of these reviews, as opportunities for improvement are identified, we will take action. We will not wait until conclusion of reviews to implement what we are able to improve as we move along. Since my last message, an Aggieled sexual assault survivors group agreed to meet with our leadership team last week. The Chancellor, Provost and I along with other campus leaders listened carefully as individuals bravely shared their experiences. We are deeply grateful for their input. We will not comment on any individual case or publicly share details of that private discussion, but I want to sincerely thank them for their testimonies and willingness to share with us directly. I reiterate our commitment to addressing concerns brought forth. We are committed to keeping our Aggie community informed as these important reviews and resulting actions progress. It is important to remind you of the standing invitation for all Aggies to send suggestions to feedback@tamu.edu, which we are reading. I want to thank you again for your input, caring and support as leaders inside and outside of the university advance this important work. Sincerely, MICHAEL K. Y OUNG , President. 
Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Texas A&M is not alone in the fight to provide victims a voice. As stated in one of the victim’s statements that I read into the RECORD , the National Sexual Violence Resource Center reports that each year one in five women will be assaulted while in college. One in five, 20 percent, in those 4 or 5 years. To me that is a staggering statistic. According to End Rape on Campus, an American woman who attends college is more likely to be a victim of sexual assault than a woman who does not go to college. That means whatever you think it means—one in five. Mr. Speaker, most of us in the House are parents. I am blessed to have three daughters and a son, and I have 12 grandkids, eight of which are girls. Parents need to be aware of these statistics. One in five will be assaulted while in college as a student. So what we want to do and what the 12th Woman wants to do is to stop these statistics and bring them down. I understand that at Texas A&M, the statistics—and I may be wrong—the statistics show that 1 in 14 are assaulted. At the same time, institutions of higher education across the country, to me, do not have an incentive to acknowledge the problem publicly, to address it. We can understand why universities don’t really talk a lot about what is happening with crimes on campus. They just don’t. It is about the image of the university and other things. But it is not being talked about, I think, enough so that people are on notice that there is a problem. Here are some solutions to the chances of having an assault committed on campus and what we can do about it as public, Members of Congress, and what universities can do about it. Some of those solutions are presented in the president’s report at Texas A&M. Many of the solutions are presented in what these victims, the 12th Woman, tell us about. The current oversight—because there are Federal laws that talk about reporting all crimes, including assault— seems to affect encouraging colleges to underreport sexual assaults. I certainly applaud these young women for having the courage to come forward and tell their stories to the world. This 12th Woman group, as I said, are here today, and they are advocating for change on the national level. It has nothing to do with Texas A&M. It has everything to with changing all of our universities. It is a call to action. The 12th Woman is dedicated to bringing change to the way universities address sexual assault, not just at A&M, but across the country. I will stand with the 12th Woman, Mr. Speaker, for their coming forward and telling their stories. These stories that you heard are not unique to one university. They happen all over the country. So what are we doing about it? Hopefully, I have shown part of the problem. Now it is up to us. I am talking about Congress. Victims of crime on college campuses—or really any other place—sexual assault victims don’t have highdollar lawyers from New York City to represent them. Whether it is in a university setting or whether it is in a courtroom, they don’t. Some of them do, but most of them don’t. As stated in these cases, most of them are alone when they are trying to resolve this problem before officials at the school. The United States Congress must be their voice. How do we become their voice? We make sure there is the right legislation filed to protect our daughters and our sons when they go to our universities. We have some legislation. The Clery Act is one of these. We are going to try to improve it. So I am talking about three pieces of legislation. These are pieces of legislation that are bipartisan. I will repeat that. It is bipartisan. So it may not get a whole lot of notoriety because we are not fussing, fighting, and feuding with each other. Both sides agree. I want to thank CAROLYN MALONEY from New York and JACKIE SPEIER from California—bipartisan—for working on these pieces of legislation. They will help combat sexual assault on campus, provide victims with a clear path to reporting to the universities, make sure victim advocates are ready and available to all students nationwide, and make sure that victims are able to access a qualified nurse examiner, a forensic examiner. Let me mention the first one. It is called the Megan Act. It is bipartisan. Megan Rondini lived in Austin, Texas. She went to school at the University of Alabama. While she was a sophomore there, she was at a local hangout, a bar, and came in contact with a former student. She was taken to his place. She was sexually assaulted, jumped out of the second story window at his place, and then the whole system seemed to fall apart. She went to the hospital, but the person at the hospital didn’t really understand what the responsibility was of that medical test. The rape kit was taken, but nobody knows where it is. It is gone. The police interrogated her, I think, because they knew who the accused was. The parents were important people at the university. They didn’t have anything to do with the case and even talked about filing charges on her. Then she went to the university and talked to a counselor. The counselor said: Well, I know the accused, and I am not qualified to talk to you about it. 
But they didn’t furnish her with somebody else. So she didn’t get help from the university, didn’t get help at the hospital, and didn’t get help from the police department. She had a lot of emotional problems and decided to transfer. So she transferred from the University of Alabama to SMU in Dallas, Texas. Shortly after she transferred, Mr. Speaker, she committed suicide. She couldn’t handle it, all of these things going on in her mind. So she paid; she got the death penalty for what happened to her. Megan Rondini could have been anybody’s daughter. So we have filed the Megan Rondini Act. What does it do? It does one thing specifically. It says universities and colleges must provide a SANE or a SAFE, sexual assault forensic examiner, to victims of sexual assault, or have one available for them nearby so that when they go to report this trauma medically they get treatment from an expert. It is bipartisan legislation. We ought to pass this legislation, get it on the House floor and pass it to make our universities better. I will say this about the University of Alabama, because of this thing that happened at their school, they changed a lot of things. Good for them that they changed a lot of their procedures. I would ask the Speaker how much time I have remaining. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. ESTES of Kansas). The gentleman has 17 minutes remaining. Mr. POE of Texas. Okay. I will talk a little faster. I am from Texas. We talk slower. I would like to get more than 17 minutes, but I understand. JACKIE SPEIER and I have filed a bill called the HALT Act, HALT Campus Sexual Violence Act. I will give as many details as I can, Mr. Speaker. The National Institute of Justice estimates that 63 percent of universities shirk their already legal responsibility when reporting sexual assault violent crimes. They are already supposed to report it; they don’t. This bill will make sure that they do report it. 
It allows the Department of Education to issue financial penalties to people who don’t comply with Title IX. It increases the penalties up to $100,000. It allows a private right of action by the victim on campus, and it requires public disclosure of a list of colleges and universities under investigation in violation of Title IX and the Clery Act. It increases funding so that universities can do this. The HALT Act is a good piece of legislation. The third piece of legislation by CAROLYN MALONEY of New York and me—it is pretty bipartisan. CAROLYN  MALONEY from New York is a progressive, liberal Democrat. TEDPOEis kind of a conservative guy from Texas. We are joining together to sponsor the Campus Accountability and Safety Act. What does it do? It provides, specifically, victim advocates in sexual assault cases to victims of sexual assault on campus. It does a lot of other things, too. I hope we can get both of these on the House floor soon. It also requires that there is one reporting mechanism. In other words, if you are complaining of sexual assault by a student, there is one avenue on campuses. Other campuses, such as the ones that have the Corps of Cadets, you go through the Corps of Cadets. If it is against a faculty member, for example, you go that route. If it is against an athlete, you go a different route. So we need to combine all of those in all of our reporting systems so that students know and are put on notice that they can go through one specific route. These legislations do a lot of other specific things, too. Recently I was at Rice University. I had Members of Congress down there. We did a sexual assault forum on campus. What happened? Rice University is doing a lot of good things. One of the things they do is just make it real obvious that there are things that students can do. Mr. Speaker, I include this poster in the RECORD . 
YOUARENOTALONE  Rice University has supportive and caring faculty, staff, and students who are here to help you. If you have experienced any kind of sexual assault, sexual harassment, relationship violence and/or stalking, it is not your fault and you have options. Rice University’s Sexual Misconduct Policy prohibits relationship violence, stalking, and sexual misconduct. These behaviors include physical and verbal abuse, sexual assault, unwanted sexual contact, and sexual harassment. For emergency assistance, call: RUPD/REMS. For confidential counseling, call (24/7): Rice Counseling Center Houston Area Women’s Center the Montrose Center Students can learn about their options at Rice by contacting: Title IX Coordinator Student Wellbeing and Title IX Support To learn more or to find a STRIVE Liaison: Visit safe.rice.edu Email TitleIXSupport@rice.edu Mr. POE of Texas. They post these posters throughout the university and restrooms telling them basically you are not alone and here is what you can do to educate and what you can do if a crime is committed against you. It is a good idea. They have a protocol that I think many universities ought to look at. They have designed a studentbased—really?—a program that all students are required to take when they are an incoming freshman. It is not just a 1hour course. It is several weeks long. They educate students on how to deal with other people—relationships—that a lot of them have never been trained in doing. Mr. Speaker, I have been talking about, I think, a very serious thing that happens. Here in Congress, we spend a lot of time talking. Right before I talked, you heard a lot of talking on both sides. But we spend a lot of time talking about our national defense, and we spend a lot of money on airplanes, aircraft carriers, and our military. I’m not saying that we shouldn’t. But it is defense spending to make us safe from foreign countries. Should we not be as concerned about the safety of Americans in America and maybe refocus on their safety? I think we can and we should. We need to make sure we get our priorities straight. b1300 I have known a lot of sexual assault victims in my career at the courthouse for 30plus years. I still keep in contact with them on a periodic basis. Sometimes they just call me to check in. I have known sexual assault victims who, even after the trial and the person went off to the Texas penitentiary, committed suicide. Mr. Speaker, rape, sexual assault is a different type of crime than your car being stolen or your house being burglarized. It affects the individual in the deepest part of their soul. Sometimes the offender tries to steal the identity, the soul, the selfworth of the victim. Many of them feel that way for a long time. We in the House of Representatives have the responsibility to be the voice of sexual assault victims in our country and do what we can to make sure that they have due process, that the same Constitution that protects the rights of offenders—and I totally believe in those rights—protects the rights of people who are victims of crime. Due process and justice must balance both of those so that we get the right decision for the right reason when these things happen to, primarily, our female athletes or female students throughout our universities. I admire these women who have come forward, being bold to make public what happened to them—bad things— and our response should be: We are on your side. We are in it together. We are going to do what we can to make our great universities even greater and protect our young men and women on college campuses. The 12th Woman. I would say, Mr. Speaker, don’t mess with the 12th Woman. These are relentless, tenacious young women who want to take what happened to them and turn it around and make it something that we can prevent, make it a positive thing. My grandmother, who was the most influential person in my life—and I will close with this, Mr. Speaker, and I appreciate the time—lived to a ripe old age of 99. She was the most influential person in my life, even more than both my parents, who are both alive. They are 93 now. She told me that there is nothing more powerful than a woman who has made up her mind. I think these women have made up their mind, and we need to join them and be together in our calls to stop sexual assault on campuses and tell our universities and help our universities make those places safer because our American children and children from other countries that go to our universities are worth fighting for. It is our job to do so, Mr. Speaker. And that is just the way it is. 
Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the topic of my Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my colleague Congressman TED POEholding this important Special Order Hour to honor survivors of sexual violence on our college campuses, and in particular the brave members of the 12th Woman, a group of survivors from Texas A&M University who are speaking truth to power about their experiences. Judge POEhas been unwavering in his pursuit of justice for victims of sexual violence on the bench and in Congress. I applaud his strong advocacy and tireless dedication to this incredibly important cause. He is a true ally and his legacy on this issue will continue to help countless victims and survivors move forward. When parents drop off their children for their first year of college, we expect our institutions of higher learning to keep them safe. But that’s not the reality for 20 percent of young women and six percent of young men who are destined to become victims of sexual assault on campus. To make matters worse, survivors are constantly told that they are responsible for their assault—from being penalized for so called ‘code of ethics’ violations, like drinking at parties or going into other students’ dorm rooms, to being blamed for not fighting back. That includes a brave survivor at Texas A&M who had the wherewithal to alert her school that her rapist was allowed back on the swim team after being suspended for only one semester and not being subject to criminal charges. The school’s response speaks volumes—‘‘I regret your displeasure with the perceived impact, and I wish you all the best as 
you continue to seek healing’’. The school’s failure to protect the survivor and other potential victims is unacceptable. They are not alone. Universities continue to inadequately deal with perpetrators across the country—from expulsions after graduation, to honor code violations that carry less of a penalty than plagiarism, to allowing perpetrators to directly crossexamine their victims about their past sexual history during the socalled investigative process. This kind of antiquated victimblaming and shaming must end. That is why I am introducing the bipartisan Hold Accountable and Lend Transparency or HALT Campus Sexual Violence Act with my colleagues Congressmen TEDPOEand B RIAN FITZPATRICK to ensure that our colleges and universities do everything they can to hold perpetrators accountable and to provide the support survivors need and deserve. 
WHAT TAX REFORM MEANS TO PENNSYLVANIA The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. ROTHFUS ) for 30 minutes. Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a few minutes this afternoon during this Special Order just to go over some highlights of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as we continue to see very robust economic growth happening across the country, including in my district back in western Pennsylvania. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is the culmination of years spent listening to the stories of families back home who had nothing left over at the end of the month, of families who were struggling to save for retirement, pay off loans, and simply make ends meet. These stories are not just unique to my district, but they are coming in from all across America to the House of Representatives. For too long, hardworking Americans toiled under a broken Tax Code filled with loopholes and special interest carveouts. For most of the last decade, we had sluggish growth, stagnant wages, and limited opportunity across the country, including parts of Pennsylvania. When an economy is stagnant and not healthy, fewer job opportunities exist and workers’ hardearned wages often do not keep up with expenses. Since being elected in 2012, I told my constituents that it did not have to be that way, that we could do better, that we deserve better. That is why 6 months ago, my colleagues and I passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and the President signed it into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act puts hardworking Americans first by allowing them to keep more of their paychecks, bringing businesses home from overseas, and creating that healthier economy. To help workers keep more of their wages, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act nearly doubles the standard deduction from $6,350 per individual to $12,000, and from $12,700 to $24,000 for married couples, essentially doubling the amount of income that will not be subject to Federal income taxes. It also expands the child tax credit to $2,000 to help parents with the cost of raising kids, and adds a new credit to help provide care for elderly family members and adults with disabilities. With these changes, the zero tax bracket increases significantly. Consequently, more Americans will be fully exempt from Federal income taxes, and they can keep more of their hardearned wages. Additionally, before the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the United States had the highest business tax rates in the industrialized world. Pennsylvania’s combined Federal and State corporate tax rate stood at nearly 45 percent. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is removing a choke hold on our economy, decreasing for American corporations the tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. Consequently, the Pennsylvania combined rate now stands at 31 percent. This puts American companies in a better place, from a competitive standpoint, than their Chinese and Mexican counterparts. Think about that. Prior to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, China was treating its companies better, Mexico was treating its companies better, with lower tax rates, and you saw investments going into those countries. Now, with the United States having lower tax rates, it is turning around. This improvement, as well as other provisions such as the immediate expensing of new equipment, is causing companies to bring cash back from overseas and invest in America and hire workers and raise pay. Under the new system, small business employers, known as passthrough enterprise—your partnerships, your LLCs—will be able to deduct 20 percent of their qualified business income, and the remaining income will be taxed at new and lower rates. This translates into a significant tax cut for Main Street businesses, freeing up resources that will allow them to innovate and invest in their communities, hire workers, and increase wages. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act also established a program that will ensure that the benefits of our booming economy reach areas that have been historically overlooked: the opportunity zone programs. States are identifying areas that have struggled with high poverty and sluggish economic growth. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provides tax incentives to direct private investment into and reinvigorate these communities. These communities have been starved of robust capital investment for decades. That is about to change. In my district in western Pennsylvania, Governor Wolf from Pennsylvania has designated zones across the State. In western Pennsylvania, in my district, we have tracts that have been designated in Beaver Falls, Midland, Johnstown, and Aliquippa. These are strong communities, Mr. Speaker, that once again can thrive thanks to the attractive incentives offered in the opportunity zone investment. This is how it is going to work. People may have an asset they have been holding for a long time and have a capital gain there. There is $6 trillion locked up in capital gains across this country. If somebody wants to make an investment in a community where there has not been an investment, they can sell that asset, defer their capital gain, and invest in that fund. If they hold that in the fund for 10 years, they can defer the tax for that 10 years, get a step up in basis, and here is where it is great: they will not pay taxes on the appreciation of that investment in the opportunity zone. Think about that capital that can flow into those communities and stay there and grow a business. That is private capital coming in, which is different from a government grant that might go in. You have individuals who are looking to make investments. They want that investment to grow. They want that investment to do well. They want that investment to prosper in these communities. This is good news for those communities and good news for people who live there and can get jobs as a result of the investments in these opportunity zones. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is not just about simplifying our Tax Code. It is saving people money. It is about empowering people in Pennsylvania and throughout our Nation with hope and opportunity to better their lives for themselves, their families, and their communities. These reforms within the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act are resulting in real benefits that are being experienced across the Nation. Already, 90 percent of American workers are receiving higher takehome pay under the new withholding tables. Four million workers have received bonuses, raises, or expanded benefits, and over 1 million new jobs have been created, including 160,000 manufacturing jobs. For the first time in many years, there are more job openings than job seekers. Last month, the unemployment rate was 4 percent, nearly the lowest in decades, and the unemployment rates for African Americans and Hispanics were at historic lows. Fifty eight percent of small business owners are confident about hiring new employees, and more Americans are optimistic about their future. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is bringing workers who were pushed to the sidelines during the previous years back into the labor force and restoring hope to everyday Americans. In June, 600,000 people entered the labor force, and 213,000 new jobs were added. Businesses in my district are reinvesting in their employees, communities, and operations through bonuses, 
higher wages and salaries, and increased charitable giving. In western Pennsylvania, PNC Bank and BNY Mellon have raised their employees’ minimum wages. Major companies, including UPS, FedEx, and Home Depot, that employ thousands of western Pennsylvanians, are providing bonuses and contributing more to their employees’ retirement plans. In fact, the Hampton Township Home Depot plans to create its own Success Sharing Program, in which hourly employees will be able to divide an estimated $30,000 to $40,000 among themselves semiannually, twice a year. The Ellwood Group, a steel manufacturer, is planning a $60 million addition to its New Castle plant and adding 25 new employees once it is fully operational. Some who opposed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts have touted these meaningful benefits to U.S. workers as ‘‘crumbs.’’ They have said that this law only helps the wealthy. Let me ask this: Is the Pennsylvania Utilities Commission requiring 17 of its utility companies to give a monthly credit to their customers, saving $320 million a year, crumbs? Mr. Speaker, these aren’t crumbs. These are seeds that are taking root and growing opportunities, creating jobs and the economy for all Americans to prosper. Don’t just take it from me. Take it from John in New Kensington, who is seeing more money in his paycheck and received a $2,500 bonus. Take it from Brian in Windber, who is receiving $500 more a month; Michael in Aliquippa, who is bringing home an extra 4.5 percent in each paycheck; Edward in Westmoreland County, who is receiving $128 more per paycheck. That is more than $3,000 per year. Take it from Flory in Westmoreland County, who said that, thanks to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, her family will have more money to use towards their son’s postgraduate education; and Heidi from Allegheny County, who wrote to tell me that ‘‘every penny we aren’t taxed can go towards our other bills such as food, utilities, school loans, a mortgage, and clothing for our children. We were barely scraping by during the previous administration.’’ b1315 The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is about empowering everyone, from the single mom in Ambridge, Pennsylvania, looking to buy her first home to the entrepreneur in Beaver Falls, working to achieve his or her American Dream. When our people can fully develop their Godgiven skills and talents in a competitive economy without the government’s excessive taxes and regulations, not only will our citizens’ lives improve, but our country will grow stronger. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ADJOURNMENT Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn. The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 1 o’clock and 17 minutes p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until Monday, July 23, 2018, at noon for morninghour debate.

Equip us, by Your Spirit, to be defined by consensus through compassion, expertise enlightened by experience, leadership resistant to polarization and expediency, yet intentional in unity, honesty, transparency, and integrity, as together we seek to be ‘‘one nation under God.’’ We bring our prayers to You in and through the Name of Christ our Lord.
