Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, too many students are being overlooked by our education system. These students are emergent bilinguals, a group that makes up 10 percent of the K–12 student population. In the law, we refer to them as English learners, students whose native language is one other than English and who are not yet English proficient. But when we call students ELs day to day, we ignore the important fact that they are already proficient in another language, whether it is Spanish, Chinese, or Arabic. As these students learn English, they become bilingual, and bilingualism is an incredible asset in our global society. We benefit, and we need to shift our view of emergent bilinguals and recognize their great potential. We must recognize that by investing in their success, we all benefit. Sarah Hesson, a Rhode Island educator, introduced me to the term ‘‘emergent bilinguals,’’ and I encourage my colleagues to use it as well and to celebrate students’ emerging bilingualism. 
After all, it is a gift that will empower students to become more successful later in life. 
MOMENT OF SILENCE HONORING THE LIFE OF CORPORAL DANIEL BAKER (Mr. LAHOOD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to honor the life of an American hero and son of Illinois. Last Thursday, Corporal Daniel Baker of Tremont, Illinois, was aboard a KC–130 refueling aircraft that collided with an F/A–18 Hornet during a training mission over the ocean south of Japan. Following a search and rescue mission, Corporal Baker was declared deceased this past Tuesday morning. He was 21 years old. Born and raised in Tremont, Illinois, Daniel Baker was known by friends and family to be a man of deep faith who was kind, compassionate, and sincere. In 2015, Daniel graduated from Tremont High School and felt a deep calling to serve his country in the military. Corporal Baker served 2 years in the United States Marine Corps. He received the National Defense Service Medal and the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal. Corporal Baker was taken from this world way too early, but he embodied every quality we seek to impart upon young men and women in this country, and he will be deeply missed by his friends, family, and the Tremont community. May we continue to keep Daniel and his family in our thoughts and prayers. We will never forget his selfless sacrifice to our country. At this time, Mr. Speaker, I would request that the House of Representatives honor his service with a moment of silence. 
RECOGNIZING WALLA WALLA COUNTY SHERIFF JOHN TURNER (Mr. NEWHOUSE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor John Turner, who is retiring from his role as Walla Walla County Sheriff. He honorably served the public in this role for 8 years. Sheriff Turner dedicated himself to working to make his community safer. He sought to provide 24/7 patrol coverage, reestablish the K–9 program, address gang activity in the county, and proactively address other public safety concerns. He was nominated by his peers across Washington State for the National Sheriffs’ Association Ferris E. Lucas Award for National Sheriff of the Year and received the National Sheriffs’ Association Medal of Merit for his outstanding positive accomplishments. In his retirement announcement, Sheriff Turner wrote: ‘‘Being Walla Walla County Sheriff for the last two terms has been one of the greatest honors of my life. As I wind down my second term, I ask that you continue to keep those brave men and women who regularly and selflessly go into harm’s way in your positive thoughts and prayers.’’ Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Sheriff John Turner for his tremendous service to the people of Walla Walla County and Washington State. f
