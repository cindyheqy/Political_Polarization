Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to join me in the urgent effort to address the dramatically rising threat of domestic terrorism. From a church in Charleston where worshippers were engaged in Bible study on a Wednesday night to a peaceful counterdemonstration in Charlottesville, our national consciousness has been seared by the violence of white supremacist and other extremist domestic terrorist groups. In fact, a recent FBIDepartment of Homeland Security joint intelligence bulletin found white supremacist organizations were responsible for 49 homicides and 29 attacks from 2000 to 2016, more than any other domestic extremist movement. In response to this threat, today I am introducing the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act, which makes smart changes to ensure our Federal agencies are effectively coordinating on monitoring these terrorist organizations and better able to prevent acts of violence. This is companion legislation to the bill introduced by Senator DURBIN  in the Senate. I thank him for his leadership, as well as my colleagues in the House, Ranking Member BENNIE THOMPSON , Representatives ROBIN KELLY , L OU CORREA , and V ICENTE GONZALEZ , for joining me in this effort. Working together, we can crack down on these domestic terrorist organizations and ultimately save lives. 
RECOGNIZING FEBRUARY AS CTE MONTH The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON ) for 5 minutes. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, February is Career and Technical Education Month. As co chair of the Career and Technical Education Caucus and a senior member of the Committee on the Education and the Workforce, I have long been aware of the importance of career and technical education programs that provide learners of all ages careerready skills. From agriculture to the arts, from marketing to manufacturing, CTE programs work to develop America’s most valuable resources: its people. Together, with Representative JIMLANGEVIN , my CTE Caucus cochair, we will introduce a resolution officially designating February as CTE Month. Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to sign on as cosponsors because CTE truly benefits all Americans. CTE is taught in a range of settings, from high schools and area technical centers to technical and 2year community colleges. In total, 12.5 million high school and college students are enrolled in CTE programs across the Nation. Just last week, President Trump expressed his commitment to CTE during his first State of the Union Address. President Trump said: ‘‘Let us invest in workforce development and job training. Let us open great vocational schools so our future workers can learn a craft and realize their full potential.’’ Fortunately, the House unanimously passed the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act last June. I authored this bill with Representative RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI . It aims to close the skills gap by modernizing Federal investment in CTE programs and connecting educators with industry stakeholders. This is the first major overhaul to the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Improvement Act since 2006. We are currently working with our colleagues in the Senate to bring up this bipartisan bill for consideration so we can get this important reauthorize signed into law. The Perkins Act is important for educational institutions as well as businesses. Smallbusiness owners rely upon Perkins programs to increase the number of skilled candidates in emerging sectors. Future workers in fields such as manufacturing, information technology, healthcare, and agriculture also rely on career and technical education to obtain the skills necessary for highskill, highwage, familysustaining careers. Essentially, Mr. Speaker, we are providing the education tools to equip a 21st century workforce. CTE has established itself as a path that many highachieving students choose in pursuit of industry certifications and handson skills that they can use right out of high school in skillsbased education programs or in college. By modernizing the Federal investment in CTE programs, we will be able to connect more educators with industry stakeholders and close the skills gap that exists in this country. There are good jobs out there, but people need to be qualified to get them. 
Mr. Speaker, we have all met young people who haven’t been inspired in a traditional classroom setting. We all know people who have lost jobs or are underemployed and are looking for goodpaying, familysustaining jobs. We all know people who are aspiring for a promotion but keep falling short year after year. We all know people who are living in poverty. Maybe their families have been living in poverty for generations, for so long they can’t even remember what put them there in the first place. A career in technical education is a pathway forward for each and every one of these people. CTE gives people from all walks of life an opportunity to succeed. 
b1000 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. SIMPSON ) at 10 a.m. 
PRAYER The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: We give You thanks, O God, for giving us another day. Bless the Members of the minority party as they prepare to gather these next days. May they, with those who accompany them, travel safely and meet in peace. Bless, also, the majority party as they return to their constituencies. Give them hearts and ears to listen, to listen well to all those whom they represent. May the work that needs to be done presently result in progress toward addressing the needs of the Nation to the benefit of all. May all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory. Amen. 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8, rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn. f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. COSTELLO ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to make it clear that treason is not a laughing matter. It is a serious crime embedded in the Constitution, punishable by death. But since your Commander in Chief chose to raise it at a political rally, let’s have a discussion about treason. Is it treason for a Presidential campaign to meet with a hostile foreign power to sell out our democracy and rig the election? Is it treason for a Presidential campaign to meet with Russian spies who promised information that was negative about a political opponent and then failed to report that meeting to law enforcement officials? Is it treason for your former National Security Adviser to be a Russian asset sitting at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue doing the bidding of Vladimir Putin? How dare you lecture us about treason. This is not a dictatorship. It is a democracy, and we do not have to stand for a reality show host masquerading as President of the United States of America. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. 
PAKISTAN IS A MENACE TO RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AND A SUPPORTER OF TERROR (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the State Department has announced that it is adding Pakistan to a special watch list for severe violations of religious freedom. The long overdue decision recognizes that Pakistan’s shameful policies target and encourage violence against religious minorities, primarily Christians. Pakistan’s blasphemy laws declare open season for attacks on these already persecuted communities. Pakistan also lets radical Islamic terrorist groups like the Afghanistan Taliban Network, Haqqani Network, and alQaida go unchallenged in Pakistan. This makes Pakistan one of the most dangerous places in the world for Christians. Just last month, ISIS suicide bombers struck a densely packed church in Pakistan, killing nine and wounding dozens. I applaud the President’s decision to reexamine our relationship with Pakistan and freeze military aid. Pakistan has played the United States for too long. We cannot continue to provide billions of dollars to a country that fosters terrorism and hate. And that is just the way it is. 
CONCERNS REGARDING THE NEW NUCLEAR POSTURE REVIEW (Mr. BLUMENAUER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, with all that is going on in Washington, D.C., these days, it is really hard to keep up with some things that are amazingly consequential. One item that is flying below the radar screen is the new Nuclear Posture Review from the Trump administration. They are talking about expanding our nuclear arsenal, embarking us on a path of spending $1.2 trillion. Not only do we have more than we need already that we can’t afford to use and pay for; we are talking about other elements here that are disturbing: developing new destabilizing nuclear weapons; being able to use nuclear weapons in nonnuclear situations, for example, responding to cyber attacks when you might not even know who did it. We still have all these land based ballistic missiles in silos on hairtrigger alert. We just saw the vulnerability there in Hawaii with the recent mistaken threat of an attack send a whole state into panic. We need to take a hard look at how to do this right before it is too late. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF VIETNAM HERO THOMAS COREY (Mr. MAST asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, I dedicate my time today to a man whom I am honored to represent in Congress. His name is Mr. Thomas Corey, a decorated Vietnam hero who proudly served our country as a combat infantryman. During the 1968 Tet Offensive, he received an enemy round in the neck that struck his spinal cord, leaving him paralyzed, a quadriplegic for life. But with true American grit, that did not stop him from dedicating his life and his work to our veterans and to our country. He was a tireless patient advocate, working on medical research and family support for disabled veterans. Mr. Corey returned to Vietnam 16 times, promoting reconciliation for individual veterans, accounting for those missing in action, and to study the health effects of Agent Orange. For these extraordinary efforts, he was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. He was also the first recipient of the Vietnam Veterans of America Commendation Medal, their highest award for service. Mr. Corey, your Nation is grateful to you. I am grateful for you. America is proud and blessed to have men like you who never stop fighting for this country on and off the battlefield. And, Mr. Corey, I salute you. RECOGNIZING THE AFRICAN AMERICAN MUSEUM OF BUCKS COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, February is African American History Month, and I rise today to recognize the African American Museum of Bucks County, Pennsylvania, in my district, for the work that they do in our community. With the mission of promoting an understanding and appreciation for the AfricanAmerican experience by focusing on history, education, inspiration, and building up the community, they are already having a huge impact. I had the opportunity to meet with many of the women and men who are responsible for the museum when they came down to Washington, D.C., in December, and I would like to recognize them now: President Linda Salley; Vice President Bill Reed; Secretary Nancy Bell; Correspondence Secretary Robyn Johnson; Treasurer Nicole Brown; Assistant Treasurer Alonzo Salley; and the founders: Harvey Spencer, Sr.; Millard Mitchel; Natalie Kaye; Merian Frieberg; Carole Johnson; Mechelle Connors; and Deal Wright. Mr. Speaker, the mission of the African American Museum of Bucks County is an extremely important one. I commend all those involved, and I wish them continued success and continued growth. I encourage everyone in our community to get involved and to support this outstanding organization. 
PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 772, COMMON SENSE NUTRITION DISCLOSURE ACT OF 2017; PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1153, MORTGAGE CHOICE ACT OF 2017; PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 4771, SMALL BANK HOLDING COMPANY RELIEF ACT OF 2018; AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 725 and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Colorado is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. HASTINGS ), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. b1015 
Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Colorado? 
There was no objection. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the underlying legislation. This rule makes in order two bills reported favorably by the Committee on Financial Services and one bill reported favorably by the Committee on Energy and Commerce. I just want to take a moment at the beginning to point out that there are no amendments made in order by this rule because there were no amendments offered to any of these bills. Both of the Financial Services bills were the subject of hearings in the committee last year. Both bills were reported out of committee with bipartisan support of 75 percent or more of the committee members. The Energy and Commerce bill was reported favorably by the committee with a large bipartisan vote of 39–14. The rule also provides us with the necessary tools to ensure that we can bring government funding measures to the floor quickly to prevent a government shutdown. Mr. Speaker, we have three bills before us today. Each of these bills deals with one underlying problem: Washington overregulation. That is it. These are not bills protecting Americans from some foreign hostile force. These are bills protecting Americans from the overreach of their own government. It is a sad time in which we find ourselves when we must dedicate legislative effort to undoing the harmful effects of the American government on the American people. Mr. Speaker, in 2013, the CFPB issued its rule commonly referred to as the qualified mortgage rule, or the QM rule. The QM rule requires creditors to make a good faith effort to determine a customer’s ability to repay a loan if the loan is secured by a home. However, the rule creates a legal safe harbor from liability under the rule for qualified mortgages. One aspect of a qualified mortgage is that it cannot have total points and fees exceeding 3 percent of the total loan amount if the loan amount is at least $100,000. However, some fees may be excluded from the points and fees cap if they are reasonable and the lender or any affiliate of the lender receives no compensation from the service. This all sounds well and good. We certainly don’t want predatory lending institutions referring business to themselves just to pad their bottom line at the expense of unsuspecting borrowers. But this is a great example of how massive, onesizefitsall Washington regulation often ends up hurting Americans. The result of the points and fees cap within the QM rule has been to place low and moderateincome borrowers in a position where they end up spending more money to secure a loan. Mr. Speaker, my home State of Colorado has been experiencing explosive population growth over the past decade and longer. Between 2009 and 2016, we added a net increase of more than 600,000 people. But home prices also increased significantly over that time, more than 57 percent. In 2016, according to The Denver Post, we had the lowest growth we have experienced in many years at only a 30,000person net increase. In part, the slowing growth rate has to do with rising housing costs. This is why it is vitally important that many firsttime homeowners and others have access to affordable loans. Government regulation should not be a part of driving up housing costs. Why does this happen? Why does a Federal regulation result in hurting the very people it is intended to help? It is simple: Washington regulators cannot take into account the unique circumstances of each individual American. This is a crucial difference between the common sense of Americans across this land and the selfimportance of some here in D.C. Many in D.C. believe firmly that the Federal Government is able to protect every American from every bad experience. They express enormous faith in socalled experts who believe they can effectively govern from afar the lives of Americans. I reject this notion. I reject the belief that a class of enlightened experts and bureaucrats in Washington can better run the lives of individuals. That philosophy deprives Americans of the freedom to make their own choices. When Washington’s power expands, individual liberty retreats. So we have to have bills like the ones before us today. The DoddFrank financial regulatory bill required the CFPB to issue the QM rule. The QM rule was supposed to help low to moderateincome borrowers save money, but, instead, the QM rule created a situation where low and moderateincome borrowers cannot take advantage of discounted services offered by their lender. The rule forces these borrowers to secure these services from third parties which almost always charge more than the lenders would charge for the same services. The negative impact of this rule is so abundantly clear that half of the committee’s Democrats voted with all of the Republicans in support of fixing this provision of DoddFrank. Passing this bill will not magically cause housing in Colorado to become more affordable, but it will eliminate an unnecessary regulation that needlessly drives up borrowing costs. Mr. Speaker, in addition to rolling back DoddFrank regulations, the second Financial Services bill that we have before us today protects the ability of small banks to issue debt and raise capital. The Federal Reserve generally discourages bank holding companies from using debt to finance acquisitions, particularly the purchasing of banks. However, the Federal Reserve carved out certain small bank holding companies. In order to be considered a small bank holding company, these companies had an asset cap of $150 million. By 2015, the cap had been increased to $1 billion. The bill before us today increases the cap to $3 billion. As we have heard last night during testimony at the Rules Committee, there is no science or data behind the level of the cap. Think about that for a second. The government has established a cap that has a negative impact on our community banks, and the cap has no basis in anything, not science, not data, not historical financial patterns, nothing. The cap is simply a whim of Washington. Mr. Speaker, this is absurd. It is time we allow our community banks to have an avenue to continue being locally owned and based in our communities rather than being bought out by Wall Street. Today we have two Financial Services bills before us that reduce regulations and allow Coloradans and all Americans greater freedom in the choice of banking services. I urge support of these two bills. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. BUCK) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes for debate. I rise today to debate this rule, the Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act, the Mortgage Choice Act of 2017, and the Small Bank Holding Company Relief Act of 2018. H.R. 772 would amend the labeling requirements for nutrition information displayed by restaurants and other retail food establishments. This measure would unnecessarily complicate and further delay the implementation of nutrition labeling requirements established by the Affordable Care Act. In what can only be described as a rather astounding attempt to avoid good sense, this bill will make calorie and nutrition information less accessible and less useful to consumers at a time when we are spending $147 billion annually on healthcare measures related to chronic illnesses that are directly tied to obesity. Consumers need more access to this information, not less. The second measure, H.R. 1153, the Mortgage Choice Act of 2017, would introduce some of the high fees that borrowers faced leading up to the 2008 mortgage and financial crisis. This bill would roll back important homebuyer protection reforms, taking us back to the days when the true cost of a loan could be obscured in mortgage documents to the detriment of home buyers everywhere. The third measure, the Small Bank Holding Company Relief Act of 2018, would direct the Federal Reserve Board to triple the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement from $1 billion to $3 billion, allowing even larger banking institutions to use greater amounts of debt to finance acquisitions, seemingly ignoring the lessons 
from the previous financial disaster that we continue to climb out of to this very day. Indeed, these Financial Services bills would weaken and politicize the policies created after the financial crisis to identify and guard against systemic risk in our financial system; and will allow even larger bank holding companies to leverage themselves with debt when financing the purchase of other banks. Reviewing this legislation, I had to ask myself: Are the memories of my Republican colleagues really so short that they do not remember the complete breakdown of our financial system only a few short years ago? Let me remind my friends across the aisle that the financial crisis of 2008 was the worst economic downturn America has faced since the Great Depression. Four million homes went through foreclosure and 9 million Americans lost their jobs. Yet, instead of supporting efforts to ensure a financial collapse of such magnitude does not happen again, the majority has, instead, chosen to weaken the very protections put in place to prevent it. With this in mind, we are left with two questions of equal importance: On the one hand, why are the Republicans so set on weakening muchneeded and proven economic protections and making it harder for people to knowingly buy healthy food? And, secondly, why are they doing so now? Mr. Speaker, the government runs out of funding this Thursday at midnight. We, once again, are forced to stare down the very real possibility of another shutdown because the Republican leadership either cannot or will not govern in a mature and reliable manner. Instead, our country is forced to lurch from continuing resolution to continuing resolution for no discernible reason. I think we are coming up on continuing resolution number 5. Rather than taking the time to address their everpresent inability to govern responsibly, we are here today to debate evidence of that very inability, namely, the three bills we will be asked to vote on shortly. It strikes me as odd, and is certainly frustrating, that I must, once again, remind the majority that we have yet to pass a budget agreement that provides an equal increase to both defense and nondefense spending. Caveat right there. Later today, when we take up the CR, it is likely going to be said by a lot of people that our primary responsibility is to provide for the defense of this Nation, and I agree 100 percent. But that does not ignore the secondary responsibility of promoting the general welfare, and there are a variety of measures that are unattended and need to be attended. I might add, military people, veterans, and others find themselves in need of those particular services that are unattended as well. We have yet to enact disaster aid so that our fellow Americans in Florida, Texas, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, California, and southwest Louisiana can recover from the devastating hurricanes and wildfires. b1030 We have yet to provide funding, and we will be talking about that a little bit later in our previous question request. We haven’t provided funding for what we all know is the urgent opioid crisis. We have yet to protect hardworking Americans’ pensions, and we have yet to see a serious proposal from Republican leadership to protect DREAMers and those whose temporary protected status will soon run out. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I just want to point out to my friend from Florida that we were both here on the floor as the House of Representatives passed all 12 appropriations bills in early September. As we look across to the other side of the Capitol, not much work has been done on those appropriations bills since they left the House and traveled to the Senate. The answer to the continuing problem that we have with continuing resolutions is to find Members of the Senate who are willing to work as hard as the House has and pass appropriations bills and fund the government. Unfortunately, that doesn’t seem to be happening right now, and I hope we do pass a continuing resolution, I hope we do fund the military, and I hope we give some more stability to this government. But the finger pointing in this case I don’t think is warranted in the House. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Utah (Mrs. LOVE). Mrs. LOVE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule and in support of the underlying bills: H.R. 772, the Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act of 2017; H.R. 1153, the Mortgage Choice Act of 2017; and my bill, H.R. 4771, the Small Bank Holding Company Relief Act of 2018. Both H.R. 1153 and H.R. 4771 have received strong bipartisan support in the Financial Services Committee, and I urge my colleagues to support this rule. The goal of H.R. 4771 is one that I have been pushing for the past few years to help our small banks thrive and serve their communities. Since that is a shared goal on both sides of the aisle, I am grateful that Mr. GOTTHEIMER and Mr. M EEKS joined me in cosponsoring this bill. The Small Bank Holding Company Relief Act of 2018 is a very simple bill that helps small banks and savings and loan companies get the access to capital they need to serve the financial needs of small businesses and individuals in their communities. This bill would simply raise the consolidated asset threshold under the Federal Reserve’s Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement from $1 billion to $3 billion in assets. Raising the asset threshold means that hundreds of additional small banks and thrift holding companies around the country will qualify for coverage under the policy statement and, therefore, be exempt from certain regulatory and capital guidelines. These exemptions make it easier for these small holding companies to raise capital and issue debt. Many holding companies that are above the current threshold face challenges with regard to capital formation, which is particularly of concern for small institutions that are struggling to meet higher capital level demands by regulators. The Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement was first issued in 1980 and provides exemptions from certain capital guidelines for small bank institutions. These capital standards were originally established for larger institutions and disproportionately harm small bank holding companies. The policy statement also makes it easier to form new banks and thrift holding companies and to make the acquisitions by issuing debt at the holding company level. These are all important tools in ensuring that our smallest institutions can continue to lend to consumers and small businesses in their communities and survive in an environment that continuously challenges our community banks. The policy statement also contains several safeguards designed to ensure that small bank holding companies that operate with higher levels of debt permitted by the policy statement do not present an undue risk to the safety and the soundness of these subsidiary banks. Mr. Speaker, this is a simple bill to help our small banks stay strong and continue to support their communities. The last time the threshold was raised in 2014, the effort received widespread bipartisan support. H.R. 4771 also received strong bipartisan support in the Financial Services Committee during the most recent markup. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to give equal support to this rule. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, every day, more than 115 Americans die from an opioid overdose. In 2016, the opioid epidemic claimed more American lives than car accidents and even breast cancer. In order to tackle this growing crisis, we need to pass legislation that invests in effective solutions. Even President Donald John Trump agrees. Last year, he said: ‘‘It is a national emergency. We are going to spend a lot of time, a lot of effort, and a lot of money on the opioid crisis.’’ Well, Mr. Speaker, we have not spent a lot of time, a lot of effort, or a lot of money on this crisis. Instead, the President and the Republican Party spent most of last year trying to take 
away healthcare from millions of Americans and passing a tax cut for billionaires and corporations. And to that, Mr. Speaker, I say: Enough. We need to act now. For that reason, if we defeat the previous question, I am going to offer an amendment to the rule to bring up Representative KUSTER ’s bill, H.R. 4938, the Respond to the Needs in the Opioid War Act. This legislation would create a $25 billion opioid epidemic response fund to invest in programs that will help States respond to the epidemic over the next 5 years. I happen to live in south Florida, which has an equivalent crisis with everyone around the Nation. The people with addiction problems seem to gravitate to several areas in south Florida, particularly Delray Beach and Palm Beach County, where I live. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the RECORD , along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. POE of Texas). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from New Hampshire (Ms. KUSTER ) to discuss our proposal, who is a true champion on this issue. Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me. Mr. Speaker, in New Hampshire and all across this country, people are dying every day. Communities have been devastated by the heroin and opioid epidemic. Last year, we lost nearly 500 people to substance abuse disorder in my small State of New Hampshire. Helping families, first responders, treatment providers, law enforcement officials, and activists in the Granite State confront this crisis has been one of my top priorities in Congress. Our communities need our help, and there is strong bipartisan commitment here in the House to respond effectively to this crisis. While we have passed effective legislation over the last 2 years, including the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, the most important thing that we can do is to provide the funding to help those on the front lines of this crisis do their jobs. While I and my Democratic colleagues welcome the President’s declaration of an opioid public health emergency, the lack of corresponding funding means that this commitment has been little more than empty rhetoric. We need leadership from Congress and the President to save lives across the country by providing real solutions to the opioid epidemic, and I call on my colleagues to act now. During the State of the Union, the President, once again, expressed his commitment to working to address the opioid and heroin epidemic, but, unfortunately, his actions have fallen short of his rhetoric. I have come to the floor today so we can defeat the previous question and bring up for consideration my legislation, the Respond NOW Act. This critical legislation creates a $25 billion opioid epidemic response fund to provide $5 billion annually over 5 years targeted to numerous key initiatives involving agencies such as the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the National Institutes of Health. This includes $18.5 billion for SAMHSA grants to States, particularly those targeted at expanding medication assistance treatment, which opioid experts agree is among the most critical ways to help those suffering from substance use disorder. My bill also provides funding to increase the number of substance use treatment providers and to expand medical research related to the opioid epidemic. Additionally, it provides $2.5 billion for critical CDC initiatives, such as expanding and strengthening evidence based prevention and education strategies. Finally, the bill includes funding specifically to support children and families impacted by this opioid epidemic, including $250 million to support the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, which can help address the risk of adverse childhood experiences, a known driver of this epidemic. We need to break the cycle, and these programs are ideally suited to support substance abuse treatment services to help families stay together and keep children in safe and stable homes. The opioid crisis is a multifaceted challenge, and we are fortunate that so many amazing researchers, first responders, law enforcement officials, community activists, and others are doing amazing work in communities all across our country. But they need the resources to effectively meet these challenges. We must stop playing political games and act immediately to provide emergency funding to help stop this crisis in New Hampshire, in Florida, and all across this country. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I want to turn now to the final bill made in order under this rule, the Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act. Mr. Speaker, in 2016, I had the privilege to visit with one of my constituents, Lamont Muchmore. Lamont owns a Papa John’s pizza franchise and invited me to come to his restaurant. He even taught me how to throw, or how to toss—maybe throw, maybe toss—a pizza. It was a great experience. I got to meet members of his team and hear about their professional goals. I am happy to say that the American Dream is alive within the hearts of the people of Colorado. However, my visit with Lamont was not without concern. You see, recently, Washington had decided to push a hugely disruptive regulation on our food service industry. In the interest of ensuring Americans had information on their food choices, Washington crafted a onesizefitsall mandate that every menu item be labeled with its nutritional content. As someone who has become extremely aware of the quality of foods that I consume, I certainly understand the dogood intentions behind this kind of regulation. But the impact on businesses like Lamont’s has been substantial. In fact, some businesses have no realistic way of complying with the rules. Further, the law that put these regulations in place, ObamaCare, placed criminal penalties on those who fail to comply. How ridiculous is that? If you mislabel or fail to properly label the calorie count on a menu item, you could be fined and go to jail. The bill before us today rectifies some of the harm done by this rule. The bill allows multiple avenues for businesses such as Lamont’s pizza restaurant to comply with menu labeling requirements in the most costeffective manner possible. While I don’t believe the Federal Government needs to require the calorie count of a food item on a menu in Colorado, this bill offers a compromise. Americans will still have access to nutrition information about the food they are purchasing, while businesses will be able to provide a variety of prepared and local foods without fear of major penalties if one serving happens to be slightly different in its calorie count than the last serving. b1045 Mr. Speaker, I cannot tell you how frustrating it is to visit with Coloradans who are working hard to build their businesses, provide for their families and community, and employ people, only to be met with the constant headwind that our Federal Government blows in their faces through its Washingtonknowsbest regulatory schemes. Washington should get out of the way and let Americans do what we do best: cultivate our resources for the good of our family and neighbors. I think often of Coloradans like Lamont. It is men and women like him all across this great land that are doing the important work. I am committed to ensuring that this Federal Government stops jeopardizing their hardwon success, and that Washington’s so called experts give honor where it is due: to the hardworking American people. I thank Lamont for taking the time out of his day to visit with me. This bill answers the needs of his team, and I urge its passage. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
I ask the gentleman from Colorado: Does Lamont own more than one establishment? Mr. BUCK. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. HASTINGS. I yield to the gentleman from Colorado. Mr. BUCK. He does. Mr. HASTINGS. Does he own more than 20? Mr. BUCK. I don’t believe he owns more than 20. Mr. HASTINGS. If he doesn’t own more than 20, then he is not affected by this law. I just want you to know that. I am with you. I want Lamont to be successful. Mr. BUCK. I will pass that information on to Lamont, although I disagree with your reading. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, Democrats do not want to weaken financial protections keeping our economy stable and strong. Democrats do not want to make it harder for Americans to know the nutritional value of their food. Rather, Democrats are ready to pass a budget that creates jobs and grows the paychecks of hardworking Americans. Democrats are ready to provide relief to our fellow Americans suffering from natural disasters. Democrats are ready to protect American’s pensions. Democrats are ready to protect DREAMers; people who have known no other country than the United States; people, who, but for one piece of paper, are just as American as anyone who will walk in this Chamber today; people who served in the United States military, almost 1,000 of them. Preferably, we would like to do that work in a bipartisan way. All we need is for the Republican Conference to stand up to the extreme faction in their party and to finally work with us. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the rule, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Washington is out of step with the vast majority of the American people. It is true that we often do work here that moves our country forward, that protects this great land, but it is also true that there is a competing worldview in this City which seeks to rule over the American people. In Colorado, we have experienced the negative effects of overreach by the Federal Government. How is it that regulators living 1,700 miles away from us believe they can create rules that take into account our needs and that respect our way of life? It is just not possible. Washington is good at stamping out large Federal programs. The problem is that it usually stamps out individual liberty in the process. This City must stop telling the people of Colorado how to live every detail of their lives. Washington’s socalled experts must stop burying Colorado businessmen and women under piles of rules. If we truly free our people to grow and pursue their hopes and dreams, we will experience a renaissance of growth unmatched in our history. This Congress has done good work in rolling back the strong arm of the Federal Government, but there is more work to do. These bills before us continue what should be a neverending pursuit of giving back to the people their personal liberty which has been confiscated by overreaching Federal Government. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman HENSARLING and Chairman W ALDEN for their work on these bills. I thank Chairman SESSIONS for bringing these bills to the floor. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the bills and the rule. The material previously referred to by Mr. HASTINGS is as follows: 
THEVOTE ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION : WHAT ITREALLY MEANS  This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the House of Representatives (VI, 308–311), describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.’’ To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition’’ in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (RIllinois) said: ‘‘The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.’’ The Republican majority may say ‘‘the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.’’ But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here’s how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ‘‘Although it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by voting down the previous question on the rule....  When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.’’ In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled ‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ‘‘Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon.’’ Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Republican majority’s agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous question. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. 
RAISING A QUESTION OF THE PRIVILEGES OF THE HOUSE Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise to a question of the privileges of the House and offer the resolution previously noticed. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the resolution. 
H. R ES. 726 Whereas, on January 30, 2018, Representative Paul Gosar tweeted a series of statements that included ‘‘Today, Congressman Paul Gosar contacted the U.S. Capitol Police, as well as Attorney General Jeff Sessions, asking that they consider checking identification of all attending the State of the Union address and arresting any illegal aliens in attendance.’’; Whereas Representative Gosar went on to tweet ‘‘Any illegal aliens attempting to go through security, under any pretext of invitation or otherwise, should be arrested and deported,’’ said Congressman Gosar; Whereas Representative Gosar’s comments explicitly targeted the DACA recipients that Members of Congress brought as their guests to the State of the Union; Whereas DACA recipients have been granted deferred action, are contributing to this country, and have been thoroughly vetted by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services; Whereas Representative Gosar’s actions to inappropriately pressure the U.S. Capitol Police to detain and deport Dreamers, who are staying in the country according to U.S. Department of Homeland Security regulations, intimidated these young people who are already facing fear and uncertainty; Whereas Representative Gosar abused the power in an attempt to interfere with and politicize the United States Capitol Police’s efforts to provide for a safe, secure, and open environment during the State of the Union; Whereas Representative Gosar has violated clause 1 of rule XXIII of the Code of Official Conduct which states that ‘‘A Member, Delegate, Resident Commissioner, officer or employee of the House shall behave at all times in a manner that shall reflect creditably on the House’’: Now, therefore, be it: Resolved, That the House of Representatives strongly condemns Representative Paul Gosar for his inappropriate actions that intimidated State of the Union guests and discredited the House of Representatives. 
Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion. The Clerk read as follows: 
Mr. Buck moves that the resolution be laid on the table. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion by the gentleman from Colorado. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, this 15 minute vote on the motion to lay the resolution on the table will be followed by 5minute votes on: Ordering the previous question on House Resolution 725; and Adopting House Resolution 725, if ordered.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. HARPER. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4924) to amend the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 to reform the procedures provided under such Act for the initiation, investigation, and resolution of claims alleging that employing offices of the legislative branch have violated the rights and protections provided to their employees under such Act, including protections against sexual harassment, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4924 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; REFERENCES IN ACT; TABLE OF CONTENTS. 
ANDREGULATIONS .—Any reference to the Office of Compliance in any law, rule, regulation, or other official paper in effect as of the effective date of this Act shall be considered to refer and apply to the Office of Congressional Workplace Rights. TITLE IV—EFFECTIVE DATE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. HARPER ) and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. BRADY ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Mississippi. 
Mr. HARPER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Mississippi? There was no objection. Mr. HARPER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, a little more than 3 months ago, you tasked the Committee on House Administration with a great responsibility, to undertake a comprehensive review of the training, policies, and mechanisms to guard against sexual harassment in the congressional workplace. b1145 I believe that the legislation we are considering today, H.R. 4924, the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 Reform Act, and, immediately following that, the House resolution, together, respond to this great task. At the outset, I would like to thank the Speaker of the House, PAULRYAN, for his leadership on this issue and for the trust he placed on our committee to conduct this important review. I would also like to thank and appreciate the work done by our Conference Chair, CATHY MCMORRIS RODGERS . I would also thank every member of the Committee on House Administration, particularly the ranking member, Mr. BRADY . He has been a great friend and colleague over the last decade, and I appreciate being able to work closely on this issue with him. Both the CAA Reform Act and the House resolution reflect the dedication and commitment of a bipartisan group of Members, including Representatives BYRNE , SPEIER , BROOKS , and D EUTCH , who want to ensure this institution remains worthy of the trust placed in it by the American people. I also want to thank Representatives DESANTIS , LOVE, COMSTOCK , and C HRIS SMITH for their contributions to this bill. As I have said previously and will state again, unequivocally, there is no place for sexual harassment, or any type of harassment, period, in the U.S. House of Representatives. It is no secret that the culture on Capitol Hill is unique. While there are hundreds of employing offices, we should all share the common goal of creating effective work environments— environments that are safe, productive, collegial, and, most importantly, responsive, responsive to the needs of our constituents and the public. During our review, the committee held two hearings, three member listening sessions, a roundtable discussion with stakeholders, and meetings with victims and their advocates to examine how we could improve the workplace for everyone. We found the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 to be outdated and in need of this comprehensive reform. We found the House training programs to be inadequate in order to meet the needs of all House employees. Additionally, we found that our House policies and procedures are in need of change as they relate to sexual harassment in the workplace. Last November, the House took the first step in addressing these issues by passing H. Res. 630, a resolution that, among other things, requires all House employees to take annual, inperson antiharassment and antidiscrimination training. Passage of the CAA Reform Act is the logical next step. The CAA Reform Act makes a number of reforms to the Congressional Accountability Act that will ensure its future effectiveness, including: Reforming the dispute resolution process to establish procedures for initiating, investigating, and resolving alleged violations of part A, title II, of the CAA; Ensuring all claims are filed in writing and are made under oath; Requiring Members who have engaged in intentional discrimination to reimburse the Department of the Treasury; Requiring the Office of Compliance, the OOC, to report every 6 months of a calendar year to Congress, and to publish on their website the awards and settlements from the previous year; Directing the OOC to conduct a climate survey of the legislative branch every 2 years; Directing the OOC to establish a permanent record retention program; Expanding the definition of covered employees to include unpaid interns, fellows, and detailees; and Clarifying certain commissions, such as the Helsinki Commission, are covered by the Congressional Accountability Act and providing the process for disposing of claims. These are just a few of the reforms that the CAA Reform Act makes. I am proud of the work of this committee and our bipartisan group of Members who have worked on this so diligently over the last several months. Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to support this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON HOUSE ADMINISTRATION , Washington, DC, February 2, 2018. Hon. SUSAN BROOKS , Chairwoman, House Committee on Ethics, Washington, DC. DEARCHAIRWOMAN BROOKS : I am writing to you concerning H.R. 4924, the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 Reform Act and H. Res. 724, a resolution making operational changes to the House of Representatives as well as changes to the Code of Official Conduct. There are certain provisions in both pieces of legislation that fall within the jurisdiction of the House Committee on Ethics. In the interest of permitting the Committee on House Administration to proceed expeditiously for floor consideration of these important bills, I am writing to request a waiver of your committee’s right to a referral. I request with the understanding that by waiving consideration of these bills, the Committee on Ethics does not waive any future jurisdictional claim over the subject matters contained in the bills which fall within its Rule X jurisdiction. I will place this letter into the committee report and into the Congressional Record during consideration of the measures on the House floor. Thank you for the cooperative spirit in which you have worked regarding this matter and others between our respective committees. Sincerely, GREGG HARPER , Chairman. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON ETHICS , Washington, DC, February 6, 2018. Hon. GREGG HARPER , Chairman, Committee on House Administration, Washington, DC. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN : Thank you for your letter regarding H.R. 4924, the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 Reform Act, and H. Res. 724, a related resolution. As you know, certain provisions of both bills fall within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Ethics and your committee has previously consulted with us regarding provisions of these measures that fall within our committee’s jurisdiction. We appreciate the opportunity to work with you, Ranking Member Robert Brady, and your colleagues on the Committee on House Administration in a collegial and bipartisan manner on this important legislation. The Committee on Ethics has unique and exclusive jurisdiction over the Code of Official Conduct. In addition, the Committee on Ethics takes allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination and other violations of workplace rights extremely seriously. However, in order to expedite Floor consideration of these measures, the Committee on Ethics will forgo action on both measures. We believe that discharging the Committee on Ethics from further consideration of H.R. 4924 and H. Res. 724 will serve in the best interest of the House of Representatives to ensure their swift consideration. It is our mutual understanding that forgoing action on 
H.R. 4924 and H. Res. 724 will not prejudice the Committee on Ethics with respect to appointment of conferees or any future jurisdictional claim over subject matter contained in this or similar legislation. Our committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any HouseSenate conference involving this or similar legislation, and ask that you support any such request. We understand that your letter and this response will be included in the bill report filed by your Committee, as well as in the Congressional Record. Sincerely, SUSAN W. B ROOKS , Chairwoman, Committee on Ethics. THEODORE E. D EUTCH , Ranking Member, Committee on Ethics. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON HOUSE ADMINISTRATION , Washington, DC, February 2, 2018. Hon. TREYGOWDY , Chairman, House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Washington, DC. DEAR CHAIRMAN GOWDY : I am writing to you concerning H.R. 4924, the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 Reform Act. There are certain provisions in the bill that fall within the jurisdiction of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. In the interest of permitting the Committee on House Administration to proceed expeditiously for floor consideration of this important bill, I am writing to request a waiver of your committee’s right to a referral. I request with the understanding that by waiving consideration of this bill, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform does not waive any future jurisdictional claim over the subject matters contained in the bill which fall within its Rule X jurisdiction.

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT AND GOVERNMENT REFORM , Washington, DC, February 6, 2018. Hon. GREGG HARPER , Chairman, Committee on House Administration, Washington, DC. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN : Thank you for your letter regarding H.R. 4924. As you know, certain provisions of the bill fall within the Jurisdiction of Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. I realize that discharging the Committee on House Administration from further consideration of H.R. 4924 will serve in the best interest of the House of Representatives and agree to do so. It is the understanding of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform that forgoing action on H.R. 4924 will not prejudice the Committee with respect to appointment of conferees or any future jurisdictional claim. I request that your letter and this response be included in the bill report filed by your Committee, as well as in the Congressional Record. Sincerely, TREYGOWDY . HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON HOUSE ADMINISTRATION , Washington, DC, February 5, 2018. Hon. KEVIN BRADY , Chairman, House Committee on Ways and Means, Washington, DC.

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS , Washington, DC, February 5, 2018. Hon. GREGG HARPER , Chairman, Committee on House Administration, Washington, DC. DEARCHAIRMAN HARPER : I am writing with respect to H.R. 4924, the ‘‘Congressional Accountability Act of the 1995 Reform Act,’’ on which the Committee on Ways and Means was granted an additional referral. As a result of your having consulted with us on provisions in H.R. 4924 that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on Ways and Means, I agree to waive formal consideration of this bill so that it may move expeditiously to the floor.

Sincerely, KEVIN BRADY , Chairman. 
Mr. BRADY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, since we began this process several months ago, I have met with experts, my colleagues, and, most importantly, the survivors of sexual harassment and assault. Their insight has informed this legislation today. By passing this proposal, Congress will take a muchneeded first step in changing how we do business: We eliminate counseling; We eliminate the cooling off period; We make mediation optional; We change the system so that we protect the victim and not the perpetrator; We require more transparency with regular reporting that has meaningful information; We change the confidentiality rule so that the victim decides what to talk about and when; and We hold Members accountable for their behavior by referring every case to the Ethics Committee. This is long overdue. There is one person who has been championing this work her entire career, the gentlewoman from California, Representative JACKIE SPEIER , and I thank her. Without her, we would not be here. Representative SPEIER ’s leadership and persistence are the main reasons we are so close to getting this done, and the entire Congress should be grateful for her work. It is because of the leadership of the chairman that we are here on the floor today. As he has his entire 10 years on the committee, he has been focused on working together in a bipartisan way where we can agree. Because of that commitment, he will certainly be remembered as one of the most consequential chairmen of this committee. I thank him, and I cherish his friendship. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HARPER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. BYRNE ). Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding. Prior to coming to Congress, I worked for 30 years as a labor and employment attorney in Alabama. I advised clients on how to prevent sexual harassment and how to navigate the process if a harassment claim was made. Quite frankly, I was shocked to see how complicated the congressional process for handling sexual harassment and other employment law claims was. Mr. Speaker, this legislation is a shining example of how Congress should work. Chairman HARPER and Ranking Member BRADY engaged a bipartisan group of Members, including Representative JACKIE SPEIER and me, interested in solving this problem. After months of thoughtful negotiation, we come to the floor today with a product that this House and the American people can be proud of. Under this legislation, we will bring the congressional workplace into the 21st century and ensure that Congress plays by the same rules as the private sector. There are far too many important reforms to mention all of them, but I want to highlight a few that I think are especially transformative. First, the bill creates a fair and simpler process for employees to file an employment law claim and for the claim to be resolved. The bill creates 
an Office of Employee Advocacy to ensure staff has access to legal counsel just as Member offices are provided. The process is also simplified to make the claims process smoother, faster, and fairer. Second, the bill increases transparency by requiring that basic information about any sexual harassment or other claims be made public so the American people are fully aware of what is happening in Congress. Third, the bill will ensure that Members of Congress, not taxpayers, are responsible for paying out sexual harassment settlements that they are responsible for. Fourth, the related resolution paves the way for every congressional office to have a clearly defined antiharassment and antidiscrimination policy. This reform alone will result in greater awareness. Fifth, the resolution prohibits Members of Congress from engaging in a sexual relationship with any staff member under their supervision and makes clear that sexual harassment is a violation of the Code of Official Conduct and will not be tolerated. In closing, I want to again thank Chairman HARPER and Ranking Member BRADY for their leadership on this issue, and I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation and the related resolution. Mr. BRADY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. SPEIER ), and, again, the main reason we are on the floor today. Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for his generosity and for his great leadership. Mr. Speaker, we are truly here on a historic occasion. It is a rare and crucial moment of bipartisanship. This is the way you can do it—men and women, Republicans and Democrats, conservatives and liberals—coming together to make this place better. When I first started this work back in 2014, I dreamed, but I did not dare to hope, that we would end up here today. Today, this bipartisan group of legislators is taking a historic step that has plagued this institution for generations. For years, Members of Congress have gotten away with truly egregious behavior by mistreating their staff. A story that will be etched in my memory forever is a young woman who sat in my office earlier this year and told me her story and who said, as she cried, the process was almost worse than the harassment. No more, ladies and gentlemen, no more will that be the case. Thanks to the Me Too movement, the American public has made it clear that they have had enough. They expect Congress to lead; and, for once, we are. Today, I am proud to support the CAA Reform Act. Based on the ME TOO Congress Act, which I introduced last fall, this bill empowers survivors. They will no longer be subject to mandatory mediation. They will be represented by counsel. They will no longer have cooling off periods and periods where they have to be counseled legally, and they have the right to sue. Most importantly, it creates the kind of transparency that we talk about but rarely ever provide, and Members—yes, Members—are going to be held responsible for their bad behavior. We will require them to pay the settlement in full in 90 days. If they can’t do that, we will garnish their wages, we will garnish their thrift saving plans, and we will garnish their Social Security. We would not be here today were it not for the unwavering commitment of Chairman HARPER , Ranking Member BRADY , Speaker R YAN, Leader P ELOSI , Congressman BYRNE —whom I was delighted to work with on this issue— Congresswoman BROOKS , Congressman DEUTCH , and the entire Committee on House Administration. This would not be here today but for the majority and minority committee staff, especially Jamie Fleet, who has shown extraordinary leadership, as has Kim Betz, for all the late nights and the lost weekends to get this bill over the finish line. And to my staff, who worked just as hard, to Molly Fishman and to Miriam Goldstein, I will forever be grateful for what you have provided. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. BOST). The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. BRADY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from California an additional 30 seconds. Ms. SPEIER. But our work is not done. The Me Too movement is driving change from the boardrooms to the break rooms across our great country. I am committed to ensuring that Congress looks beyond itself to improve the lives of all workers in America. Today, we take a great step forward for the congressional workplace. We show that we can come together across party and geography. Tomorrow, let us continue to work to make sexual harassment and violence in all workplace settings a thing of the past. Mr. HARPER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. BROOKS ), the chairwoman of the Ethics Committee. Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the bipartisan Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 Reform Act, introduced by the House Administration chairman, Mr. HARPER , and the ranking member, Mr. BRADY . I also want to thank my colleagues who have helped lead the effort, Representative BYRNE and Representative SPEIER , along with my colleague, the ranking member of the House Ethics Committee, Representative DEUTCH . Current law, the CAA, as we call it, was enacted over 20 years ago, and it has become so outdated. The proposed reforms in this CAA Reform Act work to improve our response to harassment and discrimination so that allegations of wrongdoing can be investigated swifter, fairer, and in a more efficient manner. This legislation prioritizes protecting the victims while ensuring due process for the accused. Congress must be a force for justice in order to ensure all employees have a safe workplace environment that is free of sexual harassment or discrimination of any kind, because it is completely unacceptable to be subjected to harassment or discrimination of any kind at any workplace in our country. The element of the CAA that allowed for silencing of victims and spending taxpayer dollars to settle claims for Members of Congress must be changed. The CAA Reform Act will increase transparency and accountability in Congress and create a more victim friendly process. It ensures sexual harassment and discrimination settlements made, moving forward, will no longer be secret. This bill will protect taxpayer dollars by requiring Members of Congress who have an award or judgment against them for harassment to personally pay for any settlement. As chairwoman of the House Ethics Committee, I am proud to work alongside the ranking member, Representative DEUTCH , on this important, bipartisan legislation. I want to thank our colleagues who worked to ensure that, in order for the Ethics Committee to fulfill its obligation of the House to investigate and potentially discipline Members and staff, now the committee must be given information on potential bad actors. The CAA Reform Act ensures the Ethics Committee is given that information. b1200 The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. HARPER. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentlewoman. Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. It provides an automatic referral to the Ethics Committee upon disposition of claims before the Office of Congressional Workplace Rights, currently known as the Office of Compliance, so now the House Ethics Committee can quickly investigate allegations of wrongdoing while protecting the identity of the accuser and ensuring due process for the accused. By supporting this Reform Act, we are showing the Nation that Congress is taking strong bipartisan action to improve the workplace called the people’s House and the conduct of those who work in it. Mr. BRADY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. PELOSI ), our Democratic leader. Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I also thank him and Mr. HARPER for their leadership in bringing this legislation to the floor. Congratulations to the Committee on House Administration. I commend Congresswoman BROOKS and Congressman 
DEUTCH for their work on the Ethics Committee in this regard. I thank Mr. RASKIN as well for his work. Of course I want to thank Congresswoman JACKIE SPEIER from California, who has made this part of her life’s work in officialdom in her public service in the California Legislature and here. Today, the fruit of your labor, Madam Congresswoman, comes to fruition. Your strong leadership will ensure that no survivor of discrimination or harassment will face the injustice of having his or her voice silenced. The ME TOO Congress Act is our promise, in a bipartisan way, to hold every person accountable to the rule of absolutely zero tolerance. No matter someone’s contribution to our country, harassment and discrimination are always unacceptable. With this bill, we are shining a blazing light on the scourge of workplace abuse, which has been allowed to fester in the shadows for too long. We are securing protections for all employees by streamlining and strengthening the resolution and reporting process. We are holding Members personally responsible for settlements, and we are guaranteeing taxpayer money will never again be used to create a culture of complicity and silence around workplace harassment. This bill is bipartisan because the fight against workplace harassment and discrimination transcends party or politics. This legislation is about protecting the personal safety of every person who comes to Congress to serve either as a Member or in the workforce. This is about upholding human dignity and the inalienable right to live free from abuse. Our Nation is at a watershed moment in the fight against sexual harassment and discrimination. Brave men and women from Hollywood to Washington, from Sacramento—I might add, where my daughter has been involved in this campaign—from the boardroom to the newsroom, in the hotels, restaurants, and workplaces, in every corner of the country, people are standing up to say: Time is up. But the Me Too movement has really made quite a difference. Their voices are correcting the culture around harassment and abuse. But more needs to be done. The Congress must continue to work with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and others to forge a path forward to improve protection for all American workplaces. That is why I am so pleased to bring this bill to the floor. Over recent times, Members of Congress listened to survivors and advocates, learned from public and private sector experts, and received constructive recommendations from many Members. We will not rest until every person in every workplace has full safeguards against harassment and abuse and discrimination. This is a time for shaking up the status quo, not for bowing to inaction and incrementalism. Members of Congress are trustees of the people. We have a solemn responsibility to do well by the people, both the people who sent us to Washington, and those who serve by our sides here. Our values and our humanity compel us to take action and to finish this fight so that every woman, man, and child can live free from the fear of abuse. Again, I thank Mr. BRADY and Mr. HARPER for their leadership on this issue. Mr. HARPER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS), the vice chairman of the Committee on House Administration. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Chairman HARPER for his leadership on this important piece of legislation. And I would be remiss, Mr. Speaker, if I didn’t offer my thanks to our House Administration Committee’s ranking member, Mr. BRADY . I thank him for his leadership on this important issue, too. I want to thank my fellow colleagues on that committee for their hard work and diligence. Mr. Speaker, no one should have to worry about sexual harassment when they come to work. This bill is vital to addressing this problem as we work to increase professionalism in the House and establish a workplace that is grounded in respect. In Congress, we have got to lead by example. As a member of this committee, my colleagues and I held hearings on preventing sexual harassment in the congressional workplace and the effectiveness of the Congressional Accountability Act, which demonstrated the need for reform. I am pleased to report that this bill continues the House Administration Committee’s commitment to increasing transparency in the Federal Government. Last Congress, we worked hard to pass reforms that made House office spending more transparent and accountable than any other area of the Federal Government. Today we are voting on a bill that will increase transparency of Member conduct by requiring the Office of Compliance to report on awards and settlements every 6 months and by holding Members personally responsible. This strengthens the dispute resolution process, enables employees to speak without fear of retribution, and ensures every House office has an antidiscriminatory and antiharassment policy. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ and to support this bill. Mr. BRADY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN ), a valued member of our committee. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank our chairman, Mr. HARPER ; and the ranking member, Mr. BRADY , for their excellent leadership on this legislation. I rise as a proud cosponsor and strong supporter of H.R. 4924, the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 Reform Act; and H. Res. 724, the companion resolution which strengthens antiharassment and antidiscrimination policies and procedures in this institution. These two bills show how Congress can make dramatic progress on a bipartisan basis when we listen to the people; specifically, the Me Too movement against workplace discrimination and harassment that has swept America into the 21st century by demanding equality and dignity in the workplace for all women as well as all men. This continuing Women’s March Across America for workplace fairness has forced the Members of this body to acknowledge that, here in Congress, sexual harassment has been a serious occupational hazard for thousands of women who only want to come to work to support their families and to contribute to the common good of the country. We have heard about shameful cases of quid pro quo harassment, hostile workplace environment, groping, forcible kissing, sexual coercion, and reprisal and retaliation for saying no or complaining. As the representatives of the American people, we have a compelling obligation to lead America to a culture of zero tolerance for sexual harassment and assault in the workplace; and we, in Congress, must lead, not only by strong legislation, but by strong example. Our current dispute resolution process is stacked against victims, requiring people to go through a protracted and duplicative process. Members are provided legal counsel, while victims are left to navigate this convoluted process on their own. Settlements, if provided, are paid for with taxpayer money instead of the money of the perpetrators of the events. This legislation eliminates protracted mandatory waiting periods. It empowers victims to move directly to a court proceeding if they so desire. It creates an Office of Employee Advocacy with lawyers on hand to help people understand their rights. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee). The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. BRADY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman. Mr. RASKIN. It prohibits sexual relationships between Members of Congress and their staffs. It holds offending Members personally responsible for their conduct by requiring that they pay any settlements that are actually made. I thank Chairman HARPER and Ranking Member BRADY for their leadership. I especially thank Congresswoman JACKIE SPEIER for her untiring and exemplary advocacy over the years on this issue. I am glad that we are being part of this great cultural paradigm shift in America right now. 
Mr. HARPER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. COMSTOCK ), who continues to work tirelessly on this issue. Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his leadership. I also thank all of my colleagues on the committee and all of those who have participated in this process on this bill and this resolution. I rise in support of both the bill and the resolution. We know sexual harassment is about power—a misuse of power that impacts careers, lives, and selfesteem. We know most women do not come forward and disclose sexual harassment. We know, often, they leave their desired careers because of that. We have seen it in all industries: predators such as Harvey Weinstein in Hollywood; Matt Lauer, Roger Ailes, Charlie Rose in the media; John Conyers and Trent Franks in our own body. So it is so important that this legislation, this historic step, is fundamentally changing that balance of power by creating an office for the victims, the Office of Employee Advocacy. This is the single most important thing in this legislation to restore that balance of power that has been misused by those in power. When I spoke to Dorena Bertussi, who, 30 years ago, was sexually harassed in this body by Congressman Jim Bates from California, she didn’t have an office to go to. She didn’t even have one that wasn’t very good. So now, 30 years later, we are writing this. We now have transparency. People can’t hide behind the process anymore. The Members’ names will be known. Taxpayers will not be on the hook for any of this. The offender themselves will have to pay. We have all types of methods in here to get that money because we want to make sure the victim is made whole. I appreciate we have also adopted some of the DeSantis provisions to get a full accounting of past cases so we know the amounts and we know exactly what happened. And I am still concerned about those Members who may have used their MRAs, their Member allowances, in an inappropriate way. That is corrected in this bill and is no longer allowed. Also, we have made it clear that there are no relationships with subordinates. I do want to mention that I still do believe, despite—this is a great bill and I heartily support it and so appreciate all the hard work that the staff and everyone has done, but I still do believe we need to disclose the past names that are still unknown. Some of those names have come forward because of the press, because of victims speaking out. We need to let the victims know that they can speak out from the past. If they want to speak out, they can; that this body is not going to be using any of our resources to stop a victim from the past from speaking out. I also do think we still need to disclose all of those names going forward so that we have full accountability, because part of that misuse of power is that they can continue to know they won’t be held accountable, and the victims see that. So we need to have a strong message that there is nobody in this body that would ever be allowed to go forward without being held accountable. I encourage all of my colleagues to support this resolution and this important legislation. Mr. BRADY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DEUTCH ). Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, last year, American culture experienced a moment of reckoning. It doesn’t matter what political party; it doesn’t matter what industry; it doesn’t matter when or where: sexual harassment and sexual violence are unacceptable. America has been willfully blind to abuses of power for far too long. The bravery of survivors of sexual assault and harassment has changed that, has changed our country, and it is time for Congress to follow their lead. I am grateful to introduce this bill with my colleagues: House Administration Chairman HARPER and Ranking Member BRADY ; my counterpart on the House Ethics Committee, Chairwoman SUSAN BROOKS ; all of whom worked so hard to develop these reforms. I am going to thank Representative BYRNE for his commitment to this effort, sharing his experience. And my colleague and friend, Congresswoman JACKIE SPEIER , deserves particular appreciation and acknowledgment for her strong leadership not just in crafting this bill, but throughout her career in standing up for the rights of women; but, in this case, for crafting a bill that will produce lasting change for the United States Congress. This bill will allow survivors to speak out, ensure that legal resources are available to them, and offer justice without fear of retribution. This bill will not only strengthen our outof date workplace protections, but it will send an important message to the entire country that Members of Congress will be held accountable. Also with this legislation, the Office of Compliance must provide the House Ethics Committee with all of the information required for the transparent pursuit of full accountability. b1215 It is time to end protections for powerful abusers and to empower survivors. Each survivor must be heard, allegations must be taken seriously, and abusers and harassers must be held accountable. Every congressional employee and every American deserves an equal chance at success in their careers, free from sexual harassment and free from retaliation for defending themselves and asserting their rights. Mr. Speaker, it is time to do the work necessary to change our culture. I encourage my colleagues to support this bill and ensure that Congress does its part in that important work. Mr. HARPER. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire of the time remaining for debate. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Mississippi has 6 minutes remaining. The gentleman from Pennsylvania has 91⁄2minutes remaining. Mr. HARPER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DESANTIS ). Mr. DESANTIS. Mr. Speaker, when news broke that there had been a series of secret sexual harassment payments paid for on behalf of Members of Congress by tax dollars, I think a lot of Americans, even by the low standards that they have for this body, were shocked to hear that. And it was almost as if the rules were set up to incentivize bad behavior by a Member because Members could harass people and they wouldn’t be personally liable for it, and they could keep it all secret. This had to change, and I applaud Chairman HARPER for leading on this bill. And I am happy that the provisions of my bill have been adopted in this because I think it is important. Taxpayers should not bail Members of Congress out for misconduct, and this bill fixes that and makes them personally liable. We also need a full accounting of any payments that are being made with tax dollars. This bill does that. We have to protect identities of victims. I think we are making a step in the right direction. I think this starts to foster a culture of respect on Capitol Hill. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I thank Chairman HARPER for his efforts. Mr. BRADY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON ). (Ms. NORTON asked and was given permission to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank both sides for the bipartisan way in which this bill has proceeded. Today, the House is doing no more than bringing itself in line with what we have long required of the public sector and Federal agencies. When I became chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in the late 1970s, sexual harassment was not even recognized as a form of employment discrimination. We remedied that with sexual harassment guidelines, later ratified by the Supreme Court. In drawing the sexual harassment guidelines, it never occurred to us that Congress would adopt special procedures for themselves, preferential to Members and prejudicial to employees. The antidiscrimination statutes typically require some kind of conciliation before moving forward to avoid excessive litigation, but the current process creates multiple steps and time frames that exhaust complainants and deter resolution. 
It takes courage to file a sexual harassment complaint because most are unwitnessed and they are difficult to corroborate. The most important provisions of this bill, I believe, are the provisions for legal assistance to complainants, which Members have long had, and personal liability for sexual harassment lying with the Member, not the taxpayers. This bill marks the Congress holding itself accountable to the public. However, it is another focus on highprofile workplaces. I ask the House to move next to the workplaces of America where the average woman and man works—hospitality, factories, offices, retail, and the like. Increasingly, we find sexual harassment is still widespread. Therefore, I hope the House will pass my bill to create a national commission to hear from ordinary workers so that the average worker gets our equal attention and equal time. Mr. Speaker, again, I thank the sponsors of this bill and for this bipartisan effort. Mr. HARPER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Utah (Mrs. LOVE). Mrs. LOVE. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Chairman HARPER and also Ranking Member BRADY for including the STOP Act in the House Administration legislation. Shockingly, the Office of Compliance confirms that hundreds of thousands of dollars have been paid with taxpayer money to settle sexual harassment cases against Members of Congress. I am pleased to say that the bill that is before us today incorporates a bill that I introduced last December to stop this practice, H.R. 4674. The Stop Taxpayers Obligations to Perpetrators of Sexual Harassment Act will require Members of Congress to pay back any taxpayer money used to settle sexual harassment cases. Victims will be compensated, but taxpayers won’t be footing the bill. This bill promotes and supports due process. It sends a message that there isn’t a set fund out there paid for by the taxpayer ready for someone to access, but it also doesn’t encourage a Member who feels that they have done nothing wrong to settle so an issue can just go away. If a Member of Congress behaves badly, the consequences of those actions are that person’s responsibility, not the taxpayers’. I believe that Members should live by the laws that they create and the taxpayers should not be responsible for inappropriate behavior. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to vote for this bill. Mr. HARPER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. SMITH). Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, first of all, let me begin by thanking Chairman HARPER for this outstanding bipartisan legislation, and Mr. BRADY as well. This is what this place can produce when we do come together. Obviously, it provides congressional employees with comprehensive protection from abuse, including zero tolerance for sexual harassment. The bill significantly increases transparency on Member conduct by publishing reports on awards and settlements, and it holds Members personally financially responsible, ending the charade of having taxpayers foot the bill for abuses. Very, very significantly, the new Office of Employee Advocacy, which the legislation creates, will provide free legal services to congressional employees. That is absolutely critical, Mr. Speaker, that House employees have a dedicated advocate to consult, assist, and to represent them. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman HARPER for including my bill, H.R. 4393, as section 303 of this bill. This section makes clear that employees of the Helsinki Commission and the China Commission, both of which I cochair, are covered by the CAA. In 2011, Mr. Speaker, an employee, a woman employed by the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, filed suit making sexual harassment and workplace retaliation allegations directed to a former chairman of the commission. When I learned that the woman was being told—the woman who lodged the complaint—that the CAA did not apply to her, I immediately, as chairman, changed that policy. I deemed it. Thankfully, I checked with the House counsel, and I had the full backing of the House counsel. I thought it was unconscionable that this person was told not only did she not have representation, which, again, the Harper bill now provides, but the CAA itself did not cover her. That was a terrible, terrible wrong. That will be rectified forever by this legislation. Mr. Speaker, again, I want to thank Chairman HARPER for his leadership. This is a remarkable bill, an important bill, and will protect employees from abuse. Mr. BRADY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON  LEE). Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me thank the ranking member, Mr. BRADY , and acknowledge his longstanding leadership and friendship, and as well the work that he does with the chairman and for his leadership as well. This is a highlight on the floor of the House for the bipartisanship that it represents, the tone of which we are speaking, even though we know that this is a matter of urgency and we have seen the telling of situations that none of us would want to see repeated. And forgive me for using more of a most recent set of circumstances just to capture the intensity of the moment, and that is, of course, the recent trial with a conspicuous and vile sex offender to the 200plus young women athletes. Now, this is not the circumstances here in the House of Representatives, but I think it captures the intensity of silence, because those young women had to live or thought that that was what they were obligated to do because they wanted to achieve greatness in their field, and they were stopped by the wall of silence and, therefore, could not find relief. The courts have finally given them relief, but through an enormity of pain. I think it is important for the congressional standards to be such that it sets a wide net across the Nation to be able to ensure that the wall of silence is broken. Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 4924, to amend the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 to reform the procedures provided under such Act for the initiation, investigation, and resolution of claims alleging that employing offices of the legislative branch have violated the rights and protections provided to their employees under such Act, including protection against sexual harassment, and for other purposes. Mr. Speaker, this bill will provide a broader subpoena authority to the Office of Compliance, which adjudicates workplace disputes, and as well it would expand protections in other areas of antidiscrimination. Let me say that this is a positive statement made by all of us, and I ask my colleagues to support H.R. 4924. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my support for H.R. 4924, the ‘‘Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 Reform Act,’’ legislation to amend the Congressional Accountability Act (CAA) of 1995 to reform the procedures provided under such Act for the initiation, investigation, and resolution of claims alleging that employing offices of the legislative branch have violated the rights and protections provided to their employees under such Act, including protections against sexual harassment, and for other purposes. Legislative branch employees who allege sexual harassment or other workplace violations could use an accelerated claims process under H.R. 4924. The bill would amend the 1995 Congressional Accountability Act (CAA; Public Law 104–1). I celebrate and congratulate JACKIE SPEIER  and the women members of Congress who stood up. Thanks again to the Ranking Member and Chairman of the House Administration Committee. The amendments include: Eliminating a requirement for counseling and mediation before a legislative staffer could file a civil action in a U.S. district court; Requiring members of Congress to pay for settlements and awards if they’re the alleged offender; Giving broader subpoena authority to the Office of Compliance (OOC), which adjudicates workplace disputes for most legislative branch offices; Requiring the OOC to publish more information on claims, awards, and settlement payments and reimbursements from lawmakers; The measure follows recent accusations that lawmakers sexually harassed or otherwise mistreated employees. 
Some of those cases went through the OOC process and resulted in resignations and taxpayerfunded settlements. The OOC approved more than $17 million in awards and settlements from fiscal 1997 through 2017. Many of those cases originated outside of memberled congressional offices and didn’t involve alleged sexual harassment. The House is also slated to consider a separate resolution (H. Res. 724) that would apply only to House offices and employees. That measure would establish an office to provide House employees with free legal assistance during the OOC process, and would bar the Office of Congressional Ethics from investigating an alleged workplace violation once a staffer files a claim with the OOC. These comprehensive reforms will provide a positive change of culture within the Congress, and improve the overall process of both preventing and reporting any harassment in the future. The CAA requires congressional and other legislative offices, such as the Congressional Budget Office, to comply with about a dozen workplace protections that apply to private sector and executive branch employees. For instance, the 1964 Civil Rights Act bars discrimination based on factors such as race, religion, and sex. The Supreme Court has held that the law also prohibits sexual harassment in the workplace. Some CAA provisions don’t apply to offices such as the Library of Congress (LOC), whose employees are covered by other laws and procedures. To seek relief for certain workplace violations specified in the CAA, a legislative employee must go through a multistep OOC process. Within 180 days of an alleged violation, the employee must bring it to the attention of the OOC to initiate a 30day counseling phase and be informed of his or her rights. The OOC doesn’t notify the employing office unless the employee waives confidentiality. An employee can participate by phone and be represented by someone else. If a claim isn’t resolved during the counseling phase and the employee wishes to keep pursuing it, he or she must file a request for mediation, which lasts at least 30 days and can be extended for an additional period. Materials prepared for mediation are kept confidential, though an employee can still discuss the allegations publicly, according to December 2017 testimony from OOC Executive Director Susan Tsui Grundmann. If a resolution can’t be reached through mediation, the employee can file a confidential administrative complaint with the OOC or a public civil action in a U.S. district court. Either filing has to be made within 90 days after mediation ends, though the employee must wait at least 30 days during a ‘‘cooling off’’ period. OOCappointed hearing officers are authorized to issue subpoenas to investigate the allegations. An employee can appeal a hearing officer’s decision to the OOC board and then to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. For most legislative branch offices, including congressional offices, settlements are paid from an account in the Treasury general fund. The bill would still require employees to file a claim with the OOC within 180 days of an alleged violation. The measure, however, would allow an employee to file a civil action in a U.S. district court within 45 days, which would end the OOC investigation. Otherwise, the matter would go through a revised OOC process. At the outset, the OOC would inform the employee of his or her rights and notify the head of the employing office. Employees could also contact the OOC before filing a claim to learn about their rights. The OOC general counsel’s investigative authority is limited to certain types of claims, such as alleged violations of the Occupational Safety and Health Act. The bill would expand that authority to cover a wider range of claims, including alleged discrimination or harassment under the Civil Rights Act. The general counsel could issue subpoenas regardless of whether a party requests one. The bill would express the sense of Congress that subpoenas should be issued only if other methods are insufficient. The general counsel would have to finish the investigation within 120 days. The OOC would have to conduct an administrative hearing if the general counsel finds reasonable cause to believe there was a violation, or if the general counsel is unable to make a determination. If the general counsel finds no reasonable cause to believe a violation occurred, the employee would be notified that he or she could still file a civil action within 90 days. The general counsel could also recommend mediation, and the parties could file a joint request for mediation at any time. The bill would allow an employee to request mediation meetings in which the parties are separated. Any investigative reports concerning allegations of discrimination or retaliation by members of Congress would be referred to the House and Senate Ethics committees. The OOC would also refer claims to the committees if there’s a final disposition—such as a settlement or final decision by the OOC or a court—in a case involving a lawmaker or a senior staffer. The bill would require current and former members of Congress to reimburse the government if an employee receives an award or settlement for the member’s alleged act of discrimination or retaliation. Funds could be withheld from the member’s salary or retirement account if he or she doesn’t meet payment deadlines specified in the bill. The OOC would have to notify members as soon as a claim is filed that they may be required to provide reimbursement. The member could intervene in a mediation, hearing, or civil action to contest an award or settlement, though the employee who filed the claim couldn’t be subject to an additional deposition. Noncongressional legislative offices would also have to reimburse the government for certain award or settlement payments. The filing and investigation of a claim would be kept confidential, though an employee or employing office could disclose claim information during a proceeding. The bill would also clarify that information discussed or disclosed during mediation would remain confidential, without barring the parties from talking about the underlying allegations. An office could allow an employee to work remotely or grant the employee a paid leave of absence while a claim is pending. The provisions wouldn’t override the terms of a collective bargaining agreement for the office. The bill would rename the OOC as the ‘‘Office of Congressional Workplace Rights’’ and make other changes to the office. The office publishes annual reports with statistics on employee contacts with the office, the basis of their claims, and the results of proceedings. The bill would require the office to publish semiannual reports listing each award and settlement in the previous year related to a wide range of CAA workplace claims if the money comes from the Treasury account. The reports would have to specify the employing offices, award amounts, and alleged violations. They would also have to indicate whether 
members of Congress made reimbursements resulting from cases of alleged discrimination. Reports couldn’t include the names or positions of employees who filed a claim. Within 30 days of the bill’s enactment, the office would have to publish a report on all previous payments related specifically to discrimination claims if the payment involved any public funds. That report would have to indicate the amount paid and the source of public funds, including a House or Senate office account, though it couldn’t identify the specific office. The OOC would also have to establish an electronic system to receive and keep track of claims, and use the system to provide Congress with semiannual reports on the time required to resolve claims. The OOC would collect information from employing offices, including the Library of Congress, every two years on their workplace environment and attitudes regarding sexual harassment. All responses would be anonymous and confidential. The OOC would consult with Congress on survey procedures and methodologies and share the survey results. The office would have to create a program to permanently retain records of investigations, mediations, hearings, and other proceedings. The Government Accountability Office would report to Congress on OOC management practices and cybersecurity. The bill would expand certain protections— including antidiscrimination provisions—to cover employees at the LOC, as well as unpaid legislative branch interns, detailees, and fellows. Because of these clarifications and expanded protections included in H.R. 4924, I stand in support of this bill and urge my colleagues to join me. Mr. HARPER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LANCE ). Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House Ethics Committee, I rise in strong support of this legislation and resolution combating the scourge of sexual harassment. I commend the leadership of Chairman HARPER and of Representative JACKIE SPEIER , a national leader on this issue for many years. From this day forward, if a lawmaker commits an act of sexual harassment 
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 4924, the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 Reform Act. This bill would bring muchneeded reforms to the process available to congressional employees for filing workplace complaints and ensure a more equitable and transparent process. Under the new process, employees who file a complaint would have the choice to enter into mediation instead of being required to do so, as is currently the case. Employees should not be forced into mandatory mediation, especially with an employer against whom they have raised allegations of sexual harassment or other types of discrimination. This bill also eliminates the thirtyday ‘‘cooling off’’ period currently mandated by the CAA. Filing a workplace complaint can be harrowing for employees, and having no choice but to face the employer or colleague against whom they have filed the complaint may deter employees from going through with it. That is why the protections in this bill from retaliation by the employing office for requesting remote work or paid leave by an employee who has a filed a complaint are so important. Unpaid interns, fellows, and detailees in Congressional offices should not be more vulnerable to workplace harassment and discrimination than their congressional staff colleagues. This bill would extend coverage of the rights and protections established under the CAA to these groups. The bill also requires that a climate survey be conducted of all offices covered by the CAA, each Congress, regarding the workplace environment, including sexual harassment. Collecting information, anonymously, from staff will help us determine whether the reforms we hope in this bill are serving their purpose or if modifications are needed. H.R. 4924 is the culmination of bipartisan work on the part of House Administration Committee Chairman HARPER and Ranking Member BRADY , and my fellow members on the Committee, as well as the leadership of my colleague Rep. JACKIE SPEIER , who has championed the issue of fighting sexual harassment on the Hill. I want to thank them all for working collaboratively on this legislation. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. HARPER ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4924. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
REQUIRING ADOPTION OF ANTI HARASSMENT AND ANTIDISCRIMINATION POLICIES FOR HOUSE OFFICES Mr. HARPER. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 724) requiring each employing office of the House of Representatives to adopt an antiharassment and antidiscrimination policy for the office’s workplace, establishing the Office of Employee Advocacy to provide legal assistance and consultation to employees of the House regarding procedures and proceedings under the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the resolution. The text of the resolution is as follows: 
SECTION 1. MANDATORY ANTIHARASSMENT AND ANTIDISCRIMINATION POLICIES FOR HOUSE OFFICES. 
Clause 9 of rule XXIII of the Rules of the House of Representatives is amended by striking ‘‘such individual,’’ and inserting ‘‘such individual, including by committing an act of sexual harassment against such individual,’’. 
The Office of Congressional Ethics may not initiate or continue any investigation of an allegation of a violation of law made applicable to employing offices of the House of Representatives under part A of title II of the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995, or make any recommendations regarding such an allegation, if a covered employee initiates proceedings with respect to the alleged violation under title IV of such Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. HARPER ) and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. BRADY ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Mississippi. Mr. HARPER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, this is the second measure before us today. The House resolution makes a number of administrative reforms to the House, including requiring each employing office of the House to adopt antiharassment and antidiscrimination policies for the office’s workplace; establishing within the Chief Administrative Officer an Office of Employee Advocacy who will provide legal consultation, representation, and assistance to House employees; and directing Members to certify that the Members’ Representational Allowance is not being used to settle or pay an award under the Congressional Accountability Act. In addition, the resolution makes a number of changes to the Code of Official Conduct that, together, will strengthen the House’s policies on sexual harassment. The House resolution is a critical piece of the comprehensive reform package needed to strengthen the policies, procedures, and mechanisms to guard against and respond to sexual harassment claims in the congressional workplace. I encourage my colleagues to support this important resolution. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BRADY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, this resolution continues the work we started and the legislation we just considered. It makes muchneeded improvements to how the House operates. It requires every office to have an antiharassment and antidiscrimination policy. It provides legal counsel for our House employees who need assistance in fighting harassment in their offices. It strengthens our Code of Conduct, the ethics rules we live by, to make clear that this kind of behavior will not be tolerated, and it bans the use of the MRA for paying settlements. I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation. Again, I would like to thank my chairman for his cooperation. As always, we work together. As you can see, when we work together, we get things done. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HARPER. Mr. Speaker, I want to certainly thank the ranking member, Mr. BRADY , for the great bipartisan work and his friendship in making this possible to get these important things done. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. HARPER ) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, H. Res. 724. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the resolution was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
AUTHORIZING THE USE OF EMANCIPATION HALL IN THE CAPITOL VISITOR CENTER FOR AN EVENT TO CELEBRATE THE 200TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BIRTH OF FREDERICK DOUGLASS Mr. HARPER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on House Administration be discharged from further consideration of House Concurrent Resolution 102, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House. The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Mississippi? There was no objection. The text of the concurrent resolution is as follows: 
H. C ON. RES. 102 Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
SECTION 1. USE OF EMANCIPATION HALL FOR EVENT TO CELEBRATE 200TH ANNIVERSARY OF BIRTH OF FREDERICK DOUGLASS. 
The concurrent resolution was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
COMMON SENSE NUTRITION DISCLOSURE ACT OF 2017 Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 725, I call up the bill (H.R. 772) to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to improve and clarify certain disclosure requirements for restaurants and similar retail food establishments, and to amend the authority to bring proceedings under section 403A, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 725, the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the Committee on Energy and Commerce, printed in the bill, is adopted, and the bill, as amended, is considered read. The text of the bill, as amended, is as follows: 
H.R. 772 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act of 2017’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill shall be debatable for 1 hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and 
ranking minority member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce. The gentleman from Michigan (Mr. UPTON ) and the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan. 
Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous material on H.R. 772. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Michigan? There was no objection. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, this bill, H.R. 772, is a bipartisan piece of legislation introduced by Representatives CATHY  MCMORRIS RODGERS and T ONY CA´RDENAS to amend the Food and Drug Administration’s menu labeling rule that was issued in November of 2014. The goal of the bill was to make implementation of the nutrition disclosure law useful for consumers and workable for food service establishments. The existing regulatory framework, which has not yet been implemented, is not only cumbersome for the food industry, but it also impedes businesses’ ability to provide meaningful information that customers can use to make nutrition decisions. The Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act is critical to avoid harming consumers’ choices, jobs, and, certainly, small businesses. This bill was drafted to address the challenges of an overly prescriptive, onesizefitsall approach to regulation affecting a very, very diverse industry. We need to ensure that the law works for all food establishments: convenience stores, supermarkets, grocery stores, pizza shops. All have enormous challenges complying with the regulations as written. This bill is going to provide those entities with the flexibility and, frankly, the certainty that they need to comply without compromising consumers’ access to nutrition information. The Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act will establish a more reasonable standard for Federal regulations and allow nutritional information to be provided by a remote access menu for establishments where the majority of orders, in fact, are placed off premises. b1245 Consumers should have this information when they are placing an order. A menu board may work for some businesses where customers order at the counter where they also pay, but for an establishment where most people now order online or from a phone, having the calorie information when they pick up their order won’t be very helpful to that consumer. This legislation also takes steps to preserve local foods and fresh items that might be sold at just a few locations. To do so, the bill clarifies that menu labeling regulations are intended for standard menu items, defined as those items with substantially the same recipe prepared in substantially the same way with substantially the same food components that are routinely included on a menu or menu board or are routinely offered as a self service food or food on display at 20 or more locations. This bill also eliminates draconian penalties that are required in current law by removing criminal felony penalties for store managers and allowing restaurants and retailers to take corrective actions. This shields small business owners and their employees from frivolous lawsuits based on inadvertent human error. No one ought to be criminalized for putting too many pickles on a sandwich or maybe not enough olives. This bill further clarifies that establishments will have 90 days to correct a violation before FDA brings enforcement action. The food retail sector employs—let’s face it—millions of Americans and provides access to affordable, healthy options. The Federal Government shouldn’t impose arbitrary regulations that are going to cause unnecessary harm to businesses and consumers. The businesses impacted by this bill widely support providing consumers with nutritional information to better inform their food decisions, but they want to do it in a practical and a commonsense way. This legislation provides clear guidance to smallbusiness owners, ensuring compliance and, at the same time, delivering critical information. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my Energy and Commerce Committee colleagues for their work on both sides of the aisle. I urge its passage today, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I rise in opposition to H.R. 772. This bill is completely unnecessary, overly prescriptive, and would deny consumers critical information about the food that they eat. At a time when our country is facing an obesity epidemic—I would say, really, crisis—we should not be undermining efforts to educate consumers about the nutritional value of foods, including calories. As a country, we pay a high price for obesity. It is estimated that medical costs for obesity top $190.2 billion, annually. Childhood obesity alone is responsible for $14 billion in direct medical costs. We should be embracing efforts to reduce this enormous cost to our healthcare system. A Harvard study found restaurant menu labeling could prevent up to 41,000 cases of childhood obesity and could save over $4.6 billion in healthcare costs over 10 years. So if you want to eat pizza and fries, that is great, but why not have the opportunity to know how many calories are in that pizza and fries? You should be able to have that information. More information for consumers is a good thing. The menu labeling law that passed in 2010 requires chain restaurants with 20 or more locations to provide consumers with basic nutritional information like calorie content for standard food and beverage items on menus. Since then, the FDA has been working to implement this rule only to face numerous delays along the way. Research has shown that calorie information can help people make healthier choices, and 80 percent of Americans support providing this type of calorie information on the menu. But far from common sense, the legislation we are considering today would undermine the law. H.R. 772 takes us backwards by undermining the law and further delaying consumer protections. This is not about flexibility. This bill just gives cover to bad actors and special interests that do not want to comply with the law. First, it would allow food establishments to display calorie information in ways that would only serve to confuse and mislead customers. It allows the food establishment to set arbitrary serving sizes and cut the calorie count way below what a normal person would eat. Without standardized calorie reporting for menu items, people will have a tough time figuring out and computing nutrition information and comparing across items. It is deceptive to label an entree or a muffin as multiple servings because we all know that they are mostly consumed by one person in one sitting. Second, it would deny consumers the opportunity to view calorie information and other nutritional information regardless of how or where they purchase food from a chain restaurant. Not only does it allow deceptive serving size manipulation, this bill would allow food establishments to make that information difficult to find. Calorie labeling is not useful if it is posted somewhere that it will not be seen. Provisions in this bill would deny customers nutritional information from not only inside a pizza chain, but inside fastfood and other chain restaurants if the majority of their orders are placed offsite, like on the telephone or online. For example, under this bill, a restaurant or similar retail food establishment could have the option to only list nutritional information online or via some other remoteaccess menu, thereby denying consumers who order in a brickandmortar location access to the information. Speed limits are not useful if they are hidden on a highway, and calorie counts cannot help if they are concealed from the public. Finally, it has been nearly 8 years since the original menu labeling requirements were passed, but this bill would once again delay the final menu labeling rules and send the FDA back 
to the drawing board. The FDA has already put forth a proposed rule, solicited comments, and worked with stakeholders to finalize the menu labeling rule. In fact, just this past November, FDA published new draft guidance intended to help answer any of the outstanding questions regarding compliance. This guidance included sample menus and pictures to help food establishments tackle how to label for a variety of ingredients like multiple pizza toppings. This rule has been delayed long enough. The final menu labeling regulations should go into effect as scheduled in May of this year. Countless businesses, restaurants, and other retail food establishments have already invested time and money into compliance with the current menu labeling rules, and it would be irresponsible to further delay implementation of this important rule. This bill is another handout to businesses and an affront to consumers. It will keep consumers in the dark about the nutritional information that they need and create consumer and industry confusion. H.R. 772 would weaken an important tool intended to help Americans make informed food choices at a time when obesity and other nutritionrelated health problems are at crisis levels. That is why countless consumer and public health organizations oppose this bill, including the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, the American Diabetes Association, the American Heart Association, the American Nurses Association, Center for Science in the Public Interest, Consumers Union, and the Trust for America’s Health. All of these health organizations oppose this legislation because it is not good for the health of our country or for consumers. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I know that I have other speakers, so I am going to stall a little bit for time here. I am told that some of them may be at Jimmy John’s trying to get through that menu wondering if they should have olives or pickles or Dijon mustard or mayonnaise, but they are on their way. I want to say we all want consumer information—we do—but we ought to be able to agree that food service establishments shouldn’t face Federal criminal penalties for inadvertent failures to comply with the FDA’s framework. Under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, food labeling has to be truthful and nonmisleading. Food labeling that doesn’t meet FDA’s standard for truthful and nonmisleading is deemed misbranded. Under U.S. Code, introducing misbranded food into commerce is, in fact, a prohibited act, and the liable party shall be imprisoned for up to a year, fined not more than $1,000, or both. Food to which these menu labeling requirements apply is deemed misbranded if the FDA’s rule requirement is not met, so it is not necessary that the person intentionally misleads customers. Under FDA’s framework, merely adding that extra olive or pepperoni is going to render the calorie content on the menu misleading and the chef then becomes criminal. Come on. People say that the FDA won’t put people in jail over this, so I don’t think there ought to be an issue codifying that in statute. The Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act will give folks an opportunity to correct inadvertent mistakes so long as they were acting in good faith, and they are going to make standards far more reasonable. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from the great State of Michigan (Mr. WALBERG ), who is a member of the committee. Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues in supporting the Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act. Under the Obama administration, the FDA put forward an unworkable, one sizefitsall mandate on restaurants and retail food establishments for providing calorie and nutrition information to customers. As written, many businesses cannot comply with these rules and would be subject to onerous, arbitrary penalties. H.R. 772 is a bipartisan solution that makes compliance possible by providing small businesses with greater flexibility to provide nutrition information in a way that best serves their customers. It ensures customers receive the nutrition information they want, but does so in a way that takes into account the diversity of restaurants and food products. This commonsense bill takes a flexible approach that will actually increase access to information for customers and allow good, hardworking Michigan restaurants, grocers, and convenience stores to continue meeting the needs of consumers. Mr. Speaker, I urge its passage. Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Illinois has 23 minutes remaining. Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DELAURO ). Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Illinois for yielding the time. Let me, first, dispel a couple of myths that have been suggested on the floor of the House. One myth has been that small businesses are negatively impacted by the menu labeling requirements. Small businesses are unilaterally exempt from menu labeling requirements. The rule only applies to ‘‘covered establishments,’’ meaning those that have 20 or more locations. This rule does not and never was intended to apply to small businesses. That is misinformation being given out by the majority. The second item which I just heard momentarily about, penalties, menu labeling will be subject to the exact same mechanisms and penalties as those for packaged food. The FDA has maintained its commitment to compliance, outreach, and education and has waived enforcement for the first year. Additionally, numerous State and local governments have menu labeling requirements, and not one chain restaurant has faced criminal liability— once again, misinformation being distributed by the majority. b1300 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this special interestdriven attack on popular and necessary menu labeling rules. When we crafted the health reforms in the Affordable Care Act, we kept several critical goals in mind. We aimed to slow the staggering growth of healthcare spending, make preventive and wellness care more central to our health system, and give Americans access to more data so that they can make their own informed healthcare decisions. Menu labeling is an essential tool to meet all three of those goals. That is why I have been a longtime champion of menu labeling, and I fought hard to secure its inclusion in the Affordable Care Act. Congress passed standardized menu labeling in 2010. The goal was to arm Americans with the information they need to make informed nutritional decisions for themselves and their families. The language was built on consensus and compromise. It was worked out between a variety of interests, including industry partners and the National Restaurant Association. Industry has already had nearly 8 years of input for the implementation of the labeling rule, yet, with this misguided bill, certain sectors of the industry will tear down the progress that we have made. This bill would roll back and weaken this crucial step to combat the obesity epidemic in the United States. This is obstruction. American families are paying the price in their healthcare costs. In 2015, sales at restaurants and bars surpassed spending at grocery stores for the first time. In a typical day, one third of our children, 4 in 10 adolescents, and onethird of adults eat at a fast food restaurant. Americans are eating, on average, onethird of their calories outside of the home. Nutritional information must be made readily available where the consumer is at the point of purchase. A health impact assessment from Los Angeles County found that menu labeling could avert 40 percent of the 6.75 millionpound average weight gain in the country. You think of that in terms of healthcare costs and the impact that decrease would have. Our children are especially at risk. Today, more than onethird of our kids 
and adolescents are overweight or obese. Children eat more than twice as many calories at a restaurant than they do at home. They consume less nutrients and more saturated fats. The impact on our kids alone should be reason enough to oppose a measure that undermines a consumer’s ability to make informed, nutritious choices at mealtimes. Menu labeling is popular. In a national poll, over 80 percent of Americans support menu labeling in chain restaurants. Over 100 nutrition and health organizations support menu labeling. Chains from Starbucks to Panera Bread to McDonald’s are already implementing menu labeling. The rest of the industry must follow suit. Consumers have a right to make an informed decision. It is disrespectful for the industry and their partners to argue that the American people cannot understand menu labeling. Give people the ability to make their choice. You go in to eat, it has been a great day, you look at the board, you see something that you want, you look at the calories and say: Today, I think I will watch my calories. You order accordingly. Other days, it is a bad day. You go in and you throw caution to the wind. You say: I am going to order whatever I can, no matter what the calorie count is. This is about the right to choose and freedom of choice. That is what we are talking about here today. This bill denies consumers the right to nutritional information at that point of purchase. Even if 49 percent of orders are placed from instore menus, food establishments could bury menu labeling online. Multiple studies have shown that providing calorie menu labeling information can help Americans make lower calorie choices, but they cannot do this if they do not have the information they need. This bill increases consumer confusion and allows restaurants to list deceptive portion sizes, listing an entree as multiple servings even though these items are most often consumed by one person. It weakens enforcement and consumer protection, completely removes an establishment’s incentive to comply with the menu labeling requirements, and removes the ability of individuals to hold retail food establishments accountable for violations to the food labeling law. The existing law is already extremely flexible. I said restaurants with less than 20 locations. Momandpop small businesses are excluded. I don’t believe my colleagues on the other side of the aisle understand that. Read the legislation. Let me mention something which has been very interesting, and that is about pizza companies. I come from New Haven, Connecticut, an Italian American neighborhood. I know something about pizza. What we have done with the industry is to work with them. The FDA opened the door to allow them what they asked for: to give a range of calories on a slice of pizza. They have done it. These are FDA charts which demonstrate how easily you can put a label on the food so that people understand what the calories are. I will show this one. Calories are listed per slice. That is what the industry wanted. That is what we did. They have the ranges that they have for their various toppings. Don’t let the other side sell you a bill of goods. The FDA has conceded that they can list the calories in a single slice rather than an entire pizza. This all illustrates that the Food and Drug Administration has already been working closely with the industry to address their concerns. We should let them work through this process, rather than complicating it with legislation that, in fact, would harm what we have been doing, what we have worked on all these years: meaningful, impactful work on menu labeling with a single stroke. This is a special interestdriven bill. It is not the answer. I urge my colleagues to oppose it. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  a document that outlines the myths that are perpetrated by the majority and what the underlying facts are. 
BUSTING THE MYTHS OF MENULABELING  The Menu Labeling Rule provides consumers with nutritional information on the foods they purchase. This crucial information would give Americans a tool to make healthy choices. Nevertheless, the lobbying of special interest groups has resulted in H.R. 772, a bill based on nothing more than misleading myths. MYTH No. 1: Small businesses are negatively impacted. Small businesses are unilaterally exempt from menu labeling requirements. The rule only applies to ‘‘covered establishments,’’ meaning those that have 20 or more locations. The rule does not, and never was intended, to apply to small businesses. MYTH No. 2: Labeling requirements are burdensome and difficult to comply with. In reality, nutritional labeling requirements are straightforward and easy to implement, which is why numerous food retailers are already labeling calories on their menus. Furthermore, FDA has sought eight years of industry input which has resulted in the most flexible disclosure requirements to date. Nutritional information for complex menu items can be disclosed in ranges, without the need to estimate exact calories for various combinations. MYTH No. 3: Labeling requirements only create consumer confusion. The Menu Labeling Rule actually reduces consumer confusion by providing nutritional information at the point of purchase, and ensures that portion sizes are listed realistically. The rule will allow for a standard nutritional information format which will facilitate consumer understanding. Without it, consumers will be subject to deceptive portion sizes which can lead to them making misinformed decisions based on misleading information. MYTH No. 4: Enforcements and penalties for noncompliance are harsh and unreasonable. Menu labeling will be subject to the exact same mechanisms and penalties as those for packaged food. FDA has maintained its commitment to compliance outreach and education, and has waived enforcement for the first year. Additionally, numerous state and local governments have menu labeling requirements, and not one chain restaurant has faced a lawsuit. MYTH No. 5: Menu Labeling Requirements are unpopular among American consumers. Consumers have unequivocally maintained their support for menu labeling, with a recent poll showing support as high as 80 percent among Democrats, Republicans and Independents. Moreover, more than 100 public health organizations and health professionals have voiced their opposition to H.R. 772 because it would ‘‘undermine congressional intent to provide access to calorie labeling in a broad range of chain food service establishments.’’ Congressional Republicans have yet again bowed to special interest and created a carveout for big food corporations who do not have the best interests of Americans at heart. Overwhelmingly, consumers want to know the nutritional information of the foods they are eating. Please oppose H.R. 772—as well as any efforts that seek to undermine consumers. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, might I ask how much time each side has remaining on this bill? The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. LAMBORN ). The gentleman from Michigan has 23 minutes remaining. The gentlewoman from Illinois has 14
1⁄2minutes remaining. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds. Mr. Speaker, I might say the previous speaker, my friend, asked about what the original stakeholders had in mind before these regs were written. I was one of those. This was my bill. This was a bipartisan bill offered by Jim Matheson and FREDUPTON a lot of years ago. It was never our intent to put people behind bars for having some misinformation based on the number of olives or pickles or Dijon or mayonnaise. It is just wrong. It was not our intent to do what the FDA has now done. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs. MCMORRIS RODGERS ), the author of this bill and a member of our committee, where it passed 39–14. Mrs. MCMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with legislation to address one of the most burdensome rules in the Obama administration. When the FDA announced its final rule implementing a national menu labeling standard in 2014, the intent was twofold: deliver customers increased access to nutrition information and establish a uniform, single national standard. However, in trying to establish this uniform standard, the FDA’s 400page rule attempts a onesizefitsall approach to an industry as diverse as its ingredients. Under the current rule, every deli and salad bar offering, every possible pizza topping combination will have to be calculated and their calorie count displayed on physical menus. 
Last week, I was home in Spokane and visited My Fresh Basket. This newly opened grocery store is also a great place to eat lunch, with fresh, local options and madetoorder food. This rule would mean new physical signage every time this locally owned grocer changes the options they offer, which is just about every day. This bill is not about the merits of calorie counts. This bill does not remove the requirement of calorie counts on menus. This bill certainly does not make it more difficult for customers to receive nutritional information. This bill, at its very core, is about flexibility for businesses to meet the requirements of the rule and present this calorie information in a way that makes sense for them and their customers. The onesizefitsall approach proposed by the FDA is problematic for two reasons. First, the madetoorder portion of the food industry offers endless, constantly changing combinations of ingredients. For some sandwich shops and pizzerias, the possible variations are in the tens of millions. The FDA wants these restaurants to put on paper all of these variations and their calorie counts and have it publicly displayed in the restaurant. It is unrealistic and it is not a good use of the businessowner’s time. Second, digital and online ordering is customers’ preferred method for ordering. Nearly 90 percent of orders in some restaurants are placed without an individual ever stepping foot into the restaurant. So tell me, how does it make sense to force a restaurant to have a physical menu with calorie listings when 90 percent of your customers aren’t going to see it? How does it make sense to force a customer to navigate millions of combinations to find the nutrition information that matches their order? This legislation provides flexibility in how restaurants provide the nutritional information. It makes it easier for customers to actually see and understand the information because it is displayed where customers actually place orders, including by phone, online, or through mobile apps. By bringing this rule into the 21st century, customers can trust that they are getting reliable information in a way that is easy to access and is customerfriendly. I also want to take this opportunity to clarify that this bill does not change the preemption provision in the underlying statute. This ensures that no State or political subdivision of a State may directly or indirectly establish or enforce any requirement for nutrition labeling of food that is not identical to the requirement laid out in the final regulations. While some States may disagree, I am committed now and moving forward to ensuring that we have one unified menu labeling requirement. Before I close, I want to thank all my colleagues and the stakeholders for their hard work on this bipartisan legislation. This has been a team effort over a number of years now, and I appreciate their support. Finally, I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this important amendment and to ultimately vote ‘‘yes’’ for the bipartisan Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act. Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. ENGEL ). Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Illinois for yielding and for the good work she is doing on this and so many other bills. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill. In today’s world, when technology allows us to constantly be logged into the workplace, it is understandable that Americans often find themselves seeking more convenient meals outside of the home. But dining out should not be about sacrificing nutrition. I believe Americans should have all the tools necessary to make informed choices about what they eat and what they feed their families. Why wouldn’t we want that? Why wouldn’t we let the consumer decide? Why would we try to rob some tools and take things away from them? Menu labeling gives Americans those tools, and we have been making progress towards more transparent labeling for consumers. It is a good thing. This bill, H.R. 772, would undo that process. It delays muchneeded transparency and will cause confusion for both consumers and businesses, many of which have already started implementing existing menu labeling requirements. So let’s not turn back the clock. Menu labeling is both a vital public health tool and an important consumer protection. People are smart enough to make their own choices. If you want to make it impossible for them to know everything, then you are not allowing the consumer to make the final choice in an informed way. I don’t see why we would want to do that. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’ b1315 Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER ), a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my good friend Mrs. MCMORRIS RODGERS ’ bill, the Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act. This legislation would make commonsense reforms to menu labeling and help ease the burden on businesses, while providing consumers with the information that they need. The regulations, finalized by the Obama administration in 2014, presented incredible challenges to businesses and would cause some insurmountable challenges for them to be in compliance with the law. This bill would allow for a more targeted approach and provide relief, while ensuring people have the nutritional information they need to make educated decisions about their health. Let’s take a second to look at how exactly this bill benefits people across the country. This directs restaurants and food establishments to disclose visible information on calorie counts, the number of calories per serving, and accounts for online ordering with remoteaccess labeling directions. Self service establishments will need to place signage with nutritional information for each food item. Finally, it ensures that the nutritional disclosure of food contents would need to comply with current standards, ensuring that restaurants will adhere to a guideline that they know they can trust. While this is good for consumers, it also makes important reforms for the establishments. It sets out protections to prevent frivolous lawsuits. It puts forth a good faith threshold so that businesses aren’t ultimately penalized for what could be a small error from one of their employees. It gives establishments the flexibility in labeling that may not maintain the same item list at all of their locations. This legislation is about ensuring integral parts of our communities aren’t subjected to unfeasible regulatory expectations while providing transparency to customers. I am proud to cosponsor this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support the underlying legislation. Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. CA´RDENAS ). Mr. CA´RDENAS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Illinois for yielding me this time, and I also want to thank her so much for her diligence, her efforts, and her sincerity in trying to make this issue and this bill, and many bills on this issue, as good as possible. Although we may disagree on the final version of this bill, again, it is my sincere wish that we will continue to work together as this issue will never go away because nutrition and the understanding of that for every American is paramount for our individual health and for communities as a whole. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 772, the Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act of 2017. I am proud to colead this bill with my colleague, Congresswoman MCMORRIS RODGERS . Americans increasingly realize the importance of having access to accurate nutritional information about the food we eat, and we need to make sure that businesses are providing this information. However, no two food establishments, convenience stores, or grocery stores are identical, and the government 
should take that into account as we implement guidelines on making nutritional information available. As a former smallbusiness owner myself, I know the costs and challenges associated with regulatory compliance. Not all businesses can afford a legal department to help them stay within the rules, despite their best intentions. This legislation would help businesses help consumers be smart about what they are eating. The FDA’s 2014 rule on nutrition disclosures is set to take effect in May of this year, though some issues remain unresolved. This bill will give FDA the authority to fix these issues and hold businesses to tough standards they can and shall meet. Right now, the FDA rule exempts small businesses, but not those that sell to large suppliers. Those small businesses would have to undertake expensive nutritional analysis in order to comply with the law, even if they don’t have the resources. Another example is, right now, the FDA rule would require delivery restaurants to post nutritional information in their brickandmortar establishment instead of online, even though nobody would see it, especially those who go online to order their food. This bill fixes that. Finally, this bill reins in outofproportion penalties in the current rule that would have severe, unintended consequences. No one should have to worry about losing their business if they mistakenly make sandwiches with too much meat or cheese. Importantly, this bill makes sure the FDA is still able to enforce the law in situations in which businesses are misleading their customers. This bill doesn’t include a time delay, meaning the FDA would be able to implement the nutrition disclosure rules sooner than later. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill to help the businesses in districts like mine to help our constituents eat healthier. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume while I am waiting for an additional speaker. I want to hold up this board. This is an example that the FDA gave to businesses on how they could easily—we see all kinds of signs like this. Sometimes it is the price at the end of the item, and, in this case, it would be the calories. So it talks about a slice of pizza. Now, I am feeling kind of chunky today, and I go into the pizza parlor, and it says that for cheese pizza, for the original, it is about 200 to 240 calories; for the thin and crispy, 150 to 190 calories; and for pan—now, we love our pan pizza, our deepdish pizza in Chicago, but that is 260 to 300 calories. So I am thinking: Yeah, I want pizza, but I think I am going to go with the thin and crispy, which is going to save me at least 110 calories. Now, what do I want on top? I am looking now at all the things, the meats and the veggies that can go on top, and each one of them has calories per slice listed there. Simple. I am a pretty good—you know, I can do math pretty well, and I can also compare. Do I want something that is up to 50 calories or something that is 20 calories? And I can look at this sign and make a decision for myself. This is not too cumbersome. This is something that could easily be displayed. I go to a lot of restaurants that already are in compliance and have the calories, and if I am like between the pasta and the salmon—and, again, I want to make that decision. It is good for me to know what is the real difference in calories. I want to say, I started out as an activist in the grocery store. I was a very, very young housewife many years ago, 1970, when a small group of women got together. We called ourselves National Consumers United because we wanted to know how old our food was in the grocery store. Everything was code dated. You couldn’t tell how old the food was, and we were actually told that if we didn’t like it, we could shop somewhere else. Well, we started cracking the codes like detectives, pushing the stock boys—and they were all boys—against the shelf, and they were telling us how they put the old stuff in front and the new stuff in the back. Finally, we were able to get one of our retailers to say: Come to Jewel; our food has freshness dates. And people loved it. And it turned out that, even over the initial opposition from the retailers, it was good for them, because people appreciated that and went to their stores. Now, those dates on food are ubiquitous. Customers like it, retailers like it, it is better, and this would be yet another thing that we could do. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE ), the ranking member on the Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from Illinois for all her work on this and so much other good legislation—not the bill that is on the floor today, though. I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 772. This bill would undo years of progress towards implementing menu label requirements and only lead to greater consumer and industry confusion. We included a requirement in the Affordable Care Act that certain restaurants and other retail food establishments with 20 or more locations display calorie and other nutritional information in order to give consumers access to the information they need to make healthy choices in a way that would be consistent and easy to understand. Now, GOP efforts to sabotage the Affordable Care Act continue with this legislation today, which also undermines the ACA’s prevention goals. Unfortunately, H.R. 772 would weaken the current menu labeling requirements and lead to extended compliance delays, putting those establishments who have already begun complying at a disadvantage. While proponents of this bill claim it will increase flexibility for covered entities, in reality, this bill would allow restaurants and other retail food establishments to determine their own serving sizes and what would be the one designated menu or menu board for the purposes of disclosing caloric information. It would also permit establishments to disclose nutritional content for certain food items through a choice of methods instead of utilizing a standardized format. H.R. 772 also would limit the civil liability of covered entities, impeding private citizens’ ability to take legal recourse should an establishment fail to comply with the menu labeling requirements. And as I noted when we considered a similar version of this bill in the last Congress, I continue to believe that legislation is not the right approach to address the concerns raised by some industry groups regarding the menu labeling rule. The FDA has been diligently working with stakeholders, since the law was passed, to find a workable approach that provides consumers with transparency when eating out, while also ensuring covered establishments have the tools they need to implement the rule. Just this past November, FDA issued new supplemental draft guidance to help answer any outstanding questions still posed by industry. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from New Jersey. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, the FDA has demonstrated that it is best positioned to address specific concerns with the regulation, and this new guidance is an example that FDA is taking the necessary steps to make compliance attainable. Again, we have a new FDA Administrator appointed by the Trump administration, and he is trying to work with industry to get this done. So we shouldn’t roll back the clock and undo the progress we have made. Instead, we should be moving forward with the menu labeling requirements as they currently stand and are set to go into effect in May of this year. H.R. 772, unfortunately, would do the opposite; and, for this reason, I oppose the bill and urge my colleagues to oppose the bill as well. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I wanted to—you know, your friends at Jimmy John’s are not 
going to go to jail. In fact, just this past November, in new supplemental draft guidance, FDA explained that the agency, ‘‘does not intend to penalize or recommend the use of criminal penalties for minor violations.’’ The FDA went on to explain that minor violations would include inadvertently missing a calorie declaration for a standard menu item on the buffet; minor discrepancies in the type, size, color, contrast of calorie declarations; minimal variations or inadvertent error that would only minimally impact the calorie declaration, such as adding extra slices of pepperoni or an extra dollop of ketchup. This is just not going to happen. Let me just say, in closing, the law that Congress passed almost 8 years ago—so the calls for more time is just ridiculous—should be allowed to go into effect. It is long past due. This is about freedom, about freedom of consumers to make informed choices. I know my friends across the aisle talk about freedom all the time. This is about freedom to make choices that will help you. Empowering consumers to make informed decisions that benefit their health is exactly what the current law allows. H.R. 772 would undermine that important goal. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I would just remind my colleagues that this bill is supported by literally hundreds of national State and local organizations, including the National Grocers Association, the National Association of Convenience Stores, the Food Marketing Institute, the American Pizza Community, the National Association of Truck Stop Operators, amongst many, many others. b1330 I want to also reiterate that this bill, again, is bipartisan and has passed the Energy and Commerce Committee 39– 14, in this Congress, and last year in the House, where it passed 266–144. The bottom line is this: it clarifies that establishments acting in good faith will not be penalized, particularly in a criminal way, for inadvertent human error in reasonable variations in serving sizes and ingredients, giving them 90 days to correct a violation before enforcement action is brought by the FDA. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in support of this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. DESAULNIER. I rise to express my strong opposition to H.R. 772, the socalled Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act. I have worked at every level of the restaurant business, starting as a dishwasher and busboy, and eventually managing and owning various restaurants in the San Francisco Bay area. As a former restaurateur and a member of the California Restaurant Association, I have a deep appreciation for the value American consumers place on nutritional information when determining their food purchases. Numerous studies, like the International Food Information Council and elsewhere, suggest that nutritional information is second only to taste when choosing what to eat from a menu. Other peerreviewed studies have found that consumers make healthier choices when nutrition information is placed directly on the menu. Making nutrition information readily available and standardized is an important step in fighting the growing epidemic of obesity and chronic disease. According to the CDC, more than twothirds of American adults are overweight or obese, nearly a third of American children are overweight, and the prevalence of childhood obesity children has more than tripled since 1971. That is why, as a California State Senator, I coauthored the firstinthenation menu labeling law. This bipartisan legislation was passed with industry support and cooperation, and signed by a Republican governor. In contrast, the bill before us today creates giant loopholes in the ACA’s national menu labeling provisions and allows selected establishments to arbitrarily determine serving sizes, and obscure the total number of servings per item. For example, if this bill would become law pizza chains, supermarkets, and convenience stores would be exempt from having to provide information to consumers at the pointofsale. The bill would also further delay the implementation of our existing nationwide menu labeling efforts that are supported by more than 75 percent of American consumers. Particularly harmful for my constituents, H.R. 772 would preempt state efforts to address the obesity epidemic locally. The bill also undermines state and local efforts to enforce or enact their own food labeling laws, and extends to food labelling in general, not simply menu labeling as the bill’s title would lead us to believe. This misguided legislation unravels all of the cooperative work being done by the restaurant industry and government agencies across the nation. I urge my colleagues to oppose this effort to undermine local transparency efforts and vote No on H.R. 772. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 725, the previous question is ordered on the bill, as amended. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the passage of the bill. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. 
b1508 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. PALMER ) at 3 o’clock and 8 minutes p.m. 
REPORT ON RESOLUTION PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF SENATE AMENDMENT TO H.R. 1892, HONORING HOMETOWN HEROES ACT Mr. SESSIONS, from the Committee on Rules, submitted a privileged report (Rept. No. 115–547) on the resolution (H. Res. 727) providing for consideration of the Senate amendment to the bill (H.R. 1892) to amend title 4, United States Code, to provide for the flying of the flag at halfstaff in the event of the death of a first responder in the line of duty, which was referred to the House Calendar and ordered to be printed. 
PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF SENATE AMENDMENT TO H.R. 1892, HONORING HOMETOWN HEROES ACT Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 727 and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: 
H. R ES. 727 Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in order to take from the Speaker’s table the bill (H.R. 1892) to amend title 4, United States Code, to provide for the flying of the flag at halfstaff in the event of the death of a first responder in the line of duty, with the Senate amendment thereto, and to consider in the House, without intervention of any point of order, a motion offered by the chair of the Committee on Appropriations or his designee that the House concur in the Senate amendment with an amendment consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 115–58 modified by the amendment printed in the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution. The Senate amendment and the motion shall be considered as read. The motion shall be debatable for one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Appropriations. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the motion to its adoption without intervening motion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from Rochester, New York (Ms. SLAUGHTER ), my dear friend and ranking member of the Rules Committee, pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. 
Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this rule and the underlying legislation. The rule provides for consideration of the Senate amendment to H.R. 1892, the Further Extension of Continuing Appropriations Act of 2018. Mr. Speaker, the House amendment will extend government funding until March 23, 2018, while simultaneously funding the Department of Defense for a full year. This will ensure our Nation’s defense and pay for our proud servicemen and women who will no longer be in jeopardy during ongoing discussions on funding for the long term spending caps, until we agree to that. Mr. Speaker, we just have come out of Rules Committee where we had a hearing for several hours where we detailed not only the parts of this bill, but also the agreement and disagreement between the two parties. I want you to know that I am pleased to report today the Rules Committee favorably reported out this bill, and we will be talking about the substance of that today. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank my friend for yielding me the customary 30 minutes. Mr. Speaker, I am sorry I can’t support this continuing resolution today. The great government of the United States of America that has been called ‘‘the last best hope of man’’ cannot be funded in tranches of maybe 2 weeks to 3 weeks. This is the fifth continuing resolution that we have done since the 30th of September. That is an atrocity. I mean, I can’t think of any legislative body anywhere totally unable to do its job. And as sorry as I am to say it because of my great respect and affection for my fellow Members, I don’t believe that this majority is capable of governing. We are 2 days before the shutdown of the government of the United States, before it closes for business. Late last night, about 10 p.m., they finally released the details of this shortterm spending bill. And we will be back here as soon as this one expires doing yet another one. We are 5 months into the fiscal year, and this is the majority’s fifth continuing resolution. We are virtually in the same position today as we were on September 8, December 7, December 21, and January 18 when this Chamber passed the prior continuing resolutions. The majority isn’t learning from any of this. They just keep repeating those mistakes. Like the bill before it, the proposal was written by and for the majority. Let me repeat. The Democrats had virtually no say in this. And once again, it ignores many of the priorities that we all agree need to be addressed: providing additional disaster relief after a storm season that saw historic wildfires, hurricanes, and mudslides; three rail wrecks in 2 weeks with fatalities, certainly proving to us, if we didn’t know it already, that our neglect of the railroads, the bridges, the infrastructure in the United States is a mess. Saving America’s endangered pensions is also a priority, and extending additional health access for our veterans certainly is not just a priority, but an obligation. b1515 What is included here is woefully inadequate. This bill pays for extending community health centers—which is very important to me, let me hasten to add—by eviscerating funding for one of the most important parts of the Affordable Care Act that helps keep people well: the Prevention Fund. This fund focuses on children’s health by expanding access to lifesaving vaccines and reducing the risk of lead poisoning, among many other things. The majority is paying for opening the centers by gutting the Prevention Fund while we are experiencing the worst flu epidemic in nearly a decade. Now, I have heard a lot of talk about prioritizing the national defense. We don’t take a back seat on our side to anybody who loves and respects the people who defend us, who every day— an allvolunteer military—stands on the line for us. But we also believe that this bill does not raise the Budget Control Act sequester level of spending caps for nondefense. That is a shame, and it is also the Budget Control Act. Mr. Speaker, onethird of the nondefense domestic budget that we are trying to get parity for goes to national security, part of our defense: to our veterans, to homeland security, the State Department, the Justice Department, and counterterrorism initiatives. Refusing to equally raise the defense and nondefense caps is irresponsible. Secretary of Defense General Mattis has said: No enemy is more harmful than unpredictable funding from Congress. But it isn’t just defense that has had undependable funding. Not a single agency of the Federal Government knows from one week to another whether they will be funded or what they can do. We have cut down on almost everything that they can do, including travel to places that they absolutely need to be. It is pretty awful. We have had the warnings, yet here we are today with a fifth shortterm continuing resolution. The majority has 238 seats in the Chamber, but it only holds 51 seats in the Senate. They have the ability to draft a partisan agenda, and routinely do. And we just saw that spectacle coming from the Intelligence Committee in the House, when a memo, governed by the majority—and one was acted on and put out for the public—but we are waiting and hoping that the one for the minority will be given the approval by the President of the United States. But for anything, including this bill, to have a chance of getting 60 votes in the Senate and becoming law, you have to involve the Democrats. They don’t have enough over there. Fiftyone is not 60. This is simple math. The minority leader in the Senate has said this proposal is a nonstarter. He added that moving forward with this plan would ‘‘jeopardize the positive discussions going on right now about the budget, immigration, disaster aid, and more.’’ So we know, standing here today, that we are wasting our time. We should finally bring an end to the continuing resolutions and the failed mywayorthehighway approach to governing. That is the only way the majority can fulfill what Speaker RYAN pledged when he took the gavel and said: ‘‘Only a fully functioning House can truly represent the people. And If there were ever a time for us to step up, this would be that time.’’ Mr. Speaker, the American people and the world have watched for months as the greatest democracy ever devised has been defined by its dysfunction. If ever there was one, this is the time for the majority to step up. I am very much concerned, Mr. Speaker, that we are reaching the tipping point. That the dysfunction and chaos displayed not just with the actions of the stock market in the past 3 days, but our inability to really know whether or not we are going to keep the lights on has cost us dearly with respect to the rest of the world. And I need to point out as well, just a few minutes ago, the President of the United States thought that a government shutdown would be a good idea. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleague for being here so that we may move forward on this important funding for the government. Mr. Speaker, from time to time, there are Members of Congress who distinguish themselves in ways that draw not only attention upon an organization more than just themselves, but also distinction. Our next speaker is a gentleman who served for 14 years in the United States Air Force. He holds the record for the fastest nonstop flight ever in the world in one of the United States Air Force planes that is called a B–1 bomber. This gentleman not only served with distinction and honor but is here today to speak about the importance of funding our United States military. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. STEWART ). Mr. STEWART. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for those kind words. Chairman SESSIONS is a hero of mine. There are a lot of reasons why I hold 
him in such high regard. One of the reasons is that he understands a couple of very important things. I think the first thing he understands is that the primary responsibility of the Federal Government is to keep Americans safe in a chaotic world. The second thing he understands is that nothing is more important than thing one. It is for these reasons that I rise in strong support of the rule and the underlying legislation to fund our military. Our inability to constantly fund our Federal Government has real consequences, but it has no greater consequence than it has for our military members. Nothing impacts our military with more devastating effect than the lack of sustained, predictable funding. We need to do what is right for the men and women in uniform charged with defending our country, including, I might add, members of my own family who are deployed, even as we speak. The uncertainty of funding creates problems in the supply chain with regard to everything from large acquisitions to the smallest repair part. It impacts training as funding is needed to lock in major events to include logistical support, movement of personnel and equipment, and access to sufficient types and quantities of munitions. I have spoken with military members, as recently as the last few weeks, who told me about their funding and their training being canceled because of the threat of a government shutdown. It has implications for their safety and their wellbeing. In a letter to Congress last September, Secretary Mattis warned of the consequences: funding through a CR cannot be reprogrammed; training impacts begin immediately, as I have said; and hiring actions and recruiting is curtailed. The bottom line is this: governing by crisis has had an enormous impact on our military, and it is time we do what is right and fully fund our country’s defense. Funding the Department of Defense in the year 2018 will keep Americans safe by boosting our national defense and give a muchneeded pay raise to our troops and an increase in end strength for the Active Duty, Guard, and the Reserve. Let me end with a personal observation. These wings that I proudly wear are my father’s Air Force wings. He was an Air Force pilot in World War II. He had five sons who served in the military. I am proud to say that I was one of them, as Chairman SESSIONS has indicated. As I indicated as well, I have members of my own family who are deployed now, or will deploy in the next year. These young men and women put their lives on the line to serve and to protect our country. For heaven’s sake, let’s give them the funding to do that. Let’s do the right thing. That is why I support this rule and the underlying legislation. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, President Trump said to reporters earlier today that if Congress can’t reach a deal on immigration: ‘‘I’d love to see a shutdown if we can’t get this stuff taken care of. If we have to shut it down because the Democrats don’t want safety . . . let’s shut it down.’’ We are also the people who were accused last week at the State of the Union—because we didn’t show great enthusiasm for his speech—that we were treasonous. It is really pretty frightening to me, Mr. Speaker, what is going on here, and I can’t avoid talking about it. I said earlier in the Rules Committee that I think we are reaching a tipping point, and I honestly do believe that. But this isn’t the first time that President Trump encouraged a government shutdown, which would be devastating. The last one we had was for 16 days and took $24 billion out of this economy. This is remarkable and, I think, pretty sad. The President keeps injecting uncertainty into what already is a chaotic process from the majority. No one in this Chamber is against safety. We are asking them to take action on the bipartisan priorities that have languished while they passed tax cuts for millionaires. In 2016, during an interview with CBS This Morning, President Trump said: ‘‘I’m the king of debt. I’m great with debt. Nobody knows the debt better than me.’’ Well, Mr. Speaker, according to this article from The Washington Post from February 3: ‘‘The U.S. Treasury expects to borrow $955 billion this fiscal year. . . . It’s the highest amount of borrowing in 6 years, and a big jump from the $519 billion the Federal Government borrowed last year.’’ He is definitely the king of debt. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  the article from The Washington Post titled: ‘‘The U.S. Government is set to borrow nearly $1 trillion this year, an 84 percent jump from last year.’’ 
[From the Washington Post, February 3, 2018.] THEU.S. G OVERNMENT ISSETTOBORROW  NEARLY $1 T RILLION THISYEAR, AN84 P ERCENT JUMPFROMLASTYEAR (By Heather Long) It was another crazy news week, so it’s understandable if you missed a small but important announcement from the Treasury Department: The federal government is on track to borrow nearly $1 trillion this fiscal year—Trump’s first full year in charge of the budget. That’s almost double what the government borrowed in fiscal 2017. Here are the exact figures: The U.S. Treasury expects to borrow $955 billion this fiscal year, according to documents released Wednesday. It’s the highest amount of borrowing in six years, and a big jump from the $519 billion the federal government borrowed last year. Treasury mainly attributed, the increase to the ‘‘fiscal outlook.’’ The Congressional Budget Office was more blunt. In a report this week, the CBO said tax receipts are going to be lower because of the new tax law. The uptick in borrowing is yet another complication in the heated debates in Congress over whether to spend more money on infrastructure, the military, disaster relief and other domestic programs. The deficit is already up significantly, even before Congress allots more money to any of these areas. ‘‘We’re addicted to debt,’’ says Marc Goldwein, senior policy director at Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. He blames both parties for the situation. What’s particularly jarring is this is the first time borrowing has jumped this much (as a share of GDP) in a nonrecession time since Ronald Reagan was president, says Ernie Tedeschi, a former senior adviser to the U.S. Treasury who is now head of fiscal analysis at Evercore ISI. Under Reagan, borrowing spiked because of a buildup in the military, something Trump is advocating again. Trump didn’t mention the debt—or the ongoing budget deficits—in his State of the Union address. The absence of any mention of the national debt was frustrating for Goldwein and others who warn that America has a major economic problem looming. ‘‘It is terrible. Those deficits and the debt that keeps rising is a serious problem, not only in the long run, but right now,’’ Harvard economist Martin Feldstein, a former Reagan adviser, told Bloomberg News. The White House got a taste this week of just how problematic this debt situation could get. Investors are concerned about all the additional borrowing and the likelihood of higher inflation, which is why the interest rates on U.S. government bonds hit the highest level since 2014. That, in turn, partly drove the worst weekly selloff in the stock market in two years. The belief in Washington and on Wall Street has long been that the U.S. government could just keep issuing debt because people around the world are eager to buy up this safehaven asset. But there may be a limit to how much the market wants, especially if inflation starts rising and investors prefer to ditch bonds for higherreturning stocks. ‘‘Some of my Wall Street clients are starting to talk recession in 2019 because of these issues. Fiscal policy is just out of control,’’ says Peter Davis, a former tax economist in Congress who now runs Davis Capital Investment Ideas. The Federal Reserve was also buying a lot of U.S. Treasury debt since the crisis, helping to beef up demand. But the Fed recently decided to stop doing that now that the economy has improved. It’s another wrinkle as Treasury has to look for new buyers. Tedeschi, the former Treasury adviser to the Obama administration, calls it ‘‘concerning, but not a crisis.’’ Still, he says it’s a ‘‘big risk’’ to plan on borrowing so much in the coming years. Trump’s Treasury forecasts borrowing more than $1 trillion in 2019 and more than $1.1 trillion in 2020. Before taking office, Trump described himself as the ‘‘king of debt,’’ although he campaigned on reducing the national debt. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget predicts the U.S. deficit will hit $1 trillion by 2019 and stay there for a while. The latest borrowing figure—$955 billion—released this week was determined from a survey of bond market participants, who tend to be even faster to react to the changing policy landscape and change their forecasts. Both parties claim they want to be ‘‘fiscally responsible,’’ but Goldwein says they both pass legislation that adds to the debt. 
Politicians argue this is the last time they’ll pass a bill that makes the deficit worse, but so far, they just keep going. The latest example of largesse is the GOP tax bill. It’s expected to add $1 trillion or more to the debt, according to nonpartisan analysis from the Joint Committee on Taxation (and yes, that’s after accounting for some increased economic growth). But even before that, Goldwein points to the 2015 extension of many tax cuts and the 2014 delays in Medicare reimbursement cuts. ‘‘Every time you feed your addiction, you grow your addiction,’’ says Goldwein. There doesn’t seem to be any appetite for budgetary restraint in Washington, but the market may force Congress’s hand. 
Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, we did hear in the State of the Union that we will be asking for $1.5 trillion for infrastructure. Given the $1.5 trillion that we have already started borrowing for to give the top 1 percent a great tax cut that would be permanent, I am not sure anybody will finance that request. And, frankly, taking on that amount of debt would mean that almost everything else that we do in the country would take a back seat, or even further behind than back. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I would like to acknowledge, also, Mr. STEWART ’s service to the United States Air Force and this country. Mr. Speaker, I had an opportunity to talk with a security officer from Pearl Harbor, Lieutenant Kevin Fahland. Lieutenant Fahland essentially told me: We are out in the middle of the Pacific faced with danger every day, and we represent the greatest Nation in the history of the world. Please do us a favor and recognize that we need the funding to continue what is an aggressive race against us. He is a lieutenant in the Navy, a security officer, who sees firsthand the attack, all sorts of ways, at Pearl Harbor that happens every day, and it is his job to protect this great Nation. I want to thank the lieutenant and other members of the United States Navy and the United States military for their service. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS ) from the Rules Committee. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, we are here today considering a continuing resolution that will provide dollars for the Federal Government and our national defense, but it also will finally accomplish reauthorization of funding for several important healthcare programs. These extensions are long overdue, and I urge Members to support this legislation so that our Nation’s healthcare providers will have stability to continue their normal operations. The House passed many of these provisions last November. That is when we passed the Championing Healthy Kids Act. However, since House passage, the legislation has been stalled without action in the Senate. Fortunately, the Children’s Health Insurance Program was reauthorized in the last continuing resolution. It seems like a long time ago, but it was only 3 weeks ago. However, we did not complete the public health or Medicare extenders. The continuing resolution that we are debating today includes funding for other important healthcare programs, such as community health centers, the National Health Service Corps, and Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education, all of which expired at the end of September. b1530 The continuing resolution provides a 2year extension of funding for federally qualified health centers. One in 13 individuals nationwide relies upon a community health center to receive necessary healthcare services. The Community Health Center Fund plays an important role in supplementing the services that the federally qualified health centers are able to deliver to underserved communities by providing care to all Americans, regardless of their income or their ability to pay. The legislation we are considering also includes a 2year extension of other important public health programs, including funding for the National Health Service Corps, the FamilytoFamily Information Centers, the Personal Responsibility Education Program, the Special Diabetes Program for Type 1 Diabetes, and the Special Diabetes Program for American Indians. The package also delays the $5 billion in cuts to many hospitals in many of our districts across the country from the Affordable Care Actmandated Medicaid disproportionate share hospital reductions for the fiscal years 2018 and 2019. I am certain that other Members have heard from their hospitals, as have I; hospitals in our districts whose ability to remain open and operational and continue to provide care could be jeopardized by these cuts in the socalled DSH payments. This delays but does not fix a problem that ObamaCare created for safety net hospitals that provide care to citizens of our country who most need this care. The committee is committed to continuing to work on this, but this 2 year extension is important. The bill also includes important Medicare extenders. The extension of the ground ambulance services and cost reporting requirements will allow our emergency responders in urban, rural, and superrural areas another 5 years of certainty in receiving their addon payments. Similarly, home health providers will receive a 5year extension of their rural addon Medicare payments, and certain lowvolume hospitals will continue to receive the payment adjustment for an additional 2 years. This health extenders package permanently repeals a provision in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. This provision sought to cap Medicarecovered outpatient therapy services, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speechlanguage pathology. The cap was never fully put into effect, but repealing the therapy caps will allow for certainty and stability for Medicare beneficiaries and providers of these services. Many of us have heard about the importance of repealing the cap. One of my priorities as chairman of the Health Subcommittee has been to improve the value of our electronic health records for doctors and for patients. Electronic health records have promise to streamline the sharing of data amongst patients and their doctors, but they have not yet fully lived up to this promise. Adoption of electronic health records is growing, but the meaningful use program, as established in the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, has burdened providers with stringent requirements. In an effort to reduce that burden, this bill we are considering today removes the mandate that the Secretary of Health and Human Services make the meaningful use standards more stringent over time. I believe we have squeezed all the blood we can out of this turnip, and it is time to let our doctors be doctors. This will permit the Department to evaluate in other ways. Lastly, this package contains important provisions that aim to improve care for individuals suffering from chronic diseases. The Senate has already passed these provisions in their CHRONIC Care Act. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas. Mr. BURGESS. One of the most important pieces of this package is the extension of the Independence At Home Medical Practice Demonstration Program, which allows participating high need Medicare beneficiaries who have multiple chronic conditions to receive Medicare coverage for homebased primary care. This program is currently in its fifth year and has been found to save Medicare dollars, but Medicare needs more time to evaluate the overall effectiveness of the program. This health extenders package has responsible offsets. One of these offsets would allow for Medicare reimbursement of outpatient physical therapy or occupational therapy services provided by a therapy assistant. These providers are reimbursed at 85 percent of the physician rate, and therapy assistants must have a State license and abide by Medicare supervision requirements. Additionally, lottery winnings and other lump sum income of over $80,000 would count toward income eligibility under Medicaid’s modified adjusted gross income rules. In certain cases, individuals could remain eligible if being ineligible would lead to undue medical or financial hardship. Similar to the Championing Healthy Kids Act, this bill modifies the level of funding in the Prevention and Public 
Health Fund. By law, this fund is required to receive $2.5 billion in annual appropriations, which must be used for prevention, wellness, and public health initiatives administered by the Department of Health and Human Services. If Congress does not direct the funds toward specific efforts, the Secretary of Health and Human Services has the authority to spend the dollars however he or she deems fit. While we are redirecting these taxpayer dollars, the overarching purpose of the fund is still there to improve the health and wellness of Americans through existing mechanisms, and community health centers will do just that. With this spending offset, we are using the Prevention and Public Health Fund for what is intended: investing in America’s wellbeing. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up H.R. 3440, the Dream Act. This bipartisan, bicameral legislation would help hundreds of thousands of young people who are American in every way except on paper. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the amendment in the RECORD , along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from New York? There was no objection. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. NAPOLITANO ) to discuss our proposal. Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, DREAMers embody our American ideals, our values, and everything we hold dear. They are proud servicemembers, students, teachers, healthcare workers, first responders, and entrepreneurs. The DACA program has allowed many of them to build a life here and make positive, significant contributions to the U.S. economy and their communities. DACA recipients, in fact, earn higher wages and will contribute an estimated $460 billion to the U.S. GDP over the next decade. It is no wonder employers and corporate America are demanding a solution. The economic case for passing the Dream Act is strong. It is not just the right thing to do for our economy, though; it is the right thing to do, period. H.R. 3440, the Dream Act, builds on these great successes and honors our history and our heritage, as we are a proud nation of immigrants from all over the world. Poll after poll reflects overwhelming support for allowing the DREAMers to remain permanently in the United States. Nearly 8 out of 10 voters, including almost threequarters of Trump voters, agree on this. Only 14 percent believe they should be forced to leave. The faith community is also imploring Congress to do what is the right, compassionate, and just thing. Just this morning, I met with the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, who said this is about human dignity and how we treat people. They understand the weight of our inaction and indecisiveness. Anxiety and hopelessness continue to grow as the President dithers. We are now less than 1 month away from the end of the 6month period set by President Trump to fix the mess he created. No more delaying. No more inaction. DREAMers kept their promise to the only Nation they know and love. Our government must honor its commitment to protect them and their families. Mr. Speaker, this is the 20th time we have asked for a vote on the clean Dream Act. All we are asking for is a vote. Give us a vote so we can give young immigrants, their families, their employers, their teachers, their coworkers, and friends some certainty and peace of mind. I ask my colleagues to vote against the previous question so that we can immediately bring DREAMers and the Dream Act to the floor and finally do what is right for our young people and for our country. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. It is amazing how the President, by honing the message and focusing his ideas on Congress, has brought this entire issue to a forefront. Last year, the President said: I am calling on Congress to please resolve this issue with the DACA people who are in this country. I am asking Congress to please do this by next March. Now he is being treated—instead of like a firefighter, he is being treated like an arsonist; and he is not. He is the person who has the ability and the desire to lead Congress, on a bipartisan basis; lots of meetings down at the White House. For months now that has been happening, with the date of March. What happens? Somebody gets frustrated and they want not what we agreed to do in March, but they want it in January— actually, December, rather than attempting to work with the President, who, I believe, forthrightly, has held lots of meetings. So, Mr. Speaker, what I would say to you is that it is a moving target. There is never something that this President can do that will satisfy our colleagues on the other side. If it is not DACA, it is going to be the caps issue. If it is not the caps issue, it is going to be the military issue. If it is not the military issue, it is going to be Children’s Health Insurance Program. Mr. Speaker, we are addressing those. We are trying to bring those issues professionally, on a bipartisan basis. Just a week ago—10 days ago, we respectfully did not include yearlong funding for the United States military. What did we hear back over and over and over from the other body? They said: Well, I would have voted for this bill, but the funding for the military is not in there for a 1year basis for the remainder of the year. So that is what we have done. We are trying to bring forth ideas of agreement that say we need to find a deal. We need to come to an agreement. We recognize this is not the last funding agreement for the year, but what we are trying to do is to avoid a government shutdown. The way you do that is by voting ‘‘yes,’’ and that is what we are asking people to do today. That is why we had Dr. BURGESS . That is why we had Major CHRIS STEWART, the United States Congressman from Utah. That is also why we have the gentleman from Waterford Township, Michigan, here, a member of the Republican leadership, a bright, young, thoughtful, articulate man. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. MITCHELL). Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I think everyone can agree here that continuing resolutions—CRs—are bad policy. For the folks in the gallery, it is simple. CRs are whether we keep the lights on or not. They are whether you can call Social Security and get assistance. They are whether you can figure out what is going on with your taxes, call the IRS. They are whether or not we actually function. Yes, it is going to be our fifth CR. Shame on all of us, and I do mean all of us. However, the people on the other side of the aisle, they talk about all their legislative agenda they want put in the package and passed or they are going to vote against keeping the lights on. Think about that. They say: If we don’t get DACA, we are shutting the lights off. If we don’t get this, we will shut the lights off. That is what happened in the Senate the last shutdown. They say: If we don’t get fullyear funding for the military, we are shutting the lights off. If we don’t get DACA, we are shutting the lights off. If we don’t get permanent funding for CHIP, we are shutting the lights off. It didn’t work out very well, did it? Our fundamental responsibility is to keep the lights on. There is nothing in this bill that is objectionable. In fact, they have all passed. This bill supports fullyear funding for the Department of Defense appropriations. This isn’t the first time we passed the appropriations bill for the Department of Defense. We have passed it three times. And we sent it to the Senate to die a cruel and horrible death. Why? Not because, as was noted by my colleague, that we can’t get 51 votes. We can’t get 60 votes. And where do those votes come from? On the other side of the aisle, who will do anything to get their agenda, 
including putting our military at risk. People die when we make those decisions, and they have. b1545 The funding is fully consistent with the NDAA, National Defense Authorization Act, something that was a bipartisan vote. It provides a 2.4 percent increase to the men and women in the military who put their lives on the line for our Nation, well deserved, something we also voted for and supported. The bill provides full extensions for popular health programs that, in fact, both sides of the aisle supported, a 2 year extension of community health centers. In Michigan, federally qualified health centers serve nearly 650,000 individuals. There are 11 health centers located in my congressional district. They need the funding. That is why I support it. In all of your districts, you have community health centers. But you will argue: Unless we get DACA, we won’t fund the military; we won’t fund the health centers. This bill also extends Medicare policies, providing options for people receiving home care. Again, it was a bipartisan vote, but now we don’t want to support it. I believe we shouldn’t continue the habit of shortterm spending bills. They are offensive to me; they truly are. We passed, in September, in this House, all 12 appropriations bills and sent them to the Senate. My suggestion to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle is, rather than lecture us about math—I can count to 60. I can get between 51 and 60. I suggest you make a phone call to some of your colleagues in the Senate and tell them to do their job and bring up the appropriations bills. If they don’t like what they are, amend them, go to conference, rather than just obstruct the functioning of our government. The most fundamental responsibility we have is to keep the lights on, is to defend this Nation. If we are not doing that, I have to wonder what we are doing for a job. So I suggest we pass this bill here, we send it to the Senate. And may I suggest that someone on the other side of the aisle make a phone call and ask if they want to see how Schumer shutdown part 2 goes—their choice. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. BERGMAN ). Members are reminded to refrain from referring to occupants in the gallery and also reminded to direct their remarks to the Chair. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds to say that I would not come to the floor if I were in the majority and lecture the minority when the majority runs the House, the Senate, and the White House and accuse us of shutting down the House or not producing the votes. We don’t have enough votes in the first place. That is why we are the minority. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DOGGETT ), the distinguished ranking member of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Tax Policy. Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, it was all only a dream, a dream that Speaker RYANwould permit this House to work its will and have a vote to secure the future of our DREAMers, America DREAMers, who Trump one day condemns as ‘‘illegal,’’ then says he ‘‘loves,’’ and then goes off on some racist rant. Congress, in fact, has been hijacked by 28 percent of the Members who sit here. Applying the rule that the only thing this House can vote on is whatever a majority of the majority want us to vote on and blocking everything else is what creates the problem that we face today. A minority of this House can say we will not ever get to vote on the DREAMers or any other number of other issues under the procedures that are being applied here. And even if 72 percent of this body want to seek a bipartisan resolution to a matter, we cannot do it under the rules that are being applied. So what has happened since the Trump shutdown three weeks ago? What has been done to secure the future of our DREAMers? What has been done to fulfill the promise that was made of action on our DREAMers? Absolutely nothing, zero, zilch—nothing to resolve this problem, and not even the prospect of action here in the House. Last week I met again with DREAMers in Texas: a county prosecutor who enforces our local and state laws, a teacher, a nurse, students—powerful, emotional stories that they tell—and their employers who are uncertain about their ability to continue providing the services that they provide. Just as Congress has been hijacked by a few Republican extremists, these DREAMers have been hijacked, and the only question is: What is the price to solve their problem, our problem? That price grows by the day. The ransom that is being demanded daybyday goes up a little bit higher amidst all of the antiimmigrant hysteria. It is not difficult to resolve this issue. It could have been resolved before President Trump ever issued his illbegotten proclamation in September. And since I represent a city that is proud to call itself ‘‘Military City,’’ San Antonio, Texas, I find particularly obnoxious the attempt to pit the security of our DREAMers against the security of our country. It ignores, for example, the fact that a number of DREAMers are putting their lives on the line for us in the United States military. And what could be more harmful to taxpayers and the future of our country than to continue to budget week byweek, monthbymonth? Of course, I am impressed by the number of Republicans who get up here and tell us: Oh, we just hate these continuing resolutions. Well, if they hate them, why do they keep doing them? We are on number five. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. HULTGREN ). The time of the gentleman has expired. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Texas an additional 1 minute. Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, what we have is an incredible amount of bungling, no fiscal responsibility in doing this week by week, month by month. And the discussion of there being a government shutdown, turning the lights out, well, the only person who has called for a government shutdown was Donald Trump back in May, and then he reiterated his call this afternoon for a government shutdown. I think he and the Republican intransigents, the ability to block votes here in the House by a minority—28 percent, almost onefourth of the people who are here to block a vote—is what led to the last Trump shutdown. And by casting our vote ‘‘no’’ today, it is not only about the DREAMers, but it is the only way that we who do not have a majority can speak out and say that this fiscal mismanagement has to stop once and for all. We are tired of taxpayers being charged more money for all kinds of services and products the government procures just because this problem is not solved. Fulfill the dream. Fulfill responsibility for the taxpayers. Vote against this resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, a year or so ago, I received a rather urgent phone call from Dr. Shelley Hall from Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas and Dr. Rick Snyder from Medical City in Dallas, which are hospitals, and they spoke with me about a change in the law some year and some ago that would change infusion therapy. What is infusion therapy? It involves administering medication through a needle or a catheter, which is prescribed when a patient’s condition is so severe that it cannot be treated effectively by oral medications, meaning, through this needle or the opportunity for a catheter. What happened was there was a change in the law that did not fully fund this effort. ‘‘Home infusion’’ means, instead of having to receive this in the hospital, which is more expensive, they would be able to do this at home, and the doctor would manage that. As a result of the change in some law and funding levels, that stopped the patients from being able to do this at home. I want to congratulate KEVIN BRADY , the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, for working not only with these doctors, but also with me on this insistence that we go and review this, 
an opportunity for more effective healthcare and cost effective from the perspective of not only the patient, but also to make sure that physicians would stay involved in the health of their patients. I would like to thank Dr. Shelley Hall of Baylor University Medical Center and Dr. Rick Snyder, both from Dallas, Texas, for working with me to make sure that this change happened today. This is one of the pages of the changes that we are making today, to go in and offer some corrections and to update and extend the privileges that we have in this country to have the greatest healthcare system in the world. I want to thank Chairman BRADY for his work, and his staff, to make sure this was involved in this change today. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON  LEE). Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me time. Mr. Speaker, I associate myself, and I think it is important for my colleagues and the American people to know, that this body, this government, this Congress, is controlled by one party: the Presidency, the House, and the Senate. Just a few minutes ago, the President of the United States called for a shutdown. I am shocked. I am not calling for anything but relief. I am delighted that the gentleman from Dallas was able to craft a support system for infusion therapy, but it goes to show you who controls this place. I don’t know what Democrat could get any additions to this particular CR. It is not an appropriation. It is not an authorization bill. I am just on the floor begging for what my colleagues, both Republicans and Democrats from Texas, have been asking for but my Republican House has not been able to produce, or the Senate. When I say that, we have not been able to produce a disaster supplemental bill that is going to respond to the needs of those who are still suffering. Harris County covers 1,778 square miles. It can fit New York City, Philadelphia, Boston, Chicago, Seattle, Austin, and Dallas, with room still to spare; 41,500 square miles of land mass impacted by Hurricane Harvey and the subsequent flooding that covered an area larger than the States of Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont, combined. This is not puffery. It is to show you the depth of devastation. Hurricane Harvey dropped 21 trillion gallons of water on Texas and Louisiana, most of it on the Houston metroplex. 51.88 inches of rain fell near Cedar Bayou, and at the peak, on September 1, onethird of Houston was underwater. Our headlines: Hurricane Harvey Recovery Goes Ignored in Washington Yet Again; Republicans Controlling Every Phase of Government; After Harvey, Houstonians Eye Long Road to Recovery; After Harvey, Houstonians Have Long Road; Houses Down on the Ground; Long Road to Recovery; Senior Citizens Suffering; Suffering from Health Conditions. And you can see, here is the basic point: There is no reason why Republicans joining with Democrats cannot, one, have an $81 billion supplemental that goes up. It is not enough. But it is the administration that has cut into our very life by giving us a skinny disaster aid supplemental. I am looking for the Senate to plus it up because this is not enough. In this bill, if you want to know why we are voting ‘‘no,’’ it doesn’t exist. Where is the disaster emergency supplemental money that is needed? I left my office with six members of local officials in my office. They were telling me about the depression of so many in Texas who do not have the resources. They don’t have the housing money. The infrastructure money has not come. Mold is there. They have bad health. And these are examples of their situation. This is what the rescues look like. This is, of course, what the water looked like. And this gentleman was walking in the water. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Texas an additional 2 minutes. Ms. JACKSON LEE. This is a house that is evidenced by those impacted by the hurricane. This is a house of someone who is still waiting for that house to be rebuilt. Finally, the city council, wanting to be responsive—and I thank them—has lifted the permitting to allow trailers. Our people are begging now for trailers. Most people don’t beg for trailers. We are begging for trailers in urban Houston because people have nowhere to live. This is a disgrace. I am not making this personal, but we flooded on August 27. It is now, today, February 6. There is no reason why this Republican administration has not been able to work. And all these additional addendums on this CR should have been done in a bipartisan effort. We support infusion therapy. We support federally qualified health clinics. But you are taking money from prevention. We support CHIP, but you are taking money from prevention and other things. This is not the way to do, one, spending; it is not the way to provide for national security; it is not the way to provide for the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of State, Department of Justice, law enforcement. We are not doing any of that. b1600 And then there are 140,000 DREAMers in my State. Some of them are impacted by Hurricane Harvey. And let me make mention of the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Florida, and California. I am not in any way diminishing their pain. They are likewise suffering. So if the American people want to know what the ‘‘noes’’ are about, the ‘‘noes’’ are because those who are in charge are not doing anything. By the way, DREAMers are part of those who sought to rescue many who were stranded in Houston. We lost a DREAMer who traveled all the way from Dallas to provide rescue and he died. He died because he loved this country. He died because he loved his neighbors. Yet we cannot get that fixed, but we cannot help our neighbors get the dollars that they need. If you want to know why there is a ‘‘no’’ vote, it is because it is long overdue for our friends to do the real work that needs to be done, and to do disaster supplemental funding and do it right. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  two articles from the Houston Chronicle. 
[From the Houston Chronicle, Oct. 26, 2017] HOUSTON ISD S CHOOLS WITHMOSTDISPLACED  STUDENTS AFTER HURRICANE HARVEY  (By Shelby Webb) More than 1300 Houston ISD students are displaced or homeless after Hurricane Harvey, according to records the district submitted to the Texas Education Agency. That number is likely to change after the TEA changed how districts should categorize displaced students and as Houston ISD shores up its own internal estimates. But initial data shows four of the 10 schools with the largest numbers of displaced students are located in Southwest Houston, three in Meyerland alone. Two magnet schools—Carnegie Vanguard High School and Lamar High School—also saw large numbers of their students affected by Harvey’s floods. Houston ISD Superintendent Richard Carranza required that all teachers go through crisis and trauma training during the first semester of the year to better help students who are dealing with Harveyrelated fears and losses. Across the Houston area, more than 10,700 students have been displaced by Hurricane Harvey, according to data reported to the TEA and given to the Chronicle by 16 local school districts. But that number does not include estimates for how many students are displaced in some of the area’s largest school districts, including the CypressFairbanks, Spring and Pearland ISDs. Katy ISD had the most students affected by the storm with 2,862. Tiny Stafford MSD had the least, with 32 students displaced by the storm. 
[From the Houston Chronicle, Dec. 6, 2017] TOPHEALTH OFFICIAL VIEWS HARVEY  RECOVERY EFFORTS  (By Mike Hixenbaugh) Dr. Brenda Fitzgerald, the head of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, spent most of the day receiving briefings from officials at Harris County Public Health, which has been on the front lines helping residents cope following the historic flooding. Later, Fitzgerald visited a mobile wellness unit in Galena Park, where county health 
workers provided residents of the floodravaged community in southeast Harris County with free immunizations, cleaning supplies, bug spray, canned food and other services. Now Playing: Level of help to expect for Harvey flood recovery Harris County dispatched the mobile health units to more 3o locations in the weeks following the hurricane, part of a broader effort to help residents care for themselves in the midst of the devastation. Fitzgerald said she’s been monitoring the county’s efforts closely and wanted to see them firsthand. ‘‘I wanted to come and see how it’s going,’’ Fitzgerald said, ‘‘and also to see what else we can do to make sure Houston recovers totally.’’ Although Harvey’s true toll on public health is still being calculated, Fitzgerald said the CDC is committed to providing Texas with whatever resources are needed to grapple with the aftermath. The visit comes days after the Kaiser Family Foundation released a sweeping survey that found 17 percent of those who had houses damaged or suffered income loss reported that someone in their household has developed a new or worsening health condition. Chronic respiratory ailments resulting from mold and stressrelated mental health struggles are of particular concern after flooding, health officials said, as well as the threat of mosquitoborne illnesses and other infectious diseases. Fitzgerald said she was impressed by the resiliency of residents and public health workers she met, some of whom manned mobile health clinics just days after losing their homes to flooding. ‘‘The work goes on,’’ Fitzgerald said. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in opposition to Rules Committee Print 115–58, legislation extending the Continuing Resolution now in effect for an additional five weeks, or until March 23, 2018. But before I proceed further, I want to note—and Americans needs to know—that this is not a spending bill; it is instead an affirmation of the House Republicans’ inability to govern. This is the fifth time House Republicans have chosen to kick the can down the road rather than work with Democrats to come to a necessary bipartisan agreement to lift the Budget Control Act (BCA) spending caps, giving appropriators the direction they need for fullyear funding bills. The reason given for passing each of the prior Continuing Resolutions was that the extra time was needed to reach a comprehensive agreement to fund government operations in a fair and balanced way. Yet, even with the extra time, House Republicans made no progress during any of the previous extensions. This should not be surprising; the House GOP is carrying the water for the president, who a few months ago said ‘‘we need a big beautiful shutdown.’’ Mr. Speaker, I cannot support a CR that does not include full funding for disaster recovery, extends additional health access for veterans, provides funding to combat the opioid epidemic, and protects pensions. Most important, it is outrageous that House Republicans would bring to the floor and request support for a fifth CR extension that does not address and resolve the crisis the Republican Administration has inflicted on 800,000 Dreamers and their families, including 124,000 Dreamers in my home state of Texas. Instead of acting responsibly to address these issues and fund the government for the remainder of the fiscal year, House Republicans continue wasting time. This is not appropriations; this is a stopgap funding measure to save ourselves from collapse. Although the funding bill before us makes a feeble attempt to address numerous expired or expiring health priorities, it fails to reauthorize several key programs including the Maternal Infant and Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV) and Health Professional Opportunity Grant (HPOG) programs. Just as bad, this legislation is paid for the package with partisan offsets, such as cuts to the Prevention and Public Health Fund before ending the Prevention and Public Health Fund in 2027. Mr. Speaker, another reason that this bill should be passed in its present form is that it includes the same Department of Defense appropriations bill that the House passed on January 30, 2018, which increases defense spending by $73 billion more than the $549 billion allowed under the current BCA defense cap and provides $75 billion in additional discretionary funding designated for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO). As a consequence, if this bill becomes law it would eliminate any chance for a bipartisan budget cap agreement for this year. For months, Democrats have sought an agreement on the discretionary spending caps that provides parity for both defense and non defense appropriations bills, both of which are critical to our nation’s security. Rather than negotiate a cap agreement that would pave the way for a defense appropriations bill to become law, Republicans are placing a bill on the floor that will exempt itself from the BCA defense cap’s sequestration. This bill is the fifth example of Republicans rejecting bipartisan compromise. Mr. Speaker, despite controlling the House, Senate, and the White House, Republicans have not funded the government for the entire year, even though we are already four months into the fiscal year. Democrats, meanwhile, have done the work with which we were tasked. I am a member of the Budget committee and we Democrats proposed a budget that: 1. Respected the needs of all Americans, including those who serve bravely in the Department of Defense; 2. Honored the sacrifice of our heroes in uniform; 3. Protected programs like CHIP, made investments in infrastructure and ensured that Americans have access to quality healthcare. Because Republicans refuse to work with Democrats and compromise on how to provide relief from the BCA’s sequester level spending caps, they are lurching from CR to CR—degrading the readiness of our military and preventing government agencies from properly serving the American people. This is not a responsible way to govern; therefore, I cannot support this bill, especially when there still remains millions of Americans still coping with the devastating effects of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and wildfires in California. The ninecounty Houston metro area impacted by Hurricane Harvey covers 9,444 square miles, an area larger than five states, including New Hampshire, New Jersey and Connecticut. Harris County covers 1,778 square miles, enough space to fit New York City, Philadelphia, Boston, Chicago, Seattle, Austin and Dallas, with room still to spare. There was over 41,500 square miles of land mass impacted by Hurricane Harvey and the subsequent flooding that covered an area larger than the States of Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont combined. Hurricane Harvey dropped 21 trillion gallons of water on Texas and Louisiana, most of it on the Houston Metroplex and the 51.88 inches of rain that fell near Cedar Bayou is the highest total ever recorded for a single U.S. weather event. At its peak on September 1, 2017, onethird of Houston was underwater. At the peak on August 31, there were 34,575 evacuees in shelters across Texas. Hurricane Harvey is the largest housing disaster to strike the U.S. in our nation’s history. Hurricane Harvey damaged 203,000 homes, of which 12,700 were destroyed. Mr. Speaker, people are living in homes with mold. As recently as this past November, nearly 19,000 hotel rooms in over 1,500 hotels were still occupied by persons displaced by Hurricane Harvey. Thousands of others with severe damage to their homes are living with family or friends. 889,425 people have registered for assistance with the Federal Emergency Management Agency. As of December 5, 2017, more than 632,000 individuals or households in metro Houston had submitted valid registrations for FEMA’s Individual and Households Program (IHP) and 249,259 registrations were approved for $1.0 billion in assistance. And because of Republican unwillingness to compromise or govern competently, disaster victims in my congressional district and all across the affected areas are still waiting for the disaster funding assistance they desperately need. House Republicans need to work across the aisle with Democrats and get our work done— including. upholding the longstanding precedent of agreeing to parity when providing relief from sequester caps. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I appreciate the gentlewoman’s advocacy because, in many respects, I feel the same way. But I would offer, in speaking to you, Mr. Speaker, that you made sure this House passed the $81 billion spending bill on October 12 last year. The House of Representatives, through the leadership of not only Speaker RYAN, but also the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN ) were tasked with the duty of making sure that we would take feedback from States, from cities, and came up with a figure of $81 billion. That is not in any way not living up to our responsibility, Mr. Speaker. We are the ones who did this—this whole body. It is stuck in the United States Senate, and the President and this administration have not been authorized to spend more than what has been appropriated. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. SESSIONS. I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. JACKSON LEE. The gentleman, we have worked together. Mr. SESSIONS. And continue to right now. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I think the important point is that this has to be a collective effort of the administration and the bodies of the House and the Senate. The only point that I would make is that the administration has not sent forward—yes, the $81 billion—but we are not moving it in the Senate. The administration has not been engaged actively to say that they want to help the people who are impacted, and they have a skinny impact or skinny impression of what we need of $81 billion for all of the disaster areas. And, of course, Mr. SESSIONS , my good friend, understands that $1 trillion tax cut does not help us in getting the increased disaster money. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time because the gentlewoman is going to switch subjects. I would tell the gentlewoman that the House, respectfully, before we got to any tax cut bill, made sure that we did a constitutionally responsible thing, and that was to make sure that we measured three times, sawed once, came up with the $81 billion. It is, in my opinion, something that the United States Senate needs to solve. I would also add that I don’t know what the Democratic Party is doing over there to push this issue. I think it needs to be an important attribute. But we are waiting for the Senate, Mr. Speaker. And for us to blame both houses, I think, is not fair to the leadership that PAULRYANhas provided, to the leadership that RODNEY FRELING HUYSEN has contributed to this effort, and most of all, Mr. Speaker, to the people who voted for the bill in the House. They did the responsible action. And I think that if we are going to do anything, we need to look to the United States Senate, which is constitutionally required. President Trump and Vice President PENCE not only visited the ravaged areas, but they tried to provide the leadership. But it is up to the constitutional provisions of the United States Senate, and that is where the problem lies. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I have heard the majority speak with great urgency today about the need to pass the continuing resolution. But where was this urgency from the majority for the last 5 months of this fiscal year? They were so consumed with providing tax breaks to the wealthy and corporations that they ignored virtually everything else. This was a bill that was sold as a middle class tax cut. But 83 percent of the tax cuts go to the wealthiest 1 percent; and for corporations, the tax breaks are permanent. For individuals, they are sunsetted. Speaker RYAN, over the weekend, promoted the fact that a secretary in Pennsylvania received an extra $1.50 a week under the tax scam. That is $78 a year for her. You can see what the middle class actually got. But compare that with the wealthy. One analysis found that the Koch brothers and their corporate empire could save between $1 billion and $1.4 billion combined in income taxes every year as a result of the tax law. It is important to remember that this is a permanent cut. It was a bill written for the rich to help the rich. It spends money we don’t have, while adding $1.5 trillion to the deficit. That is such a staggering amount that the Congressional Budget Office said last week that because of this tax bill, our government now is expected to run out of money sooner than anticipated. The deadline to raise the debt ceiling has now been moved from early April to midMarch. Only during the Second World War was our debt as a percentage of gross domestic product higher than it is today. I hope we can forever end the myth that the majority is the party of fiscal discipline. The situation we are in today is a direct result of the majority prioritizing the wealthy over doing the most basic functions of keeping the government running. And now, after ignoring Democrats as this bill was drafted, they expect us to fall in line and support a flawed proposal. That is not how it works. If they want our support, they need to work with us. And Democrats have been clear: We cannot afford to keep kicking the can down the road. It is past time for a longterm bill that addresses urgent national priorities. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the previous question, on the rule, and the bill. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, how much time remains? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 4
of total new budget authority for the first fiscal year to be exceeded, or would cause revenues to be less than the level of total revenues for the first fiscal year or for the total of that first fiscal year and the ensuing fiscal years for which allocations are provided. A waiver of clause 10 of rule XXI, which prohibits the consideration of a bill if it has the net effect of increasing mandatory spending over the fiveyear or tenyear period. The material previously referred to by Ms. SLAUGHTER is as follows: 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to rule IX, I rise to a question of the privileges of the House, and I send to the desk a privileged resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the resolution. The Clerk read as follows: 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does the gentlewoman from California wish to present argument on the parliamentary question of whether the resolution presents a question of the privileges of the House? Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I do. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman is recognized on the question of order. b1645 Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I wish to explain why the House should consider this privileged resolution. Mr. Speaker, Members of Congress take an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States and protect the American people. The House majority and its leadership have abandoned that duty. It is imperative that the House vote to release the Democratic memo to set the record straight on Republicans’ attempts to undermine the Russian investigation. It is also important to note that who knows what they have next. The majority’s decision to release highly classified and distorted intelligence is profoundly dangerous and gives a bouquet to Putin. As the Department of Justice warned, the public

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 727, the motion shall be debatable for 1 hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Appropriations. The gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN ) and the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. LOWEY ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, for the fifth time since last fall, I rise today to present another continuing resolution, the House amendment to Senate amendment to H.R. 1892, to fund the operations of the Federal Government through March 23, fund the Department of Defense for the rest of fiscal year 2018, and extend critical healthcare programs, including funding for community health centers. Our current continuing resolution expires on Thursday, and without this legislation, large segments of the Federal Government will shut down again. Of course, all of us are keenly aware that more time is needed for our leaders in the House, the Senate, and the White House to negotiate overall funding levels for the 2018 fiscal year. This bill should allow that to happen. Mr. Speaker, this continuing resolution also makes a very limited number of technical changes in funding levels for only the most essential needs, including: To prevent delays in preparation for the 2020 Census; To ensure that the judicial branch is able to pay jurors; To provide $225 million in emergency funding for the Small Business Administration to provide emergency loans to those whose lives and livelihoods were destroyed by last year’s historic natural disasters. This legislation also includes the full fiscal year 2018 Department of Defense Appropriations bill, totaling $659 billion for our Armed Forces. And I don’t have to remind my colleagues that this bill has already passed this House three times on a bipartisan basis—most recently, last week. Mr. Speaker, we ask a great deal of our men and women in uniform, and we have an obligation to provide them and their families the resources they need to be safe, to complete their missions successfully at home and abroad. Governing from CR to CR just creates more unpredictability, more instability, and has reallife consequences for both our troops and civilians who support them. Mr. Speaker, the challenges we face around the world cannot be met under this Federal CR stopandgo process. While we delay doing the Nation’s business, our military and economic competitors are consolidating their gains. Finally, I would add, this legislation includes necessary funding extensions for bipartisan health priorities like community health centers and other public health programs. It also funds important Medicare extenders and includes commonsense reforms and improvements in the program. But let no one doubt our position on continuing resolutions. They are bad fiscal policy. They do not allow programs to grow, to be reduced or eliminated, if that is needed. They maintain outdated policies and stop new, critically important programs from ever starting, including programs that enhance national security and protect our Armed Forces from our enemies. Continuing resolutions are fiscally wasteful and prevent the executive branch and Congress from planning and preparing, and this is true for the private sector as well. Most importantly, they undermine congressional oversight that is constitutionally mandated for our appropriations. While I am pleased that we are here to include the Defense Appropriations 
bill in this continuing resolution, we must still pass all 12 appropriations bills for the 2018 fiscal year, as well as our third emergency disaster supplemental. As soon as congressional and White House leaders reach a bipartisan agreement, which could and should happen at any moment, our committee will get to work immediately to finish negotiations on all 12 yearlong funding bills. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Since President Trump’s draconian FY 2018 budget was released last year, Democrats have warned Republicans that a bipartisan budget agreement was needed to adequately invest in American families and communities. Without a budget agreement, programs as diverse as Head Start, job training, and terrorism prevention grants are in danger of inadequate funding, at best. Instead of engaging with Democrats to reach a budget agreement, the majority is seeking to advance a full year of funding for only the Department of Defense, busting budget caps, while punting every other Federal service and investment to an uncertain future. Mr. Speaker, the most powerful country in the world now being completely run by a Republican government can’t keep the lights on more than weeks at a time. How did we get here? Democrats will not go along with any plan that neglects critical national security and domestic needs. If this bill were to become law, the majority would have no workable plan to make the investments that are necessary for priorities, including biomedical research, infrastructure projects, Pell Grants, homeland security, assistance for local communities, veterans health, opioid funding, job training, the FBI, and other Federal law enforcement and more. This is not a serious bill. We know that it will be quickly rejected by the Senate. It is the furthest possible cry from regular order that the majority so frequently discusses yet rarely follows. It is nothing more than a political ploy that will place us on the brink of another shutdown. b1730 It is well past time to increase budget caps and enact responsible spending bills. The majority displays a lack of urgency regarding reaching a budget agreement and enacting appropriations law, choosing instead to advance partisan measures that fail to lift unmanageable budget caps for both defense and nondefense. Republicans must abandon these partisan shortterm bills and work with Democrats to fund the entirety of government for the remainder of the fiscal year to serve the American people. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. A DERHOLT ), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies. Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, today, as the House takes up the fifth continuing resolution for FY18, it seems all too appropriate to quote President Reagan where he says: ‘‘Here we go again.’’ I rise here on the floor of the House this afternoon to urge my colleagues to support the CR, which, of course, runs through March 23. As the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations’ Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies, our Nation’s farmers and ranchers will find it hard to access credit during the upcoming planting season. And those recovering from disastrous weather events will not be able to access essential programs in order to help them if we do not finalize a fullyear funding agreement right away. These are just a couple of examples of the hardships that are faced by our citizens here in the U.S. that depend on this legislation. As I say, this is the fifth CR for this fiscal year. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle must come to the table willing to negotiate on these budget caps. As Members know, the House has passed each of the 12 appropriations bills. We have done our job. Of course, the other body continues to be the weakest link in all this, as it needs to seriously reform their process in order to do the work of the people. Finally, I appreciate that this bill includes fullyear funding for the Department of Defense. To quote President Reagan once again: ‘‘We have no choice but to maintain ready defense forces that are second to none. Yes, the cost is high, but the price of neglect would be infinitely higher.’’ Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. PELOSI ), the Democratic leader. Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to me, and I commend her for her extraordinary leadership on the Appropriations Committee, where important decisions are made about how to allocate the resources of our country to invest in the aspirations of the American people, to respect the sacrifice of our men and women in uniform, and to honor the vows of our Founders for a country that is making the future better for every generation to come. The distinguished chairman of the committee, Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN , opened his remarks by saying he came to the floor to introduce the fifth continuing resolution. And the gentleman who followed him talked about this being the fifth continuing resolution. The more is not the merrier. It is like golf: the lower the score, the better. To have five continuing resolutions is a statement of incompetence and ineptitude. The Republicans control the House, the Senate, and the White House; yet they are pressing forward on their fifth stopgap, shortterm spending bill, demonstrating their failure to govern. Since President Reagan was mentioned, I will mention our very first President, our patriarch, George Washington. President Washington, when he was leaving office, cautioned against political parties who were at war with their own government. Does that sound familiar to you? Here we are again, 2 days from another shutdown, careening toward another manufactured Republican crisis, demonstrating the Republican failure to govern. We don’t want to go to that place. As Members of Congress, we take a solemn oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States and to protect the American people. Democrats support a strong national defense. We, too, want our men and women in uniform to have the resources they need to keep them safe and to keep the American people safe as they accomplish their mission. But we will not allow Republicans to use this continuing resolution, the fifth time they had to come to the floor because they could not govern, to hollow out our Nation’s commitment to the health, education, and economic security of America’s working families. We all know that our military might is part of our Nation’s strength, but the health, education, security, and wellbeing of the American people is also a source of that strength. Instead of working constructively with Democrats to meet the needs of the American people, Republicans are trying to starve the domestic budget. I just want to remind our colleagues: Onethird, 34 percent—onethird—of the nondefense domestic budget goes to national security. When you starve the domestic budget, you are not making us stronger. Onethird of the domestic budget is about security; Homeland Security, Veterans Affairs, the State Department, and antiterrorism activities of the Justice Department. But Republicans refuse to give our patriots funded on the domestic side of the budget the resources they need to do their job, just the chaos and uncertainty of yet another stopgap extension. As Defense Secretary Mattis said, stopgap CRs ‘‘just create unpredictability. It makes us rigid. We cannot deal with new and revealing threats. We know our enemies are not standing still, so it is about as unwise as it can be.’’ And here are, as unwise as can be for the fifth time. And while their continuing resolution seeks to ransack every other commitment to the health of the American people, Republicans hide behind a fig leaf of a 2year extension of community health centers. 
We all support community health centers. It was a very important part of the Affordable Care Act. A very important part. Our colleague, assistant leader Mr. CLYBURN from South Carolina, was one of the great champions of all time of Congress on expanding funding for programs for care and for bricks and mortar for our community health centers. This is a very important piece for us. We should be extending it in a fuller bill to 5 years, except it is used here to hide from the fact of so much other domestic investment that we are not making. Republicans are eliminating the Home Visiting initiative that is vital for maternal and child care, and cutting off workforce training for lowincome Americans seeking goodpaying jobs in healthcare. The sole purpose of this Republican bill is to destroy our leverage to achieve parity in the caps, to eliminate any need for bipartisan compromise, to eliminate any need to invest in working families. Why? Because if they get their defense number, then they don’t have to negotiate about the domestic number. And as I said, we support our men and women in uniform having what they need to be safe and to keep us safe. But the strength of our country is measured in other ways as well. They don’t believe that and they can’t pass that, so they have to put the defense bill there. But we cannot support that because, again, it comes at the expense instead of as a source of strength to our country. Democrats simply want action on the critical overdue and bipartisan priorities of the American people so beautifully spelled out by our ranking member, Congresswoman LOWEY . Again, we need funding for the opioid epidemic. The President talked about that. Show us the money. The opioid epidemic claims the lives of 115 Americans every day, and it is getting worse every year in every district in the country. Bipartisan support is there to fight the opioid epidemic. Let’s do it. We need more funding for veterans, to meet our responsibility and ensure that no veteran is denied the care they deserve upon returning from the battlefield. We need emergency disaster funding for all communities ravaged by hurricanes and wildfires. We need to save millions of hardworking Americans’ endangered pensions. We need to pass the bipartisan Dream Act immediately. This is a moral priority for us. This is about the character of our Nation, who we are as a country. A nation, over time, constantly invigorated by people coming to our country to seek the American Dream; a dream that is predicated on every generation working to make the future better for the next; a dream that takes determination, optimism, hope, and courage. And when these newcomers come to America with that determination, that courage, that optimism, that hope, they associate themselves with the values of our Founders to make the future better for the next generation. These newcomers to America make America more American. So we asked to bring the Hurd Aguilar bill to the floor. It is bipartisan. It has bipartisan support on the floor. It would pass. Have the courage to bring a bill that protects the DREAMers to the floor of the House. These priorities that I mentioned are all bipartisan. They would pass if brought to the floor for an upordown vote. The GOP squandered all their time, energy, votes, and enthusiasm on tax breaks for corporations and the wealthiest, with 83 percent of the tax bill going to the top 1 percent. And now Republicans need to get serious and get to work on a budget that funds both the military and the domestic investments that keep our Nation strong. I just want to make one point about that tax bill again. Did you see that the Speaker of the House sang the glory of the tax bill because a woman was getting $1.50 a week more in her paycheck? Did you see that? Do you believe that that is a good thing when the top 1 percent were probably getting $1,500 a week compared to her $1.50 a week in their paycheck? Thank God, after millions of people objected, the Speaker withdrew that tweet. But I don’t think he withdrew that sentiment, because it is the same sentiment that haunts all of these negotiations about investing in the American people. Republicans must stop governing from manufactured crisis to crisis, and work with Democrats to pass many urgent, longoverdue priorities of the American people. As our distinguished ranking member, Mrs. LOWEY , said earlier in her remarks, ‘‘We must abandon these shortterm bills.’’ She spelled out very clearly why. I associate myself with her remarks. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CARTER ), the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations’ Subcommittee on Homeland Security. Mr. CARTER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, our fine Secretary of Defense this morning testified before the Committee on Armed Services. He remarked that if the military is forced to continue to operate under a continuing resolution for the rest of the year, it will be unable to provide pay to our brave men and women in uniform, unable to recruit personnel we need, unable to maintain our naval ships, unable to maintain our aircraft, unable to supply our troops in the theater of combat, and unable to strike contracts critical toward modernizing our force. Unable, unable, unable. As Congress, it is our responsibility to make our military force the most able in the world; able to keep our country safe and able to promote the ideals of freedom across the globe. It would be deeply irresponsible for Members of this House to vote against providing fullyear funding to the Defense Department, which addresses the needs of today and tomorrow, not last year. The Secretary was on the Hill to discuss something very important: The Department’s National Defense Strategy, which seeks to address the significant challenges we face with rising adversaries in China and Russia, along with enduring threats of a nuclear armed Korea, a terrorist state in Iran, a terrorist network like ISIS. And he said: ‘‘I regret that, without sustained predictable appropriations, my presence here today wastes your time because no strategy can survive without funding necessary to resource it.’’ Mr. Speaker, this bill funds our military for the year with funding that addresses the challenges we face today and separates this critical funding from the political fights here in Washington, D.C. Our troops need our support for this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. POE of Texas). The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from Texas. Mr. CARTER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, they need what this bill provides. Because of that, I support the bill and I urge its passage. b1745 Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. VISCLOSKY ), the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee Subcommittee on Defense. Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, the first observation I would make is: When I was raised by my parents, I was taught not to whine and not to blame others for problems that arose, but, rather, to work hard to solve them. I think it is long past time for people in this body to blame people in another body for the collective inability of the Congress of the United States to make a decision about something so important as the budget of the United States of America. It is a leadership issue for the Democratic leadership and the Republican leadership of the House to come to an agreement to overturn the caps of the Budget Control Act. It is time for the Democratic and Republican leadership of the Senate to do the same and for those two bodies to come to an agreement collectively to meet our constitutional responsibilities. A few days ago, I was on this floor and said that we were confronted with a number problem. That is, what is our total spending for this fiscal year? We are in the 129th day of it for the Department of Defense. What is the total budget number for all of our domestic spending so that we can have a strong and vibrant economy and people? We still have a number problem. For the sake of the country, for the sake of 
this institution, for the sake of our committee and the good work that Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN , Mrs. L OWEY , and the members of our committee have done repeatedly, please let us have some leadership. Lewis Carroll wrote ‘‘Through the Looking Glass,’’ and there was an interchange in that story: ‘‘‘Well, in our country,’ said Alice, still panting a little, ‘you’d generally get to somewhere else—if you ran very fast for a long time, as we’ve been doing.’’’ ‘‘‘A slow sort of country!’ said the Queen. ‘Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place.’’’ In September, we did the first CR to December 8 because it was going to be different then, but we are in the same place. Then we did a CR for December 22 because it was going to be different then, but we are in the same place. Then we did a CR for January 19 because it was going to be different and a new year, but we are in the same place. Today, we have February 8 because it was going to be different on February 8, and now it is going to be the fifth time we have done a continuing resolution to March 23 because it is going to be different next month. That is fine. We did our Defense Appropriations bill. We did it in July; then we did it in September; then we did it in December; then we did it in February—four times between CRs, repeatedly doing the same Defense Appropriations bill. We have done it nine times. If we go through this sequence one more time, Mr. Speaker, I am not going to be able to keep track of my numbers anymore. This is a numbers problem, and I would conclude by noting that I, for one, did not vote for the Budget Control Act, and I would note that an independently elected Congress set it aside for 2 years because they knew a mistake had been made. Then a subsequently elected Congress did away with the Budget Control Act because they had a 2year deal because they knew they had made a mistake. There are negotiations—apparently taking place as we meet here today—to set it aside for another 2 years because they know we made a mistake within our legislation, because Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN , Mrs. L OWEY , my chairwoman, Ms. GRANGER , and I, everybody has been honest. We are going to set aside sequestration because we need to spend additional moneys on defense. How many times does Congress have to hit its head with a hammer to not fix this problem permanently? Three different independently elected Congresses have overturned a really rotten bill, and we are still in the same place. It is time to stop for the sake of this country. Give the chairman, give the ranking member, give the committees in both Houses numbers so we can complete our bills. The last time I looked, every department of this country has completed their work on fiscal year 2019, are going to present us with their budgets next week, and they don’t know what we are doing this year. Mr. Speaker, this is unbecoming of a great nation. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BRADY ), the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his leadership and hard work on this effort. For over a year, the Ways and Means Committee has been leading efforts to advance smart, focused solutions to improve Medicare for the American people. A number of these solutions are included in the bill before us today. These policies take action on three primary goals: First, expanding access to highquality care; Second, increasing efficiency in the way we deliver care—a key goal that will help patients better receive the care they need when they need it; and Third, incorporating healthcare technologies that are focused on patients, such as telehealth, and eliminating barriers to coordinating care. This means providing new tools to patients that healthcare providers can use to better access care and deliver it and, at the same time, reducing red tape burdens that now make it harder for our local doctors to provide the highquality care our Americans deserve. So many of these provisions have support from Republicans and Democrats, and for good reason. These are smart, targeted improvements that will go a long way in helping Medicare patients in Texas and, frankly, throughout the country. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank all of the members of our committee and throughout the House who have worked on these provisions. Improving and strengthening Medicare for the long term is a major priority for the American people. With this bill, we have an opportunity to take meaningful steps toward this important goal. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting its passage. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR ), the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development, and Related Agencies. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member LOWEY and rise in opposition to this bill. Our Nation really needs to be on an even keel to produce steady economic growth in this country. This bill doesn’t help that. I agree, America must have a strong defense, but a nation has to be strong at home to be strong abroad. You can’t shortchange the home front. A nation at home must be secure, without wild stock market swings, to be strong abroad. A nation at home must be strong, without a massive drug epidemic here at home, to be strong abroad. This bill can’t produce a steady economy with consistent job growth because it fails to dedicate sufficient resources here at home: to education, to healthcare, to employment and retraining, for Head Start, for energy independence, for law enforcement, and for localities savaged by the drug epidemic and shortchanged on treatment. Our ship of state needs to be on an even keel, not the wild fluctuations in this resolution. This bill tilts in the wind far, far starboard, and that is not a setting that can assure a steady ship of state to maintain a steady growth economy. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the resolution. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. SMITH), chairman of the Subcommittee on Human Resources of the House Ways and Means Committee. Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this continuing resolution package. While I appreciate this legislation will keep government open, fund community health centers for 2 years, and fully fund our military while we continue to work toward a broader budget agreement, I would like to focus on the various Ways and Means Committee provisions included in the bill. This legislation includes numerous Medicare provisions important to rural health providers and patients, including permanently repealing therapy caps and extending the floor on geographic payment adjustments for rural providers and addons for rural ambulance providers. Just as importantly, these health provisions are paid for without cutting swing bed reimbursements to critical access hospitals, including the 55 critical access hospitals in Nebraska’s Third District as originally proposed. I am particularly pleased that two important programs within the jurisdiction of the Subcommittee on Human Resources—which I chair—are included today. We have much work to do to lift Americans out of poverty and into prosperity, and each of these bills will play an important part in this effort. The Family First Prevention Services Act reforms our child welfare system to reinforce the importance of keeping children with their families whenever possible. We know children who stay with their families have better longterm outcomes than those who move to nonfamily settings, and our goal for every program in this space to demonstrate results through empirical evidence. I want to thank the sponsor of Family First, Mr. BUCHANAN , for working with me to address my concerns about nurse staffing requirements which would have been costly to implement for entities like Omahabased Boys Town, while providing no tangible improvements to their family driven model of care. 
The other H.R. item in this package, the supporting Social Impact Partnerships to Pay for Results Act, also moves our family support programs to a more resultsdriven model by incentivizing States and local governments to pilot new ideas and reserving Federal funding until they demonstrate outcomes through rigorous datadriven evaluation. We still have more work to do in this space, starting with completing the work begun by this Chamber last September when we passed a paidfor 5year MIECHV reauthorization. But like the rest of this legislation, these provisions are a downpayment on the work we are committed to completing. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from Nebraska. Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the time, and I certainly urge passage of this bill. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DELAURO ), the ranking member of the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee. Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to strongly oppose this continuing resolution. I cannot support a bill that flies in the face of responsible governing. This is pure incompetence. How many times are we going to do this? This is our fifth shortterm spending bill since September. How many times will we punt our priorities, lurching from one selfinflicted wound to another? That is exactly what the continuing resolution represents: a failure to govern. It is shameful that, yet again, we neglect our core obligation as a Congress, which is to fund government programs. We should be voting on new top line spending levels for 2018, that alleviate sequestration from both nondefense and defense spending. We should have spent the last few months fulfilling our responsibility as legislators by writing bipartisan bills to fund programs that help the middle class and the vulnerable, support evidencebased scientific research, and help working people get the skills they need to find good jobs and get good wages. Instead, the majority forced through their tax scam for millionaires and billionaires. They became the first party to ever control both Chambers of Congress and the White House, and, yes, they shut down the government. And today, the President of the United States says that he supports a government shutdown. The Republican majority has failed to respond to the needs of the American people. Instead of working with Democrats to set budget numbers and ensure parity, equal for defense spending and nondefense spending, they have put the government on autopilot. b1800 They put services and investments that are critical to our families and to our communities at grave risk from apprenticeships to education for students with disabilities, childcare, after school programs that help working families make ends meet, and financial aid for students who are attending college. Instead, they are forcing through another continuing resolution, this time cutting almost $3 billion from the Prevention Fund over the next 10 years on top of the $750 million that they cut in December. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Connecticut an additional 1 minute. Ms. DELAURO. We are talking about cuts to programs that improve our public health immunization infrastructure at a time when the flu is rampant in this country, as well as cuts to lead poisoning prevention programs that seek to prevent and ultimately eliminate childhood lead poisoning. Programs like these and dozens of others in the Prevention Fund save billions of taxpayer dollars by preventing illness and disease before they occur. You cut the Prevention Fund and you cause millions of Americans to suffer for no reason. You pit community health centers against the Prevention Fund. Take the money, the $1
1⁄2trillion that you give to the richest people in this country: the millionaires, the billionaires, and the richest corporations; don’t take it from children’s health, don’t take it from the healthcare centers, and don’t take it from the Prevention Fund. It is unacceptable, because here we are talking about people’s lives. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues: Reject this continuing resolution. It fails to meet our obligations to the American people. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BARTON ), who is the vice chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished Appropriations Committee chairman for yielding me time. I rise in support of this continuing resolution. Obviously, we would rather fund the government for the entire year before the start of the fiscal year, but that is in a perfect world, and one thing that the Congress has never been accused of is being a perfect world. So we are here dealing in the real world. To my good friend from Connecticut who just spoke, and she is my good friend, I would point out that the bill before us doesn’t cut money from the Prevention Fund. It directs money from the Prevention Fund to spend on healthcare programs. In other words, it is taking some discretion from the executive branch and directing that spending that Congress thinks it should be spent for. One of the programs that we are going to fund for 2 years is the community health centers. Twentyfour million people each year get their healthcare from these community health centers, and one of them is in my home county, the Hope Clinic. Its main facility is in Waxahachie, Texas. But in my hometown of Ennis, we have the Nell Barton Hope Clinic Annex. These two facilities in Ellis County this year are providing healthcare for over 10,000 Ellis Countians. This is not exotic care. It is checkups, screenings, mammograms, and all the odds and ends that you have in your basic healthcare facilities. If they need more specific treatment, they are referred to specialists in the Dallas Fort Worth area. But for the 10,000 citizens of Ellis County who depend on the Hope Clinic for their healthcare, this is a big bill. In fact, the executive director of the Hope Clinic was in my office today, saying: We want to expand, but we don’t know if we are going to have the funds. We really need to get some certainty. That is what this bill is all about. So I rise in strong support, and I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the CR later this evening. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. LEE), who is a senior member of the Appropriations Committee. Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman for yielding and, once again, for her tremendous leadership on so many issues as our ranking member. As a member of the Appropriations Committee and the Budget Committee, I rise in strong opposition to this continuing resolution. This bill kicks the can down the road for the fifth time— mind you, fifth time—since October. It also shamelessly includes the stand alone defense spending bill of $659 billion to an already outofcontrol Pentagon budget. This bill breaks the budget caps. It includes $75 billion for wars that Congress has never debated or voted on. It also includes more than $1 billion in funds to increase troop levels in Afghanistan by 3,500, not to mention the millions—the billions, actually—in waste, fraud, and abuse that taxpayers have already lost by irresponsible Pentagon spending. This is outrageous. Republicans control the House, the Senate, and the White House. The least they could do is keep the government open. Yet here we stand, once again, with no deal on DREAMers and no agreement on a longterm spending bill. Clearly, Republicans have no strategy on funding the government. They would prefer to pass CR after CR after CR after CR. This is beyond irresponsible, Mr. Speaker. 
How long will Republicans govern from crisis to crisis? Nobody can manage their household or their business like the Republicans are managing our government spending. This shortterm resolution once again ignores urgent bipartisan priorities the Democrats have been fighting for for months with Republicans, the most urgent of which is passing a clean Dream Act. DACA recipients are American in every way except on paper, and right now their lives are hanging in the balance. We have less than 1 month until DACA expires, a deadline that the President, himself, created. This continuing resolution is really irresponsible, and it is morally bankrupt. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from California an additional 1 minute. Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, this continuing resolution fails to honor the temporary protective status for immigrants. It fails to raise budget caps for defense and nondefense spending, and it neglects to provide desperately needed funding for hurricane and wildfireimpacted communities, the opioid crisis, and our veterans. This bill underscores the majority’s complete lack of regard for everyday Americans and struggling families. Continuing resolutions leave the American people out on a limb with no confidence in their Federal Government. This resolution makes it clear that that is just what Republicans want to do. The American people sent us to Congress to govern in their best interest. Now we have spent the last 4 months passing shortterm spending bills one after another, and for what? Because Republicans refuse to do their job. Instead of wasting more time on this terrible CR, we should deal with our bipartisan priorities and fund the government for the long term. It is the right thing to do for our communities and our country. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on this bill. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. BILIRAKIS ), who is a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for doing an outstanding job this year passing all 12 appropriations bills. Mr. Speaker, I support passage of this CR which includes three provisions of mine. It will reauthorize the Community Health Center program, providing $3.6 billion per year for the next 2 years. Community health centers have a proven track record of providing high quality, costefficient healthcare to approximately 25 million Americans and have long enjoyed bipartisan support because they are a prime example of what is working in our healthcare system. The CR updates the civil and criminal penalties in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Many haven’t been updated in over 20 years. It also repeals the Medicare therapy cap. This will ensure that patients who need physical, speech, or occupational therapy services can receive them without fear of losing their benefits if they hit an arbitrary cap. This is so important to our seniors, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. MCCOLLUM ), who is the ranking member of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee. Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I thank our ranking member for yielding me the time. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this legislation, a misguided bill that ignores the urgent needs of the American people. The Federal Government’s fiscal year started October 1, 2017—128 days ago. Instead of using that time to get their work done, Republicans have focused solely on partisan politics. When it comes to the essential responsibility of funding the Federal Government, the Republicans can’t be bothered. Now we are asked, today, to vote for a bill that funds the Pentagon for the rest of the year while funding our schools and our hospitals for just 43 days. Mr. Speaker, our national security begins at home with investments in the future that keep our families and our communities safe, strong, and moving forward. This bill ignores those needs. It provides no certainty for our law enforcement professionals, no longterm funding for urgent repairs to our crumbling infrastructure, and no confidence for investments in lifesaving medical research. It doesn’t even provide a full year of funding for veterans’ healthcare. While it is encouraging that Republicans are finally reauthorizing vital healthcare programs like our community health centers, paying for these programs with cuts to the CDC’s Prevention and Public Health Fund, which is currently providing lifesaving vaccines in this severe flu season, is the height of irresponsibility. Discord and delay is no way to run a government, but under Republican control, that is exactly what we are getting. Mr. Speaker, unlike the President, I do not want a government shutdown. We need a budget agreement that keeps our government open, protects our national security, and meets our commitments to hardworking families. So let’s stop playing games, get to our work, and get to it now. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER ), who is a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this spending measure under consideration and what it means for our country and our constituents. This continuing resolution we are considering includes a number of extremely important health provisions that are desperately needed. Under this legislation, we will see a 2year extension of federally qualified health centers that employ nearly 190,000 people and serve over 24 million people across the country. There is also a 2year extension of public health programs such as the National Health Service Corps, the Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education, FamilytoFamily Health Information Centers, and the Sexual Risk Avoidance Education Program. Additionally, this helps hospitals by eliminating the $5 million in reductions for Disproportionate Share Hospitals that were included in the ACA. Many of the good bills my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee have worked on are included in this legislation to improve public health and make reforms to Medicare. Finally, this legislation pushes through a permanent repeal of the Medicare payment cap for therapy services, meaning that patients will have better access to important medical devices. All of these efforts wouldn’t be possible without the work of Chairman WALDEN , Chairman B URGESS , and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in the Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. Speaker, now is the time to work together to ensure that these bills are passed into law, and that is why I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
1⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ ), who is the ranking member of the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Subcommittee. Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding and for her leadership. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this continuing resolution which, yet again, is a complete and total abdication of our responsibilities as Members of Congress. For the fifth time so far this fiscal year, Republicans are asking us to fund the government for just another flip of the calendar. The last time Republicans dragged us down this path of budgetary incompetence, we had the first ever complete government shutdown when one party held the House, Senate, and the White House. Yet here we are again, left with this ludicrous approach of funding the U.S. Government month to month while ignoring so many of the pressing issues Americans want us to address. Today we have heard Republicans pay endless lip service to their devotion to military spending—and that 
funding is certainly vital—but what Republicans have not mentioned is that this latest stopgap gimmick is going to rob from crucial nondefense budgets that also keep Americans safe. That means veterans, homeland security, counterterrorism, and State Department programs will be neglected and ignored. That is why Democrats are asking for a simple compromise to raise the spending caps that are unreasonable and uncompromising. That is because we all want a strong national defense, but we also need equal increases in our domestic budget so that hardworking families can feel safe and financially secure. We also want Republicans to join us in confronting the dire shortfall at the VA so no veteran is denied care upon returning home. We want Republicans to work with us to ensure urgently needed recovery funds go to Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and all areas impacted by wildfires. b1815 We want Republicans to truly help us fight this opioid scourge, protect America’s pensions, and do what the vast majority of Americans want us to do: pass a clean Dream Act. Don’t tell me we don’t have the funds to support those needs. This Congress just gave a huge handout to billionaires and giant corporations that exploded the deficit by $1.5 trillion. But this cynically crafted continuing resolution fails to address those real needs, the needs of the people who actually sent us here to stand up for them. We must end this cycle of budgetary neglect. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’ Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DUNN). Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, our troops comprise the most professional, highly trained, and dedicated military force that the world has ever seen. They have pledged their lives, the wellbeing of their families, and their sacred honor to serve and protect this Nation. Yet here we are, over a month into 2018, and our military and national security are being held hostage by our colleagues across the aisle over unrelated issues. It is time for the Senate to get its act together. The House has passed the full defense funding three times this year. Tonight, we will pass it a fourth time. It is wrong for us to send our best young men and women into harm’s way without the resources they need, asking them to make up with their efforts, and their risk, for our shortcomings. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this funding legislation and to prove to our troops that we have their backs. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE ), the ranking member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1892. Mr. Speaker, I am disappointed that, once again, my Republican colleagues are playing politics with important health programs. Rather than bringing a standalone, bipartisan health extenders package to the floor, the Republicans have once again delayed any action on these extenders so that they could attach them to a CR that Democrats could not support. The strategy may hide their inability to pass a final funding bill for a fiscal year that began on October 1, but it has also created uncertainty for the millions of Americans who rely on these programs every day. I am glad that Republicans have dropped some of the harmful offsets that have led to months of delay and uncertainty for these health programs. However, our main concern is that the package excludes important health priorities, including the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program; the Health Profession Opportunity Grants program; and the increased funding that is desperately needed to combat the ongoing opioid crisis. The CR poses a serious threat to public health because it cuts $2.85 billion from the Prevention Fund. These funds are critical to keeping Americans healthy. The Prevention Fund funds vaccines for children, lead poisoning prevention, opioid prevention, diabetes, heart disease, and other prevention programs. I am also concerned with the Medicaid cuts in this package. Republicans have included over $10 billion in Medicaid cuts, including new money from the Medicaid Improvement Fund. We should also reject the prioritization of funding for the Defense Department at the expense of all of our domestic needs. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’ It is the only way we are going to guarantee that, ultimately, these health programs are funded and that we don’t rely so much on the Prevention Fund. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. BLACKBURN ). Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, it is so interesting to listen to this debate. I just want to make three points. First, on the military funding, I represent Fort Campbell. When you walk on that post and talk to the men and women in uniform and talk to them about their readiness training, their redeployment training, do you know what they tell us? They say: Give us certainty in funding. That is exactly what we are doing, is providing that certainty that they need to defend us, to protect us. They deserve it and they deserve our best efforts. So I find it so curious that there would be opposition to funding our military. The second point is the community health centers. Many of my colleagues may come from urban areas. I have a rural district. Community health centers are vitally important to my constituents, to Tennesseans who want the access to care and seek the education to know how to take better care of themselves and their families. Let’s give them this funding for the 2 years of certainty that is necessary. Third, legislation that I have authored and worked on is included in the Medicare therapy cap provisions. Have you ever talked to a senior, as I have, who had a stroke, who is seeking speech therapy or physical therapy from a hip replacement or a fall? There is an arbitrary cap that runs out and they can no longer seek that medical attention that is necessary for a full and complete recovery and the quality of life that they desire and that they deserve. This is something that our committee has worked on to provide for seniors. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Tennessee. Mrs. BLACKBURN. This is something that allows them to have that quality of life. Why would you vote against lifting these caps and giving seniors what they deserve? They have paid for Medicare through their working life. What they are seeking is to be able to have a full recovery. It is not only the appropriate thing to do, this is something that adds to the quality of life, just as keeping these community health centers funded enriches our communities. It enriches rural America. I close with reiterating the point that, out of fairness, out of respect, out of loyalty to those who put on the uniform to defend us, let us join together and vote to fund the military and to support their efforts to defend this Nation. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN), the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee and his great staff who have worked diligently all year, month after month after month. Five months ago next week, they approved all 12 appropriations bills, one after another, regular order, through the House of Representatives. But there they sit over in the Senate and the Democrats block them. What brings us here today is really important work. What brings us here today is that we are taking care of significant public healthcare issues. We are fully funding for the next 2 years community health centers. 
I have heard from my colleagues about the things that aren’t in this bill that they wish were, so that is why they are going to vote ‘‘no,’’ or some other thing that is not even before us and that is why they are going to vote ‘‘no.’’ But let’s talk about what is actually before us. What is before us is taking care of our men and women in uniform and their needs, especially when they are in harm’s way, and fund really, really important public health programs that used to always be bipartisan. Let’s talk about those. Valley Family Health Care Outreach Center in Ontario and Winding Waters Clinic in Wallowa County. I have visited both of these recently. They are on the front lines of healthcare prevention. They are on the front lines of saving lives and helping children and adults. Or La Clinica down in the MedfordAshland area. In fact, in my district, we have 12 federally qualified health centers and 63 delivery sites that give care for 240,000 Oregonians. Twentyfour million nationwide are served by this. On November 3, this House had the opportunity to fully fund those community health centers for 2 years and take care of children’s health insurance and a lot of these other programs. It was a separate bill brought to the House floor, and a handful of Democrats broke with their party and voted with us. But, unfortunately, when it got to the Senate, they couldn’t be freed up to support it. So we had to come back in the last continuing resolution and fully fund the Children’s Health Insurance Program. I am not sure many Democrats voted for that here, unfortunately. But here we are today, same process, same situation to fund community health centers. So we are going to do that. Your choice when you vote is ‘‘yes’’ or ‘‘no,’’ you want the community health centers funded or not, you want to shut the government down or not, you want to take care of our military or not. Then there is the disproportionate share hospitals. What are those? Those are the hospitals in our districts and States that take care disproportionately of more poorer people than other hospitals. Under the Affordable Care Act or ObamaCare, however you want to describe it, there was prescribed in law automatic cuts to these hospitals that take care of the poorest of the poor in our communities. Those cuts totaled $2 billion. In this legislation, as in the legislation we brought from the Energy and Commerce Committee on November 3, we turn off those cuts. We say: Don’t do that to our DSH hospitals. If you are at Saint Alphonsus in Ontario, Oregon, that is the most affected hospital, I am told, and they will lose money and have to decide how they cope with that. We solve that here for 2 years at $6.8 million in my State. Then we extend the special diabetes programs. For heaven’s sake, we should be able to come together in this Chamber and in this Congress to take care of people with diabetes. My grandfather lost both legs due to diabetes. They were amputated. I have other relatives and good friends whose kids have dealt with diabetes and still do to this day. For our Native Americans and others, we have two separate programs. We fully fund them and tie them together. That is done in this legislation. Fifty thousand people in my district have diabetes. My hunch is all of our districts are not dissimilar from that. We take care of those people in this legislation. Then we take care of therapy caps. Since 1997, when this law was put in place, people who needed physical therapy—my colleague from Tennessee talked about it—stroke victims, seniors who need therapy, rather than the physical therapist or the speech therapist saying, ‘‘Here is the program you need to get well, get on your feet, recover from whatever it is that afflicts you,’’ the government put an arbitrary cap, and that was it. You were done whether you were done or not. Everybody is different in terms of recovery. We repeal the therapy caps in here. By the way, we have heard about all these things that now won’t get funded because a part of this funding comes out of the Public Prevention Fund. Mr. Speaker, $2.85 billion is not insignificant, it is true, but we are applying that money to help prevention and community health centers, as we did before for the Children’s Health Insurance Program. We are providing it for diabetes health. We are removing the physical therapy caps so that people can get well. That seems to me to be pretty good use of the Prevention Fund. By the way, during the same period we are spending $2.85 billion out of that, there will still remain $12 billion left, and the talented folks at the Appropriations Committee will decide how that money is spent on vaccines and all these other issues, all these things we care about. There is still $12 billion left. So we are using discretionary funds that were set aside for that very purpose here. Then we heard about some Medicaid cuts. Let me tell you what those are. We said: If you are a big lottery winner, maybe now that you have won a big prize, you shouldn’t be on governmentfunded Medicaid because, by the way, you won a bazillion dollars. So we are taking lottery winners and saying you have got to treat that big windfall when you calculate whether that person is poor or not anymore. So that is in here. Then, on thirdparty liability, we said that if insurers actually are responsible for the cost, insurers should pay the cost rather than the taxpayer. So we make a little reform here that puts the insurers first to pay rather than the taxpayer. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for the marvelous work he has done. b1830 Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. This is the latest example of Republicans being completely incapable of governing. We must finish our work. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I am in receipt of the Statement of Administration Policy, which indicates that the administration supports this continuing resolution and that the President’s advisers would recommend his signature on the bill. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  the Statement of Administration Policy dated February 6, 2018. 
HOUSE AMENDMENT TO H .R. 1892—FURTHER EX TENSION OF CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS  
ACT, 2018—REP. FRELINGHUYSEN , R–NJ The Administration supports the House Amendment to the Senate Amendment to H.R. 1892, the Further Extension of Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018. This bill funds most Government programs at current levels through March 23, 2018, while incorporating the text of the Housepassed fiscal year (FY) 2018 Department of Defense Appropriations Act, which provides the resources the military needs to keep the Nation safe. As the Administration has noted previously, the Housepassed Department of DefenseAppropriations Act is consistent with the President’s pledge to undo the looming defense spending reductions that are harmful to America’s national security and military readiness. The Housepassed Department of Defense Appropriations Act incorporated in the bill includes a total of $659 billion for the Department of Defense (DOD), including $584 billion in base spending and $75 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations. These amounts are consistent with a total funding level for DOD similar to that authorized by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018, which was signed into law by the President. It includes $1.2 billion requested by the Administration to support increased troop levels in Afghanistan, special operations forces capabilities, and other urgent needs. The United States military’s greatest asset is the men and women who volunteer to serve. This bill keeps faith with service members by providing a 2.4 percent military pay raise. It increases end strength across the military services for active duty, reserve, and National Guard personnel, and includes funding for training and maintenance to ensure that United States troops are properly equipped and ready to fight. In addition to supporting the defense bill, the Administration supports language in the House Amendment to H.R. 1892 that provides for an extension of a variety of healthcare provisions, including Community Health Centers. The Administration is also appreciative that the bill includes language requested by the Administration to ensure continuity of operations for the 2020 Decennial Census Program and the Small Business Administration’s Disaster Loans Program. The Administration supports continuing discussions over a twoyear budget agreement that ensures funding for national defense and other priorities. As those discussions continue, however, it is dangerous to 
hold defense funding for the current fiscal year hostage to arbitrary demands for lower priority domestic programs. If the Further Extension of Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018, were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he sign the bill into law. 
Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues in the House to support this continuing resolution to keep the government open for business until March 23 and to support our men and women in the armed services who do the work of freedom each and every day. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 727, the previous question is ordered. The question is on the motion by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN ). The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it.

b1900 RECOGNIZING THE COLLEGE OF WILLIAM & MARY (Mr. TAYLOR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. TAYLOR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the College of William & Mary’s founding by British royal charter 325 years ago on February 8, 1693. As our Nation’s second oldest college, William & Mary has been coined the ‘‘Alma Mater of the Nation.’’ From George Washington to Thomas Jefferson to many of my contemporaries in Congress, William & Mary has played an important role in shaping our Nation and its leaders. I am proud to say that that tradition continues today. For the last 325 years, William & Mary has been the place where the world’s greatest minds come to study. The college is consistently ranked among our Nation’s most elite public universities and delivers an education that is rated among the highest in value for its graduates. Many of William & Mary’s accomplishments would not have been possible without the leadership of President Reveley. On June 30, he will retire from William & Mary after 27 years of service to the college, the Commonwealth, and the Nation. I want to congratulate President Reveley for a job well done and wish him a happy retirement. 
ABSENCE OF PRESIDENTIAL LEADERSHIP ON RUSSIAN AGGRESSION (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise with deep concern in the wake of President Trump’s failure to levy economic sanctions on more of Russia’s oligarchs, allowing Putin’s repressive regime its continued illegal aggression on Ukraine. In his State of the Union, the President used the single word, ‘‘Russia.’’ That was it. And then he decided to call it ‘‘a rival.’’ A rival? How about enemy of liberty? How about that? In stark contrast to every other President going back to Ronald Reagan, read what wasn’t said in this State of the Union. This raises serious questions as to why President Trump is letting Russia off the hook. Why would President Trump reject the advice of all U.S. intelligence offices, including that of his own CIA Director, especially when the United States intelligence agencies know Russia interfered massively in our elections and European elections, our most important alliance, and uses its military assets to undermine liberty? Thankfully, Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team seeks answers, but Trump’s most troublesome financial connections with Russialinked investors and intermediary banks remain questions that need to be answered. Speaking as cochair of the Congressional Ukrainian Caucus, I urge my colleagues to act in the national interest and in the absence of Presidential leadership on Russian aggression. f 
RECOGNIZING MONTANA’S OLYMPIC ATHLETES (Mr. GIANFORTE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize three Montana athletes who will join Team USA and compete in the 2018 Winter Olympics. Darian Stevens of Missoula, Maggie Voisin of Whitefish, and Brad Wilson of Butte will represent not only Montana, but our great Nation. This is the second Olympics where Maggie has qualified, and she will compete in the women’s slopestyle skiing. Darian, who began skiing when she was 4 years old, will also compete in the women’s slopestyle skiing. Brad, who also started skiing when he was just 4 years old and who competed in the Sochi Games four years ago, will compete in the men’s mogul skiing. I look forward to cheering on these outstanding Montanans. I ask my colleagues to join me in wishing Maggie, Darian, and Brad success in the 2018 Winter Olympics. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF DENISE COHEN (Mr. KIHUEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Denise Cohen. Denise was a loving mother of two. She worked as a property manager in Santa Barbara, California, and always made everyone around her feel good. She attended the Route 91 music festival in Las Vegas with her boyfriend, Bo, to celebrate her 56th birthday. Denise was a huge country music fan, and she loved concerts and was a vibrant and positive woman. She is remembered by her son, Jeff, as a strong and beautiful person who made a difference in the lives of the people she knew. She always had a vibrant and positive attitude. I would like to extend my condolences to Denise Cohen’s family and friends. Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada, and the whole country grieve with you. f 
HONORING RETIRING CAPTAIN PETER DUPREE (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a Washington, D.C., firefighter for his more than three decades of exceptional service. Captain Peter Dupree has served more than 31 years with the District of Columbia Fire Department. He started his firefighting career in 1977 as a volunteer with his hometown fire company in Avis, Pennsylvania, in Clinton County. Pete rose through the ranks and eventually became fire chief. In 1986, Pete moved to Maryland and joined the Berwyn Heights Volunteer Fire Department, Station 14, in Prince George’s County. That same month, Pete was appointed as a probationer for the District of Columbia Fire Department. After passing required courses, he was assigned to Truck 12 in Northwest D.C. In December of 2000, Pete achieved the rank of sergeant. Three years later, he would be promoted to lieutenant at Engine 18 on Capitol Hill. Then, in 2008, Pete became a captain in Northwest D.C. at Truck 9. He retired from the station in January after more than 31 years of service. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to thank Captain Peter Dupree, a native son of Clinton County, and wish him well in his retirement. 
LOCAL BENEFITS FROM THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (Mr. ROGERS of Alabama asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight a company in the Third Congressional District of 
Alabama that has given out $500 bonuses to all their 500 employees as a direct result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Russell Lands in Alexander City is the first company in my congressional district to distribute bonuses as a direct result of the tax overhaul. The historic tax reform legislation recently signed into law by President Trump is helping companies and hardworking families in Alabama and across America. Thanks to tax reform, U.S. companies are paying more than $3 billion in bonuses, and over 3 million workers have received a bonus or a pay increase because of the tax cuts. I am proud of Ben Russell and his company for leading the way on this, and I am thrilled that his employees are receiving this extra money. This bonus is a car payment, a new washing machine, or savings for school. This bonus represents opportunity, and I don’t think you would ever hear the employees at Russell Lands calling their bonus ‘‘crumbs.’’ 
b1915 CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF EMMA PRIMAS (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a sense of sadness but with joyful noise, if you will, to celebrate Mrs. Emma Primas, 112 years old, who passed away last month in the arms of the comforting Lord and her family. Mrs. Primas was a historic figure. She was someone who lived through the suffragette movement; lived through World War I; was a street car operator in San Francisco; the head of nutrition for the schools of San Francisco; a businessowner in Houston, Texas, where she owned a store and was able to provide for others who could not pay for the food. She paid poll tax to vote. She provided for her grandchildren. She loved her wonderful daughter and her wonderful grandchildren. She became an icon in our community. People flocked to her because she was alert and bright, and she could tell us the history not only of her life but of this Nation. How wonderful it was for her to be able to vote for the first AfricanAmerican President. When I hosted her in Washington with President Barack Obama, she said it was the greatest moment in her life. Obviously, I know the love of her children was even greater, but she was so excited. And when, of course, she met the former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, she was rejoiceful as well. To all of her wonderful grandchildren, I know that Saturday at the Community of Faith, February 10, we will celebrate her life. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in a moment of silence in honor of this great American, Mrs. Emma Primas, 112 years old. Though she has gone home to glory, she has celebrated her life as a great American and a great patriot. f 
AMERICA NOW KNOWS (Mr. GAETZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. GAETZ. Mr. Speaker, America now knows the truth. The Democratic Party hired the Perkins Law Firm. The Perkins Law Firm hired the Fusion GPS company. Fusion GPS needed two things: fake dirt on Donald Trump, and they needed a way to inject that fake dirt into the bloodstream of our intelligence community. So they hired Christopher Steele. And then they went and hired Nellie Ohr, the wife of senior Justice Department official Bruce Ohr. Now, Bruce Ohr’s portfolio included counternarcotics and antidrug work. But all of a sudden, after his wife gets hired from the money that you can trace back to the Democratic Party, Bruce Ohr starts taking counterintelligence meetings, meeting with Glenn Simpson and Christopher Steele, before and after the election. What should enrage the American people is the notion that cash at a political party could ever be convertible to a warrant to spy on political enemies in the United States of America. That is what we are fighting against. That is what is at issue. That is why we are going to do everything we can to hold the bad actors accountable and then institute reforms so that this type of thing never happens again. 
IN HONOR OF BLACK HISTORY MONTH The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. TAYLOR ). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. SOTO) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, in honor of Black History Month, I first would like to take a moment to remember a hero of the civil rights movement in central Florida. Harry T. Moore was born on November 18, 1905. He was an AfricanAmerican educator, a pioneer leader of the 
civil rights movement, and founder of the first branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the NAACP, in Brevard County, Florida. Harry T. Moore and his wife, Harriette Vyda Simms Moore, who was also an educator, were the victims of a bombing of their home in Mims, Florida. On that fateful Christmas night in 1951, he died in an ambulance on the way to the hospital in Seminole County, while she died January 3, 1952, at a hospital also in Sanford, Florida. Forensic work in 2005 to 2006 resulted in the naming of the probable perpetrators as four Ku Klux Klan members, all long dead by the time of the investigation. The Moores were trailblazers as the first NAACP members to fight for civil rights, and, unfortunately, were murdered as a result of their activism. Moore has been called the first martyr of the early stages of the civil rights movement. Mr. Harry T. Moore and Harriette Vyda Simms Moore, we salute and honor you. 
Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, in honor of Black History Month, I want to recognize Captain Keva Harris, born in Bartow, Florida, and raised in Haines City, Florida, in a family that stressed community involvement. While in high school, Ms. Harris worked with her grandmother to raise funds for band instruments and school trips. After her high school graduation, she started studying tae kwon do, opening a school for the Oakland community with her future husband, Ricky. She attended Polk Community College, and was hired as Haines City’s first AfricanAmerican female officer in 1993. While on the force, Captain Harris attended Warner University, graduating with a bachelor’s degree and an MBA. She also attended the University of Phoenix, graduating with a master’s in science and criminal justice. She is also the first Black woman in the city’s history to hold an administrative position with the police force, but always coming back to community involvement, she became commander of the community service division in 2015. Harris became a lieutenant in 2006, and later that year was promoted to captain. In addition to her police duties, Ms. Harris is a longstanding member of the Haines City branch of the NAACP, which her motherinlaw served as a longtime president. Captain Harris is a member of the Northeast Revitalization Group, an organization that serves the Oakland community with neighborhood cleanup, a Christmas breakfast, a local museum, and the city’s annual Martin Luther King, Jr., parade. She is also part of the Unity in the Community, started by a group of local pastors that give back to the community through backpack drives for schoolchildren, holiday turkey giveaways, and a health fair. She is a member of the New Beulah Missionary Baptist Church. Captain Keva Harris, we salute you. SALUTING AND HONORING THE AUSTIN FAMILY  
Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, in honor of Black History Month, I want to recognize the Austin family of Lake Wales, Florida. James P. Austin, Jr., was born in 1919. He served in the United States Army as a staff sergeant during World War II. Mr. Austin served as the Lake Wales NAACP president for over 33 years, founding the branch along with his wife, Jeresa Austin, and Reverend W.J.H. Black. During his tenure, both Austins were instrumental in the sitins and swim ins as far away as Ocala and St. Augustine in the 1960s, as well as the integration of the Polk Theatre in Lakeland in 1976. Mr. Austin was elected to the Lake Wales City Commission, vice mayor, and became the first AfricanAmerican mayor of Lake Wales in 1987. As well as a civil rights leader, Mr. Austin was a major developer in Lake Wales, building many of the homes on the northwest part of the city, and had a community center named after him. Jeresa lived for about 4 years after her husband’s death, serving as a teacher in Polk County schools. James’ brother, Reverend Allen Austin, was a longtime pastor of the First Institutional Missionary Baptist Church in Lake Wales, and for the past 5 years has served as pastor of the First Baptist Hilltop Church in Frostproof. James’ sister, Lula Jones, was born in 1925 in Lake Wales, Florida. After graduating, Ms. Jones worked as a housekeeper and, along with her brothers, was a member of the Lake Wales branch of the NAACP. Ms. Jones is involved with the American Legion Post 71 Auxiliary in Lake Wales, supporting veterans in the community. Ms. Jones said of her family’s service to the community: ‘‘We remember how it was back in the day and always worked to make it better for our children.’’ Ms. Jones is highly regarded as a pillar of the community. For that, we salute the Austin family. 
Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, in honor of Black History Month, I want to recognize Dr. Barbara Jenkins. Dr. Jenkins is the superintendent of Orange County Public Schools. She is a recognized education leader, who has been dedicated to serving the needs of students for over 30 years. In January 2017, she received a presidential appointment as director of the National Board of Education Sciences. She serves on the executive board of directors of multiple councils in the central Florida area. Also in 2017, she was named the Florida Superintendent of the Year, and she was one of four finalists for the national title. The Association of Latino Administrators and Superintendents named her HispanicServing School District Superintendent of the Year. The Florida Association for Career and Technical Education named her CTE Superintendent of the Year. Under Dr. Jenkins’ leadership, the district won the prestigious 2014 Broad Prize for Urban Education, which earned a half a million dollars for student scholarships. The district also received the Governor’s Sterling Award in 2014 and 2015, and the Sustained Excellence Award in 2017. Deeply engaged in the community, Dr. Jenkins serves on the board of directors of United Arts of Central Florida, Orlando Economic Partnership, Florida Hospital, Central Florida Commission on Homelessness, and the Orange County Youth Mental Health Commission. For that, Dr. Barbara Jenkins, we salute you. b1930 SALUTING AND HONORING LAWRENCE EPPS  
Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, in honor of Black History Month, I want to recognize Lawrence Epps. Lawrence Epps moved to Lake Wales with his grandmother when he was 12 years old. As a Boy Scout, he and his troop shoveled out the graves, quickly changed into their uniforms during the funerals, then changed again and dashed back to the cemetery to cover the graves back up, just as a young boy. About 4 years ago, he began driving the ambulance on calls while also working for James P. Austin Construction Company, preparing the newly built homes for occupancy. An alumnus of Roosevelt High School, he transferred to Lake Wales High School in his senior year in 1969, the first year that the schools in Polk County were integrated. Epps completed his associate’s degree in mortuary science at MiamiDade Junior College in 1973, and returned to Polk County serving as a special deputy with the Polk County Sheriff’s Office from 1974 to 1980. Epps, who was barely 26 when he began Epps Memorial Funeral Home in 1976, has served the bereaved of the community for over four decades. In 2013, the State organization named him Mortician of the Year, which Tommy L. Hayes, president of the Florida Morticians Association, says is an honor bestowed by Epps’ peers. Two decades later in 1996, Epps achieved a personal goal when he was ordained a minister through the Progressive Missionary & Educational Baptist State Convention. Mr. Epps has been president of the Roosevelt Alumni Association since 1978, an organization that helps raise money through scholarships and school 
supplies for students of Lake Wales. He also is a member of the Lake Wales Chamber of Commerce and has been a member of the board since 1998. Epps has said that the mortuary business is a lot of hard work and dedication, but the rewards that come with helping people get through a difficult time are great. He is a firm believer in the adage, ‘‘The village raises the child,’’ and plans to continue giving back to his adopted home for many years to come. And for that, Mr. Epps, we salute you. 
Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, in honor of Black History Month, I want to recognize Russell Drake. Russell Drake is the president of the Orange County Democratic Black Caucus. He is a Christian man, community activist, engineering professional; and he attended Howard University with a focus in systems and computer science. Upon finishing school, he moved to Orlando, Florida, where he has worked as a systems engineer at two Fortune 500 corporations over the last 15 years. Outside of work, Russell has a focus and passion for uplifting the community, leading him to be a very active member in the Orlando metropolitan area through individual and group efforts of service. On his own accord, Russell is a supporter of various youth programs, mentoring activities, food drives, homeless empowerment initiatives, voter action rallies, and civic and political awareness causes. Mr. Drake is part of the African American Chamber of Commerce of Central Florida, Central Florida Urban League Young Professionals, National PanHellenic Council of Metro Orlando, NPHC, the NAACP Orange County Branch, the National Society of Black Engineers, the Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, and the Democratic Black Caucus of Florida. Mr. Drake’s active nature has earned him appointments to the African American Advisory Board of WESH 2 News Orlando and to the Boy Scouts of America, Whitney M. Young Council. In spiritual life, Mr. Drake is a member of the Saint Mark African Methodist Episcopal Church where he serves on the trustee board, usher board, praise and dance team, and men’s choir. Last but not least, Mr. Drake regards his lovely family to always come first. For that, Mr. Drake, we salute you. 
Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, in honor of Black History Month, I want to recognize Recy Taylor. Recy Taylor was a 24yearold African American in 1944 when she was kidnapped and raped maliciously by six White men in Abbeville, Alabama. The NAACP sent a young activist, Rosa Parks, to investigate this travesty. Like so many other crimes involving AfricanAmerican victims in this era, this crime was never brought to trial. After reporting the crime to local officials, Mrs. Taylor was intimidated to recant by vigilantes, but she did not. Even after an allWhite, allmale jury dismissed the first case after 5 minutes of deliberation, Recy Taylor, with the help of Rosa Parks and the NAACP, continued to organize and form the Committee for Equal Justice for the Rights of Mrs. Recy Taylor. This committee had 18 chapters across the Nation and included activists such as W.E.B. Du Bois, Mary Church Terrell, and Langston Hughes. The committee lobbied Alabama Governor Chauncey Sparks until he called for another investigation. In the documentary, ‘‘The Rape of Recy Taylor,’’ Mrs. Taylor said: ‘‘ . . . they didn’t try and do nothing about it. I can’t help but tell the truth of what they done to me.’’ Mrs. Taylor’s acts of courage were one of the catalysts that led to the modernday civil rights movement. She was also recently referenced by the famous and worldrenowned Oprah Winfrey in her ‘‘Time’s Up’’ speech and will forever be memorialized as a result. Many of the members of the committee went on to plan and lead the Montgomery Bus Boycott as well. Today, I posthumously honor this longterm Winter Haven resident in my district, Recy Taylor, for her act of courage and bravery, and for that I recognize you, Mrs. Taylor. HONORING DESMOND MEADE  
Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, in honor of Black History Month, I want to recognize Desmond Meade. Desmond Meade is a formerly homeless returning citizen who overcame many obstacles to eventually be the current executive director of the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, chair of the Floridians for Fair Democracy, chair of the Florida Coalition on Black Civic Participation, and Black Men’s Roundtable. Desmond is a graduate of the Florida International University College of Law. As president of the FRRC, which is recognized for its work on felon disenfranchisement issues, Desmond led the citizen’s initiative to allow Florida voters to decide to end the disenfranchisement and discrimination against people with felony convictions, create a more human reentry system that will enhance successful reentry, reduce mass incarceration, and increase public safety by empowering those impacted by our criminal justice system. Desmond spoke before national organizations, such as the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and Bread for the World, on the challenges of returning citizens as well. Desmond recently orchestrated a historic meeting at the White House between returning citizens and the President’s administration. He was recognized as a foot soldier on the Melissa HarrisPerry show on MSNBC. Desmond recently successfully got a restoration of rights amendment onto the ballot which gives Floridians the right to vote to end this legacy of Jim Crow laws in the South that bar felons from restoring their rights after they have fulfilled their sentences and met their debt to society. We are one of only four States left with this terribly discriminatory law. Desmond is married and also has five beautiful children, and for that, Mr. Meade, we honor you. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. f
