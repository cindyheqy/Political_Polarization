Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Lieutenant Colonel Robert Miller, a veteran of the Marine Corps from Bogalusa, Louisiana, which I have the privilege to represent. Colonel Miller went above and beyond to answer the call of service to our Nation. He fought in three wars between 1945 and 1973: World War II, the Korean war, and the Vietnam war. He received three Purple Hearts during his time with the Marines, and some of his war experiences are quite impressive. While in Korea, American forces suffered enormous casualties due to bitter cold and frostbite, yet Colonel Miller’s platoon did not suffer a single casualty. He was asked later how he protected his men, and he shared with them a trick he learned from a gentleman, Delos Nobles, a homeless man from his home of Bogalusa. Mr. Nobles would line his clothes and shoes with old newspapers to block the cold. Colonel Miller and his men asked friends and family to send them as many newspapers as they could get, and the results helped earn him a battlefield commission. Maybe fittingly, Colonel Miller eventually earned a degree in journalism from the University of Maryland. Colonel Miller also caught the eye of Marilyn Monroe while serving in Korea. His rifle platoon provided security to her while she visited the DMZ. She arranged a front row seat for him at her show. She even gave him her phone number and told him to call her when he got home from the war. He did, and the two went on to become great friends. Following his military service, Colonel Miller started what now is known as Venture Scout Crew 313, which specializes on learning survival skills and winning national white water canoe races. That legacy includes 18 national championships in open cruisers, 27 national championships in advanced aluminums, and 26 national championships in the novice division. His scouts also serve as stretcher bearers during medical emergencies at LSU football games. There is a reason that some of us joke that our Tigers are more like the Cardiac Cats. His work with youth garnered him national and international leadership awards. Colonel Miller has stayed active throughout his long life as a member of the local Lion’s Club and chairman of the Christmas in Cassidy Park in Bogalusa. He is certainly a shining example of public service, someone who puts community and country first. We could always use a few more Colonel Millers in whatever community we call home, and I thank him for everything and all he has done for Bogalusa and the United States of America. f 
b1400 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. DESJARLAIS ) at 2 p.m. 
PRAYER The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: Loving God, we give You thanks for giving us another day. Bless the Members who are laboring through these challenging days with wisdom, magnanimity, and a shared desire to serve our Nation at a pivotal time for us all. May their efforts bring results that rise above any sense of victory for one side or the other, but rather mutual benefit. In the end, may we continue to trust that You would not abandon those who put their trust in You. 
May all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory. Amen. 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Ms. NORTON led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
CAMERAS IN THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, it is time to remove the veil of secrecy from the hallowed halls of the Supreme Court. Americans have the right to watch the proceedings in person, but only 50 members of the public can get into the small courtroom at a time. Technology allows discreet videoing, but for some reason, there are those who want to keep these proceedings hidden from the American public. We have the best judicial system ever created. We should not hide it. Cameras should be allowed in the most important court in the world. I know cameras can be placed in a courtroom without disruption or distraction, because I did it. For 22 years, I served as a felony court judge in Houston, Texas. I heard over 25,000 criminal cases and nearly 1,000 jury trials, and many of those were filmed by the television media. Justice would be better served if the black robe of secrecy was removed from the United States Supreme Court and the proceedings were filmed. Because justice is the one thing we should always find in America. And that is just the way it is. 
WHY HAS JUDGE KAVANAUGH NOT REQUESTED AN FBI INVESTIGATION (Ms. NORTON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, although the Republican Senate has refused the customary FBI investigation into allegations against Judge Kavanaugh by Dr. Ford and others, there is evidence that should be weighed. Dr. Ford is not only willing to offer sworn testimony at the hearing, she has requested an FBI investigation with the required FBI questioning under penalty of perjury. Judge Kavanaugh is an expert on all our legal processes. Why hasn’t he asked for the standard FBI investigation? Moreover, apparently understanding the seriousness of her allegations, Dr. Ford has also taken the unusual step of being polygraphed. A lie detector test is not required, although law enforcement sometimes requests it. It would be a fair question for Senators to ask Judge Kavanaugh why he did not request an FBI investigation and whether he would take a polygraph test, too. f 
CELEBRATING 100TH BIRTHDAY OF WALTER ‘‘STICKY’’ BURCH (Mr. BUDD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Walter ‘‘Sticky’’ Burch, who is going to be 100 years old on October 21. And that is a great day, Mr. Speaker. It is also my birthday, although mine is just a few years after his. Walter Burch was born in Asheville but grew up in Greensboro and spent much of his life serving in the Greensboro Police Department. His service to our Nation began just 9 days after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. During the Second World War, he helped gather intelligence on enemy operations in Europe, but his service to his country did not end there. Walter returned home and joined the police department, where he served for nearly 50 years. He officially retired in 1981, but he ran for sheriff just a few years later. He went on to serve two terms as the sheriff of Guilford County. Since retiring from law enforcement, Walter has remained deeply involved in our community, and the people of Guilford County are lucky to have him. Mr. Speaker, please join me in celebrating the 100th birthday of Walter ‘‘Sticky’’ Burch and his lifelong commitment to public service. 
COMMUNICATION FROM THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following communication from the Clerk of the House of Representatives: 
COMMUNICATION FROM THE DEMOCRATIC LEADER The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following communication from the Honorable NANCY  PELOSI , Democratic Leader: 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. RICHMOND. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6735, the PublicPrivate Cybersecurity Cooperation Act. Mr. Speaker, protecting our Federal information systems is an enormous task. As ranking member of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Protection Subcommittee, I hear more often than I would like about the challenges of recruiting and maintaining the Federal cyber workforce. That is true even at the Department of Homeland Security. As DHS works to address ongoing workforce challenges, we have to think creatively and leverage untapped resources of talent. Across the country, there are white hat hackers who want to apply their considerable cyber skills to report vulnerabilities found on government information systems to Federal authorities. But today, these ethical hackers cannot research and report bugs on DHS’ systems without being in violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. In 2016, the Department of Defense piloted Hack the Pentagon, which gave white hat hackers 24 days to find unique vulnerabilities in certain DOD information systems and report them for a reward. The program was so successful, DOD established a permanent vulnerability disclosure program to allow ethical hackers to search for and report bugs on DOD information systems without violating the law. That program has enjoyed similar success to Hack the Pentagon. Members of the Homeland Security Committee have been urging DHS to establish a vulnerability disclosure program for several years. At a hearing with Secretary Nielsen in April, my colleague on the Cybersecurity Subcommittee, Mr. LANGEVIN , asked the Secretary whether the Department had in place a mechanism for vulnerabilities to be reported. Secretary Nielsen testified that the Department had no clear process in place to accept information about bugs in DHS information systems and agreed to work with the committee to establish one. Five months have passed, and the Department is not any closer to establishing a vulnerability disclosure program of its own. Vulnerability disclosure programs are an emerging industry best practice and are recommended by the updated NIST Cybersecurity Framework. White hat hackers are an enormous pool of talent that the Federal Government has largely failed to leverage. DHS can no longer afford to leave that kind of talent on the table. 
H.R. 6735 would push DHS in the right direction by requiring it to put in place policies to ensure that civic minded hackers can research and report bugs found on certain information systems without breaking the law. Before I close, I would like to express my disappointment that S. 1281, the Hack DHS Act, is not being considered on the floor today. S. 1281, which would create a bug bounty pilot program at DHS, was approved by voice vote in the committee and is consistent with the objectives of H.R. 6735, which I support. b1415 It is unclear why S. 1281 is not being considered today. I urge House leadership to bring S. 1281 to the floor later this fall. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6735. In the current security environment, vulnerability disclosure policies have emerged as a critical component of cybersecurity without any organization. DHS is the lead Federal Department charged with securing government civilian networks. DHS should be leading by example, not playing catchup. Today, the Department of Defense and the GSA have vulnerability disclosure programs in operation. It is time for DHS to join them. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6735, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support this bill. It is at a time when there is a lot of partisanship going on. I think it is healthy to see a truly bipartisan bill on such an important issue regarding our national security. I think, as the gentleman from Louisiana pointed out, this is modeled after a program that the Department of Defense successfully deployed, and I am proud of the record my committee has had on passing, I think, close to 110 bills now, and almost all of them are bipartisan. Mr. Speaker, I urge my Senate colleagues to at least take up some of them and do the same, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6735, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn. f 
BORDER TUNNEL TASK FORCE ACT Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 6740) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to establish Border Tunnel Task Forces, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 6740 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Border Tunnel Task Force Act’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL) and the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. RICHMOND ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. 
Mr. M CCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Border Tunnel Task Force Act. Mr. Speaker, some of the most dangerous threats to our homeland are coming across our southern border. Drug smugglers are bringing dangerous narcotics and fueling America’s epidemic of opioids. Human traffickers and transnational gangs like MS–13 are infecting our neighborhoods and endangering our kids. Even potential known or suspected terrorists are trying to make their way into America by exploiting our weak borders. All of these groups are a serious national security concern. They are also very determined and creative, and one of the ways they avoid detection is by digging crossborder tunnels. In August, a tunnel the length of two football fields was discovered below a closed fastfood restaurant in Arizona. This pathway was used to smuggle cocaine, heroin, fentanyl, and methamphetamines. In 2016, 7 tons of marijuana and 1 ton of cocaine were found in a tunnel not far from San Diego. In my home State of Texas, a tunnel was discovered under the Rio Grande in El Paso back in 2010, also for smuggling drugs. Unfortunately, the problem is not new. Authorities have discovered nearly 200 crossborder tunnels since 1990. We must do more to shut these tunnels down. This legislation will establish Border Tunnel Task Forces to enhance the ability of DHS to detect these tunnels and identify criminal networks. These teams will be made up of ICE, CBP, and other Department personnel. They will be assisted by State, local, and Tribal law enforcement agencies. These teams will deploy to locations along the border where the greatest 
risks to our national security exist. In working together, they will be able to better secure our border and protect Americans from a growing list of threats. This bill will minimize a unique, but serious, threat to our homeland. I want to thank my very dear friend and colleague, Congressman SESSIONS , for all of his hard work on this issue, and I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RICHMOND. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6740, the Border Tunnel Task Force Act. H.R. 6740 formally authorizes the Department of Homeland Security’s Border Tunnel Task Force. The first illicit crossborder tunnel under the United StatesMexico border was discovered in 1990. Since then, law enforcement has uncovered more than 200 tunnels, primarily in Arizona and California. Crossborder tunnels are exploited by smugglers to move all types of contraband, currency, and people into the United States without detection. Unearthed tunnels range from crudely formed, shallow tunnels, to elaborately constructed passages that include lighting or railways and emerge on the U.S. side in facilities large enough to accommodate deliveries by tractor trailers. Incredibly, some tunnels are interconnected with municipal stormwater and sewer systems on both sides of the border. In one case, a 2016 law enforcement operation uncovered a tunnel half a mile inland with a ton of cocaine and 7 tons of marijuana in it. Just last month, about 200 yards from the border, there was a traffic stop arrest of an individual with more than 300 pounds of illegal drugs, which resulted in the execution of a search warrant on his property and the discovery of a tunnel that went from a longabandoned Kentucky Fried Chicken that was on his property directly to a house in Mexico. Inside that 600foot long tunnel, Federal agents discovered $1 million worth of hard drugs. These discoveries did not just happen. They were the result of collaborative, binational law enforcement operations under the auspices of the Border Tunnel Task Forces that the Department of Homeland Security maintains. H.R. 6740 seeks to authorize the task forces to ensure that this valuable work continues. I ask my House colleagues to join me in supporting DHS’ efforts to head off smuggling through illicit crossborder tunnels and vote in favor of H.R. 6740. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. SESSIONS ), the distinguished chairman of the Rules Committee and the author of this bill. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate and thank the young chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, the gentleman from Austin, Texas, who has had the responsibility and the authority vested in him as chairman of the committee to make sure that we look at, approach, and correct the problems that we have at our borders. I want to thank the distinguished gentleman for his years of service not only to the Department of Justice, but to the American people and the rule of law. Mr. Speaker, every day we in Texas and around the United States deal with crime, drugs, and gangs that are streaming into the United States from our southern border. Both Chairman MCCAULand I recognize that the challenge that we have ahead of us here in Washington is not only to support and defend our Constitution, but it is actually to defend people who live back home, wherever they might be in the United States. No part of the United States is safe if our southern border is not effectively taken care of. That is why we are here today with a bill that addresses this issue even further. That issue is that we must secure our borders to halt the flow of drugs that come into our country. We recognize that one of the most vulnerable piece parts that has been talked about today and that is known by law enforcement is that of the use of tunnels, which evade not only the sight of law enforcement, but take place under the secrecy of those who would intend to bring illegal drugs, narcotics, people, and other unspecified but dangerous items into this country. These tunnels are difficult to detect without sophisticated equipment or intelligence that advises law enforcement not only where they are, but how they might discover them. Said another way, cartels and criminals are one step ahead of the good guys, our law enforcement. Just last month, United States Homeland Security agents discovered a 600footlong drug tunnel running between a private home in Mexico and an abandoned food restaurant in Arizona. Near the tunnel, they discovered—as has been talked about here today and it is worth repeating—261 pounds of methamphetamines, 14 pounds of cocaine, 45 pounds of heroin, and almost 7 pounds of fentanyl. That is enough to have supplied over 3 million people with dosage units that could cause them not only harm, but also take their life. Working with Chairman MICHAEL  MCCAUL, our young chairman from Austin, Texas, I am pleased to inform you that earlier this month we introduced H.R. 6740, the Border Tunnel Task Force Act. This bill will enhance not only law enforcement—Federal, State, and local law enforcement—but also Tribal law enforcement with the ability that they need to make sure that these crossborderrelated threats are taken care of properly. First of all, the task force will look at the issue and understand how these cartels and drug gangs make these tunnels, where they make them, and when they make them. Secondly, the task force will ensure that they are looking out and working together. Specifically, this legislation requires the Department of Homeland Security to establish a Border Tunnel Task Force, which would be comprised of personnel from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, known as CBP; U.S. Border Patrol; U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, known as ICE; and Homeland Security investigators. These groups would work together on border issues where enhanced information could be shared and law enforcement action would contribute to our border security missions. It is my hope that the establishment of these law enforcement groups will help facilitate not only teamwork among Federal, State, local, and Tribal officials, but they will also help execute coordinated activities to crack down on gangs that continue to seek ways to do their illegal trade and business along our border which places Americans at risk. In closing, I would like to once again thank Chairman MCCAUL and his Homeland Security Committee, its members on a bipartisan basis, and their staff for recognizing that this is a true threat against the United States of America, our citizens, and perhaps our most vulnerable, our children. Their work in protecting our country is paramount, and so I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6740, the Border Tunnel Task Force Act, a bill that will encourage, help, and strengthen law enforcement in this activity. It will protect the United States of America and protect American families from drug cartels and drug trafficking. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the young chairman for his hard work and also the gentleman from Louisiana, who recognized, on a bipartisan basis, that we must protect our homeland. b1430 Mr. Speaker, DHS’s Border Tunnel Task Forces have been effective at identifying and closing tunnels through which smugglers illicitly move drugs, launder money, and other contraband into the United States. As such, I support these task forces, but would note that there are two 20foot high fences—or ‘‘wall’’ as the President likes to call them—near the U.S.Mexico border in San Luis, Arizona, the town where a tunnel was discovered under an abandoned restaurant last month. Logic tells you that when smugglers cannot easily move goods or people over or through physical barriers, they will tunnel underneath. Importantly, the measure under consideration today includes language offered by Representative VELA, the ranking member of the Border and 
Maritime Security Subcommittee, to require DHS to determine whether border barriers impact the proliferation of crossborder tunnels. With DHS having dedicated nearly $9 million over the past decade to remediating and countering crossborder tunnel threats, DHS needs to know whether its wall agenda is driving more illicit crossborder tunnels. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6740, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, every day, we are seeing drugs coming in from Mexico, known or suspected terrorists, and dangerous opioids. We see fentanyl coming in from China into Mexico where they mix it with methamphetamines and heroin. It is really toxic, poisonous stuff. Fentanyl is so toxic that our canines die when they sniff it, yet that is being put into drugs coming across the U.S.Mexico border into the United States to pollute and infect our children and our veterans. It is time for this to stop. I hope that we will be able to take up, perhaps in November, our border security bill, which I think would go a long ways to getting this job done. In the meantime, this bill, I think, will go a long ways to stopping a very organized, sophisticated route of drugs, bad people, and bad things into the United States, and that is shutting down these tunnels. Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6740, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
PROTECTING CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE AGAINST DRONES AND EMERGING THREATS ACT Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 6620) to require the Department of Homeland Security to prepare a threat assessment relating to unmanned aircraft systems, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 6620 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Protecting Critical Infrastructure Against Drones and Emerging Threats Act’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL) and the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. RICHMOND ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. 
Mr. M CCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this legislation that will help protect the American people from threatening drones. Drones are being used to cross America more and more every year. News outlets use drones to capture footage for a breaking story. Photographers use them to take photos and videos at weddings, sporting events, and rock concerts. They also are used by law enforcement to help document crime scenes or assist with search and rescue operations. Those are all good things. However, drones or other unmanned aerial systems can also pose a threat if they are controlled by terrorists or criminals. For example, ISIS used them to carry out attacks and conduct reconnaissance overseas. Here at home, criminals are using drones to smuggle drugs across our borders and surveil law enforcement. The FBI even disrupted a plot to attack the Pentagon with a drone loaded with grenades. The threats we face from drones are constantly evolving as the technology becomes more accessible across the globe. We need to do more to confront these dangers. This legislation requires the Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis at DHS to develop a drone threat assessment with information gathered from Federal, State, local, and private sector partners. It also directs the Under Secretary to establish a secure communications infrastructure for receiving and analyzing such threat information. Further, this bill sets up a voluntary mechanism for critical infrastructure owners and operators to report information on similar emerging threats. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman RICHMOND and Congressman R ATCLIFFE  for their hard work on this issue. I think this bill will allow us to strengthen our intelligence gathering and stay one step ahead of our enemies. I am pleased that the Senate and House were also able to include the Preventing Emerging Threats Act, legislation I introduced with Congressman CHABOT , in the FAA bill that will be on the floor tomorrow. This will give DHS the authority to counter drones in our airspace if they are determined to be a threat to national security. This bill provides DHS and DOJ with the ability to act quickly and effectively when a drone poses a security risk to largescale events, national security events, and government facilities. Secretary Nielsen described this legislation as ‘‘a critical step in enabling the Department to address this threat.’’ Let’s provide DHS with the tools it needs to confront these threats before they get worse. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support these bipartisan bills, and I reserve the balance of my time. 
COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION AND  INFRASTRUCTURE , HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , Washington, DC, September 21, 2018. Hon. MICHAEL MCCAUL, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, Washington, DC. DEAR CHAIRMAN MCCAUL: I write concerning H.R. 6620, the Protecting Critical Infrastructure Against Drones and Emerging Threats Act. This legislation includes matters that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction 
of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. In order to expedite floor consideration of H.R. 6620, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure will forgo action on this bill. However, this is conditional on our mutual understanding that forgoing consideration of the bill would not prejudice the Committee with respect to the appointment of conferees or to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject matters contained in the bill or similar legislation that fall within the Committee’s Rule X jurisdiction. I request you urge the Speaker to name members of the Committee to any conference committee named to consider such provisions. Please place a copy of this letter and your response acknowledging our jurisdictional interest in the Congressional Record during House Floor consideration of the bill. I look forward to working with the Committee on Homeland Security as the bill moves through the legislative process. Sincerely, BILLSHUSTER , Chairman. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON HOMELAND SECURITY , Washington, DC, September 21, 2018. Hon. BILLSHUSTER , Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Washington, DC. DEAR CHAIRMAN SHUSTER : Thank you for your letter regarding H.R. 6620, the ‘‘Protecting Critical Infrastructure Against Drones and Emerging Threats Act.’’ I appreciate your support in bringing this legislation before the House of Representatives, and accordingly, understand that the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure will forego further consideration of the bill. The Committee on Homeland Security concurs with the mutual understanding that by foregoing consideration of this bill at this time, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure does not waive any jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this bill or similar legislation in the future. In addition, should a conference on this bill be necessary, I would support your request to have the Committee represented on the conference committee. I will insert copies of this exchange in the Congressional Record during consideration of this bill on the House floor. I thank you for your cooperation in this matter. Sincerely, MICHAEL T. M CCAUL, Chairman. 
Mr. RICHMOND. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6620, the Protecting Critical Infrastructure Against Drones and Emerging Threats Act. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6620 would require the Department of Homeland Security to take action to better understand and address an emerging threat posed by unmanned aerial systems—or drones—to our Nation’s critical infrastructure. These technologies are not new, but their applications have evolved rapidly in recent years. Some of these uses are important to keeping the public safe, growing our economy, and providing new ways to explore the world, including giving first responders better information in an emergency, for example. But, we also know that drones can be used for espionage, be weaponized, or even to carry out a terrorist attack. My district in Louisiana has one of the Nation’s highest concentrations of critical infrastructure, including pipelines, refineries, ports, airports, stadiums, and a wide range of other key assets and resources. When I speak with critical infrastructure owners and operators, they recognize the benefits of drone technology. Many of them even put them to good use in their own businesses. At the same time, they are troubled by the risks posed by unknown, unauthorized drones operating over their facilities. Over the past year, I have asked owners and operators what we in government can do to help them address this threat. What I heard is that, at a minimum, they need a way to report potentially dangerous drone activity to DHS when they detect it. In a hearing this spring before the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Protection Subcommittee, where I serve as ranking member, stakeholders from the chemical industry testified about this challenge on the record. They told us that when a facility detects a drone in their airspace, they aren’t sure what to do about it, or even who to tell. H.R. 6620 would address this gap in a few ways. First, it would require DHS to establish a channel for reporting information on drones, as well as other emerging threats, securely, through a communications infrastructure, developed in conjunction with the Department’s chief information officer. This bill would also direct DHS’s Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis to develop and disseminate a threat assessment on unmanned aerial systems and other emerging threats associated with drone technology. The assessment would be informed by Federal, State, local, and private sector partners, and prepared in consultation with other DHS components, like the National Protection and Programs Directorate, that have relevant expertise. Finally, H.R. 6620 would require DHS to report its findings to Congress within 1 year. Together, these provisions call on DHS to take a closer look at a significant threat to our Nation’s critical infrastructure—the threat of droneenabled attacks—while also creating an enduring mechanism for DHS to continue gathering information on emerging threats from the owners and operators who stand on the front line of defense. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6620 would direct the Department of Homeland Security to do more to understand, assess, and respond to the threat posed by drones, while also creating an avenue for two way information sharing about emerging threats. My bill creates a new channel for critical infrastructure owners and operators to report potentially dangerous drone activity in their airspace, and other new threats as they evolve. Creating a way for owners and operators to relay this information, on a voluntary basis, would give DHS access to better data and a more comprehensive view of the threat environment. Before I yield back, I would like to also express support for a related provision in the FAA package that is expected to be considered tomorrow. It would allow DHS to research technologies to counter threats of unmanned aerial systems being exploited to carry out terrorism or dangerous activity. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6620, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, on September 11, a United Airlines flight was headed towards the Capitol. Thank God those heroes that day brought down that airliner in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, and this great building that we are standing in today was not destroyed with an image I don’t think the American people could accept. However, those terrorists are exploiting these drones. We have seen them in Iraq and Syria with explosives and chemical weapons. We have also disrupted plots for the use of drones against both the Pentagon and the United States Capitol. A drone, unlike an airplane, could hit the United States Capitol very quickly. We need to give the Department the tools and the authorities necessary to protect our American institutions. Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6620, the Protecting Critical Infrastructure Against Drones and Emerging Threats Act. This much needed measure would direct the Department of Homeland Security to complete a vulnerability assessment of the threat posed by Unmanned Air Systems (UAS) to our critical infrastructure assets. The results of the assessment would be reported to Congress, providing policymakers with much needed information to better protect our critical infrastructure assets. Unmanned Air Systems, or drones, hold great promise, and may one day change the world as we know it. As the technology develops however, there is always the risk that malicious actors may seek to use it to cause harm or destruction. Drones offer the ability for almost anyone to bypass most physical security measures of our critical infrastructure facilities. These facilities, such as nuclear power plants and oil refineries, depend on physical security and access control to ensure that operations are secured and remain operational. Drones could potentially allow a malicious actor to bypass the security of a facility, carry out an explosive or chemical attack, or conduct surveillance of prohibited areas. At a time when our critical infrastructure assets are under constant attack, and have suffered serious breaches in recent years, we must take action to ensure that the ability of our citizens and the ability of federal agencies to carry out their duties are resilient. 
As a longtime advocate of a government that works efficiently for the people, it is clear that current security practices protecting our critical infrastructure are neither sufficient nor consistent. Without an honest effort to even get a obtain view of the security risks facing critical infrastructure assets we will continue to be increasingly vulnerable. While conducting threat assessments like this will harden the security posture of the federal government and our critical infrastructure assets, we are still suffering from a shortage of workers with the requisite skills to secure them. To address this, I have introduced the Cyber Security Education and Federal Workforce Enhancement Act (H.R. 1981), which would address our cyber workforce shortage by establishing an Office of Cybersecurity Education and Awareness within DHS which will focus on: Recruiting information assurance, cybersecurity, and computer security professionals; Providing grants, training programs, and other support for kindergarten through grade 12, secondary, and postsecondary computer security education programs; Supporting guest lecturer programs in which professional computer security experts lecture computer science students at institutions of higher education; Identifying youth training programs for students to work in parttime or summer positions at federal agencies; and Developing programs to support underrepresented minorities in computer security fields with programs at minorityserving institutions, including Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanicserving institutions, Native American colleges, AsianAmerican institutions, and rural colleges and universities. Mr. Speaker, government agencies and the owners of critical infrastructure alike continue to struggle to identify the factors and technologies that put them at risk. In closing, Mr. Speaker, I urge all members to join me in voting to pass H.R. 6620, the ‘‘Protecting Critical Infrastructure Against Drones and Emerging Threats Act’’. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6620. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
SECURE BORDER COMMUNICATIONS ACT Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 6742) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to ensure that appropriate officers and agents of U.S. Customs and Border Protection are equipped with secure radios or other twoway communication devices, supported by system interoperability, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 6742 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Secure Border Communications Act’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL) and the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. RICHMOND ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. 
Mr. M CCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. b1445 Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Secure Border Communications Act. Every day our CBP agents and officers serve on the front lines in the fight to secure our homeland. They face threats from armed drug cartels, dangerous gangs like MS–13, human traffickers, and potential terrorists. These brave individuals take pride in serving with vigilance, integrity, and professionalism in order to keep us safe. To be successful, however, they must be equipped with the tools they need to do their jobs well. Too often, the communications devices and radios used by CBP officers and other agents are outdated and unreliable. For instance, Border Patrol agents patrolling on the ground may not have direct radio contact with CBP air assets or other law enforcement officers working the area. This hinders interagency communications and jeopardizes their mission and safety. At a subcommittee hearing earlier this year, a Border Patrol agent stated that she had been issued a radio that often failed. At times, she would need to communicate with a fellow agent but was forced to use her personal cell phone. We cannot allow these kinds of technical failures to endanger the lives of our agents and weaken our national security. We must do better. Fortunately, we can begin to fix this problem today. This legislation will ensure that CBP agents and officers are equipped with interoperable and secure radios or twoway communication devices. In addition, this bill highlights the importance of reliable encrypted communications that will prevent powerful cartels from intercepting sensitive information, such as our CBP agents’ and officers’ locations. Passing this bill is a simple step that we can take to help our CBP agents do their jobs and protect our homeland. I would like to thank Congressman MAST for all his hard work on this issue. Congressman MASTis no stranger to service and sacrifice, serving overseas in our wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and he has the scars to prove it. We thank him for his service. It is a great honor to have him sponsor a bill from our committee. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.

M CCAUL, Chairman. 
Mr. RICHMOND. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6742, the Secure Border Communications Act. Mr. Speaker, it is essential that the men and women of the Department of Homeland Security have reliable and effective communications equipment in the field. Unfortunately, in recent years, U.S. Customs and Border Protection has been unable to achieve and maintain baseline communications capabilities, with devices exhibiting a range of issues from system incompatibility to outright inoperability. For Border Patrol agents in remote areas of the border, particularly along the U.S.Canadian border, such issues give rise to troubling operational and officer safety challenges. In response, H.R. 6742 directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to ensure that CBP agents and officers are equipped with secure radio technologies that are interoperable regardless of where used along the border. Additionally, it authorizes the Secretary to evaluate new and emerging communications technologies to determine their suitability for use along the border. On a related note, a recent positive development came this summer when CBP awarded $26 million in contracts to upgrade their mission critical equipment. While CBP is slowly upgrading their communication networks and equipment, H.R. 6742 underscores Congress’ interest in seeing meaningful progress. As such, I support H.R. 6742 and ask my colleagues to do the same. Mr. Speaker, in closing, it is our duty as Members of Congress to ensure that the men and women who patrol and protect our border are trained and equipped to do their jobs. Unreliable communication in areas between ports of entry or remote areas due to system inoperability is an issue H.R. 6742 aims to fix. It seeks to do so by placing on the shoulders of the Secretary of Homeland Security the responsibility for ensuring that each agent or officer is equipped with secure, reliable radios. Mr. Speaker, I support this approach. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 6742, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, this ensures that not only are communication devices operable but that they are interoperable between agents down on the border risking their lives day in and day out. I can’t thank them enough. I have been down to the border so many times, and I see the harsh conditions that they operate under. I just want to send a message of gratitude from the United States Congress and our Committee on Homeland Security, and thank them for the work that they do tirelessly. Honestly, I think we don’t thank them enough for what they do. The encryption issue is vitally important because the drug cartels are getting so sophisticated that they can pick up communications of our law enforcement. This bill will go a long way to help protect those communications and make sure that they can do their job in a more safe and efficient manner in protecting the American public. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6742, the Secure Border Communications Act. Every single day the brave law enforcement officers of the United States Customs and Border Protection put themselves in harm’s way in order to secure our borders and ports of entry. This bill will strengthen interagency border security communication and communication within U.S. Customs and Border Protection by improving communication technologies for all CBP officers and agents. When agents or officers are in the field, secure communications with other CBP personnel and law enforcement agencies is imperative to mission success and officer safety. Currently, communication devices and radios used by officers and agents are outdated and hinder interagency communication. I never want there to be a circumstance where a CBP officer or agent is operating in a remote area along our border and is not able to call for backup or whose location is intercepted by the cartels due to defective devices. We must not accept that as a possibility; we must ensure that our agents and officers are fully equipped with the proper technology. H.R. 6742 will require the Department of Homeland Security to ensure that CBP personnel are equipped with secure radios or other twoway communication devices. These devices will allow officers and agents to communicate between ports of entry and inspection stations, and with other law enforcement entities operating in the same area of responsibility. I want to thank my friend and colleague, Chairman MCCAUL, for his cosponsorship and leadership on this important bill. Mr. Speaker, we are in the midst of a war on terror and continue to be the target of radicals who want to do our country harm. Ensuring our law enforcement officers operating along the borders and at our ports of entry are fully equipped is essential to national security. Beyond the threat of terrorism, securing our border is vitally important to preventing drug and human trafficking. Improving communication is a critical component of this mission. Mr. Speaker, let’s take some decisive action to secure our border. Let’s pass this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6742. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
SERGEANT JOHN TOOMBS RESIDENTIAL REHABILITATION TREATMENT FACILITY Mr. DESJARLAIS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs be discharged from further consideration of the bill (H.R. 2634) to designate the Mental Health Residential Rehabilitation Treatment Facility Expansion of the Department of Veterans Affairs Alvin C. York Medical Center in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, as the ‘‘Sergeant John Toombs Residential Rehabilitation Treatment Facility’’, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. ARRINGTON ). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Tennessee? There was no objection. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2634 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, was read the third time, and passed, and a motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS EXPIRING AUTHORITIES ACT OF 2018 Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 3479) to amend title 38, United States Code, to extend certain expiring provisions of law administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 3479 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
Except as otherwise expressly provided, whenever in this Act an amendment or repeal is expressed in terms of an amendment to, or repeal of, a section or other provision, the reference shall be considered to be made to a section or other provision of title 38, United States Code. TITLE I—EXTENSIONS OF AUTHORITY Subtitle A—Health Care Matters 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. DESJARLAIS ). Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON ) and the gentleman from California (Mr. TAKANO ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous material. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 3479, the Department of Veterans Affairs Expiring Authorities Act of 2018. This legislation represents bipartisan, bicameral agreement that would extend a number of expiring authorities impacting the lives of our veterans and their caregivers, their dependents, and their survivors. Swift passage of this legislation today would ensure that many of the benefits, programs, and services that they rely on would continue. The authorities that would be extended in this bill include authorities to provide nursing home care, counseling for women veterans, assistance for homeless veterans, transportation, childcare, adaptive sports programs, and housing and home loan services, just to name a few. To be clear, these are not new authorities. The costs associated with them have been assumed in the House passed appropriations bill for fiscal year 2019 and the 2020 advance appropriations. In addition to the extension of current programs, the bill would also make permanent several provisions, including provisions related to VA’s home loan program. It makes permanent the authority for disabled servicemembers to begin using VA vocational rehabilitation and employment benefits while on Active Duty. It makes permanent eligibility for specially adaptive housing grants for certain post9/11 veterans who have sustained severe disabilities while on Active Duty. It makes permanent VA’s authority to recover the cost of care for nonserviceconnected care. Finally, it makes permanent supportive services for caregivers, homeless veterans, and their families. The permanent authorization of these programs gives certainty to VA when administering them and certainty, most importantly, to the beneficiaries who rely on them. The bill would also require that a school offer instate tuition rates to veterans using vocational rehabilitation and employment benefits in order to be eligible for the GI Bill. This change would align instate tuition rules for veterans using the benefit with those already in law for students using the Post9/11 GI Bill. The bill also includes bipartisan compromise language that clarifies conflict of interest rules for VA employees and forprofit schools. Finally, the bill would also make a number of technical and clarifying changes to strengthen important legislation that Congress has previously passed, including the VA MISSION Act, the West Los Angeles Leasing Act, and the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support S. 3479, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 3479, the Department of Veterans Affairs Expiring Authorities Act of 2018. S. 3479 makes sure that some of the vital programs we have in place to take care of our veterans continue past the end of the fiscal year and continue to help our veterans. Included in this bill are provisions related to healthcare, benefits, homeless veterans, and other related issues. I am pleased to support extending programs related to support services for caregivers, childcare for certain veterans receiving healthcare, and a pilot program on counseling in retreat settings for women veterans newly separated from service. It also has provisions to extend the authority related to rehabilitation and vocational benefits to members of the Armed Forces with severe injuries or illnesses, homeless veterans reintegration programs, homeless women veterans and homeless veterans with children, and providing housing assistance and counseling to homeless and atrisk veterans. Also included are several extensions of authority for programs to help our disabled veterans, as well as the authority to enter into agreements with the National Academy of Sciences to review the research on links between diseases and dioxin exposure, a critical step in creating new Agent Orange presumptions. These provisions are crucial in helping our aging Vietnamera veteran population. The package also contains several technical corrections to the MISSION Act that we passed earlier this year. b1500 These corrections will help VA implement the law correctly, and all sides agree that they must become law quickly. In short, this is a bill that both the majority and the minority support, and we all agree that it must be signed into law as soon as possible. I urge all my fellow Members to support its passage. I thank the chairman and his staff for working with the minority on this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague and friend on the committee, Mr. TAKANO , for his friendship, for his support, and for his leadership. I think it is notable and remind our colleagues and the American people that we have passed out of this Chamber 80 bipartisan bills that support our veterans, our heroes. Twentyseven have become law of the land, delivering on our promises to those who swore an oath and made the sacrifice and served and protected us and our freedom. God bless our veterans. Mr. Speaker, once again, I encourage all Members to support S. 3479, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, likewise, I thank the gentleman from Texas for his friendship and for the work that we have done together in a bipartisan fashion on the Veterans’ Affairs Committee. I am also proud of the bipartisan work that we have accomplished together on behalf of our veterans. I say God bless our veterans as well. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in passing S. 3479, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, again, we encourage all Members to support S. 3479, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. MITCHELL ). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 3479. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
PANDEMIC AND ALLHAZARDS PREPAREDNESS AND ADVANCING INNOVATION ACT OF 2018 Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 6378) to reauthorize certain programs under the Public Health Service Act and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act with respect to public health security and all hazards preparedness and response, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 6378 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
Title XII of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300d et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following new part: ‘‘PART I—MILITARY AND CIVILIAN PARTNERSHIP FOR TRAUMA READINESS GRANT PROGRAM 
Part B of title III of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 243 et seq.) is amended by inserting after section 319D the following: 
Part B of title III of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 243 et seq.) is amended by inserting after section 319E the following: 
Beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response and the Assistant Secretary for the Administration on Children and Families shall submit to the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate weekly reports on the status and welfare of the children who, as a result of the ‘‘zero tolerance’’ policy, were separated from their parent or guardian and are awaiting reunification with their parent or guardian, as well as the number of such children in facilities funded by the Department of Health and Human Services. 
Nothing in this Act shall be construed as reducing or limiting the authorities vested in any other Federal agency by any other Federal law. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. BROOKS ) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Indiana. 
Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous materials in the RECORD on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Indiana? There was no objection. Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of the Pandemic and AllHazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act of 2018, known as PAHPA. I am proud to have introduced this important bill with Energy and Commerce Chairman GREGWALDEN , Ranking Member FRANK PALLONE , and my good friend Representative ESHOO , who is one of the original authors of the 2006 PAHPA bill and lead author of the last reauthorization in 2013. This bipartisan public health and national security effort will ensure our Nation is better prepared to respond to natural disasters like hurricanes; emerging infectious diseases like Zika and Ebola; and chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear attacks, whether from terrorist groups or from nation states. Seventeen years ago, Congress was the target of a biological attack when letters laced with anthrax arrived in Member offices just days or soon after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. In the aftermath of 9/11, the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense was formed. It was led by bipartisan leaders: former Senator Joe Lieberman, former Governor Tom Ridge, and many others. In October 2015, after extensive discussions around the country where they learned from experts, they created their ‘‘National Blueprint for Biodefense,’’ which provided us with a roadmap in drafting this important legislation. I was the United States Attorney for the Southern District of Indiana during those 2001 anthrax attacks, and my own office dealt with an anthrax hoax when we received a letter with white powder inside. Of course, at the time, we didn’t know it was a hoax. It was incredibly stressful for that staff member, who had to worry about their very own health. But that personal experience illustrated to me the importance of preparedness and sparked my interest in biodefense. In the years since then, we know that the threat of a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear incident continues to grow. Every day, our adversaries are looking for more effective and faster ways to reduce the threat. It is not really a question of if we face the threat. It is a question of when. Thanks to PAHPA and the 21st Century Cures Act, we are more prepared than ever for biological threats and attacks. In July of just this last year, the FDA approved the first drug to treat smallpox. It is called TPOXX. But TPOXX isn’t the only recent approval at the FDA. In July, the FDA also approved an autoinjector that provides a onetime dose of an antidote to block effects of a nerve agent. This new antidote and TPOXX will help protect Americans from biological attacks. But PAHPA is much more than just a biodefense bill. It also ensures a coordinated healthcare response, whether to hurricanes or other natural disasters. Florence has just hit the East Coast and residents in both North and South Carolina are still recovering and dealing with ongoing flooding. During the 2017 hurricane season, whether it was Hurricane Harvey, Irma, Jose, or Maria, far too many Americans were killed. It showed us that we need to do better to prioritize the needs of every person in our communities. The PAHPA bill we are considering today does just that. It prioritizes our Nation’s most vulnerable populations: our children, senior citizens, and those with disabilities. It reauthorizes the advisory committee focused on the specific needs of children and creates new advisory committees to ensure the needs of the elderly and those with disabilities are considered. The bill provides liability protections for healthcare professionals who volunteer after medical disasters. In addition to these types of Good Samaritan provisions, the bill ensures more healthcare professionals like nurses, doctors, and others can be hired and trained when facing a public health crisis by strengthening our National Disaster Medical System, which provides grants to our regional healthcare network. It also ensures we have a robust supply of vaccines and basic equipment like gloves, hazmat suits, masks, personal protective gear, and more in our strategic national stockpiles located all across the country, so that our healthcare professionals and first responders have what they need. PAHPA ensures our preparedness and response capabilities will include a robust pipeline of medical countermeasures by reauthorizing and increasing funding for the BioShield Special Reserve Fund and BARDA, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority. BARDA’s work over the last decade has resulted in FDA approvals for more than 42 different medical countermeasures. The development of medical countermeasures is a lengthy and often risky endeavor, which is why sending a clear signal that BARDA remains a strong and committed partner with academic institutions and the private sector in these efforts is so very important. Last week, we saw even another example of a success of research funded by BARDA when FDA approved a product called ReCell, the first sprayon skin product ever approved for use in the United States. This new treatment will help treat burn victims so they can heal faster and with less risk of infection from painful skin grafts. By using a piece of a patient’s skin about the size of a credit card, a doctor can turn it into a single cellbased solution that can be sprayed over the patient’s burns so that new skin can grow and replace the damaged skin. These types of investments BARDA is making into innovative research are critical, but it is also important that we continue to address threats that have been around for years. It has been 100 years since the 1918 pandemic influenza killed millions of people around the globe, including 675,000 Americans. Some experts predict that we are actually due for the potential of another global pandemic influenza. To address that threat, the bill we are considering today authorizes $250 million for the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, the ASPR, to address threats like pandemic influenza. Specifically, the bill directs the ASPR to work to increase manufacturing capacity and stockpile medical countermeasures. While the PAHPA bill we are considering today authorizes funding for research into known threats like pandemic influenza, it also maintains the flexibility that is the foundation of our medical countermeasure enterprise to deal with unknown threats for which we may have no defense today. Even today, the Democratic Republic of the Congo continues to deal with an ongoing Ebola outbreak. In order to ensure we are better prepared when we face an outbreak like Ebola or Zika, the bill we are considering today does three important things. First, it improves the existing emergency response fund so that the Secretary of Health and Human Services does not have to wait on approval from Congress to immediately fund response measures needed to contain an outbreak and save lives. This emergency response fund will create a bridge so that immediate funding is available, so we can then supplement with an emergency appropriations bill later. Secondly, the bill requires GAO to conduct a review of the emergency response fund to help appropriators decide what funding levels and resources are needed. The third thing the bill does to help address threats like Ebola and Zika is to authorize $250 million in funding for an emerging infectious disease program so that BARDA can invest in new research. The PAHPA bill reauthorization we are considering is the process of months of committee work in both the House and the Senate, and I want to thank all the staff members and all of the organizations, everyone who has been involved, and all the Members who have participated, whether it is subcommittee or committee hearings on this bill, examining our response to threats. I thank everyone involved for their dedication and commitment to 
making sure we have the procedures, resources, and support in place to protect our fellow citizens from public health and national security threats. I can’t emphasize enough how critically important it is to reauthorize PAHPA. We have a duty as Members of Congress to keep Americans safe and secure. This bill is an essential component of accomplishing that goal. I urge all Members to support this critical bipartisan piece of legislation. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  letters from many organizations that support the bill. 
ADULT VACCINE ACCESS COALITION , July 23, 2018. Hon. SUSAN W. B ROOKS , Member of Congress, Washington, DC. Hon. ANNAESHOO , Member of Congress, Washington, DC. DEAR REPRESENTATIVES BROOKS AND  ESHOO : On behalf of the Adult Vaccine Access Coalition (AVAC), we are pleased to express our support for bipartisan legislation that recently passed the House Energy and Commerce Committee, ‘‘Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act (PAHPA) of 2018’’. AVAC includes more than fifty organizational leaders in health and public health who are committed to raising awareness of and engaging in advocacy on the importance of adult immunization. AVAC priorities and objectives are driven by a consensus process with the goal of enabling stakeholders to have a voice in the effort to improve access to and utilization of adult immunizations. The bipartisan reauthorization of the PAHPA provides improvements to key preparedness and response programs, enhances personnel and hiring authorities, as well as prioritizes cybersecurity in health care and provides necessary resources for the development of medical countermeasures for pandemic influenza and emerging infectious diseases. We are delighted the Managers’ Amendment included references to immunization programs and immunization information systems under Section 319D. These additions will help to strengthen and enhance coordination and integrate immunization programs and immunization information systems (IIS) capabilities into public health emergency preparedness, planning, and response activities. Immunization Information Systems (IIS), or registries, confidential, populationbased, computerized systems can record immunization doses administered by participating providers to persons residing within a given jurisdiction. They provide state and local public health agencies aggregate data on immunization coverage rates for disease surveillance and program operations. IIS’ can serve as a vital component for emergency preparedness and response activities and are an optimal tool for use during a pandemic or other emerging infectious disease event by enabling communication with providers, identifying variations in access and utilization of immunization, and enabling implementation of targeted strategies during emergency preparedness and response activities. Congratulations on putting together a strong, bipartisan reauthorization package that reflects many of the important priorities shared by stakeholders. We look forward to working with you throughout the process to enact the 2018 Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act. Sincerely, LISAFOSTER , AVAC Manager. ABBYBOWNAS , AVAC Manager. 
ALLIANCE FOR BIOSECURITY , U.S. CHAMBER OF COMMERCE , July 27, 2018. TO THE MEMBERS OF THE U.S. H OUSE OF  REPRESENTATIVES : On behalf of the Alliance for Biosecurity and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, we support H.R. 6378, the Pandemic and AllHazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act of 2018, and urge the House to pass this bipartisan legislation before the Pandemic and AllHazards Preparedness Act (PAHPA) expires at the end of September 2018. H.R. 6378 is central to protecting American citizens, organizations, and communities against natural and man made biosecurity hazards. H.R. 6378 would authorize crucial funding for the Project BioShield Special Reserve Fund and Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA). However, we urge policymakers to account for inflation to ensure that future spending levels adequately support the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise (PHEMCE) Strategy and implementation Plan, the BARDA Strategic Plan, and related efforts. H.R. 6378 would establish several important programs within BARDA, especially a Pandemic Influenza Program to support research and development activities to enhance responses to pandemic influenza and an Emerging Infectious Disease Program to monitor and address infectious diseases that could cause a deadly pandemic. Both programs would be funded at $250 million per year through FY 2023. The bill would also create new and sustainable marketbased incentives to advance cuttingedge biomedical research. Our groups support developing strategic partnerships between BARDA and the business community to mitigate threats that could pose a significant risk to U.S. health and safety. Reauthorizing PAHPA would also help ensure the sustainability of the medical countermeasures enterprise by transferring the authority that governs the procurement of medical countermeasures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR). The legislation would codify ASPR’s role in coordinating Strategic National Stockpile operations with CDC. We also believe that such teamwork would make the U.S. better equipped to tackle public health emergencies and natural disasters. We urge the full House to swiftly consider and pass H.R. 6378.

AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF BLOOD  BANKS , A MERICA ’SBLOOD CENTERS , AMERICAN REDCROSS, July 25, 2018. Hon. GREGWALDEN , Chairman, House Energy and Commerce Committee, Washington, DC. Hon. SUSAN BROOKS , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. FRANK PALLONE , Ranking Member, House Energy and Commerce Committee, Washington, DC. Hon. ANNAESHOO , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARCHAIRMAN WALDEN , RANKING MEMBER  PALLONE , ANDREPRESENTATIVES BROOKS AND  ESHOO : AABB (formerly known as the American Association of Blood Banks), America’s Blood Centers and the American Red Cross commend the House Energy and Commerce Committee’s commitment to improving the nation’s preparedness and response capabilities through the reauthorization of the Pandemic and AllHazards Preparedness Advancing Innovation Act (PAHPAIA) of 2018 (H.R. 6378). Collectively, our organizations represent the nation’s blood collection establishments, transfusion services, and transfusion medicine professionals. We would like to especially highlight two sections of the bill important to us and our collective members: Section 116 is a significant step in examining the unique, and often overlooked, role of the nation’s blood supply in emergency 
preparedness and response systems and the specific challenges associated with donor recruitment, implementation of safety mandates and innovation, and adequacy in the face of public health emergencies. We believe that policies that support the availability of a safe and adequate blood supply are needed. The report required by this section is critical to evaluating possible solutions. We strongly support the Committee’s specific recognition of the blood supply in Section 207, which requires the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) to develop guidelines for regional health care emergency and response systems. We support the provision that requires the ASPR to consult with blood banks and other key stakeholders when developing and updating guidelines. Including blood centers in this process is paramount and consistent with the Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) recognition of blood as one of the core functional areas in Emergency Support Function #8 of the National Response Framework. We also commend the Committee for recognizing potential financial implications for blood centers to implement and follow the guidelines. Given that blood is an essential part of the nation’s trauma system, emergency preparedness and response system and healthcare system generally, it is essential that financial barriers not impede the availability of safe blood ahead of and during response activities. AABB, America’s Blood Centers and the American Red Cross welcome the opportunity to work with the Committee to ensure that these important provisions promoting the safety and availability of the U.S. blood supply remain during conference negotiations with the Senate.

AMERICAN COLLEGE OF  EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS , July 18, 2018. Hon. SUSAN BROOKS , Washington, DC. Hon. GREGWALDEN , Washington, DC. Hon. ANNAESHOO , Washington, DC. Hon. FRANK PALLONE , Washington, DC. DEAR REPRESENTATIVES BROOKS , E SHOO , WALDEN , AND PALLONE : On behalf of the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP), our 38,000 members, and the more than 140 million patients we treat each year, I am writing to express ACEP’s support for H.R. 6378, the ‘‘Pandemic and AllHazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation (PAHPAI) Act of 2018.’’ In particular, ACEP appreciates your legislation’s focus on improving regionalized emergency preparedness and response systems, inclusion of the MISSION ZERO Act’s provisions to facilitate the use of military trauma teams in civilian trauma centers, and the addition of Good Samaritan liability protections for health care professionals who volunteer during federallydeclared disasters. Regionalized systems for emergency care response are vital to ensuring patients are transported and treated in the most appropriate setting. While it is important to maximize our resources and capabilities on a daily basis, it becomes imperative when health care providers respond to a natural or manmade disaster. We would like to thank you for emphasizing the establishment and enhancement of these systems, especially the demonstration program designed to improve medical surge capacity, build and integrate regional medical response capabilities, improve specialty care expertise for allhazards response, and coordinate medical preparedness and response across states, territories, and regional jurisdictions. ACEP is very supportive of the trauma system improvements included in H.R. 6378, specifically the grants for militarycivilian partnerships in trauma care as established in the MISSION ZERO Act (H.R. 880). ACEP believes this policy serves three purposes. First, it makes additional trauma care personnel available to treat severely injured civilian patients. Second, it allows military trauma teams to maintain their skills in between rotations to conflict areas. Third, it allows trauma team members to train together so that when they are deployed, everyone performs his/her duties in a coordinated manner with the other members, thereby improving care to injured military personnel. The Good Samaritan liability protections established in this legislation will help encourage availability of health care professionals during times of disaster, which can be crucial to supplementing the efforts of emergency physicians and the Disaster Medical Assistance Teams (DMATs) onsite. ACEP believes volunteers responding to a disaster, whether declared by the President of the United States or the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), should be protected from liability while they are providing care within the scope of their expertise and are acting in good faith. We appreciate your efforts to include this essential provision in H.R. 6378. Other aspects of the legislation that are important to emergency physicians and will help ensure the nation is prepared to contend with all disasters and unexpected emergencies include your provisions to improve the National Disaster Medical System (NDMS); expand public health surveillance; study DMAT readiness capabilities; improve the Public Health Emergency Fund (PHEF); strengthen the Healthcare Preparedness and Response Program (HPRP), formerly the Hospital Preparedness Program (HPP); extend authorization for the Emergency System for Advanced Registration of Volunteer Health Professionals (ESARVHP); and study hospital preparedness capabilities. ACEP would also like to commend you on your oversight of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response’s (ASPR) efforts to reunify children who were separated from their parent or guardian (due to the ‘‘zero tolerance’’ policy) and placed into the custody of HHS. Finally, we would once again urge the Committee and the Congress to ensure sufficient funding is provided for the PHEF, HPRP, NDMS, and Medical Reserve Corps (MRC) to ensure their effectiveness and we encourage you to seek a sufficient, guaranteed federal funding stream. Without a dedicated and appropriate amount of federal resources for these critical programs, we are greatly concerned that the nation as a whole, and emergency medical providers specifically, will not have the infrastructure, personnel, or tools necessary to provide optimal care during a natural or manmade disaster or infectious disease outbreak. Sincerely, PAULD. K IVELA , MD, MBA, FACEP, ACEP President. AMERICAN COLLEGE OF SURGEONS , July 20, 2018. Hon. GREGWALDEN , Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Washington, DC. Hon. FRANK PALLONE , Ranking Member, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Washington, DC. DEAR CHAIRMAN WALDEN AND RANKING  MEMBER PALLONE : On behalf of the more than 80,000 members of the American College of Surgeons (ACS), we would like to express our support for the Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act of 2018 (PAHPAI), H.R. 6378. We appreciate the work the Energy and Commerce Committee has accomplished to incorporate important improvements to trauma care and begin the process for establishing the framework for a trauma system that can fully meet the needs of any disaster and provide the highestquality health care. ACS is particularly appreciative of the inclusion of the Mission Zero Act, H.R. 880 in the PAHPAI. Establishing and maintaining highquality and adequatelyfunded trauma systems throughout the United States, including within the Armed Forces, is a priority of the ACS and our Committee on Trauma (COT). The Mission Zero Act authorizes $15 million in grant funding to assist civilian trauma centers in partnering with military trauma professionals and creates a pathway to provide patients with excellent trauma care in times of peace and conflict. In addition, this legislation requires utilization of trauma data reporting as a requirement for the grant program. The measuring and recording of data is a cornerstone of advancing not only trauma care, but health care as a whole. Overall, the Mission Zero Act is a critical step toward achieving the goal of zero preventable injury deaths after injury. Inclusion of the Good Samaritan Health Professionals Act, H.R. 1876, which is legislation that would reduce barriers for health care providers looking to volunteer during a federallydeclared disaster, is a welcome addition to PAHPAI. This section in PAHPAI will help to greatly decrease loss of life as well as improve outcomes during federally declared public health emergencies. We also applaud the Committee for highlighting the critical issue of improving our trauma care system by including language creating a demonstration project promoting a regionalized approach to disaster response. Trauma systems have been organized across the country to manage the timesensitive crises of acutely injured patients in an efficient manner on a daily basis. Trauma systems span the continuum of care including prior to the point of injury and through rehabilitation. As a result, these systems engage in numerous activities aimed at improving care and outcomes, including bystander training, emergency medical services (EMS) training and coordination, hospital preparedness, injury prevention efforts, and continuous quality improvement. All of these activities will assist with responding to public health emergencies such as biological, radiological, nuclear events, and other mass casualty incidents. The ACS believes the PAHPAI represents significant progress in the process of ensuring that trauma systems, centers, and health care providers are able to meet the needs of all Americans. We thank you for your leadership on this significant legislation and stand ready to work with you toward final passage in the House. Sincerely, DAVID B. H OYT, MD, FACS, Executive Director, American College of Surgeons. 
Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON HOMELAND SECURITY , Washington, DC, September 24, 2018. Hon. GREGWALDEN , Chairman, Committee on Energy & Commerce, Washington, DC. DEAR CHAIRMAN WALDEN : I write concerning H.R. 6378, the ‘‘Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act of 2018’’. This legislation includes matters that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on Homeland Security. In order to expedite floor consideration of H.R. 6378, the Committee on Homeland Security will forgo action on this bill. However, this is conditional on our mutual understanding that forgoing consideration of the bill would not prejudice the Committee with respect to the appointment of conferees or to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject matters contained in the bill or similar legislation that fall within the Committee’s Rule X jurisdiction. I request you urge the Speaker to name members of the Committee to any conference committee names to consider such provisions. Please place a copy of this letter and your response acknowledging our jurisdictional interest in the Congressional Record during House Floor consideration of the bill. I look forward to working with the Committee on Energy and Commerce as the bill moves through the legislative process. Sincerely, MICHAEL T. M CCAUL, Chairman. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND COMMERCE , Washington, DC, September 24, 2018. Hon. MICHAEL T. M CCAUL, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, Washington, DC. DEAR CHAIRMAN MCCAUL: Thank you for your letter concerning H.R. 6378, Pandemic and AllHazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act of 2018, and I appreciate your willingness to forgo action on the bill. I agree that forgoing consideration of the bill should not prejudice the Committee on Homeland Security with respect to the appointment of conferees or to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject matters contained in the bill or similar legislation that fall within the Committee’s Rule X jurisdiction. I will request that the Speaker name members of the Committee to any conference committee to consider such provisions. Finally, I will place a copy of your letter and this response into the Congressional Record during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Sincerely, GREGWALDEN , Chairman. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6378, the Pandemic AllHazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act of 2018. I want to thank Chairman WALDEN and Representatives E SHOO  and BROOKS , as well as all the staff, for their hard work on this bill. Together, we have ensured a robust product that reflects priorities for Members on both sides of the aisle and the agencies responsible for ensuring our emergency preparedness. This is a vitally important public health bill that ensures that we can prepare for and respond to health security events like bioterrorism, emerging infectious diseases, and natural disasters. It will support the development of new treatments and the stockpiling of medications and supplies that will be deployed to communities nationwide in the case of an emergency. As we all know, effectively preparing for and responding to these events requires extensive coordination between Federal, State, local, and Tribal governments, as well as private sector organizations across the country. This bill reauthorizes or establishes critical programs that will help us better prepare and respond to any major health emergency. Let me discuss some of the specifics of how this bill will help us do that. It reauthorizes a loan repayment program that would help to strengthen and grow our public health workforce. This is critically important, as we are still trying to dig out of a public health funding hole that began during the Great Recession. This bill also makes a technical update to the Hospital Preparedness Program to reflect the use of the term ‘‘coalition’’ instead of ‘‘partnership’’ by grantees and other stakeholders. This language change is not intended to make changes related to the current cooperative agreement structure, nor does it intend to alter the role and responsibilities of States, territories, and directly funded cities, which are awardees of funding under the Hospital Preparedness Program. Therefore, it continues to require that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the CDC, provide funding through cooperative agreements to States, territories, and cities to support healthcare coalitions in their communities through the Hospital Preparedness Program. b1515 The bill also amends the Public Health Emergency Preparedness Program to require public health departments to partner with nursing homes and hospitals to promote and improve public health preparedness and response. It also requires public health departments to work with utility companies and other critical infrastructure partners to help ensure that electricity and other critical infrastructure will remain functioning or return to function as soon as practicable after a public health emergency. Both of these requirements are intended to help prevent another tragedy like the tragic deaths that occurred at a Florida nursing home last year in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma. Mr. Speaker, this bill also updates the authorization for the public health emergency rapid response fund so we can prevent any delay in HHS’ rapid response to public health emergencies in the future. It also maintains the administration’s flexibility to determine the best placement for the Strategic National Stockpile, or SNS. I have concerns with moving the SNS from the direction of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response. To date, I have yet to hear a strong argument in support of this move. I also believe CDC has the relationships and expertise that make the most sense for managing and operationalizing the stockpile. The CDC also has a record of successful stewardship of the SNS. That is why I supported the increased transparency and reporting included in this bill. Wherever the Strategic National Stockpile is placed, it is critical that we ensure that our current preparedness and response capabilities are not weakened by its placement. I also want to highlight two provisions that were included that will ensure Congress receives the information it needs to respond to the Trump administration’s family separation crisis. The Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response will be required to submit to the Energy and Commerce Committee a formal strategy on their family reunification efforts as well as keep the committee informed on the status of the children still awaiting reunification. The Trump administration’s cruel zerotolerance policy resulted in a manmade crisis that has impacted the lives of thousands of parents and children. While we can’t undo the damage done by this policy, these provisions ensure that Congress has the information it needs to help reunite each child with their family and make sure this never happens again. Furthermore, while these provisions are important, they should not take the place of an actual oversight hearing on this cruel policy. This is something committee Democrats have repeatedly requested, and we will continue to do so. Finally, Mr. Speaker, overall, I want to say this is a good bill. Our national preparedness and response capabilities will be better prepared to respond to public health threats thanks to the passage of the Pandemic and AllHazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6378, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN ), the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today, obviously, in support of the Pandemic and AllHazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act. I want to thank my friend and colleague from New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE ), our ranking Democrat on the committee, for working with me on this effort, but especially I want to thank Representative BROOKS from Indiana for her tireless effort and the partnership of my friend, Representative ANNA ESHOO of California. She and Mrs. 
BROOKS really did the heavy lift here for the committee on this effort. They were able to shepherd this critical reauthorization to the floor today with unanimous support both in the subcommittee and in the full committee. So, for those out there who are watching our proceedings, know that actually we do work together and we do get some really important public policy done. These programs, commonly known as PAHPA, enable critical partnerships between the Federal Government, State and local authorities, and the private sector to ensure our Nation is responsibly prepared for and able to respond to public health emergencies. It is time that we get it right; it is critical that we get it right; and we are. It is not really a matter of if, but when, the next pandemic strikes. The projections simply are horrifying. A fullblown pandemic flu outbreak could literally kill millions of people within months—within months. We must have the tools, backed by stable and predictable funding, to respond to these threats and especially to the threat of pandemic flu. With this vote, the House will take an important step toward keeping our families safe in the worstcase scenarios of dangerous disease outbreak or in the case of chemical or biological attack. We are moving this reauthorization on time and in a bipartisan fashion. Like my colleague from Indiana, I remember when anthrax was sent to our offices and to the postal facility, and loss of life and illness and concern, and we all wondered what is next. That was part of what prompted us to get to this point and pass this legislation, not only today but back then. This is really important work, Mr. Speaker, and I commend my colleagues and the staff, who really do the incredible work to help us get it right. This is legislation now that will head over to the Senate, where I hope they will give it the same due consideration that we are about to here today, and then get this down to President Trump’s desk, where he will sign it into law. Mr. Speaker, I want to again thank my colleagues and staff on both sides of the aisle. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS ), the subcommittee chair for the Subcommittee on Health. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, one century ago, our country was in the midst of the worst pandemic in history. It claimed the lives of almost 700,000 Americans and killed more than 50 million people worldwide. Mr. Speaker, we listened to testimony; we discussed aspects of this legislation before us today; and it is critical that we remember the significance of the centennial anniversary of the 1918 influenza pandemic as we consider this legislation today. The creation of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response under the original legislation of 2006 has helped us to make monumental strides in preparedness, coordination, and response. Close collaboration between the Centers for Disease Control and the Food and Drug Administration and our State, local, and territorial public health partners has been vital in making this progress. Much like politics, much of public health is local and executed on the ground by our hospitals, our health departments, and our emergency responders, who are our front lines in addressing infectious diseases, disasters, and threats. We must evaluate the domestic biological surveillance systems, such as BioWatch. This bill will help bring those programs up to date so they are operating with the most efficient capabilities and technologies. We must also look for innovative ways to continue to advance our medical countermeasures and ensure that Americans can access the medications that will provide critical protection in the future. As we consider the problem of antimicrobial resistance in this country, we must discuss new methods to curb this growing problem. It is important to note that this reauthorization bill is being heard on the floor of the House prior to the expiration of the fiscal year, at which time the current authorization expires. The House, once again, has done its work in this regard, and we do urge our counterparts in the Senate to do their work as well. This reauthorization includes an important provision: The MISSION ZERO Act. The MISSION ZERO Act seeks to connect American patients with battle tested trauma care through the craft of military trauma care providers. The bill provides grants to allow military trauma care providers and teams to offer care in our Nation’s leading trauma centers and systems. The need for topnotch trauma care extends across our Nation, far away from the battlefield. I first introduced this bipartisan bill with my fellow Texan, Representative GENE GREEN , following a police shooting in Dallas 2 years ago. Over 2 years ago, five police officers were killed and nine more were injured in a shooting in downtown Dallas. In the immediate aftermath of the attack, area hospitals sprung into action and activated their disaster plans. The staff at Parkland Hospital, Baylor University Hospital, and other medical professionals provided excellent emergency care to victims of the attack. Frontline facilities and responders in Dallas experienced this firsthand in 2014 when a patient presented with Ebola to a DallasFt. Worth emergency department. We must remember that infectious diseases are a mere plane ride away, and we must continue to ensure that we are prepared and ready to respond to emerging infectious diseases worldwide. This Pandemic and AllHazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act is critical to protecting the lives of Americans and providing the necessary tools and infrastructure when disaster strikes. I want to thank Representative SUSAN BROOKS and A NNA ESHOO for their work on this legislation before us today. Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. BILIRAKIS ), who also serves on the Subcommittee on Health. Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Congresswoman BROOKS , who is doing an outstanding job. We both served on the House Committee on Homeland Security, and we chaired a subcommittee prior to Energy and Commerce. She is doing an outstanding job. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 6378, the Pandemic and AllHazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act. From stormrelated injuries and illnesses to delivery and logistics issues, last year’s historically costly hurricane season tested the mettle of our health delivery system, and I am pleased to see children, seniors, and other atrisk patient communities being addressed in this reauthorization. This bill also encourages innovative partnerships and coalitions, like the Nicklaus Children’s Hospital and the Florida International University, to continue to develop novel approaches to healthcare delivery and, ultimately, save lives. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this critical piece of legislation. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I want to again thank all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for moving and working on this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6378, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I would like to particularly thank Dr. BURGESS and the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Health, GENEGREEN , for their leadership in working with so many of us who have brought this legislation to the floor at this time. It is really so very critical that all relevant Federal agencies, particularly the leadership of CDC and the ASPR, work together with our local and State partners that are truly on the ground; and I certainly urge my colleagues to 
pass this important piece of legislation not only to ensure that public health is of paramount importance in this country, but, also, because this is an incredibly important piece of national security legislation. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bipartisan legislation, the Pandemic and AllHazards Preparedness and Innovation Act and I’m very proud to have Representative SUSAN BROOKS as my partner. This legislation is the product of negotiation and compromise between the House and the Senate and I’m pleased that my colleagues were able to reach agreement on a bill that ensures our nation is prepared to respond to a wide range of public health emergencies, whether manmade or occurring through a natural disaster or infectious disease. In 2001 our nation endured the horrific attacks on September 11th and the anthrax attacks that followed shortly thereafter. Congress realized that our country was not prepared to coordinate responses to mass casualty events or chemical attacks, and in 2006, I wrote legislation with thenRepresentative RICHARD BURR to address these shortfalls. That important legislation, the original Pandemic and AllHazards Preparedness Act, was signed into law the same year. The Pandemic and AllHazards Preparedness and Innovation Act we’re considering today is critical to our national security. The legislation updates the original PAHPA by directing federal agencies to respond to new and emerging threats, and strengthens our nation’s existing preparedness and response programs. The reauthorization meets the challenges that we face today and those we anticipate facing in the future. Events over the past few years including Zika, the reemergence of Ebola, and the constant looming threat of a biological attack by another nation or hostile nonstate enemies underscore the real threats our country continues to face. In 2017, our nation experienced the most destructive hurricane season in recent memory, followed quickly by the most deadly flu season in decades. This year, parts of our country have already faced devastating hurricanes and the season is not over yet. Our experience with each of these hazards reminds us that our country is not yet adequately prepared to deal with potentially devastating widespread public health crises. That’s why this legislation is so critical. The legislation provides the authorization and federal resources to invest in programs that allow the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority to maintain its nimble and flexible framework while responding to the existing and emerging threats our country may face. It also directs BARDA to address antimicrobial resistance which is critical to our nation’s biodefense If we have a chemical or biological attack that leaves individuals with burns or open wounds, the medical countermeasures BARDA has developed to treat that attack will be useless if those injured contract secondary antibiotic resistant infections. BARDA was created by my original legislation and has been extremely successful in investing in drugs that are needed to be stockpiled, and where the federal government is the only customer. There is no other market for these products and that’s why BARDA is so important. BARDA has worked with over 190 partners and brought 35 medical countermeasures through research and development to FDA approval No private company has a track record that compares to what BARDA has accomplished in just over 10 years. This bill restores multiyear appropriations for the Project BioShield Special Reserve Fund. My original legislation provided advanced appropriations for Project BioShield for the purpose of accelerating the research, development, purchase, and availability of effective medical countermeasures against biological, chemical, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threats. Restoring multiyear appropriations offers our partners with the government the certainty they need to invest in these important medical countermeasures which are a matter of national security. I urge the appropriators to fully fund the multiyear appropriations this legislation authorizes. I’m proud that our legislation incorporates many provisions that were important to Members in both the Republican Conference, the Democratic Caucus, and to our colleagues in the Senate, to meet the needs of vulnerable communities during natural and manmade disasters. The legislation also reauthorizes the HHS National Advisory Committee on Children and Disasters and authorizes the Children’s Preparedness Unit at the CDC. This is critically important to address the persistent gaps in our nation’s preparedness and response for the most vulnerable in many crises, our nation’s children The bill also establishes an Advisory Council for People with Disabilities and an Advisory Council on Seniors to focus on the needs of these special populations during a public health emergency. It includes a proposal to prioritize bringing nursing homes back onto the power grid at the same time as hospitals after a disaster. It includes provisions related to regional health partnerships, pregnant and postpartum women and environmental health. I’m proud of this legislation and I urge my colleagues to support the Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness and Innovation Act. Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I include the following letters in the RECORD . 
HEALTH INDUSTRY  DISTRIBUTORS ASSOCIATION , July 17, 2018. Hon. GREGWALDEN , Chairman, House Energy and Commerce Committee, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. SUSAN BROOKS , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. FRANK PALLONE , Ranking Member, House Energy and Commerce Committee, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. ANNAESHOO , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARCHAIRMAN WALDEN , RANKING MEMBER  PALLONE , CONGRESSWOMAN BROOKS AND CONGRESSWOMAN ESHOO : On behalf of the Health Industry Distributors Association (HIDA), we appreciate the opportunity to express our support for H.R. 6378, the Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act of 2018 (PAHPAI). HIDA commends you for your leadership on this issue and appreciates the active engagement of your staff with industry to incorporate lessons learned from recent events such as Ebola and the 2017 hurricane season, in H.R. 6378, to continually improve our nation’s preparedness capabilities. HIDA is the trade association representing medical products distributors, all of which deliver medical products and supplies, manage logistics, and offer customer services to more than 294,000 points of care. HIDA members primarily distribute items used in every day medical services and procedures, ranging from gauze and gloves to diagnostic laboratory tests. Their customers include over 210,000 physician offices, 6,500 hospitals, and 44,000 nursing home and extended care facilities throughout the country, as well as numerous federal agencies and their healthcare facilities. As you know, the medical supply chain plays a critical role in preparedness, as it supplies key infection prevention products and protective equipment such as respirators, face shields, hoods, impermeable gowns and gloves to first responders and health care providers. Additionally, the medical supply chain is the primary source for the diagnostic and pointofcare rapid tests needed to identify infectious disease, as well as the ancillary products such as gloves, needles and syringes needed to deliver medical countermeasures effectively. HIDA and its members have collaborated with federal agencies on identifying opportunities to improve coordination and develop solutions that create more elasticity in the supply chain for key products. One of the many lessons learned during the 2017 hurricane season was a considerable need to improve coordination during an emergency response, ensuring appropriate infrastructure partners are included in a prioritization process for access to affected areas after an event. We appreciate the Committees’ acknowledgement of the importance of this issue in the legislation, as well as the recognition of the healthcare supply chain in H.R. 6378. Specifically, we support the following: Section 101 provisions important to the healthcare supply chain including The value of public and private sector coordination during an event to ensure critical supplies are delivered and information is shared. The requirement that ancillary products needed to deliver a medical countermeasure are incorporated into the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasure Enterprise planning process. Section 319C–3 provisions that create a regional healthcare system plan and that it be communicated to supply chain partners so needed product can be redirected during a response. HIDA thanks you for your continued commitment to preparedness and look forward to working with you on H.R. 6378. Sincerely, LINDA ROUSE O’NEILL, Vice President, Government Affairs, Health Industry Distributors Association. 
OFAMERICA , July 17, 2018. Hon. GREGWALDEN , Chairman, Energy & Commerce Committee, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. FRANK PALLONE , Jr., Ranking Member, Energy & Commerce Committee, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. SUSAN BROOKS , Energy & Commerce Committee, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. ANNAESHOO , Energy & Commerce Committee, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARCHAIRMAN WALDEN , RANKING MEMBER  PALLONE , REPRESENTATIVE BROOKS AND REPRESENTATIVE ESHOO : Thank you for your leadership in introducing H.R. 6378, the Pandemic and AllHazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act of 2018 (PAHPAI) that both reauthorizes and strengthens the Pandemic AllHazards Preparedness Act (PAHPA). IDSA represents over 11,000 infectious diseases physicians and scientists. Many of our members work on the frontlines of public health emergencies, including bioterror attacks, outbreaks, and natural disasters (e.g., hurricanes that carry significant infectious diseases risks). The programs and authorities contained within PAHPA provide essential resources for communities and health care facilities to prepare for and respond to public health threats. Further, PAHPA provides critical support for the research and development (R&D) of lifesaving medical countermeasures (including vaccines, diagnostics, and antimicrobial drugs). In particular, IDSA is pleased to offer our strong support for the provision in H.R. 6378 to reinstate loan repayment authority for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to improve programs that train public health responders and future leaders, such as the Epidemic Intelligence Service. We also support the bill’s attention to antimicrobial resistance. We look forward to working with the Committee on continued efforts to address this urgent public health threat. A successful response to a public health emergency depends upon skilled personnel. Section 115 of H.R. 6378 will strengthen the ability of the CDC to recruit physicians to serve in the Epidemic Intelligence Service— a fellowship program that trains expert responders to infectious disease outbreaks and other public health emergencies. We greatly appreciate your inclusion of this important provision. IDSA remains deeply concerned about antimicrobial resistance that threatens our national health security. We appreciate language in Section 302 authorizing the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority to undertake strategic initiatives to address antimicrobial resistance, as well as Section 406 that codifies the Advisory Council on Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria. These substantive efforts will continue to strengthen our national response to antimicrobial resistance, though we believe additional efforts will be essential to spur the research, development and appropriate use of urgently needed new antibiotics. Once again, IDSA thanks you for your dedication to our nation’s health security. We look forward to continuing to work with you on these crucial issues. Sincerely, PAULG. A UWAERTER , MD, MBA, FIDSA, President, IDSA. NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF COUNTY & CITYHEALTH OFFICIALS , Washington, DC, July 18, 2018. Hon. GREGWALDEN , Chairman, House Energy & Commerce Committee, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. SUSAN BROOKS , U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. FRANK PALLONE , Ranking Member, House Energy & Commerce Committee, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. ANNAESHOO , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARCHAIRMAN WALDEN , RANKING MEMBER  PALLONE , ANDREPRESENTATIVES BROOKS AND  ESHOO : On behalf of the National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO), I am writing in support of the ‘‘Pandemic and AllHazards Preparedness Advancing Innovation Act (PAHPAIA) of 2018’’ (H.R. 6378). NACCHO is the voice of the nearly 3,000 local health departments across the country that prepare communities for disasters, respond if emergencies occur, and lend support throughout the recovery process. PAHPAIA will provide needed stability for the nation’s emergency preparedness and response enterprise. We thank you for your leadership on this legislation that is essential to protecting our nation and look forward to working with you to strengthen the legislation as it moves forward. Among the many provisions in the bill, NACCHO highlights the following: 
PHEP , HPP, MRC The programs reauthorized in PAHPAIA are vital to local health departments. The Public Health Emergency Preparedness (PHEP) program and Hospital Preparedness Program (HPP), reauthorized in PAHPAIA, are complementary programs with different purposes. PHEP supports local health departments’ response to public health threats and helps to build resilient communities. HPP enables health care systems to save lives during emergencies that exceed dayto day capacity of health and emergency response systems. In addition, the Medical Reserve Corps (MRC) program provides additional public health personnel to respond to emergency needs as well as everyday health threats. The PHEP, HPP and MRC programs deserve a level of funding that is consistent with the threats that are experienced on the ground level in cities and counties across the nation. In 2017, Congress spent a record breaking $80 billion to provide relief from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, and devastating wildfires in California. Without the support of PHEP, HPP and MRC, the cost could have been much higher. A comprehensive, cost saving and proactive public health approach to disaster preparedness helps communities to effectively mitigate the damage and costs of disasters and help recover in the aftermath. Sustained funding to support local preparedness and response capacity helps local health departments build and convene diverse partners such as police, fire, transportation, planning departments, and community based organizations and develop and implement evidencebased, community centered strategies. 
MEDICAL COUNTERMEASURES  NACCHO supports the codification of the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise (PHEMCE). The PHEMCE Strategy and Implementation should require that state and local health departments be involved in all phases of the medical countermeasures (MCM) enterprise including in initial investment; research and development of vaccines, medicines, diagnostics and equipment for responding to emerging public health threats; and distribution and dispensing of countermeasures. NACCHO urges that state and local public health departments have a permanent place in the PHEMCE membership to ensure that all decisions that will affect state and local health functions are vetted by public health authorities. Current funding, support, and expertise provided to state and local health departments for the Strategic National Stockpile must be maintained regardless of the infrastructure or location of the SNS—it is too vital to this country’s ability to respond in the midst of a variety of largescale emergencies. PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY FUND  NACCHO appreciates that the bill strengthens existing authorities for the Public Health Emergency Fund (PHEF). A standing rapid response fund to provide bridge funding between base preparedness funding and supplemental appropriations for acute emergencies and emerging threats is absolutely necessary. NACCHO also appreciates the inclusion of provisions to maintain the pipeline of workers in the Epidemic Intelligence Service and to improve preparedness for children, seniors and people with disabilities. NACCHO appreciates the Committee’s acknowledgement that pandemic influenza, antimicrobial resistance and other emerging infectious diseases are under the umbrella of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority’s (BARDA) mission. Recent years have demonstrated that infectious diseases represent as significant a threat to our national security as a natural disaster or terror attack. Thank you for your work to strengthen and enhance our nation’s preparedness and response system. We look forward to continuing to work with you as this legislation moves forward. Sincerely, LORITREMMEL FREEMAN , MBA, Chief Executive Officer. 
THEPARTNERSHIP FOR  INCLUSIVE DISASTER STRATEGIES , Charleston, SC, July 18, 2018. Letter of Support for H.R. 6378—Pandemic and AllHazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act of 2018. DEAR REPRESENTATIVE ESHOO AND REPRESENTATIVE BROOKS : The Partnership for Inclusive Disaster Strategies (the Partnership) is the nation’s only coalition of national, state and local stakeholder organizations working together to advocate for equal access to emergency and disaster services and programs for children and adults with disabilities before, during and after disasters.

PEW C HARITABLE TRUSTS , Washington, DC, July 17, 2018. Hon. GREGWALDEN , Chairman, House Energy and Commerce Committee, Washington, DC. Hon. FRANK PALLONE , Ranking Member, House Energy and Commerce Committee, Washington, DC. Hon. SUSAN W. B ROOKS , House Energy and Commerce Committee, Washington, DC. Hon. ANNAG. E SHOO , House Energy and Commerce Committee, Washington, DC. DEARCHAIRMAN WALDEN , RANKING MEMBER  PALLONE , CONGRESSWOMAN BROOKS AND CONGRESSWOMAN ESHOO : The Pew Charitable Trusts thanks you for your continued efforts to respond to the ongoing threat of antibiotic resistance through the introduction of H.R. 6378, the Pandemic and AllHazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act of 2018 (PAHPA). This important legislation reauthorizes the essential work of the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR)’s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) to address public health emergencies and bring desperatelyneeded antibiotics to patients. Effective antibacterials are central to the nation’s ability to respond to public health threats, including chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear attacks (CBRN), pandemic influenza, and emerging infectious disease—antibiotics are an integral part of the nation’s armament to address these threats. We especially want to thank the Members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee for including language related to antibiotic resistance in Section 302 of PAHPA. This language will ensure that BARDA is explicitly authorized to address all CBRN threats—both intentional and naturally occurring—through robust support of innovative approaches in both preclinical and clinical development. BARDA’s unique experience working with industry to drive innovation is particularly important to advance novel therapeutics and preventive interventions and to help bridge the gap between basic science and successful clinical drug development. BARDA safeguards our nation’s health infrastructure by revitalizing and encouraging antibacterial innovation to ensure that we have a healthy pool of candidate products to address emerging threats. The CARB–X accelerator addresses critical gaps along the early stages of the antibacterial pipeline, and BARDA’s Broad Spectrum Antimicrobials program advances therapeutics into late stage clinical development. The two programs work in tandem to support a robust pipeline of novel approaches for highly resistant infections and emerging threat pathogens. Thank you for continued support of this important work. Sincerely, KATHY TALKINGTON , Antibiotic Resistance Project Director. AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF  POISON CONTROL CENTERS , Alexandria, VA, July 20, 2018. Hon. SUSAN BROOKS , Washington, DC. Hon. ANNAESHOO , Washington, DC. DEARCONGRESSWOMEN BROOKS AND ESHOO : The American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC) would like to extend our support for H.R. 6378, the Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act of 2018. As you already know, AAPCC supports the nation’s 55 poison control centers in their efforts to prevent and treat poison exposures. Poison control centers across the U.S. receive approximately 3 million calls annually that cover a variety of substances, including prescription and overthecounter medications, illegal drugs, household products, pesticides, cosmetics, environmental toxins, food, plants, and animal bites and stings. These calls come from a wide variety of individuals, including the public, health care providers, 911 PSAPs (Public Safety Answering Points), schools, health departments, law enforcement, and other safety agencies. The centers operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year and are accessed through a federally funded nationwide toll free number: 800–222–1222 (Poison Help). When someone calls 800–222–1222, the calls are answered by highly trained Specialists in Poison Information (pharmacists and nurses), who diagnose, triage, and offer treatment recommendations to callers with 24hour oversight from Board Certified Medical and Clinical Toxicologists. We answer calls from every state and territory in our nation. We know that you and your staff are already familiar with the wonderful work of the Indiana Poison Center and the California Poison Control System. There are three references, all in Title II, to poison centers in Public Law 113–5 (the Pandemic and AllHazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2013). These provisions allow states and public health departments to work directly with their regional poison center and have resulted in improved preparedness preparations in multiple communities throughout the nation. Thank you for keeping these poison center references in H.R. 6378. We also deeply appreciate your inclusion of poison centers in Section 207, Regional Health Care Emergency Preparedness and Response Systems. Poison centers have a unique set of knowledge and are the primary source for poisoning information. Our employees are trained to handle stressful, potentially life altering situations on a daily basis and we already have the infrastructure in place as a 24/7 365 days a year call center. We are a vital resource on a number of topics from chemical spills to mass exposure to an unknown toxin to a public health emergency including the pandemic flu or Ebola and Zika. The poison control system is a wellestablished, nationwide network made up of sophisticated and specially trained medical professionals who handle calls related to over 420,000 products and substances and their related toxicities. Our poison centers support your efforts and look forward to our work together on this important topic. Finally, a special thank you to your staff, Catherine Knowles and Rachel Fybel for all of their assistance. Thank you, as always, for your continued support of our 55 poison centers. Warmest regards, WILLIAM BANNER , Jr., MD, PhD, President, AAPCC, Oklahoma Center for Poison & Drug Information.

Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I include the following letters in the RECORD . 
FORMICROBIOLOGY , Washington, DC, July 23, 2018. Hon. PAULRYAN, Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. GREGWALDEN , Chairman, Energy and Commerce Committee, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. SUSAN BROOKS , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. NANCY PELOSI , Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. FRANK PALLONE , Ranking Member, Energy and Commerce Committee, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. ANNAESHOO , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR SPEAKER RYAN, M INORITY LEADER  PELOSI , CHAIRMAN WALDEN , RANKING MEMBER  PALLONE , REPRESENTATIVE BROOKS AND REPRESENTATIVE ESHOO : The American Society for Microbiology (ASM) congratulates the Energy and Commerce Committee on its passage of the Pandemic and AllHazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act of 2018 (H.R. 6378) and encourages its swift passage in the House. ASM is the largest single life science society, composed of more than 32,000 scientists and health professionals. Our mission is to promote and advance the microbial sciences, including programs and initiatives funded by the federal government departments and agencies, by virtue of the pervasive role of microorganisms in health and society. Antimicrobial resistance is among the most consequential issues facing world today. ASM is therefore pleased that H.R. 6378 includes Section 406, a provision that would guarantee the continued work of the Presidential Advisory Council on Combating AntibioticResistant Bacteria (PACCARB) by codifying the Advisory Council. A guarantee of PACCARB’s continuance also sustains the One Health partnerships—the integration of human, animal, and environmental domains—that have been formed since the establishment of PACCARB. This year marks the 100th anniversary of the Influenza Pandemic of 1918, which killed almost 40 million people, and serves a reminder that the United States must be prepared to rapidly respond to declared and potential public health emergencies, including infectious disease epidemics. ASM strongly supports the legislation’s reauthorization of the Biomedical Advanced Research Development Authority (BARDA) and is pleased to see inclusion and authorization of a Pandemic Influenza Program and Emerging Infectious Disease Program. Authorization of funding for the Strategic National Stockpile and the Bioshield Special Reserve Fund are all critically important to our public health security. Therefore, it is important that reauthorization be met with a corresponding commitment of federal resources. Lastly, ASM appreciates that the legislation points to the need for an adequately funded Public Health Emergency Fund (PHEF) and strengthens existing authorities for which PHEF dollars may be used, including in anticipation of a potential public health emergency. Vigilance will be required to make sure our country is adequately prepared to make financial resources available in a timely manner to potential or immediate public health emergencies, and so we look forward to your continued leadership in this regard. ASM believes that H.R. 6378 will further our nation’s preparedness to respond in a timely and coordinated manner to declared and potential public health threats. Toward this end, ASM strongly supports swift final passage by the Senate and House. We appreciate your championship of these issues and stands ready to work with you towards this goal. Should you have any questions, please contact Allen Segal, Director, ASM Public Policy and Advocacy. Sincerely, STEFANO BERTUZZI , PH.D., MPH, CEO, American Society for Microbiology. ALLEN D. S EGAL , Director, Public Policy and Advocacy, American Society for Microbiology. 
ASTHO, S EPTEMBER 23, 2018. Hon. LAMAR ALEXANDER , Chairman, Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Hon. GREGG WALDEN , Chairman, Energy & Commerce Committee, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. PATTY MURRAY , Ranking Member, Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Hon. FRANK PALLONE , Jr, Ranking Member, Energy & Commerce Committee, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR CHAIRMAN ALEXANDER , R ANKING  MEMBER MURRAY , CHAIRMAN WALDEN , AND RANKING MEMBER PALLONE : The Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO) submits this letter in support of most of the public health provisions included in the ‘‘Pandemic and AllHazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act of 2018’’ (H.R. 6378). ASTHO is the national nonprofit organization representing the state and territorial public health agencies of the United States, U.S. territories, and Washington, D.C. ASTHO’s members, the chief health officials of these jurisdictions, are dedicated to formulating and influencing sound public health policy and assuring excellence in public health practice. ASTHO is pleased that this bill retains elements proven to be necessary, reasonable, and successful, while making further refinements to the underlying statute, as well as responding to and including many of ASTHO’s priorities. These priorities, outlined in previously submitted comment letters, include suggestions for clarifications and acknowledgments regarding the importance of state, local, territorial, and tribal public health. These provisions include: Reauthorizing the Public Health Emergency Preparedness Program (PHEP) and Hospital Preparedness Program (HPP). PHEP and HPP are key to the foundational capabilities of public health preparedness and healthcare Codifying the role of CDC to administer the PHEP program Bolstering the Public Health Emergency Rapid Response Fund and mechanisms to quickly distribute funds Requiring that the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasure Enterprise (PHEMCE) solicit and consider input from state, local, tribal, and territorial public health departments or officials Improving the nation’s ability to take a ‘‘OneHealth’’ approach to preparedness and response capabilities Reauthorizing the temporary reassignment of state and local personnel during public health emergencies Requiring the HHS secretary, in collaboration with ASPR and CDC, to maintain the strategic national stockpile Including a provision to strengthen the Epidemic Intelligence Service by increasing the loan repayment amount from $35,000 to $50,000 In addition, ASTHO expresses our concern and seeks clarification from the committee on changes to HPP, particularly those that alter eligibility requirements for funding from a ‘‘partnership’’ to‘‘coalitions.’’ One of the most crucial functions of HPP is to bring together and incentivize ‘‘diverse and often competitive healthcare organizations to work together.’’ As neutral conveners, state and territorial public health departments are the most appropriate entities and stewards of taxpayer dollars. They are also responsible for statewide planning and coordination of services and fundamentally serve all residents in their jurisdictions—not just lives covered under a plan or specific catchment area. With the establishment of hundreds of Healthcare Coalitions across the country, ASTHO seeks assurance that the letter, spirit, and intent of this modification does not in any way change the current cooperative agreement structure and stature, nor does it alter the role and responsibilities of states, territories, and directlyfunded cities as awardees of funds under HPP. ASTHO also remains concerned that authorization levels—$685 million for PHEP and $385 million for HPP—are significantly lower than our suggested authorization levels of $824 million for PHEP and $474 million for HPP. ASTHO is concerned that authorizing at these proposed levels will be insufficient. Both PHEP and HPP must be resourced at sufficient levels to ensure that every community is prepared for disasters. An efficient and effective state and local workforce depends heavily on reliable, ongoing funding support for a network of state and local expertise, relationships and trust that is carefully built over time through shared responses, training, and exercises. Regarding sections that speak to ‘‘reservations of amounts for regional systems,’’ ASTHO would also like to reiterate that HPP is already funded at a vastly insufficient level given the task of preparing the healthcare system for a surge of patients, continuity of operations, and recovery. Any funding reductions to HPP through a tap will have an adverse impact on realtime all hazards preparedness and response activities carried out by the existing healthcare coalitions. The costs associated with exploring the development of a regional system or network should not be at the expense of current critical medical readiness and patient care services. Finally, while we appreciate that the bill strengthens existing authorities for the Public Health Emergency Fund, we continue to urge Congress to create a mechanism to fund and replenish it. Without sufficient and dedicated funding, it will be impossible to quickly access funds when needed. ASTHO appreciates the opportunity to provide our comments on this critical legislation and the bipartisan efforts of both the House and Senate committees. Sincerely, JOHNWIESMAN , DRPH, MPH, ASTHO President, Secretary of Health, Washington State Department of Health Olympia, WA. 
BIOTECHNOLOGY INNOVATION  ORGANIZATION , September 24, 2018. Hon. SUSAN BROOKS , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. ANNAESHOO , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR REPRESENTATIVES BROOKS AND  ESHOO : On behalf of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO), I am writing to express our strong support for final passage of H.R. 6378, the ‘‘Pandemic and AllHazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act of 2018’’. I wish to commend you for your extraordinary work getting this legislation to the House floor. BIO represents more than 1,000 biotechnology companies, academic institutions, state biotechnology centers and related organizations across the United States and in more than 30 other nations. BIO’s members are committed to investing in, developing, and delivering innovative vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostic tools that are transforming how we protect, treat and cure people from devastating infectious diseases. Many of BIO’s members are active partners with the U.S. government to strengthen our national health security through the development and stockpile of medical countermeasures (MCM) against the myriad threats facing our nation. The value that these MCMs offer to first responders, patients and their caregivers, and the global community is phenomenal. BIO was pleased to see the Act continue to provide support for critical preparedness programs such as the BioShield Special Reserve Fund (SRF), the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), and the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS)—all of which are necessary to ensure that we can maintain a robust medical countermeasures enterprise that can address known and unknown threats. We are also pleased to see that significant threats such pandemic influenza, emerging infectious diseases, and antimicrobial resistance are specifically recognized in the Act and that BARDA has been authorized appropriations to address these dangerous threats. We are very supportive of the overall authorization of $2.4 billion annually to the MCM enterprise, which will allow the Secretary of Health and Human Services to more fully prepare for many of the threats affecting our national health security. BIO thanks you for your commitment to our national health security and your important work to ensure that our nation is adequately prepared to respond to the myriad threats we face domestically and abroad. BIO and our member companies look forward to continuing to work with you to further strengthen our preparedness against all potential national security and public health threats as outlined in the National Biodefense Strategy. With Sincerest Regards, JAMES C. G REENWOOD , President and CEO. 
CALIFORNIA LIFESCIENCES ASSOCIATION , July 16, 2018. Hon. SUSAN BROOKS , Washington, DC. Hon. ANNAG. E SHOO , Washington, DC. DEAR REPRESENTATIVES BROOKS AND  ESHOO : On behalf of California Life Sciences Association (CLSA)—the statewide public policy organization representing California’s leading life science innovators, including medical device, diagnostic, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, research universities and private, nonprofit institutes, and venture capital firms—I am writing to express our support for H.R. 6378, the Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation (PAHPAI) Act of 2018, your legislation that will strengthen and improve our national preparedness and response for public health emergencies, and accelerate medical countermeasure research and development. Thank you for your leadership on this critically important issue. As you know, the recent Ebola and Zika outbreaks and ongoing threats from terrorist organizations like ISIS have repeatedly exposed our nation’s continued vulnerability to bioterror and pandemic threats, demonstrating the need for robust biodefense preparedness. Robust, longterm funding, and strong and sustained publicprivate partnerships remain critical in ensuring a well funded, wellcoordinated, swift and effective response from all stakeholders. This includes, critically, a robust statutory framework for securing our nation from chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threats, as well as from pandemic influenza (PI), antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and emerging infectious diseases (EID). To that end, H.R. 6378 strengthens our country’s national preparedness and response efforts for public health emergencies by codifying the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasure Enterprise and the duties of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), while maintaining the important role of the Centers for Disease Control in emergency and response activities. The legislation also provides the authorization and federal resources to invest in programs related to Pandemic Influenza and Emerging Infectious Diseases. We are pleased the bill provides new authorities to the Director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) to develop strategic initiatives for threats that pose a significant level of risk to national security, including antimicrobial resistant pathogens. We also encourage you to continue working with you colleagues on the House Committee on Energy & Commerce and congressional leadership to explore the creation of new incentives to encourage investment into the development of products to treat or prevent a disease attributable to a multidrug resistant bacterial or fungal pathogen. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), each year at least two million people in the United States are infected with bacteria that cannot be treated with an antibiotic, resulting in roughly 23,000 deaths and health care costs as much as $20 billion annually. These staggering statistics illustrate a dangerous reality: even as the rate of antimicrobial resistance has grown, research and drug development has not kept pace with the dire need for new medicines to treat these increasingly lethal ‘‘superbugs.’’ Given the threat that these deadly pathogens pose to public health in the United States and across the world, the need for effective publicprivate partnerships between the government, academia and industry has never been greater. The growing epidemic of multidrugresistant infections knows no borders and the reestablishment of antibiotic development as a viable investment for life sciences innovators is imperative to public health and preparedness. Thank you again for your leadership of H.R. 6378, as well as your longstanding support for legislation and policy measures that improve our nation’s biodefense preparedness and response capabilities. CLSA is pleased to join a broad group of stakeholders in offering our strong support for H.R. 6378, the Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act of 2018. Please let me know if CLSA can be of assistance to you. Sincerely, JENNIFER NIETO CAREY , Vice President—Federal Government Relations & Alliance Development. 
The goal at Cellphire, currently supported by the ASPR through BARDA, is to develop and field a freezedried platelet product to stop hemorrhage that can alleviate platelet shortages and lead to a lifesaving product that controls bleeding and can be stockpiled. Supplying, distributing and resupplying this and other blood products during a crisis requires a sustainable blood supply. The PAHPA Reauthorization bill includes language for the Assistant Secretary of Preparedness Response (ASPR) to include the stability of the blood supply as it considers guidelines for infrastructure. Section 203 further lists the blood banks in the stakeholder groups with whom ASPR should engage to obtain feedback on financial implications as it relates to regional preparedness planning pursuant to the guidelines. We believe the reference to the national blood supply and the inclusion of the blood collection centers and hospital blood banks in ASPR guidelines to establish infrastructure and regional preparedness planning will ensure our nation’s blood supply is ready and prepared for surge capacity in the event of a disaster or terrorist attack. Thank you for your leadership in addressing the blood supply in HR 6378, the PAHPA Reauthorization. We support the Committee’s attention to this urgent matter of national security. Sincerely, MICHAEL FITZPATRICK , Ph.D , COL (Ret.) U.S. Army, President and Director of Research, Cellphire, Inc. 
COALITION FOR EPIDEMIC  PREPAREDNESS INNOVATIONS , July 17, 2018. Hon. GREGWALDEN , Chairman, Washington DC. Hon. FRANK PALLONE , Ranking, Energy and Commerce Committee, Washington DC. DEAR CHAIRMAN WALDEN AND RANKING  MEMBER PALLONE : I write in strong support of HR 6378, the Pandemic and AllHazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act (PAHPA.) As you know, public health emergencies can result from natural disasters, emerging pathogens, or manmade threats. Just last year we saw health challenges emerge on multiple fronts due to hurricanes, a virulent strain of the flu, and outbreaks of plague, Lassa, Nipah and Ebola overseas. The United States must do everything in its power to prepare for health emergencies, and HR 6378 goes a long way towards helping the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) achieve that goal. As the CEO of CEPI, an international coalition whose mission it is to develop vaccines to prevent future epidemics, I am heartened to see language in the bill asking HHS to report on its work developing vaccines to prevent epidemics, including its collaborations with international organizations (Section 303). As we saw in the recent Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo, vaccines and international coalitions can play a critically important role in outbreak response and HHS should maximize its support for this kind of vaccine research and development. I am also pleased that HR 6378 creates an emerging infectious disease program within the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) [Section 302]. CEPI would welcome the opportunity to partner with BARDA on future vaccine candidates for emerging infectious diseases of global significance. In addition, the codification of the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasure Enterprise (PHEMCE) is another important feature of this bill [Section 101]. The PHEMCE works to ensure that medical countermeasure development is aligned across the government and that bottlenecks can be anticipated and prevented, which is important to prevent costly duplication of work and other inefficiencies. In summary, I believe that HR 6378 will strengthen US public health preparedness, particularly when it comes to vaccines and medical countermeasure development and coordination, and I am pleased that it will be considered by your committee. Sincerely, RICHARD HATCHETT , CEO. 
Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I include the following letters in the RECORD . 
CERUS , Concord, CA, July 17, 2018. Hon. GREGWALDEN , Chairman, House Energy and Commerce Committee, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. FRANK PALLONE , Ranking Member, House Energy & Commerce Committee, House of Representatives, Washington, DC, DEAR CHAIRMAN WALDEN AND RANKING  MEMBER PALLONE : As you review and deliberate over H.R. 6378, the Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act of 2018, we wanted to provide our support for the efforts in the legislation to preserve and protect the nation’s blood supply—especially in a public health emergency. As you know, the American public expects the nation’s blood supply is safe and available every day, but especially in situations of natural or manmade disasters. Blood transfusions can be lifesaving measures, but this depends on our collective ability to ensure the safety and availability of the blood supply. Though the danger of transfusion transmitted infections has decreased in recent years due to improved blood testing for specific pathogens such as HIV and hepatitis, these tests do not detect the presence of all viruses, bacteria, and parasites known to contaminate blood donations. In 2015 at the height of the Zika epidemic in Puerto Rico, the FDA released guidance calling for the use of blood treatment pathogen reduction technology as an option to reduce the risk of transfusiontransmission of Zika. This pathogen reduction technology helped ensure that very ill patients would have adequate access to safe blood and that they would not contract Zika virus infection from their therapeutic blood transfusions. Section 116 is critical to ensuring the blood collection community, in concert with the Department of Health and Human Services, begins to cohesively examine the challenges with preserving capacity in the nation’s blood supply for major emergency care, addressing issues like recruiting sufficient donors to ensure the adequacy of the current supply to meet public health emergencies and implementation of innovative and best safety practices. The inclusion of blood banks in Section 203 is also critical for ensuring the blood banking community has an opportunity to engage along with hospitals, health care facilities, public agencies and others to provide input into our nation’s new ‘‘Healthcare Preparedness and it Response Program.’’ The inclusion of blood banks is critical in providing feedback on the financial implications for the program as the industry faces many challenges in ensuring a transfusionready blood supply. I sincerely appreciate the time and effort that both of you, your fellow Committee members and the staff have placed in drafting, reviewing, and deliberation over H.R. 6378. I look forward to continuing to work with all of you in supporting our nation’s ability to respond in public health emergencies. Sincerely, DR. LAURENCE CORASH , MD Chief Scientific Officer, Cerus. 
JULY19, 2018. Hon. GREGWALDEN , Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Washington, DC. Hon. SUSAN W. B ROOKS , Washington, DC. Hon. FRANK PALLONE , Jr., Ranking Member, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Washington, DC. Hon. ANNAESHOO , Washington, DC. DEARCHAIRMAN WALDEN , RANKING MEMBER  PALLONE , ANDREPRESENTATIVES BROOKS AND  ESHOO : Child Care Aware of America cares deeply about the health and wellbeing of children and their success in child care. We would like to thank you for your bipartisan commitment to reauthorizing the Pandemic and AllHazards Preparedness Act. As the Pandemic and AllHazards Preparedness (PAHPA) and Advancing Innovation Act of 2018 moves forward, we want to voice our support for extending and expanding the authorization of the National Advisory Committee on Children and Disasters (NACCD) to address the ongoing gaps in our nation’s preparedness and response for children. Recent natural disasters such as Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria have demonstrated that our nation still is not fully prepared to respond to the child care needs of children. We also appreciate the proposed additional expertise to the NACCD to include nonfederal experts in pediatric mental or behavioral health, pediatric infectious disease, children’s hospitals, and children and youth with special health care needs, and particularly, professionals with expertise in child care or school settings. The NACCD was established to provide advice and consultation to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary and the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) on issues related to the medical and public health needs of children before, during, and after disasters. The NACCD has completed several reports in recent years focused on youth leadership, surge capacity, and the provision of human services. Their expertise has been invaluable in ensuring that children are protected during public health emergencies and disasters. Our organization learned that after Hurricane Irma, 22% of the child care facilities in the state of Florida were closed due to the storm. In the MiamiDadeMonroe area specifically, 32% of facilities were closed. Following Hurricane Harvey, 18% of child care facilities were closed in the Houston area. This means that thousands of children and their families were left without child care. This carries an incredible burden on families as they struggle to find child care when they are needed at work. Furthermore, the interruption of normalcy can cause stress on children leading to negative consequences for brain development. Including expertise in child care will help in making sure that the needs of the 11 million children in child care will be met before, during, and after a disaster. Children are not little adults. They have specialized needs that must be considered when planning for, responding to, and recovering from a disaster. This includes having a strong, wellfunded public health and medical system. We thank you considering the many needs of children and including them 
in the Pandemic and AllHazards Preparedness (PAHPA) and Advancing Innovation Act of 2018. Sincerely, CHILD CAREAWARE OF AMERICA . 
CHIME & AEHIS, July 23, 2018. Re Inclusion of Cybersecurity in the Pandemic and AllHazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act of 2018 Hon. GREGWALDEN , Chairman, House Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. FRANK PALLONE , Ranking Member, House Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR CHAIRMAN WALDEN AND RANKING  MEMBER PALLONE : The College of Healthcare Information Management Executives (CHIME) and the Association for Executives in Healthcare Information Security (AEHIS) sincerely appreciate the inclusion of cybersecurity provisions in section 401 of the Pandemic and AllHazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act of 2018. This critical section of legislation recognizes the importance of ensuring the nation’s health systems are better prepared and better able to respond in the event of a cybersecurity incident. CHIME is an executive organization dedicated to serving chief information officers (CIOs), chief medical information officers (CMIOs), chief nursing information officers (CNIOs) and other senior healthcare IT leaders. Consisting of more than 2,600 members in 51 countries, our members are responsible for the selection and implementation of clinical and business technology systems that are facilitating healthcare transformation. CHIME members are among the nation’s foremost health IT experts, including on the topic of cybersecurity. Launched by CHIME in 2014, AEHIS represents more than 850 chief information security officers (CISOs) and provides education and networking for senior IT security leaders in healthcare. CHIME and AEHIS members take their responsibility to protect the privacy and security of patient data and devices networked to their system very seriously. The widespread attacks experienced by health systems worldwide during the spring of 2017 highlighted the need to consider the cybersecurity readiness of the healthcare sector and demonstrated the importance of increased preparedness and rapid response in the event of an incident. Cybersecurity threats are growing in frequency and sophistication coming from a variety of actors seeking to send our country’s healthcare system into disarray. Our members continue to worry about the threats to patient care and safety posed by cybersecurity attacks. CHIME and AEHIS appreciate the inclusion of cybersecurity in the Pandemic All Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2018. We agree that cybersecurity threats and the recognition of their potential to disrupt healthcare delivery is of the utmost importance to patient safety and therefore, needs to be a part of the National Health Security Strategy. CHIME and AEHIS believe it is imperative that cybersecurity is treated as a threat to our nation in similarity to other hazards. We also appreciate the designation of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) as the leader within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in the event of a cybersecurity incident. Our members have repeatedly cited confusion, leading to frustration, about which operating division within HHS has responsibility over cybersecurity and serves as a liaison to the industry. We appreciate your continued interest and leadership on this important and increasingly urgent subject. We stand ready to work with you and your colleagues to pursue legislative solutions to improve the cybersecurity readiness of the nation’s healthcare sector. Sincerely, CLETIS EARLE , Chair, CHIME Board of Trustees Vice President, CIO Information Technology, Kaleida Health. ERIKDECKER , Chair, AEHIS Board CISO and Chief Privacy Officer, University of Chicago Medicine. 
EMERGENT BIOSOLUTIONS , July 17, 2018. Hon. SUSAN BROOKS , Washington, DC. Hon. GREGWALDEN , Washington, DC. Hon. ANNAESHOO , Washington, DC. Hon. FRANK PALLONE , Washington, DC. DEAR REPS. BROOKS , ESHOO , WALDEN , AND PALLONE : Thank you to you and your staff for your hard work in introducing H.R. 6378, the Pandemic and AllHazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act of 2018. This legislation, like PAHPRA and PAHPA before it, is vital to ensuring our nation is safe from and prepared for both humandeployed and natural chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threats. Emergent is pleased to support PAHPAI. We are appreciative of your staff for taking the time to meet with us and solicit feedback about the PAHPAI. Thank you for your leadership in ensuring the legislation further strengthens our nation’s preparedness for biological threats. Funding Levels: Emergent strongly supports the robust funding levels authorized in PAHPAI. This funding is needed to continue to grow the publicprivate partnership Congress created to ensure the U.S. is adequately prepared for CBRN threats. Sustained and expanded investment in these programs is a vital market pull to ensure private partners produce medical countermeasures for the most serious threats we face as a nation, such as anthrax, smallpox, and chemical threats. If the government fails to adequately support the Special Reserve Fund, BARDA, and the SNS, the nation faces the dual risk of squandering resources already invested into research and preparedness, while also being underprepared or unprepared for material threats to our national security. Identified Authorization Funding Levels for Key Programs: Emergent is strongly supportive of the inclusion of specific funding authorization that breaks out the minimum amounts for the critical Pandemic Influenza and Emerging Infectious Disease (EID) activities supported through BARDA. Specific authorizations help ensure that BARDA’s priorities receive consistent funding needed to drive the development of countermeasures to respond to material threats, pandemic influenza, emerging infectious diseases, and other public health hazards. Other Transaction (OT) Authority: We appreciate your efforts to update the medical countermeasure enterprise’s OT authority and harmonize it with the OT authority of other agencies. These changes will provide the enterprise needed flexibility to better prepare for manmade and naturallyoccurring biological threats. The public health threat matrix is real and growing. Reauthorization of PAHPAI is vital to ensuring our nation is prepared for the most severe threats facing the country. As introduced, PAHPAI will greatly enhance our nation’s biosecurity preparedness. We believe that Emergent is uniquely positioned to enable the U.S. and allied governments to address many of these threats based on our growing portfolio of medical countermeasures, decades of experience and expertise in government partnering and contracting, and our broad and deep manufacturing capabilities. We hope we can be a resource as the committee continues to work towards passage of PAHPAI. Sincerely, CHRIS FRECH , Senior Vice President, Global Government Affairs, Emergent BioSolutions, Inc. 
GENENTECH , Washington, DC, 17 July 2018. Hon. ANNAG. E SHOO , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. GREGWALDEN , Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. SUSAN W. B ROOKS , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon.

Sincerely, DAVID BURT, Senior Director, Federal Government Affairs. 
GRIFOLS PUBLIC AFFAIRS , Washington, DC, July 24, 2018. Hon. SUSAN BROOKS , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. ANNAESHOO , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR CONGRESSWOMAN BROOKS AND CONGRESSWOMAN ESHOO : Thank you for your leadership on healthcare issues in the Congress. Grifols is proud to join the public health and infectious disease communities in expressing our strong support for H.R. 6378, the ‘‘Pandemic and AllHazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act of 2018.’’ This legislation is critical to maintaining our national preparedness in response to public health emergencies. Grifols is a global healthcare company with a 75year history of producing plasma derived medicines, diagnostic tools and hospital pharmacy products. Grifols is a leader in transfusion medicine as a supplier of blood and plasma infectious disease screening systems that are critical to safeguarding the U.S. blood supply. 
The Nation’s experience with emerging infectious diseases, such as Zika, demonstrates the need for a coordinated response to public health threats. In a report commissioned by the Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Assistant Secretary of Health, the RAND Corporation found there are 86 emerging or recently emerged pathogens that threaten the safety of the blood supply. The threat posed by these emerging infectious diseases exhibits the need to plan for managing potential outbreaks. In particular, Grifols is supportive of the provisions in H.R. 6378 to aid the development and appropriate utilization of multiuse platform technologies for diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics; virus seeds; clinical trial lots; novel virus strains; and antigen and adjuvant material; as well as the provisions aimed at strengthening the U.S. blood supply: Requiring a report on the adequacy of the national blood supply Establish guidelines, in consultation with health care providers—including blood banks, relating to emergency preparedness which consider the needs of the blood supply, taking into account resiliency, geographic and rural considerations, as well as the financial implications of implementing such guidelines Seeking input from all blood supply stakeholders in the development of emergency preparedness guidelines will help strengthen the public health infrastructure by ensuring that the unique needs of the blood supply are met. In the interests of U.S. public health, we encourage Congress to pass H.R. 6378 to ensure a robust response to public health threats. Sincerely, CHRISTOPHER HEALEY , Vice President. 
Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I include the following letters in the RECORD . 
JULY18, 2018. Hon. SUSAN BROOKS , Washington, DC. Hon. ANNAESHOO , Washington, DC. DEAR REPRESENTATIVES BROOKS AND  ESHOO : I am writing on behalf of Roche Diagnostics Corporation in support of H.R. 6378, Pandemic and AllHazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act of 2018. Congratulations on advancing this legislation out of the Energy and Commerce Committee. We applaud your efforts in improving the nation’s overall preparedness and response capabilities. We especially appreciate the Committee’s recognition that diagnostics can play a key role in responding to public health and medical emergencies. We look forward to continuing to work with you as this legislation advances in Congress. Sincerely, RUSSELL C. R ING, Vice President, Government Affairs, Roche Diagnostics Corporation. 
STRATEGIC HEALTH INFORMATION  EXCHANGE COLLABORATIVE , July 18, 2018. REPS. BROOKS AND ESHOO AND MEMBERS OF  
THE ENERGY AND COMMERCE COMMITTEE : On behalf of the Strategic Health Information Exchange Collaborative (SHIEC), which represents more than 60 Health Information Exchanges (HIEs) across the nation, thank you for your leadership on the reauthorization of the Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness Act (PAHPAI). SHIEC HIEs have played an important role across the country and have a strong interest in emergency preparedness and disaster relief. SHIEC HIEs have demonstrated the important role they play in federal, state, and local governments. In 2017 SHIEC HIEs in Texas partnered with local providers and patients to access critical medical information in the wake of Hurricane Harvey, and SHIEC HIEs in New York helped to thwart a ransomware attack and safeguard patient information. SHIEC is a recognized leader in medical record interoperability via the Patient Centered Data Home. This initiative allows patients, no matter where they are—whether caught up in emergencies while traveling or displaced by disasters—access to their medical information when and where they need it. SHIEC is pleased with the proposed direction for this reauthorization of PAHPAI, particularly the broadened scope of Title II regarding ‘‘Optimizing State and Local All Hazards Preparedness and Response.’’ State and local agencies and hospitals are not the only healthcare stakeholders during a crisis. There are many entities that should be consulted in emergencyplanning. Addressing the problems and solutions more broadly allows state and local agencies and hospitals to better prepare and handle disasters. To this end SHIEC applauds the Committee’s inclusion of not just the brick and mortar infrastructure, but also the ‘‘technological infrastructure’’ while developing guidelines and protocols. SHIEC is also happy to see the broad reference to ‘‘healthcare or subject matter experts’’ which replaces a more restrictive reference to healthcare providers and agencies. SHIEC recommends inclusion of HIEs specifically. As the data trustees in a community, SHIEC HIEs offer vital services to support a community in crisis. Awareness and realization of this full benefit has yet to be achieved in some areas. Without inclusion of clarifying language, SHIEC is concerned HIEs may still be left out of planning. SHIEC hopes however, that the broader, more inclusive language that the Committee has proposed will be expansive enough to ensure HIEs a seat at the emergency preparedness and disaster relief table. Thank you, KELLY HOOVER THOMPSON , CEO.

Sincerely, RAJEEV VENKAYYA , M.D., President, Global Vaccines Business Unit, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited. 
TRAUMA CENTER ASSOCIATION OF  AMERICA , July 24, 2018. Hon. GREGWALDEN , Chairman, House Committee on Energy & Commerce, Washington, DC. Hon. SUSAN BROOKS , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. FRANK PALLONE , JR., Ranking Member, House Committee on Energy & Commerce, Washington, DC. Hon. ANNAESHOO , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARCHAIRMAN WALDEN , RANKING MEMBER  PALLONE , REP. BROOKS AND REP. ESHOO : The Trauma Center Association of America (‘‘TCAA’’) strongly supports H.R. 6378, the Pandemic and AllHazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act of 2018. We applaud your bipartisan leadership in developing this legislation that will help improve and strengthen the preparedness and response capabilities of our nation’s trauma care system. We appreciate your willingness to work with TCAA and our members as you crafted this important piece of legislation. Specifically, we are pleased to see that the bill reauthorizes federal grant funding to support the core missions of trauma centers to offset the cost of activities such as patient stabilization and transfer, trauma education and outreach, coordination with local and regional trauma systems, essential personnel, trauma staff recruitment and retention, ensuring surge capacity, and traumarelated emotional and mental health services. Additionally, TCAA has long advocated for the MISSION ZERO Act, and we strongly support the inclusion of language to establish a grant program for militarycivilian partnerships in trauma care that will allow both sectors to benefit from the others’ expertise and experience. This will benefit patients both on and off the battlefield and we look forward to continuing to work with you to implement this program. Finally, we were pleased to see that the bill requires the development of guidelines, and the authorization of a demonstration program, to promote coordination and surge capacity among regional systems of hospitals and other public health facilities during a public health emergency. This will help improve our nation’s response capabilities and give more patients access to high quality trauma care. We look forward to passage of H.R. 6378 and continued work with the Senate to ensure that this legislation becomes law. Again, thank you for your hard work and commitment to preparing and equipping our 
healthcare system for future disasters and public health emergencies. EILEEN WHALEN , MHA, BSN, RN, Chair, Board of Directors. Trauma Center Association of America. JENNIFER WARD, MBA, BSN, RN, President, Trauma Center Association of America. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. BROOKS ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6378, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ‘‘A bill to reauthorize certain programs under the Pandemic and AllHazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act.’’. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
NUCLEAR UTILIZATION OF KEYNOTE ENERGY ACT Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1320) to amend the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 related to Nuclear Regulatory Commission user fees and annual charges, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1320 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Nuclear Utilization of Keynote Energy Act’’. 
Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission shall submit to Congress a report on the status of addressing and implementing the recommendations contained in the memorandum of the Executive Director of Operations of the Commission entitled ‘‘Tasking in Response to the Assessment of the Considerations Identified in a ‘Study of Reprisal and Chilling Effect for Raising MissionRelated Concerns and Differing Views at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’’’ and dated June 19, 2018 (ADAMS Accession No.: ML18165A296). 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. OLSON ) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. 
Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous materials in the RECORD on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. b1530 Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1320, the Nuclear Utilization of Keynote Energy Act is a bipartisan bill. The NUKE Act, as it is known, was sponsored by my Energy and Commerce friends, ADAM KINZINGER from Illinois and M IKE DOYLE from Pennsylvania. The bill went through regular order in the committee. With only one single amendment, it went through the full committee by a voice vote. The NUKE Act makes targeted reforms to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. It reforms the fee structure, which, at present, threatens to increase the financial burden of our Nation’s nuclear fleet, nuclear suppliers, and those working on cuttingedge technology. This will be critical in the coming years as a large number of reactors are taken out of service. The bill also streamlines some of the licensing steps and other rules at the NRC. It means Congress will get useful information for oversight so we can find even more steps to keep the NRC on track. We need to make sure the old rules on nuclear power, dating back as far as the 1960s, still makes sense today. Overall, H.R. 1320 will help the nuclear industry with more clear and straightforward rules. And in doing so, average Americans and companies, large and small, will benefit. Nuclear technology can be part of the future for industry, medicine, and clean energy. Nuclear power is unique. It is the only baseload power we have that has no hydrocarbon emissions, zero. We also make sure that global leadership on nuclear power stays right here in America. That is important not just for jobs but for our national security. There is no question that nuclear power in America is flying into a headwind, but there is also no question that the industry provides important and sometimes underappreciated benefits to America. Congress can help lighten the burden while still making nuclear power the safest in the industry. H.R. 1320 is a key piece of this effort to ensure we have a robust nuclear industry going forward. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1320, the Nuclear Utilization of Keynote Energy Act. This bill makes commonsense revisions to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, or NRC’s licensing process that can ease the financial pressure on the nuclear industry without jeopardizing safety or the environment. Specifically, the bill makes a number of changes to the NRC’s budget process and fee structure, most significantly by limiting the fees charged to innovate and advance nuclear reactor projects. An important component of the bill requires NRC to report back to Congress on the commission’s actions to address instances of employees facing reprisal for raising safety concerns that differ from the commission’s position on a particular licensing action. A recent internal NRC report identified several troubling cases of NRC employees, who raised safety issues, being passed over for promotions or being excluded from work activities by management. This can’t stand, and I am pleased that this bill will take steps toward addressing this unacceptable situation. The bill also requires NRC to report to Congress on best practices for community engagement in regions where a nuclear power plant has shut down and is going through the decommissioning process. This is particularly important in my home State of New Jersey where the Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station ceased operations last week. I appreciate the efforts of the sponsors of this bill, Representatives DOYLE  and KINZINGER , to work with Ranking Member RUSHand me to make important changes to their original draft bill that significantly improved the legislation. I commend Mr. DOYLE and Mr. KINZINGER for their efforts. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. OLSON. Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN ), the chairman of the full Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their great work on the Nuclear Utilization of Keynote Energy Act, H.R. 1320. I especially thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. OLSON ), who is one of our real leaders on energy issues writ large on the Energy and Commerce Committee. By any measure, atomic energy has brought tremendous benefits to the Nation. It has provided a baseload, emissionsfree source of electricity that has powered homes and industry over the past half century. It has provided an infrastructure for our national and international security—from the technologies and fuels for our nuclear Navy, to the safety and security for civilian nuclear power the world over. However, a confluence of factors— abundant natural gas, power market designs, economic and regulatory burdens—they have all inhibited the Nation’s nuclear industry over the past 10 years. So the challenge confronting Congress is how to preserve and enhance the beneficial use of atomic energy for future generations. To continue to harvest the economic and national security benefits associated with our domestic nuclear energy infrastructure, we must take steps to update the relevant policies. So these policies must be forward looking to enable innovation and the development and deployment of new, advanced nuclear technologies. This bipartisan bill by Mr. KINZINGER  and Mr. DOYLE updates the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s fee structure for the first time in nearly 20 years, Madam Speaker. It reflects thoughtful work on both sides of the aisle to achieve really good public policy. H.R. 1320 establishes reasonable and predictable timeframes for regulatory decisions so that companies like Oregonbased NuScale Power can develop business plans to commercialize new nuclear technologies while also protecting future consumers from high regulatory costs. 
I commend my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their great work on yet another piece of legislation out of the Energy and Commerce Committee, and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1320. Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. MICHAEL F. D OYLE ), my colleague on the committee. Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. PALLONE . I appreciate the opportunity to speak about the Nuclear Utilization of Keynote Energy Act, or the NUKE Act. I thank my colleague, ADAM KINZINGER , for introducing this bill and working with me to advance it. I also thank Chris Bowman and Claire Borzner from my staff, as well as Mr. KINZINGER ’s staff, and the Energy and Commerce Committee staff for their diligent work to get this bill to the floor. This legislation is very timely as the nuclear industry is facing pressure from a variety of factors. Nuclear energy provides nearly 40 percent of Pennsylvania’s electricity, and it employs thousands of skilled workers in Pennsylvania. However, increasing NRC fees and uncertainty in the nuclear export process threaten this carbonfree and reliable source of baseload power. Addressing some of these issues is necessary to protect jobs in Pennsylvania and across the country, as well as to meet our Nation’s climate goals. This bipartisan legislation will take important steps to modernize the NRC’s fee structure, set achievable and flexible timelines for application reviews, and look to future reforms that will ensure the NRC can continue to effectively protect public health and safety. The bill addresses a serious reality facing the nuclear industry. As nuclear power plants retire, the remaining fleet will be faced with increasing fees from the NRC. We need to support our existing nuclear plants while ensuring that the NRC is able to fulfill its mission, and I believe that this legislation accomplishes those goals. So once again, I thank Mr. KINZINGER  for his work, and I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation. Mr. OLSON. Madam Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. KINZINGER ), the author of the bill. Mr. KINZINGER. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill, H.R. 1320, the Nuclear Utilization of Keystone Energy Act, which I proudly introduced with my colleague, MIKEDOYLE . I want to also share my compliments to his staff and my staff working together very well on hammering out a lot of the technical issues and getting this done. It shows that hard work matters. The United States is home to nine nuclear power plants—my district has four of those—which provide reliable, carbonfree electricity to thousands of American homes and businesses. Unfortunately, nuclear power is at a critical impasse, and many of these plants are facing early retirements, which means a loss of clean energy, good jobs, and our global leadership on vital issues like safety and nonproliferation. This legislation, the NUKE Act, makes commonsense reforms to increase transparency, predictability, and accountability at the NRC. Because nuclear plants pay to be regulated by the NRC, these reforms, including a predictable fee recovery structure, caps on annual fees, and keeping overhead costs in line with similar Federal agencies, will not only increase stability at our operating plants, but it will also pave the way for the next generation of nuclear technology. I also think it is important to point out that many times in the energy battle, we sometimes find out we needed to do something when it is too late and you spend a lot of time playing catch up. This is a proactive way to make sure we maintain this strong fleet of which America is a leader. In closing, I urge my colleagues to join me and Congressman DOYLE in supporting H.R. 1320, the NUKE Act, and help ensure a safe and strong future for American nuclear power. Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan initiative, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. OLSON. Madam Speaker, the ranking member of the full committee said it just perfectly: Support this bill. It is a good bipartisan bill. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. OLSON ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1320, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE REFORM ACT Mr. BARTON. Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 6511) to authorize the Secretary of Energy to carry out a program to lease underutilized Strategic Petroleum Reserve facilities, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 6511 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
Section 168 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6247a) is amended to read as follows: 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BARTON ) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. 
Mr. BARTON. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous materials in the RECORD on this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. BARTON. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, in 1995, President Ford signed a bill to ban the sale of crude oil overseas. Two years ago, we repealed that ban, and, last month, we were exporting some days 3 million barrels of oil per day. b1545 We have gone from a nation that was importing up to 80 percent of our oil to a nation that, today, if we absolutely had to, could be totally energy independent. Because of the Arab oil embargo in the early 1970s, a little before President Ford signed the bill that said you couldn’t export crude oil, we established a Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The idea was that we wanted to store oil in underground caverns—crude oil— so that, if there were another supply disruption, we would have the crude oil even if the OPEC cartel cut off oil shipments to the United States. We have authorized up to a billion barrels of crude oil in this reserve, and there is currently a little under 700 million barrels. But, Madam Speaker, we don’t need 700 million barrels of crude oil today because, as I have just pointed out, when we allowed crude oil to be exported, we unleashed a drilling boom in the United States that has driven our oil production on a daily basis from around 6 million barrels of oil per day to, this past month, 11 million barrels of oil per day. So, hence, the idea embodied in H.R. 6511, cosponsored by my good friend from Chicago, Democrat BOBBY RUSH. It is pretty straightforward. We have quite a bit of excess capacity right now in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. We have authorized the sale of about 300 million barrels between now and 2028. If that oil is actually sold, we will have almost half of the SPR without any crude oil in it. So why not set up a program and authorize the Department of Energy to put that vacant space up for bid? Oil producers all over the United States are scrambling for ways to store all the oil that we are producing while it is waiting to be refined or shipped overseas. This is not a mandatory program. We are not mandating that the private sector has to lease the space. What we are saying is, if the private sector wants to negotiate with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve managers, and it is a good deal for both sides, they can. We currently—now, this number may not be exactly right, Madam Speaker, but we spend about $200 million a year, I believe, to store the oil that we are storing in the reserve, that is owned by the taxpayers. If you have vacant space and you allow the private sector to use that vacant space and you charge whatever the market rate is for the private sector to put oil in the reserve for a short term, those funds will offset the cost of storing the governmentowned oil. They will also offset the cost of maintaining the reserve, and they will offset the cost of improving the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Again, this is not a mandatory program, so we believe that this bill, H.R. 6511, is a winwin. It helps the taxpayers because it might generate some revenue that could be used to offset the cost of maintaining the reserve as it exists. It might save the private sector some money if they decide to utilize it. And it might—and I would say, probably will—make our energy sector more efficient because the private sector, should they choose to participate in this program, doesn’t have to go out and build aboveground storage and maintain the aboveground storage. They can use the existing capacity that has already been hollowed out on the Gulf Coast of the United States that is very conveniently located adjacent to our refineries and/or to our export terminals; and that will, overall, lower costs of the whole system and end up being a win for the consumer both in the United States and overseas. So I would hope that, when the time comes later today, we will pass this unanimously. I want to thank, again, my original Democratic sponsor, Congressman RUSH of Chicago, Illinois. I want to thank the subcommittee chairman, FREDUPTON of Michigan; the full committee chairman, GREGWALDEN of Oregon; and the full committee ranking member, who is on the floor, Mr. PALLONE of New Jersey. We have all worked on a bipartisan basis to pass this, and we think that is why we have put it on the suspension calendar. As you know, Madam Speaker, suspension bills have to get a twothirds vote, and I am hoping that this bill gets a 100 percent vote. It is a good bill. It is a winwin. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6511, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Reform Act. This bill would set up a pilot program to facilitate the leasing of unused storage space in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, or SPR, while attempting to ensure that the government and taxpayers benefit from these leases. This is a worthy cause, and I commend Representatives BARTONand R USHfor their efforts. In recent years, Congress has turned to the SPR repeatedly as an offset for deficits, transportation funding, and other items. In fact, it has been used far more in recent years for those purposes than for energy security. And these SPR sales, which will occur over the next several years, will free up a great deal of physical space in the reserve. This bill puts that empty space to good use. The bill is part of our committee’s ongoing efforts to modernize the SPR. Going forward, we need to rethink its whole structure, including exploring the authorization of regional refined product reserves. Today, there are two regional supply reserves, both serving the Northeastern States: The Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve and the Northeast Gasoline Supply Reserve. The Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve was created by our committee in the Energy Act of 2000; and the Northeast Gasoline Supply Reserve was created by President Obama and Energy Secretary Moniz in the wake of Hurricane Sandy, using authorities provided to the Secretary in section 171 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. President Trump has proposed eliminating the Northeast Gasoline Supply Reserve, and I think that is a mistake. I remain committed to authorizing the existing gasoline reserve in statute, and I am convinced that regional reserves are a critical component of any SPR modernization effort. Madam Speaker, I believe other regions should benefit, or could benefit greatly, from having a refined product reserve. This is particularly true for the Southeast, which is extremely supply constrained. A Southeast regional reserve could provide relief and flexibility in the event of a natural disaster in the region itself or in the Gulf States that supply the Southeast region with refined product. Now, expanding the number of regional reserves is something that we must do in the future, but I believe this legislation is a good step forward on 
the road to SPR modernization, and so I do urge my colleagues to support this bill. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BARTON. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Madam Speaker, I have been in Congress for 34 years. I am about to retire at the end of this session. I have been on the House floor with many tumultuous battles. I have watched the fight over the Keystone pipeline, drilling in ANWR up in Alaska. My good friend, Senator MARKEY of Massachusetts, when he was in the House, would come to the floor with his chart, an oil well drilling into the Social Security trust fund. It is refreshing, Madam Speaker, to be on the floor today in the spirit of bipartisanship where we are all for something which I think really is good for the American people, good for the taxpayer, and good for the consumer. This is on suspension, so, obviously, we have to have a huge vote. I hope we get it. It looks like we will since we don’t have any other speakers. I would urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote, Madam Speaker. Let’s do something good for America. Let’s vote for this bill. Please vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 6511 when the vote is called. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6511, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Reform Act. This bill is another product of the Energy and Commerce Committee’s ongoing and bipartisan work to modernize the Department of Energy. The Committee’s DOE modernization efforts are focused on ensuring the Department can more ably address current and future domestic and international energy and security challenges. These challenges range from maintaining nuclear safety and security to protecting the reliable supply and delivery of energy, and they require a DOE that has the appropriate organization, management focus, and authorities to succeed. H.R. 6511 was developed by Vice Chairman BARTON and Ranking Member R USH to mod ernize the fortyyearold Strategic Petroleum Reserve, so it’s prepared to protect our Nation from energy disruptions in the decades ahead. H.R. 6511 authorizes DOE to lease underutilized storage capacity, which will become available in increasing amounts as DOE conducts mandated drawdowns over the next several years. Rather than have DOE maintain empty caverns at considerable taxpayer expense, H.R. 6511 will allow DOE to develop the spare capacity, attracting much needed capital investments for additional improvements. H.R. 6511 will preserve the SPR’s existing capacity, generate revenue for upgrades and maintenance, and improve the operational readiness of the entire SPR complex. H.R. 6511 is truly a winwin, and a perfect example of our bipartisan DOE modernization effort. I especially want to thank Mr. BARTON for his work on this bill. He has been at the forefront of so many defining moments relating to energy security. From his leadership as Chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee during passage of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, to his tireless efforts to repeal the ban on crude oil exports, his work on this bill contributes to the great legacy he leaves behind at the Energy and Commerce Committee— and in the United States Congress. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 6511. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BARTON) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6511, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
REAUTHORIZING WEST VALLEY DEMONSTRATION PROJECT Mr. MCKINLEY. Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2389) to reauthorize the West Valley demonstration project, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2389 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. MCKINLEY ) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from West Virginia. 
Mr. M CKINLEY. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous material in the RECORD on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from West Virginia? There was no objection. Mr. MCKINLEY. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, H.R. 2389 is a bill to reauthorize the West Valley demonstration project, which was introduced in May of 2017 by our New York colleague, TOMREED. The bipartisan legislation moved through the Energy and Commerce Committee by regular order, including legislative hearings and markups, as part of our broad nuclear waste management agenda. It was reported to the full committee, with a bipartisan amendment, by a voice vote. Let me thank the ranking member of the Subcommittee on the Environment, Mr. TONKO , for working closely with us on this legislation. H.R. 2389, as amended, authorizes appropriations to support the Department of Energy’s environmental remediation at its West Valley cleanup site in New York through 2025. It also directs a study to help Congress determine the final disposition of the radioactive waste that DOE is cleaning up at the site. H.R. 2389 also continues the work of this Congress to address the Federal Government’s obligation for treatment and disposal of the legacy waste produced during the Cold War and through the Federal Government’s early efforts to develop a civilian nuclear energy industry. The Department of Energy has successfully remediated 92 sites of this waste, but the most technologically challenging projects remain in place at 17 locations, one of which is the West Valley site. In 1980, Congress passed the West Valley demonstration project to direct DOE to address legacy environmental issues and authorized the appropriations, however, only through fiscal year 1981. The project has not been reauthorized since that time, despite Congress funding DOE’s work at the site for the past 37 years. H.R. 2389 corrects this situation and provides a path to answering important questions concerning waste disposition and ensures spending at the site is subject to an active authorization. I urge all Members to support this important legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2389, which reauthorizes the West Valley demonstration project. The Western New York Service Center in West Valley, New York, has a unique history. The site is owned by New York State, but from 1966 to 1972 it was operated by a private business to reprocess spent nuclear fuel primarily provided by the Federal Government. Those reprocessing activities ended 
decades ago, but highlevel and transuranic waste continued to be stored at the site. b1600 While a costsharing agreement between New York State and the Department of Energy has been resolved for the site’s remediation, the ultimate disposal of the waste remains a point of contention. There have been ongoing disputes and legislative actions spanning from the 1980s through today, with DOE and New York State continuing to disagree over who should be responsible for paying for waste disposal. This disagreement has major consequences for how the waste can be disposed of and who will be responsible for covering the disposal costs. H.R. 2389 would require a report by the Government Accountability Office, or GAO, to help clarify the origins of and disposal pathways for the waste, including cost estimates. The bill also reauthorizes the West Valley demonstration project at $75 million annually for 7 years, and this funding level is identical to the amount appropriated in fiscal year 2018 and will help ensure the cleanup continues on schedule. While this bill does not settle the decadesold dispute between New York and DOE, it takes positive steps towards the site’s remediation and attempts to move the ball forward to ensure that wastes are disposed of properly. Madam Speaker, I want to thank Representative TONKO , the ranking member of the committee’s Environment Subcommittee, for his work on this bill, and commend both him and the bill’s sponsor for their efforts. Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCKINLEY. Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. REED). Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the pending legislation before our body. Madam Speaker, I would like to take a moment to thank the gentleman from West Virginia as well as my colleagues on the other side of the aisle for their support and their articulation of the legislation and the need for this legislation. I would, in particular, like to thank my good colleague PAUL TONKO from New York, on the other side of the aisle, for working with us in a bipartisan way to get this legislation to reauthorize the West Valley Nuclear Site Reauthorization Act into law. Madam Speaker, this legislation will provide clarity, additional steps that we can take, and give clarity to our area of New York that is impacted by this nuclear waste site, the folks who are working there on a dayin, dayout basis. I have been to this site, Madam Speaker, multiple times. I have met with the managers of this site; I have met with the employees of this site; and they have worked tirelessly over the years to clean up this nuclear waste and this threat to our environment and to our communities, and I applaud their efforts. Madam Speaker, I can attest to, firsthand, seeing the fruits of the work that have been done over the years that they have tended to West Valley and the surrounding community in order to address the threat from nuclear waste that exists there. As we go forward, many years are still ahead of us in regard to the efforts to clean up that nuclear waste legacy that is located in our district in West Valley, New York. This legislation will give us clarity as to a future path that will be followed in order for us to continue the successful work there. Madam Speaker, I encourage all Members to join us in supporting this legislation that will do great work to make sure that our environment is protected and that the legacy obligations of us as a government are attended to for a local community that is dealing with this issue. Madam Speaker, to the Department of Energy and all the folks who work there, we say thank you. I would like to thank, in particular, not only the Energy and Commerce Committee members, their staffs, but also the folks in our local community, such as Town of Ashford Supervisor Charles Davis and the local citizens task force that spent hours, upon days, upon years attending to this issue in their unwavering support in standing with us as we move forward on this legislation. Madam Speaker, to West Valley Deputy General Manager Scott Anderson: Keep up the good work, and together we will clean up this site once and for all. Madam Speaker, I ask all my colleagues to support this legislation. Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I would just ask support from my colleagues to pass this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MCKINLEY. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. MCKINLEY ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2389, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
PATIENT RIGHT TO KNOW DRUG PRICES ACT Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 2554) to ensure that health insurance issuers and group health plans do not prohibit pharmacy providers from providing certain information to enrollees. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: S. 2554 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act’’. 
Subpart II of part A of title XXVII of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300gg–11 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following: 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous materials in the RECORD on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia? There was no objection. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, as the only pharmacist in Congress and a practicing pharmacist for over 30 years, this issue of an industry forcing the American people at the pharmacy counter hits incredibly close to home for me. Pharmacy benefit managers, also known as PBMs, have put forth restrictions that debase the drug supply chain in the United States. PBMs have existed for decades, but they have grown through mergers and acquisitions to be the middlemen for much drug coverage on formularies. The hope was that PBMs would reduce administrative burdens and be able to negotiate drug prices, yet here we are today voting on two bills to stop them from intentionally defrauding patients. It is unfortunate that we have even reached the point where there needs to be a law passed that prohibits this type of behavior. I appreciate that we are here today voting to sign these two Senate bills banning gag clauses into law; however, I think these bills could go further. My bill, the Prescription Transparency Act, which was introduced earlier this year, deemed any contract containing gag clauses null and void. Furthermore, it applied to every single insured patient. And it not only ensured that patients were notified of the lowest price, but also of any less expensive generic equivalents that might be available to the patient. My other piece of legislation, the Know the Cost Act, not only bans gag clauses in prescription drug plans for Medicare Advantage, Medicare part D, and individual and group insurance plans, but also informs beneficiaries about the consequences of paying out of pocket. My bill received letters of support from the American Medical Association, the American Psychiatric Association, the Global Healthy Living Foundation, the National Association of Chain Drug Stores, and Rite Aid, a clearly diverse group of stakeholders all hoping to lower the price of prescription drugs. States around the country have taken action to address gag clauses, with over 20 States having banned them and countless more considering it. While we have worked through these bills, we have seen the wideranging impact it has had. We have even heard in a committee hearing from colleagues like Congresswoman DINGELL , who was initially told that her prescription would be $1,300 but then talked to her pharmacist and got an equivalent for $40. I want to repeat that. We have even heard in a committee hearing from colleagues like Congresswoman DINGELL , who was initially told that her prescription would be $1,300 but then talked to her pharmacist and got an equivalent for $40. The discrepancy in costs should really be a wakeup call for how formularies are being impacted. Let’s get this legislation passed so we can take on the other issues in this space. While I am pleased that we are taking these important steps toward reining in PBMs and drug costs, I think there is still far more work ahead. Again, Madam Speaker, I want to thank you for including these bills on the legislative calendar for today. I sincerely hope that you take the resounding national support for banning gag clauses in consideration in the future and allow patients to regain control of their medical decisions back from multibilliondollar middlemen. Madam Speaker, I urge all Members to support this important legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act and the next bill we will be considering, the Know the Lowest Price Act. These two bills are the product of bipartisan efforts in the Energy 
and Commerce Committee to ban so called gag clauses, which prevent pharmacists from providing consumers information about cheaper prescription drug options. I did want to mention I see that my colleague, Mr. DOGGETT from Texas, is here, and the Senate bills being considered today are companion legislation to a House bill that Congressman DOGGETT introduced with 32 colleagues earlier this year. Specifically, gag clauses are contractual provisions that can limit pharmacists from informing consumers that their prescriptions may be purchased for a lower price if paid out of pocket instead of through their insurance plan. These bills increase consumer transparency and may help some consumers who get their insurance through the private market or through Medicare save money. Madam Speaker, I would like to thank, again, Congressman DOGGETT  and Mr. WELCH , also from our committee, for their longtime leadership on this issue. I see also that Mr. SARBANES is here, who has also been involved in this legislation in a major way. I am glad to see we are voting on these policies today. The Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act also includes an important provision that ensures biologic and biosimilar drug manufacturers are required to inform the Federal Trade Commission of potentially anticompetitive agreements that may delay lower cost drugs from entering the market in the same manner that brand and generic drug manufacturers do today. This notification will allow the FTC to challenge any ‘‘pay for delay’’ agreements in court. Madam Speaker, the language included in this bill is based on legislation introduced by Congressmen SARBANES and J OHNSON , and I thank them for their leadership on this important issue. Now, I must say, Madam Speaker, while I believe both bills are commonsense measures that we should all support, I also strongly believe that this cannot and should not be Congress’ only effort to reduce drug prices. When I am home—and we have been home a lot, as you know, over the last couple of months—one of the number one issues that people are concerned about is the high cost of prescription drugs. We need to address that. I personally believe we should be negotiating the prices of drugs under Medicare, but there are many other measures, including encouraging more generics, that could accomplish the goal of trying to reduce drug prices. These bills do nothing to address the biggest drivers of high drug costs in this country, namely, the high list prices set by drug companies for branded drugs. So we must address overall drug affordability, which these bills do not, but I continue to urge my colleagues to work together to find solutions that can actually lower drug prices in a meaningful way. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN ), the honorable chairman of the full Committee on Energy and Commerce. Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the two bills that will bring some muchneeded transparency into the drug supply chain process, and they will help patients afford the medicines that they really need. The Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act, sponsored by Senator SUSAN COLLINS , and the Know the Lowest Price Act of 2018, sponsored by Senator DEBBIE STABENOW , will, together, ban gag classes from Medicare and private insurance. These clauses restrict a pharmacist’s ability to inform a patient that their drug would be cheaper if they paid out of pocket than if they paid through their insurance. And while there is already a regulation banning this practice in Medicare part D, this legislation will end the practice across Medicare Advantage prescription drug plans, Medicare part D, and group and individual insurance plans. These two bills mirror legislation authored by Representative BUDDY CARTER, who is carrying this legislation for the majority on the floor today. He is a very valuable member of our House Energy and Commerce Committee. And, by the way, he is the only pharmacist in the Congress, so he understands this from a very personal perspective from behind the counter. He was joined in this effort by Representatives WELCH and C ATHY MCMORRIS RODGERS , A NNA ESHOO , M ORGAN  GRIFFITH , D EBBIE DINGELL , G ENE GREEN , and our chairman of the Subcommittee on Health, Dr. MICHAEL  BURGESS . I think all of us on the committee are very supportive of this effort. We, in fact, moved this bill, Madam Speaker, as you know, as an important part of our committee earlier this month, and it did pass unanimously. So I commend Mr. CARTER for his good work on this issue. I first heard about the gag clause issue from a pharmacist in Grants Pass, Oregon, named Michele. That is in my district. She is an independent pharmacist. We were talking about a lot of these issues, about how we get drug prices down for consumers, and she told me that as a pharmacist, she was prevented, precluded under certain insurance contracts, from telling a patient that their cash price would be cheaper than going through their insurance. Can you imagine such a thing in America? Michele told me that she once even received a cease and desist letter for trying to help a child with a terminal illness access his medication—simply unacceptable, period. b1615 Madam Speaker, I am glad we are taking concrete action today to address this important issue. And as we have heard already, these bills are coming over from the Senate. We had them in the House, marked them up in committee, and did our work. At the end of the day, I decided the important thing was not who had which bill. It was, how do we help consumers the quickest. Taking the Senate bills, getting them down to the President’s desk with the support of our colleagues who worked so hard in the House seemed like the best path. It is about putting consumers first. That is what we have done on the Energy and Commerce Committee, and I encourage our colleagues in the House to support this legislative effort. Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DOGGETT ). Mr. DOGGETT. Madam Speaker, unfortunately, there is just no wonder drug that will cure prescription price gouging. And with many prices for drugs rising at 10 times the rate of inflation, and with an unaffordable drug being 100 percent ineffective for the many that cannot afford it, many Americans are really desperate. In this Congress, we have another lost year of failing to address prescription price gouging. Now, on election eve, we take this miniscule step forward. A few of the many consumers who have been scrimping to get their medications, could at least find out if by paying cash, they can get a particular prescription at a lower price. No longer will gag provisions deny pharmacists the right to counsel about this issue. After learning about this problem about two years ago, I consulted with experts, with patient advocates, with pharmacists about these clauses, and asked the CMS, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to prevent this administratively, which they could have done, but they failed to do so. Finally, months ago this year, I filed two bills as companion legislation to the measures we are considering today by Senators COLLINS and S TABENOW , and was joined by 32 Members of the other house in supporting and sponsoring those measures. This Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act, the House version of it, was endorsed back in June by the National Community Pharmacists Association, thereafter, by the National Association of Chain Drug Stores, and by the American Psychiatric Association. Madam Speaker, I include in the RECORD their letters of support. 
NATIONAL COMMUNITY  PHARMACISTS ASSOCIATION , June 28, 2018. Re National Community Pharmacists Association (NCPA) Support of H.R. 6143 & 6144. Hon. LLOYD DOGGETT , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR REPRESENTATIVE DOGGETT : The Na tional Community Pharmacists Association (NCPA) is writing today in strong support of the Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act and the Know the Lowest Price Act of 2018, H.R. 6143 and 6144, two bills that would ban provisions in contracts between pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and pharmacies (so called ‘‘gag clauses’’) that prohibit pharmacists from being able to inform patients of cheaper alternatives for their medication. NCPA represents the interests of America’s community pharmacists, including the owners of more than 22,000 independent community pharmacies. Together, they represent an $80 billion health care marketplace and employ more than 250,000 individuals on a full or parttime basis. ‘‘Gag clauses’’ refer to contract provisions and/or requirements embedded in lengthy provider manuals that include overly broad confidentiality requirements, and nondisparagement clauses, as well as requirements that pharmacies charge insured patients what the PBM says at point of sale, leaving pharmacies with little to no ability to inform patients of actual drug costs. Such provisions have the effect of chilling a range of pharmacist communications with patients and others for fear of retaliation by the PBM. NCPA strongly supports passage of the Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act and the Know the Lowest Price Act of 2018 to help ensure that patients are not being charged inflated prices for their drugs. Thank you for your leadership in addressing this issue, and we look forward to working with you to advance these pieces of legislation. Sincerely, KARRY K. L AVIOLETTE , Senior Vice President of Government Affairs & Director of the Advocacy Center. 
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF  CHAIN DRUGSTORES , Arlington, VA, July 16, 2018. Hon. LLOYD DOGGETT , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR REPRESENTATIVE DOGGETT : The Na tional Association of Chain Drug Stores (NACDS) is pleased to support your legislation, the Know the Lowest Price Act of 2018 (H.R. 6144), to prohibit PDP sponsors, Medicare Advantage Organizations, and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMS) from restricting pharmacies from informing individuals regarding the prices for certain drugs and biologicals. NACDS believe gag clauses should not be allowed in contracts between health plans and pharmacies. Such clauses prevent pharmacists from informing patients when a medication can be purchased at a lower price without using insurance. The prohibition and/or removal of gag clauses in contracts between Part D plans, Medicare Advantage plans, PBMs, and pharmacies will enhance patient access to medications, enable pharmacists to have improved relationships with patients, and keep healthcare costs for patients to a minimum. Pharmacies are the face of neighborhood healthcare and are a highly trusted source of healthcare information, products, and services. Your legislation helps ensure that Medicare beneficiaries can continue to trust their local pharmacies for accurate and helpful information regarding their prescription drug costs. Again, we appreciate your leadership on this critically important healthcare issue. Sincerely, TOMO’DONNELL , Senior Vice President, Government Affairs and Public Policy. 
AUGUST 16, 2018. Hon. LLOYD DOGGETT , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARREPRESENTATIVE DOGGETT : On behalf of the American Psychiatric Association (APA), the national medical specialty association representing more than 37,800 psychiatric physicians, I write in support of your bill H.R. 6143, the Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act. H.R. 6143 seeks to enhance transparency in the pricing of prescription drugs by forbidding insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) from imposing ‘‘gag clauses’’ in their contracts with pharmacies. These clauses forbid pharmacies from disclosing to patients the difference between the amount of the drug’s copay under their insurance plan and the amount they would pay for the drug without using their insurance. As providers, we are deeply concerned about the barriers these clauses impose on a patient’s access to affordable medications. Federal preemption of these clauses is among the proposals included in President Trump’s blueprint to lower drug prices and reduce outofpocket costs for patients. As you know, the list prices for prescription drugs continue to rise. PBMs seek to lower those prices by negotiating discounts directly with drug manufacturers. However, the amount of these discounts may result in an insurance plan’s copay for a drug exceeding the actual cost of purchasing the drug outofpocket because the copay is typically calculated based on factors other than the actual price of the drug. Unfortunately, because the amount of these discounts is not publicly available, consumers do not know when their insurance plan copay is higher than the actual price of the drug and often assume that their copay represents only a portion of the best possible price of the drug. According to a recent study of 2013 drug pricing and payment data, consumers overpaid for their prescription drugs by $135 million. Almost a quarter (23%) of all prescriptions filled in 2013 involved a patient copayment that exceeded the average price of the drug by more than $2.00. Prescriptions for drugs commonly used to treat mental health disorders are prone to this overpayment phenomenon. The medications cited as having the highest frequency of overpaid prescriptions include drugs commonly used to treat insomnia, depression, and some side effects of psychiatric medications. Thank you for your ongoing commitment to finding bipartisan ways to enhance transparency in the prices consumers pay for their health care. Accordingly, we welcome an opportunity to aid your efforts to advance H.R. 6143, the Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act from the Energy & Commerce Committee. Sincerely, SAULLEVIN, MD, MPA, FRCP–E, CEO and Medical Director, American Psychiatric Association. 
Mr. DOGGETT. Madam Speaker, I am pleased that finally our House Republican colleagues have agreed to approve this proposal today. With families nationwide concerned about soaring drug prices, this legislation would end a restrictive, anticompetitive, and anticonsumer provision for those who rely on ObamaCare in the marketplace and for group employer ERISA plans. I must note, however, that of all the many bills I have either introduced or supported from other colleagues dealing with excessive medication costs, this is the most narrow of the proposals out of all of them. Instead of really saving lives, some may view this as simply a life preserver for those who have ignored prescription price gouging for the past two years. Approving this modest, narrow bill is not a substitute for tackling the pervasive problem of prescription price gouging. Pharmacists are not the only ones who are, apparently, gagged. Right here in this Congress, some seem to be unable to find their voice and vote for real reform that would lower drug prices when we are outnumbered by two pharmaceutical lobbyists for every Member of this House of Representatives. Repeated attempts to pass measures that would lower prices have been blocked. Republicans even blocked my amendment to the opioid legislation to authorize the Trump administration to negotiate the price of naloxone, the lifesaving opioid overdose reversal drug whose prices soared by 700 percent. During the past week, Big Pharma, with considerable help from the Republican majority leader, sought to hitch a ride on this very same opioid legislation to get an unrelated $4 billion gift. It is enough to make you gag. Hopefully, we have got that stopped. Passage of this bill today is one modest step that we can take, but so much more is needed. That this bill even counts as progress, demonstrates how far we have to go. And while this bill brings some transparency to the pharmacy counter, the transparency which is most needed is comprehensive legislation like the Transparency Drug Pricing Act that I have introduced, to shed some light on where the prices get set. And that is by the manufacturer who hides the whole process through discounts, rebates, and fees. Now, we all know that President Trump solved the problem with his Rose Garden press conference early in the summer when he announced that prices are going down. But I have yet to find anybody who has benefited from that announcement. And, in fact, the Associated Press just analyzed drug prices since that announcement and they couldn’t find any company that had made any significant reduction on prices. And when questioning the executives of 24 large drug companies, the AP didn’t find a single one committed to cutting prices. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas. Mr. DOGGETT. Madam Speaker, the attitude was best captured by one pharmaceutical executive who within 
the last month said that he had a, ‘‘moral requirement . . . to sell the product for the highest price.’’ Today’s two minor prescription drugs bills are being passed in this process that is called ‘‘suspension.’’ But let’s not create any further suspense for families that are in need on their healthcare costs. Let’s approve real, comprehensive prescription drug pricing reform in a new Congress that is not indifferent to the needs of American healthcare consumers. Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. SARBANES ). Mr. SARBANES. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act, an important bill that will ensure consumers can get the lowest price for their drugs. This bill is also aligned with the bipartisan Biosimilars Competition Act, a bill that I introduced that will shine a light on secret agreements called payfordelay deals. Payfordelay deals are great deals for the drug companies, but they are bad deals for consumers. Payfordelay refers to a practice where brandname drug or biologic manufacturers make agreements with competing manufacturers to keep their lowercost drugs off the market in exchange for a settlement. Brandname drugs often have exorbitant costs compared to their generic counterparts. Although they make up approximately—listen to the statistics—although they make up approximately 10 percent of all drugs dispensed in America, brandname drugs make up 72 percent of U.S. drug spending. A 2013 FTC report estimates that these payfordelay agreements cost consumers $3.5 billion each year. FTC currently has the authority— and this is good—to review agreements like these between conventional drug manufacturers. But this authority does not extend to the manufacturers of biologic and biosimilar drugs, which are new, cuttingedge drugs that are often extremely expensive. This means that right now, we have no way of knowing how many of these backroom deals occur between manufacturers of biologic and biosimilar drugs. That is why I introduced the Biosimilars Competition Act, a bipartisan bill, which would combat these agreements that keep drug prices high and have the effect of harming patients. These provisions would require manufacturers of biologics and biosimilar drugs to report payfordelay agreements and file them with the FTC and the Department of Justice for review of antitrust and anticompetitive behavior. Granting the FTC the authority to monitor these deals and punish bad actors, will deter many of these backroom deals from being made in the first place, and will help crack down on unfair deals that give millions of dollars to big pharmaceutical companies, while forcing American consumers to pay more for lifesaving drugs. Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support these new requirements because they are good for consumers. They will increase transparency in drug pricing, and add more competition to the drug market, both of which will help lower drug costs at the pharmacy. Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I yield myself the balance of my time. Madam Speaker, let me just say these are commonsense initiatives that help address the drug pricing issue. As I have said before, we still need to do a lot more, and we haven’t this Congress. But I do agree that these bills will be helpful in that regard. Madam Speaker, I urge support for this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Madam Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, and I want to assure them that this is only the beginning of what we intend to do and what I intend to do to help to lower prescription drug prices here in America. Madam Speaker, I want to thank also my colleagues on this side of the aisle for all of their help. I ask for support of this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 2554. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
KNOW THE LOWEST PRICE ACT OF 2018 Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 2553) to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to prohibit health plans and pharmacy benefit managers from restricting pharmacies from informing individuals regarding the prices for certain drugs and biologicals. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 2553 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Know the Lowest Price Act of 2018’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS ) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous materials into the RECORD  on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2553, the Know the Lowest Price Act of 2018. This bill would prohibit health plans and pharmacy benefit managers under Medicare or Medicare Advantage from restricting pharmacies from informing individuals about prices for certain drugs and biologics at the pharmacy counter, a practice commonly referred to as a gag clause. These clauses prohibit pharmacists from informing patients that paying in cash will result in lower outofpocket costs than the insurer’s costsharing arrangement unless the patient directly asks. This is a policy that the Energy and Commerce Committee has pursued in H.R. 6733, the Know the Cost Act of 2018. We held a legislative hearing and a markup in the Health Subcommittee before ultimately passing the bill out of the full committee. Once again, I want to commend Representative BUDDY CARTER for championing this policy. His bill would have banned gag clauses in group and commercial health insurance plans, as well as for prescription drug plan sponsors for Medicare part D, or Medicare Advantage plans. As an original cosponsor of H.R. 6733, I believe these bills banning gag clauses are essential in both lowering drug costs for individuals and freeing pharmacists to do what many consider to be the right thing. I am surprised Congress has not acted sooner to ban health insurance plans from using gag clauses. I am glad to see these bills on the House floor today. This will allow pharmacists to 
look out for their patients’ pocketbooks and help them get their medications at the lowest possible price. This bipartisan policy has been a shared priority for many Members on the Energy and Commerce Committee. Our Senate counterparts had a shared interest in this sound and reasonable policy, and recently advanced it out of their Chamber. The issue of gag clauses was further brought up to the forefront by the Trump administration’s drug pricing blueprint which was released this May. The President proposed eliminating gag clauses as a solution in his plan to address rising drug prices. b1630 I, too, believe that allowing pharmacists to disclose the costsaving potential of paying outofpocket to patients at the point of sale is an important piece of the drug pricing puzzle. While gag clauses are already prohibited in Medicare through regulation, it makes sense that we protect our seniors by putting this language in statute and sending S. 2553 to the President’s desk. This legislation should serve as an example of how the House and the Senate can work together to accomplish a goal to swiftly pass and send to the President for his signature. There have been news stories across the country from the New York Times—two investigations in my market—and CBS 11 in the DallasFort Worth area about how consumers can save money at the pharmacy counter by getting around gag clauses and directly asking their pharmacist: Is this cheaper for me to pay cash and not use my insurance? Kelly Selby, a community pharmacist and pharmacy owner in north Texas, has told me about the problems that gag clauses cause at his own pharmacy. He says that a gag clause has a chilling effect as a pharmacy owner and a pharmacist, and that the pharmacy benefit managers will call you after you break a gag clause and threaten you with canceling their contract. Even if pharmacists have what is in the best interest to their customers at heart, Mr. Selby told me that, overnight, he could lose 40 percent of his business, taken away by the power of pharmacy benefit managers. It is unfair for pharmacists across our country like Kelly to have to choose between hiding useful cost information from their patients and losing their other contacts. Eliminating gag clauses is an integral part of driving down healthcare costs and prescription drug prices, an issue that hits home with each and every one of our constituents. It may not solve the entire drug pricing dilemma, but it is an essential piece. When this bill becomes law, it will make a real difference in the lives of patients across the country. Mr. Speaker, I support S. 2553, and I urge fellow Members to support this legislation. Let’s send it to the President’s desk for his signature. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I already spoke in support of both this bill, S. 2553, and the previous one, S. 2554, so, at this time, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DOGGETT ). Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I continue to hear from neighbors in my part of Texas and beyond who are unable to afford their prescription drugs, lifesaving drugs. They are cutting back on necessities, cutting pills in half, or cutting into what little savings they may have. After seeking administrative action to address this gag order problem with no success, I introduced with Senators STABENOW and C OLLINS here in the House, along with 32 colleagues, a House bill to do what their measures do today. Despite repeated requests, the House Ways and Means Committee, which enjoys jurisdiction over this matter as a Medicare bill, along with the Commerce Committee, declined to consider them. This particular bill that we are considering now will allow those Medicare beneficiaries, seniors and individuals with disabilities, to turn to a professional pharmacist to learn if there is information available that, on a particular drug, they might be able to get a less expensive alternative by paying cash. While pleased that this modest Know the Lowest Price bill will become law, we have had too much aiming low and shooting low in this Congress that has really been indifferent to the overall plight of seniors burdened with exorbitant prescription drug costs. What a low bar that has been set. Patients want real change on this matter. Yet, we do the least possible to address this problem. We take baby steps when bold steps are required. To borrow from Mark Twain, I believe seniors can recognize the difference between lightning and a lightning bug, like we are getting today. While this may enable some to learn the lowest available price, I believe what we need to find out about is the highest price that is being extorted in too many cases. The sky seems to be the limit. Whatever can be obtained from someone who is sick or dying seems to be the price point. We may be able to cure some cancers and diseases—we want to encourage a price that will encourage continued innovation—but it need not come at the levels that are being charged too many people today only because this Congress is unwilling to curb the government monopoly that it has granted. Pharmaceutical pricing is a tangled knot. There is no one panacea. Every step forward is a good step forward. I formed a House Prescription Drug Task Force three years ago to begin to look at administrative and legislative steps in how we encourage innovation without being exploited by monopoly prices. I think there is much more we can do, much more for someone like Bob from San Antonio, who has suffered from crippling arthritis for decades. He has seen the prescription that he relies on skyrocket from about $200 a year to $22,000 in copayments annually. He finally had to switch to a less expensive drug and lives with the fear that it will not adequately cover his pain, even though it has become too painful to afford it. Patients like Bob need much more than modest bills. We need a Congress that does not repeatedly cave in to the Big Pharma lobbyists. What is happening this week, this very week, is yet another reminder of the choice that has been made between a special interest and the needs of seniors. With the active assistance of the Majority Leader, Big Pharma tried to exploit bipartisan opioid legislation and further burden patients with a provision undoing what had been a bipartisan agreement that helped plug the socalled donut hole and lowered patients’ outofpocket drug spending in Medicare. Pharma’s plan would save them $4 billion, but the costs would have been shifted either to our seniors and individuals with disabilities directly or through the premiums that they pay. Unable to defend this heist on its merits of flawed and misleading advertisements, and a hoard of lobbyists who have been here to try to get that $4 billion, I hope that we have it stopped. Hopefully, in fact—speak of hope—in a new Congress, we can see some action on what really might make a difference, and that is the ability of Medicare to negotiate for our seniors to get lower prices in much the same way the Veterans Administration does for our veterans. I have introduced, along with almost 90 sponsors, the Medicare Negotiation and Competitive Licensing Act to harness the purchasing power of the government through the Health and Human Services Secretary. If negotiations fail, the Secretary would use good old American competition to lower them, bringing in generics, bidding, and competition, a real American way to solve what is a serious American problem. Patients should not have to fight their insurer or a drug company when they need to be fighting their disease. Patients need this Congress to reclaim its voice and to not be gagged any longer. It can no longer let Big Pharma and its agenda define the debate. Instead, we need to end Big Pharma’s exploitation of patients in order to get windfall profits. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER ). 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I want to mark this as an important day for this Congress taking real steps to lower the cost of drugs for Americans. I am proud to have been the lead sponsor for H.R. 6733, the Know the Cost Act of 2018, a bill that includes the core elements of this bill and expands patient protections. Currently, pharmacists are prevented from telling their patients about a lower cost outofpocket option rather than utilizing insurance coverage. These gag clause provisions are included in provider manuals and contracts that require broad confidentiality agreements for pharmacists. Often, these contracts offered by the pharmacy benefit manager, the PBM, are a takeitorleaveit situation where the pharmacist doesn’t have any other options. If they opt not to take the contract, they are often left out of servicing large segments of the patient market. Gag clauses can come in many forms, such as confidentiality agreements between pharmacists and plan sponsors, nondisparagement clauses, and even prohibitions on contacting sponsors, the media, and elected officials. As a result, pharmacists cannot have a transparent relationship with their patients or provide them necessary information that could help guide their best treatment options. Senator STABENOW ’s bill, the Know the Lowest Price Act of 2018, bans these types of gag clauses in Medicare Advantage drug plans. Although this bill does not contain requirements for beneficiary notification that my bill, the Know the Cost Act of 2018, included, it is still an important step forward. Banning gag clauses has received national support from State legislatures, both Chambers of Congress, HHS, and the President. As the only pharmacist currently serving in Congress, I know all too well about the constraints placed on pharmacists as part of the takeitorleave it contracts, where the pharmacist has no other option if they want to continue providing care for their patients in their community. Mr. Speaker, I thank all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their help in bringing this legislation forward. I particularly thank Chairman BURGESS . Also, a shoutout to our staff, who has done an outstanding job of bringing this all together. Mr. Speaker, I ask all my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I support these two bills, this one and the previous one. I do think that they are good, bipartisan measures. But I do want to repeat what Mr. DOGGETT said, that this Congress and the next have to do a lot more to deal with the issue of prescription drug prices. Probably the most effective thing, which I support, is negotiated prices under Medicare, as well as trying to do more with generic drugs. Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remainder of my time. Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this important legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2553, the ‘‘Know the Lowest Price Act of 2018.’’ S. 2553 amends title XVIII of the Social Security Act to prohibit health plans and pharmacy benefit managers from restricting pharmacies from informing individuals regarding the prices for certain drugs and biologicals. A Prescription Drug Plan (PDP) sponsor and a Medicare Advantage (MA) organization shall ensure that each prescription drug plan or Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug (MA–PD) plan offered by the sponsor or organization does not restrict a pharmacy that dispenses a prescription drug or biological from informing, nor penalize such pharmacy for informing, an enrollee in such plan of any differential between the negotiated price of, or copayment or coinsurance for, the drug or biological to the enrollee under the plan and a lower price the individual would pay for the drug or biological if the enrollee obtained the drug without using any health insurance coverage. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) calculated that if generic substitution worked programwide, then Part D could potentially save $5.9 billion a year. Using generic drugs instead of their brand name equivalents could have saved the Medicare Part D program approximately $3 billion in 2016 alone. In 2016, beneficiaries paid $1.1 billion in outofpocket costs of brandname drugs, which was almost twice as much as outof pocket costs for generics. The high cost of prescriptions hits older Americans on fixed incomes particularly hard, especially for medications designed to treat serious or chronic conditions where the patient’s costshare can be expensive. This bill prohibits these outrageous contract arrangements between Medicare private plans, PBMs and pharmacies and help seniors save money when they pick up their prescriptions. Seniors should not have to choose between paying their bills and taking their medication. We should make it our mission to put medicine within reach of patients. I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of S. 2553. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. RUTHERFORD ). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 2553. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. RESPONSIBLE DISPOSAL REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2018 Mr. MCKINLEY. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2278) to extend the authorization of the Uranium Mill Tailing Radiation Control Act of 1978 relating to the disposal site in Mesa County, Colorado, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2278 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Responsible Disposal Reauthorization Act of 2018’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. MCKINLEY ) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from West Virginia. 
Mr. M CKINLEY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous material into the RECORD on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from West Virginia? There was no objection. Mr. MCKINLEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2278 was introduced by my Colorado colleague, SCOTT TIPTON , and cosponsored by my Energy and Commerce colleague from Colorado, DIANA DEGETTE . H.R. 2278 extends the authorization of the Uranium Mill Tailing Radiation Control Act of 1978 as it relates to the disposal site in Mesa County, Colorado. The legislation was considered by the Subcommittee on Environment and marked up through regular order. It was reported by the full committee with a bipartisan amendment and passed on a voice vote. Mining and processing uranium generates a byproduct known as uranium mill tailings. Congress passed the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act 40 years ago to establish the framework for DOE to dispose of mill tailings, which are left over from the nuclear defense activities and the development of our nuclear commercial industry. The act also authorizes the Grand Junction, Colorado, site to serve as a disposal location. b1645 This is the only DOE uranium mill tailing disposal site remaining open in the Nation, and so it is necessary for the final disposition of mill tailings discovered throughout this country. 
H.R. 2278 extends the site’s current authorization until 2030. The extension will enable the site to plan longterm operations to protect the public health and the environment. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this important legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2278, the Responsible Disposal Reauthorization Act of 2018. H.R. 2278 is bipartisan legislation to address the safe disposal of uranium mill tailings, a sandy byproduct of the uranium milling process. In Grand Junction, Colorado, uranium mill tailings were offered to the community as fill material before the health risks of the radioactive material were fully understood. The tailings were subsequently used in the construction of local homes, roads, sidewalks, parks, and schools. The Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act provided for the cleanup of those tailings in 1978 and created 19 disposal cells for the radioactive waste. The last of the cells available to accept this material for disposal, the Cheney cell in Grand Junction, Colorado, is set to close in September 2023. This bill extends the cell’s closure date to September 2030 or until the cell is filled, whichever day comes first. Mr. Speaker, Congress has already extended the closure date of the disposal cell several times. I support this legislation to keep the site operational, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCKINLEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. TIPTON ), who is the sponsor of the bill. Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague from West Virginia for the time. The Department of Energy’s Cheney disposal cell in Mesa, Colorado, is a critical component of DOE legacy management’s mission to be able to protect public health and the environment. The cell receives radioactive waste materials that were produced decades ago during the uranium milling process. The waste materials continue to be uncovered during road construction, bridge replacement, home foundation excavation, and other construction activities in several towns in western Colorado. Once the waste materials are discovered, they must be properly disposed of at the Cheney cell. The authorization for the Cheney disposal cell expires at the end of 2023 or when the site is filled to capacity. Currently, the remaining capacity in the cell is approximately 234,000 cubic yards, and, therefore, an extended authorization is required. H.R. 2278 would extend that authorization until 2030. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment supports extending the reauthorization for the Cheney cell and will remain a strong partner in DOE’s legacy management program. I would like to thank my colleague from Colorado, Ms. DIANA DEGETTE , for her support on this legislation. I would also like to thank the Energy and Commerce Environment Subcommittee chairman, JOHNSHIMKUS , and Ranking Member PAUL Tonko, as well as the full committee chairman, GREG WALDEN, and Ranking Member P ALLONE for recognizing the importance of the Cheney disposal cell and working to bring this bill to the floor. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MCKINLEY. Mr. Speaker, in closing, again, this is the last remaining disposal site that we need to keep open. I appreciate the support, and I applaud the work of my colleague from Colorado (Mr. TIPTON ) for his efforts and DIANA DEGETTE and the bipartisan nature of that cooperation between the two of them to get this done. Mr. Speaker, I call upon the Members to support this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. MCKINLEY ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2278, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ‘‘A bill to extend the authorization of the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act of 1978 relating to the disposal site in Mesa County, Colorado.’’. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
SMALL BUSINESS ACCESS TO CAPITAL AND EFFICIENCY ACT Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 6348) to adjust the real estate appraisal thresholds under the section 504 program to bring them into line with the thresholds used by the Federal banking regulators, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 6348 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Small Business Access to Capital and Efficiency Act’’ or the ‘‘Small Business ACE Act’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT ) and the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio. 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Ohio? There was no objection. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the House Small Business Committee strives to create an environment where small businesses can thrive and create jobs. Unfortunately, small businesses are often hampered by conflicting Federal rules and regulations. This is the case when it comes to the appraisal threshold for commercial real estate. Earlier this year, Federal financial regulators, including the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, increased the commercial real estate appraisal threshold from $250,000 to $500,000. Unfortunately, the Small Business Administration’s threshold for the real estateheavy 504/CDC loan program is set in statute at $250,000. The conflicting numbers produce confusion for and burdens on small business owners and the organizations that strive to assist them. H.R. 6348, the Small Business Access to Capital and Efficiency Act, also known as the Small Business ACE Act, modernizes and benchmarks the SBA’s 504/CDC threshold value with the value set by the Federal financial regulators. This commonsense legislation will prevent future threshold changes from hampering small businesses that utilize SBA’s many lending products. I want to thank Mr. CURTIS of Utah for leading the efforts on this bill, as well as Ranking Member VELA´ZQUEZ  
and Mr. E VANS . It has broad bipartisan support. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 6348, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6348, the Small Business ACE Act. This important legislation updates SBA’s outdated real estate appraisal threshold for the 504 loan program. It is vital for our country’s small businesses that we keep current laws in sync with what is going on in the commercial market. More importantly, this commonsense fix ensures as many small business borrowers as possible can affordably access the capital they need to grow their businesses and create jobs. Finally, I would like to take a moment to recognize the chairman for his continued willingness to work across the aisle. He and his staff have set a bipartisan tone that I think all of us on this committee can be proud of. As a result, we are carrying out our responsibilities in a timely manner with input from both Republican and Democratic Members. Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this piece of legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman for her indications that we work very much in a bipartisan manner in our committee. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. CURTIS ), whom I thank for his leadership in this effort. Mr. CURTIS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the chairman and ranking member for supporting the Small Business Access to Capital and Efficiency Act, or Small Business ACE Act. I am also grateful to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. EVANS ) for joining as a cosponsor and for my colleagues on the Small Business Committee for advancing this bipartisan legislation. Mr. Speaker, the Small Business ACE Act is critical to reducing burdensome red tape and regulations that fall so disproportionately on small business. Small businesses are the lifeblood of our economy across the country and certainly in my home State of Utah where they make up over 99 percent of all Utah businesses and contribute two thirds of all job growth. Without a doubt, the strength of our economy depends on these small businesses. Although the economy continues to improve, small businesses and entrepreneurs often face challenges accessing capital. To assist creditworthy innovators, the Small Business Administration offers numerous lending programs, including the 504 loan program. Without using a single taxpayer dollar, the program has helped many well known businesses throughout the United States and Utah. In the past 20 years, the 504 program has supported over 4,500 entrepreneurs and nearly 64,000 jobs in Utah alone. However, despite the program’s positive status, Federal red tape and conflicting regulations have hampered its development, weighing it down with roadblocks and uncertainty. As a result, many small businesses still have difficulty accessing capital. The Small Business ACE Act will help fix this by eliminating Federal regulations burdening the program and harmonizing conflicting real estate appraisal thresholds that have prevented eligible small businesses from accessing capital. I am pleased that my bill has broad support from important stakeholders, like the National Association of Development Companies, Mountain West Small Business Finance, and Utah Certified Development Company, that know better than anyone just how essential the 504 small business lending program is and how critical it is that we improve it. By reducing burdens on small businesses, we help ensure not only their individual success, but the success for our Nation’s economy. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to put forth this commonsense legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support it. Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. EVANS ), who is the ranking member on the Subcommittee of Economic Growth, Tax and Capital Access. Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the chairman and the ranking member for their bipartisan leadership. I am pleased to join with my colleague, Congressman JOHNCURTIS from Utah, in putting forth this important piece of legislation. I am pleased to join as the cosponsor of Congressman CURTIS on H.R. 6348, the Small Business Access to Capital and Efficiency Act, which adjusts the real estate appraisal threshold under the section 504 program to bring them into line with thresholds used by the Federal banking regulator. This bill also passed out of the Small Business Committee in July. The city of Philadelphia has a robust real estate industry which employs appraisers, lenders, construction workers, bankers, and numerous others. The point is the industry is responsible for jobs, jobs, and more jobs. Currently, the Small Business Act mandates this. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this particular bill. This is very important to our country. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. EVANS ) for his leadership on this. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, in closing, with this legislation, we are only responding to the reality of the situation in the commercial lending market. This is a commonsense fix with bipartisan support that will ensure small businesses are not unfairly burdened with appraisal requirements. Doing so allows small firms to allocate their working capital as wisely and efficiently as possible. Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to close. Mr. Speaker, to conclude, the SBA’s 504/CDC loan program is vital to many creditworthy small businesses that cannot obtain credit elsewhere. To reduce confusion from conflicting Federal rules, H.R. 6348 will update and bring SBA’s commercial real estate threshold to the same level as other Federal financial regulators. b1700 We must continue to work together to free small business owners from conflicting Federal regulations. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan reform instituted in H.R. 6348. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6348. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
H.R. 6347 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT ) and the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio. 
SMALL BUSINESS ADVOCACY IMPROVEMENTS ACT OF 2018 Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 6316) to clarify the primary functions and duties of the Office of Advocacy of the Small Business Administration, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 6316 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Small Business Advocacy Improvements Act of 2018’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT ) and the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio. 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Ohio? There was no objection. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in support of H.R. 6316, the Small Business Advocacy Improvements Act of 2018, which clarifies the role of the Office of Advocacy of the United States Small Business Administration. The Office of Advocacy is charged with representing small businesses before Federal agencies whose policies and activities may affect small businesses. It also examines the role of small business in the American economy and the contributions small businesses can make in improving competition. This office plays a vital role in ensuring that small businesses are heard when the Federal Government makes policy decisions that will impact them. Currently, the law is silent regarding the Office of Advocacy’s ability to study the role of small business in international economies, which is an important avenue for small businesses as they seek opportunities to expand overseas. This bill would clarify that the Office of Advocacy should include international economies as part of its research functions. The law is also silent regarding the Office of Advocacy’s authority to represent small businesses before foreign governments and international entities. It is important for small businesses to have their views and interests on regulatory and trade initiatives represented in the international space. This bill clarifies the Office of Advocacy’s ability to represent small business views and interests before foreign governments and other international entities for the purpose of contributing to regulatory and trade initiatives. I want to thank Mr. COMER and Ms. ADAMS for working on this issue and producing a simple solution to clarify the Office of Advocacy’s role. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this straightforward legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6316, the Small Business Advocacy Improvements Act. There are nearly 30 million small businesses in the United States, representing more than 99 percent of all businesses. These small firms employ nearly 50 percent of all private sector employees in the U.S. The SBA’s Office of Advocacy represents an important tool for these businesses because it is their voice that the office embodies in all matters of government. Clarifying the authority of advocacy to examine international economic data and represent small business interests in international discussions, particularly in trade negotiations, raises the ability of small American firms to participate in a global market. Mr. Speaker, that is why I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes,’’ and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. COMER ), and I thank him for his leadership on this bill. Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6316, the Small Business Advocacy Improvements Act of 2018. I am proud to be the sponsor of this bipartisan legislation. The Office of Advocacy at the United States Small Business Administration plays a vital role in ensuring Federal agencies take into account how their policies impact small businesses. While the Office of Advocacy has done excellent work on behalf of our Nation’s small businesses, the current law is silent on whether it can research and advocate on behalf of small business on international matters. This is a problem that we can easily fix. Given the Office of Advocacy’s knowledge and research on how regulations impact small businesses, it is appropriate for the office to advocate and research small business interests on international matters. This bill advances the Office of Advocacy’s mission to advocate for America’s small businesses and clarifies its authority on international small business issues. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important bipartisan bill. Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. There is no question that we need to support our small businesses across the country, no matter their location or industry, when they are attempting to break into international commerce. Today’s bill leverages the unique position and knowledge of the SBA’s Office of Advocacy to amplify the voice of small firms in international settings. I commend Congressman COMER and Congresswoman ADAMS in taking the important step to break down international barriers for small entrepreneurs entering into the world of trade. Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I would like to, again, thank Mr. COMER and Ms. A DAMS for their leadership on this measure. The Office of Advocacy is a critical Federal agency charged with representing America’s 30 million small firms across the Federal Government. They have done outstanding work on behalf of our Nation’s small businesses. But as we have discussed, current law is silent on whether it can research and advocate on behalf of small business on international matters. This bipartisan legislation offers a simple solution to allow the Office of Advocacy to expand their role in international matters. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. b1715 The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6316. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
SMALL BUSINESS RUNWAY EXTENSION ACT OF 2018 Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 6330) to amend the Small Business Act to modify the method for prescribing size standards for business concerns. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 6330 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Small Business Runway Extension Act of 2018’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT ) and the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio. 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Ohio? There was no objection. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. K NIGHT and Ms. CLARKE for this leading bipartisan legislation, which takes a critical step toward addressing the challenge that small contractors face when entering the middle market. The primary objective of the SBA’s small business programs is to encourage the growth and vibrancy of the Federal supplier base, boost competition, protect against supplier consolidation, and spur innovation. These noble goals are thwarted when small businesses find themselves competing in the open market prematurely before they have the tools they need to succeed. Given the increasing size of Federal contract awards made today, one or two big awards won by a small contractor could easily force them out of the category of small business. Since many do not have the infrastructure or competitiveness to go head to head against firms many times their size, they often fail or become consumed into a larger competitor’s supply chain. These results contravene the mission and purpose of the small business programs, further widening the divide between large and small contractors. Competitiveness takes time, hard work, and significant resources to build. However, difficult as it is to build competitiveness, it is just as easily lost. H.R. 6330 provides a solution to this problem, allowing small businesses extra time to potentially retain their ‘‘small’’ size status while they continue to develop their competitive edge. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6330, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6330, the Small Business Runway Extension Act of 2018. Over the years, Congress has created numerous Federal programs, setasides, tax preferences, and SBA loan programs to help small businesses succeed. However, the advantages conferred by this program have led to heated debate over who is truly a small business and what an acceptable small business size standard is. The answer is an important one, as it can be underinclusive, thereby pushing a firm outside the standard, or it can be overinclusive, allowing large firms to compete in these programs. The end result is the same: small firms deprived of Federal contracting opportunities. This bill addresses the pressure placed on those businesses not able to compete against large entities from being prematurely placed outside their size standard by providing a more inclusive review of 5 years of their gross receipts. Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this very important legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from California (Mr. K NIGHT ) and thank him for his leadership in this important measure. Mr. KNIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I thank my chairman for his support on this and many other issues that we see in our Small Business Committee. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6330, the Small Business Runway Extension Act of 2018. This bill is simple. It is commonsense. It is a measure designed to promote the sustainability, growth, and development of small Federal contractors into the open marketplace. Under existing law, the Small Business Administration calculates the size of a company by taking the average of the past 3 years of gross receipts. A company’s average must be within established industry parameters set by the SBA in order to be considered a small business and be eligible to receive access to SBA’s small business programs, resources, and assistance. My bill is very simple. It extends that time period out to 5 years. This additional time allows all small businesses an opportunity to mature before graduating out of the SBA’s small business programs. Over the course of this Congress, we have conducted hearings, held roundtables, and heard stories of the overwhelming midmarket challenges forcing many successful small contractors to close their doors or stall their growth. Prospects for a newly graduated firm successfully integrating into the open marketplace are rapidly declining due to the widening gap between small and large contractors. Small firms are opting out—either voluntarily or, in many cases, involuntarily—from joining the Federal marketplace because of this rift. This outcome depletes our industrial base, reduces competition, and inhibits economic growth. Mr. Speaker, do we really want our small businesses to look at their ability to expand and their ability to be a larger and more prosperous business and say: I can’t do this because I am going to move out of the SBA, so what I should do is maybe close my doors or just restrict our growth. That is not what America is all about. That is not what we want out of our small businesses. We want them to expand. We want them to bring new and innovative things to the marketplace. And we want them to expand and have jobs for our kids and for the next generation. Mr. Speaker, I think that this is a reasonable look at what we are trying to do, and I urge support of H.R. 6330. Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to close. Mr. Speaker, this legislation gives small businesses more time to adjust to not being a small business anymore. We want our small businesses to thrive and grow and break through to the midtier and big business strata. Oftentimes, that is difficult. H.R. 6330 gives these firms just a little more time to adapt to their new business environment, so they can compete more efficiently and continue to grow and create more jobs for more Americans. I again thank Mr. KNIGHT for his leadership on this. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan piece of legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6330. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
INCENTIVIZING FAIRNESS IN SUBCONTRACTING ACT Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 6367) to amend the Small Business Act to specify what credit is given for certain subcontractors and to provide a dispute process for nonpayment to subcontractors, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 6367 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Incentivizing Fairness in Subcontracting Act’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT ) and the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio. 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Ohio? There was no objection. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, before we begin discussion of this legislation, I would like to thank Mr. LAWSON from Florida and Mr. KELLY from Mississippi for their leadership in addressing an issue that is a cause of great concern for small subcontractors; namely, prime contractor compliance with their subcontracting plans. Large prime contractors have a statutory obligation to develop and submit a subcontracting plan as part of their bid and proposal package. In this plan, prime contractors are required to outline their intention to award a certain percentage of subcontracting dollars to small businesses. Unfortunately, it has been a challenge to ensure that prime contractors are held accountable to these plans. Recently, the Department of Defense Inspector General’s Office issued a report that found postaward compliance activities, specifically the oversight of subcontracting plans, is not a high priority for contracting officers. This finding is not limited to the military and can be generalized to apply across the Federal Government. As the number of prime contracts suitable for small business continues to decline, subcontracting becomes increasingly important for small contractors trying to gain a foothold in the Federal market. H.R. 6367, as amended, proposes to strengthen subcontracting measures by requiring large primes to maintain records proving they are subcontracting to small businesses, as required by their subcontracting plans. Furthermore, this bill establishes an alternative avenue of redress for small subcontractors, allowing them to engage the appropriate Federal agency’s small business advocate office if they believe payment is being withheld unfairly by a large prime contractor. Because of these important measures undertaken to protect small contractors, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6367, as amended. I also, again, thank my colleagues for their leadership in this measure, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6367, the Incentivizing Fairness in Subcontracting Act of 2018. Mr. Speaker, in fiscal year 2017, the Federal Government purchased goods and services worth over $508 billion through over 22 million contract actions. Yet, not all this money stayed with the original prime contractor and, instead, trickles down to subcontractors. Subcontracts are growing in importance as an avenue for small businesses to work with the government, so it is important that barriers to entry are reduced. By improving the tools that exist for small businesses to become subcontractors, today’s measures will draw in more small businesses that are not regular government contractors. This is a critical step to expanding the industrial base and including more small firms. Most importantly, it ensures more small contractors have just recourse through the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization if payment is not received within 90 days of completion. Timely payment protects small contractors who do not have the overhead margins to continue operating without being paid. Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers on this particular legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. LAWSON ), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Health and Technology and sponsor of the bill. Mr. LAWSON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support my bill, H.R. 6367, the Incentivizing Fairness in Subcontracting Act of 2018. This bill will clarify what credit is given for certain subcontractors and to provide a dispute process for nonpayment to subcontractors. Simply put, this bill will help contractors receive the credit they need to satisfy Federal requirements. Small businesses put in a tremendous amount of effort to receive Federal contracting jobs. There are tons of requirements, paperwork, and costs that go into applying and being awarded these opportunities. Unfortunately, even after a Federal contract is awarded, small businesses still struggle. Whether it is a delay in payment due to the lack of an administrative dispute process or not being able to count lower tier subcontractors toward goals, many contractors face obstacles during the implementation of their contracts, creating the need for safe harbors to guarantee that they can move forward in the most effective and efficient manner. b1730 H.R. 6367 will do just that. This is a bill that provides the clarity and resources needed to help contractors work at full capacity. This bill is endorsed by the National Electrical Contractors Association, an association whose 4,000 members are 85 percent small businesses. NECA is the voice of about a $160 billion industry responsible for bringing electrical power, lighting, and communication to buildings and communities across the United States. I am proud to work with Ranking Member VELA´ZQUEZ , the chairman, and the Congressman from Mississippi (Mr. KELLY ). This is an important step in 
guaranteeing that our contractors are treated fairly when carrying out their contracts. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I am prepared to close. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. LAWSON ) and his cosponsor, Mr. KELLY , for introducing this important legislation. H.R. 6367 protects our small contractors by updating the subcontracting goaling regime through increased flexibility and accountability. Establishing incentives to count low tier subcontracting awards and a dispute process for subcontractors to utilize in the event of nonpayment ensures a healthy Federal procurement marketplace. Today’s legislation spreads the economic power of Federal procurement to more companies and the communities they are located. Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to close. Mr. Speaker, as we have discussed, there are less prime contracting opportunities that are available for small businesses nowadays. It is in the subcontracting arena that is often the best and only way for a small contractor to engage with the Federal Government, but the lack of accountability and Federal oversight harms small subcontractors that rely on these opportunities to survive. This is a loselose situation for both America’s small businesses seeking to do work for the Federal Government and for the government itself. We want our citizens to get the best bang for their buck, and the more competition there is, the better it is for all of us. The greater oversight reforms in this legislation take a big step in ensuring small firms are protected. I once again thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. LAWSON ) for his leadership on this measure, and I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan, commonsense piece of legislation. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. PALMER ). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6367, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
ENCOURAGING SMALL BUSINESS INNOVATORS Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 6368) to encourage R&D small business setasides, to encourage SBIR and STTR participants to serve as mentors under the Small Business Administration’s mentorprotege program, to promote the use of interagency contracts, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 6368 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Encouraging Small Business Innovators’’. 
Section 9 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 638) is amended by adding at the end the following: ‘‘(tt) ENCOURAGING PARTICIPATION IN THE  MENTOR PROTEGE PROGRAM .—The Administrator shall provide an increase to the past performance rating of any small business concern that has participated in the SBIR or STTR program that serves as a mentor under section 45 to a small business concern that seeks to participate in the SBIR or STTR program.’’. 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Ohio? There was no objection. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan legislation was introduced by the gentleman from New York (Mr. ESPAILLAT ) and cosponsored by the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. NORMAN ), so it is bipartisan. I thank the gentlemen, both of them, for their leadership on this important issue. This legislation would make small but important changes to the Small Business Innovation Research, or SBIR, and the Small Business Technology Transfer, or STTR, programs. A healthy and vibrant Federal marketplace is important to our Nation. Competition breeds innovation, which is critical in our national defense to save lives on the battlefield or healthcare advancements to improve and prolong lives. The SBIR and STTR programs are often one of the first places small innovators and manufacturers venture into the Federal contracting arena. The process can be daunting for small firms completely new to contracting with the Federal Government. H.R. 6368 provides an avenue for more experienced SBIR and STTR companies to mentor newer companies to help them adjust to how the Federal Government does business. By doing so, it aims to strengthen the industrial base by bringing new firms into the contracting process. The bill also rewards mentors with a pastperformance rating boost so they can be more advantaged when applying for a full research and development setaside or solesource contracts going forward outside of the program. Additionally, this legislation provides clarity in the use of government side interagency acquisitions permitted through the fiscal year 2009 National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, by updating and harmonizing the terminology used in acquisitions. Finally, the bill expressly allows the GSA, General Services Administration, to assist agencies with contract awards and vehicle creation for small businesses receiving solesource or set aside contracts in the SBIR and STTR programs. 
Historically, there have been lengthy delays in the programs at various stages, including award notification, payment, and advancement. The bill aims to reduce these delays by allowing the GSA to assist participating agencies in the SBIR and STTR contract creation and management. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.

Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6368, Encouraging Small Business Innovators. For almost 40 years, our Nation has experienced increased innovation and job creation through the Small Business Innovation Research program, or SBIR, and the Small Business Technology Transfer program, or STTR. Research conducted by SBIR and STTR awardees has helped address our country’s most technological and research based challenges while generating tremendous economic growth and employment opportunities. By incentivizing more experienced SBIR/STTR companies to mentor newer companies and rewarding mentors through a pastperformance rating increase, Congressman ESPAILLAT ’s legislation positively promotes integrating these program participants into the larger Federal marketplace. That is why I urge Members to support this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of time. Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. ESPAILLAT ), the sponsor of the bill. Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, before I begin, I thank Ranking Member VELA´ZQUEZ and Chairman C HABOT for their leadership in the Small Business Committee, and the colead in this bill, the Congressman from South Carolina (Mr. NORMAN ). Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6368, Encouraging Small Business Innovators. Mr. Speaker, access to capital remains limited for underrepresented minority and womenowned small businesses. I hear this concern from many in New York City whose ventures in science and technology are full of promise and potential for success. However, a 2013 report commissioned by the Small Business Administration found that womenowned businesses do not have equal access to capital from the private sector as compared to their male peers. The Small Business Administration’s own Office of Advocacy has said that ‘‘there are fewer minority owned businesses representing high patenting industries than in all industries.’’ Through the Small Business Innovation Research and the Small Business Technology Transfer programs, the Small Business Administration works with partners in 11 Federal agencies, ranging from agriculture to NASA, to support small businesses, and especially those that are minority and disadvantaged owned. These programs are committed to fostering and encouraging participation and innovation and entrepreneurship by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals and expanding privatesector commercialization of innovations resulting from federally funded research and development. But this is limited only to research and development. There is no consideration given for testing and evaluation. What good is a product or a method when you don’t know if it works effectively, efficiently, or can be used in variable ways? H.R. 6368 addresses this problem by including testing and evaluation among the activities that SBIR and STTR participants can apply for. This is how we can encourage more underrepresented entrepreneurs and their expertise into a process where they can 
develop new products, ideas, and gain respected external validators. H.R. 6368 also incentivizes mentorship with previous SBIR and STTR companies that have found success in the programs to share and impart that knowledge and experience. Today’s bill is endorsed by the National Defense Industrial Association, an association whose majority are small businesses. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. ESPAILLAT ) for introducing today’s bill to spur increased contracting activities in the SBIR/STTR programs, and I ask all my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to close. Mr. Speaker, I, first of all, thank the gentlewoman, the ranking member, for her leadership on this, and Mr. ESPAILLAT , as well, and Mr. N ORMAN  for working together in a bipartisan manner. Mr. Speaker, the SBIR and STTR play pivotal roles in the development of new technologies while giving Federal agencies innovative and costeffective ways to solve operational problems. They are highly popular and have helped thousands of small businesses create new technologies, commercialize their ideas, and generate new jobs. The reforms contained in H.R. 6368 will bring more firms into the programs and make it easier for them to win contracts. This is a winwin for small businesses and the Federal Government as competition breeds innovation, and innovation leads to saving taxpayer dollars. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bipartisan and commonsense reforms of H.R. 6368, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6368, the ‘‘Encouraging Small Business Innovators Act,’’ which encourages R&D small business setasides, to incentivize Small Business Innovation Research Program (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer Program (STTR) participants to serve as mentors under the Small Business Administration’s mentorprote´ge´program. The SBIR program is a highly competitive program that encourages domestic small businesses to engage in Federal Research/Research and Development (R/R&D) that has the potential for commercialization. Through a competitive awardsbased program, SBIR enables small businesses to explore their technological potential and provides the incentive to profit from its commercialization. By including qualified small businesses in the nation’s R&D arena, hightech innovation is stimulated and the United States gains entrepreneurial capacity as it meets its specific research and development needs. STTR is another program that expands funding opportunities in the federal innovation research and development (R&D) arena. Central to the STTR program is expansion of the public/private sector partnerships to include the joint venture opportunities for small businesses and nonprofit research institutions. The unique feature of the STTR program is the requirement for the small business to formally collaborate with a research institution in Phase I and Phase II. STTR’s most important role is to bridge the gap between performance of basic science and commercialization of resulting innovations. As a member of Congress, I have worked to advance policies that promote business opportunities and business growth because I believe that this is at the heart of the American dream—small businesses are the backbone of the American economy. To this end, I have authored numerous Legislative proposals empowering small businesses such as the American Rising Act and the Transitioning Heroes Act, to name a few to provide opportunities for small businesses. I have also hosted events to create a platform for entrepreneurial and small business participants to hear from experts in the industry and to network with supplier outreach representatives from major government agencies and corporations. By finding the right mentors like SBIR and STTR, small business owners and incubators can learn valuable tools to aid in leading small businesses to success. For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to stand with me in the support of H.R. 6368. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6368, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn.

b1745 EXPANDING CONTRACTING OPPORTUNITIES FOR SMALL BUSINESSES ACT OF 2018 Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 6369) to amend the Small Business Act to eliminate the inclusion of option years in the award price for sole source contracts, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 6369 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Expanding Contracting Opportunities for Small Businesses Act of 2018’’. 
FOR ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED SMALL BUSI NESS CONCERNS OWNED AND CONTROLLED BY  
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT ) and the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio. 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Ohio? There was no objection. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Dr. MARSHALL and Mr. S CHNEIDER for their leadership on this bill. The Small Business Act currently allows Federal agencies to award sole source contracts to womenowned; servicedisabled veteranowned; HUBZone; and socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses. However, these awards can only be made in the narrowest of circumstances, rightly protecting the ability of small businesses to compete against each other. Even though Federal contracting officers have this procurement tool in their toolbox, the reality is that small business solesource contracting is rare and may be underutilized. This can, in part, be attributed to the fact that the maximum dollar threshold for Federal solesource contracts designated in statute has fallen far behind the typical size of contract awards made today. As contracts increase in size and scope, the usefulness of small business solesource contracts diminishes, to the detriment of small contractors eligible to receive such awards. H.R. 6369, as amended, adjusts the dollar threshold to actually reflect the size of contracts that are commonly used across the government today. This modest change will provide agencies with an accessible pathway to achieving their small business goals in categories they have historically been unable to meet. Additionally, and importantly, this bill institutes a new oversight process which will help reduce the chances of solesource awards being made to ineligible firms by requiring positive confirmation by the Small Business Administration that this small business is, in fact, eligible to receive the award before it is issued by the Federal agency. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6369, as amended, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 6369, the Expanding Contracting Opportunities for Small Businesses Act of 2018. The Small Business Act sets forth a governmentwide 23 percent goal of Federal contracts that should be awarded to small businesses. Each Federal agency is charged with setting its own small business goals which are to reflect the maximum possible opportunity for small businesses within that agency. By promoting the use of solesource contracts to small businesses, this bill adds to the government’s pool of suppliers. This results in higherquality goods and increased job creation for the economy as these direct awards require the small businesses to do the majority of the work and not subcontract out. I urge Members to support this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. MARSHALL ), the leader on this particular legislation. Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6369, the Expanding Contracting Opportunities for Small Business Act of 2018. Not only will this bill provide opportunities for womenowned, servicedisabled veteranowned, HUBZone, and socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses, this legislation also helps Federal agencies achieve and exceed their small business goals. Small business solesource contracting can be a valuable tool for both Federal agencies and small businesses, but our current statute is outdated. Federal procurement practices are rapidly changing, and the solesource authority provided by the Small Business Act has not kept up with the changes of today’s procurement landscape. By adjusting the statutory sole source dollar thresholds, H.R. 6369 incentivizes contracting officers’ use of small business solesource contracting in order to help agencies swiftly meet their goals. While it is critical that agencies maximize opportunities to small businesses, it is equally important that they have procedures in place to assure that awards are made only to eligible and qualified firms. This bill will apply a new oversight procedure that requires agencies to coordinate with the SBA prior to awarding a solesource contract, ensuring that firms receiving awards are, in fact, qualified and eligible. I am proud of H.R. 6369 and its mission to promote small business growth, strengthen oversight, and incentivize Federal agencies to work with small businesses. I encourage my colleagues to support this bill. Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Kansas for introducing this important legislation to provide flexibility to contracting officers when awarding solesource contracts. H.R. 6369 promotes the use of sole source contracts to small business concerns through the SBA contracting programs by raising the dollar threshold of these contract types to account for inflation. This bill will make valuable strides to a more equitable playing field for small contractors. I urge Members to support this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to close. Mr. Speaker, this bill provides greater opportunities for womenowned, servicedisabled veteranowned, HUBZone, and socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses. Additionally, it will help Federal agencies achieve and exceed their small business goals. It reinforces oversight, and gives Federal agencies a greater motivation to work with small firms. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to support the bipartisan and commonsense reforms in H.R. 6369, as amended. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6369, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn. 
CLARITY ON SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION IN CATEGORY MANAGEMENT ACT OF 2018 Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 6382) to amend the Small Business Act to require the Administrator of the Small Business Administration to report certain information to the Congress and to the President, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 6382 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Clarity on Small Business Participation in Category Management Act of 2018’’. 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Ohio? There was no objection. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I would like to thank Ms. ADAMS for leading this important piece of legislation. Category management is a procurement initiative that is currently being rolled out across the Federal Government. It can be a positive tool, allowing the Federal Government to better understand its purchasing habits and identify cost savings where appropriate. However, setting mandatory targets to manage agency spending may result in unintended consequences. Specifically, there is concern that this initiative may have the effect of reducing competition to only a few select vendors. As we continue to see increased use of these bestinclass vehicles by Federal agencies, it is important to remember that it is not the job of the government to pick winners and losers. We must be vigilant and ensure that maximum opportunities are given to small businesses, even as we continue to pursue cost savings across the Federal Government. H.R. 6382, as amended, takes that critical first step by tracking the potential impacts of category management on small businesses. The bill requires the SBA to report exactly how much of these dollars spent through bestinclass vehicles are awarded to small businesses. Obtaining this data and identifying trends or patterns affecting small businesses will become increasingly important as category management continues to be used in years to come. This is a commonsense piece of oversight legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support the measure. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 6382, the Clarity on Small Business Participation in Category Management Act of 2018. Our committee has long acknowledged small businesses’ critical role in 
the $500 billion a year Federal marketplace. When small firms are awarded Federal contracts, the result is a win win. While category management is billed as the strategy to get agencies the lowest price, we have heard the contrary in our committee, in that more contracts are being consolidated out of the reach of small businesses. By requiring that contracting activity under this new regime be reported in the annual goaling report from agencies to Congress, today’s bill protects the industrial base by creating a mechanism for much needed accountability. I am proud to be a cosponsor of H.R. 6382, and commend Congresswoman ADAMS for her work to provide accountability to the category management regime. I urge Members to support this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. ADAMS ), who is the sponsor of the bill and ranking member of the Subcommittee on Investigations, Oversight and Regulations. Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, H.R. 6382, the Clarity on Small Business Participation in Category Management Act. Small businesses are the heart of American enterprise, and we must ensure a level playing field for all of them to compete for Federal contracts. My legislation is the first step to addressing the many concerns of the small business community regarding the current administration’s efforts to expand the use of category management. Although category management has been billed as the procurement strategy that can get Federal agencies the lowest price, the actual numbers tell a very different story. In fact, the data shows us that small business vendors on the Multiple Award Schedule continually provided agencies with lower prices than those offered by category management contract holders. However, due to the changes under this administration, many Federal agencies and contracting officers can no longer take advantage of increased competition and lower prices because some category management vehicles are the only option available. Unfortunately, the current trend of this administration is to increase the number of agencies heading in this misguided direction. This will result in wasteful spending of taxpayer dollars because a reduction of competing vendors means Federal agencies will pay more than necessary for goods and services. Furthermore, the harmful effect of the use of the category management business model could mean further exclusion of minorities, women, veterans, and other already disadvantaged small business owners in the Federal marketplace. My bill requires the Small Business Administration to include in their annual report information on bestin class contractors, which are the companies that largely benefit from category management. This bill would also provide lawmakers with information on whether category management is reducing the role of small firms, womenowned firms, minorityowned companies, and veteranowned enterprises in Federal contracting. I am also proud to say that my bill is endorsed by the National Defense Industrial Association, an association whose 1,600 corporate members and over 85,000 individual members are 70 percent small business. NDIA works to help small companies grow and remain a strong part of the defense industrial base. The ability for Congress to see this data allows us to determine the effectiveness of such contracting vehicles for small firms and to make needed changes where appropriate. b1800 Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this legislation. I thank very much our chairman and our ranking member for their support. Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. ADAMS ) for introducing this important piece of legislation to provide much needed oversight of small business participation in the streamlined acquisition strategy known as category management. Mr. Speaker, I urge all the Members to support this important piece of legislation. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to close. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Ms. ADAMS for her leadership on this measure and congratulate her for its passage here shortly. This legislation raises the profile of this important issue and requires that the SBA keep track of how much Federal spending is made through bestin class vehicles. I applaud the administration for looking for ways to ensure taxpayer dollars are utilized in the most efficient ways possible. At the same time, we must be watchful to safeguard small businesses’ proper importance and place in the Federal marketplace. Enacting this legislation will help ensure that the correct data is collected and reported to help maintain that balance. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6382, the ‘‘Clarity on Small Business Participation in Category Management Act of 2018’’. H.R. 6382 amends the Small Business Act to require the Administrator of the Small Business Administration to report certain information to the Congress and to the President. This bill directs the administrator of the Small Business Administration to report to congress on: the total amount of spending government wide in such designation; the number of small business concerns awarded contracts and the dollar amount of contracts within such category awarded to each of the following— 1. HUBZone small business concerns; 2. Small business concerns owned and controlled by women; 3. Small business concerns owned and controlled by servicedisabled veterans; and 4. Socially and economically disadvantaged small business concerns. More than 99 percent of Houston’s businesses are considered small. In 2016, roughly seven businesses in the Houston District received a loan averaging $500,000 each weekday. Small businesses are the lifeblood of our economy in Houston and across America. Small business was key for the nation’s recovery from the recession. Between the middle of 2009 and the middle of 2013, 60 percent of the jobs created were from small businesses. I am committed to producing tangible results in suffering communities through legislation that creates jobs, fosters minority business opportunities, and builds a foundation for the future. Studies have shown that supporting small businesses is good for the American economy. For every $1 invested, small businesses will contribute $7 to the economy. Every American deserves the right to be gainfully employed or own a successful business and I know we are all committed to that right and will not rest until all Americans have access to economic opportunity. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6382, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
SMALL BUSINESS INNOVATION PROTECTION ACT OF 2017 Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 791) to amend the Small Business Act to expand intellectual property education and training for small businesses, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 791 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Small Business Innovation Protection Act of 2017’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT ) and the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio. 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Ohio? There was no objection. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 791, the Small Business Innovation Protection Act of 2017. As smallbusiness entrepreneurs continue to expand both here and abroad, they must have the tools they need to protect their intellectual property. However, the process for obtaining intellectual property protections both in the U.S. and abroad can be daunting, even for the most experienced small business owner. We must ensure that smallbusiness owners have the tools they need to protect their innovative ideas and products, as intellectual property protections are essential to promoting entrepreneurship and innovation. Smallbusiness owners often do not have the resources to protect their ideas and products, especially when they are competing in the international marketplace. Most simply cannot afford to retain attorneys to guide them through the difficult process of obtaining intellectual property protections, which leaves them vulnerable to their innovative ideas and products being stolen both here in the United States and internationally. This legislation addresses this issue by developing a partnership between the Small Business Administration, the SBA, and the United States Patent and Trademark Office, USPTO, giving entrepreneurs the full breadth of knowledge of a Small Business Development Center system and the USPTO. The bill utilizes existing resources at both agencies to better assist small business owners and expand their outreach efforts to provide small businesses with the resources they need to address intellectual property issues. Considering the important role that smallbusiness entrepreneurs play in our global marketplace, it is our responsibility to ensure that they have the resources they need to better protect their intellectual property. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY , Washington, DC, September 20, 2018. Hon. STEVE CHABOT , Chairman, Committee on Small Business, Washington, DC. DEAR CHAIRMAN CHABOT , I write with respect to S. 791, the ‘‘Small Business Innovation Protection Act.’’ As a result of your having consulted with us on provisions within S. 791 that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on the Judiciary, I forego any further consideration of this bill so that it may proceed expeditiously to the House floor for consideration. The Judiciary Committee takes this action with our mutual understanding that by foregoing consideration of S. 791 at this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over subject matter contained in this or similar legislation and that our committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as this bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues in our jurisdiction. Our committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any House Senate conference involving this or similar legislation and asks that you support any such request. I would appreciate a response to this letter confirming this understanding with respect to S. 791 and would ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the Congressional Record during floor consideration of S. 791. Sincerely, BOBGOODLATTE , Chairman. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON SMALL BUSINESS , Washington, DC, September 20, 2018. Hon. BOBGOODLATTE , Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR CHAIRMAN GOODLATTE : In reference to your letter of September 20, 2018, I write to confirm our mutual understanding regarding S. 791, the ‘‘Small Business Innovation Protection Act of 2017.’’ I appreciate the House Committee on the Judiciary’s waiver of consideration of provisions under its jurisdiction and its subject matter as specified in your letter. I acknowledge that the waiver was granted only to expedite floor consideration of S. 791 and does not in any way waive or diminish the House Committee on the Judiciary’s jurisdictional interests over this or similar legislation. I will support a request from the House Committee on the Judiciary for appointment to any HouseSenate conference on S. 791 or similar legislation. Again, thank you for your assistance with these matters. Sincerely, STEVE CHABOT , Chairman. 
Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 791, the Small Business Innovation Protection Act of 2017. Innovation is an indispensable element driving economic growth and ensuring America’s competitive edge in the global marketplace. In fact, it is so important that studies show the IP industry supports an estimated 30 percent of all jobs and contributes over $6 trillion to U.S. GDP. While many entrepreneurs understand the benefits of holding IP rights, just as many do not know where to start or how to protect their ideas overseas. The USPTO reported that just 15 percent of small businesses that conduct overseas business understand they need to file for IP protection abroad. This bill addresses the problem by creating a partnership between the two agencies best suited to take on this mission: the SBA and USPTO. By leveraging existing IP education and training programs, and utilizing the immense network of SBDCs, small firms will have all the resources to better protect their interests both domestically and internationally. 
I applaud Senator P ETERS and Representative EVANS for recognizing the problem and working to advance the interests of our Nation’s small businesses. Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to vote ‘‘yes,’’ and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, S. 791 is the Senate counterpart to legislation spearheaded on the House side by Mr. EVANS and Mr. FITZPATRICK , both of Pennsylvania. Once again, it is bipartisan legislation coming out of the Small Business Committee. That bill, H.R. 2655, was also reported unanimously out of our committee this spring. I commend them on their work on this important issue. This legislation helps small businesses receive better access to education and training opportunities both domestically and abroad. A partnership between the Small Business Administration and the USPTO would help more smallbusiness owners learn how they can use intellectual property to protect their ideas and products. This important partnership between the two agencies will help to reach more smallbusiness owners and better prepare them for doing business both here and abroad. It is vital that smallbusiness owners have as many tools and resources as possible to help protect their innovative ideas from intellectual property theft. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, in line with the bills we are debating today, this recognizes the special place small firms have in America’s economy and provides them a simple tool to protect themselves and their ideas. Today’s bill leverages the current role of the USPTO and SBA to educate and protect innovative entrepreneurs at home and abroad. Doing so is paramount to remaining the global leader in innovation. Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this bill. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the ranking member—the chairman, Mr. CHABOT , and the staff of both the minority and the majority side. It has been a great pleasure working on these nine bills. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I would just advise the gentlewoman not to get ahead of herself there. It ain’t happened yet, and I don’t think it is going to happen. But nonetheless, we have had a wonderful working relationship over the years. I have been the chair; I have been the ranking member. The gentlewoman from New York has been the chair and the ranking member. We would like to keep it just the way it is now, but we will see in about 6 weeks. Mr. Speaker, I have already given the closing statement, so I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 791. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
STUDY OF UNDERREPRESENTED CLASSES CHASING ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE SUCCESS ACT OF 2018 Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 6758) to direct the Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the Administrator of the Small Business Administration, to study and provide recommendations to promote the participation of women and minorities in entrepreneurship activities and the patent system, to extend by 8 years the Patent and Trademark Office’s authority to set the amounts for the fees it charges, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 6758 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Study of Underrepresented Classes Chasing Engineering and Science Success Act of 2018’’ or the ‘‘SUCCESS Act’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT ) and the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. JOHNSON ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio. 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 6758, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Ohio? There was no objection. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6758, the SUCCESS Act. Back in 2011, I was one of five Members of Congress who cosponsored the LeahySmith America Invents Act that the President eventually signed into law. In it, a provision was included to provide the Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office with the authority to set fees to cover the cost of examining patent applications and registering trademarks. Today, as a senior member of the House Judiciary Committee, I recognize the need to extend that authority another 8 years. The PTO plays a critical role in the development of new technologies. The agency operates on fees it collects from patent and trademark applicants. To ensure that the PTO has the resources it needs to properly examine patent applications and register trademarks to study the issue of patenting by women, minority, and veteran entrepreneurs, and to perform the countless other activities it undertakes that are essential to maintaining America’s competitiveness, Congress needs to reauthorize the PTO’s authority to adjust its fees. 
Additionally, we need to ensure that every American with a great new idea has access to the tools necessary for success in order for our Nation to realize its full potential and to secure an even brighter economic future for ourselves and our children. The SUCCESS Act helps us achieve that goal by requiring that the PTO provide recommendations to Congress on how to increase the participation of women, minorities, and veterans in entrepreneurship activities in the patent system. While American ingenuity is unparalleled, recent reports indicate that we have not tapped into all that the American people have to offer. Those reports indicate that while U.S. women earn almost half of all undergraduate degrees in science and engineering, and an estimated 39 percent of all new Ph.D.s in those fields, it appears that only between 10 percent and 20 percent of innovators listed on patents are women. A 2017 study showed that racial minorities fair even worse. Mr. Speaker, I want to take this opportunity to thank Representatives COMSTOCK and A DAMS for introducing language that served as the inspiration for the study included in H.R. 6758. I want to also thank my fellow members on the Judiciary and Small Business Committees for being original cosponsors of this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I might consume. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be the lead Democratic cosponsor of H.R. 6758, the SUCCESS Act. This bill takes the important step of extending for 8 more years the Patent and Trademark Office’s authority to set its own fees. It is a timely bill, and it is a timely time that we are passing this bill, because the feesetting authority for the USPTO expired on September 16 of 2018. This bill will allow the USPTO to have the ability to set the amount it charges for each of the services it provides to patent and trademark applicants. b1815 The ability to set its fees will also help the USPTO with its longterm planning. The fees are set to recover aggregate estimate costs of the patent and trademark operations, including all administrative costs. This bill would renew the USPTO’s feesetting authority consistent with the framework of the America Invents Act, which was enacted in 2011. Section 29 of the America Invents Act called for the Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office to ‘‘establish methods for studying the diversity of patent applicants, including those applicants who are minorities, women, or veterans.’’ This bill directs the Director of the USPTO, in consultation with the Administrator of the Small Business Administration, to conduct a study on the number of patents annually applied for and obtained by U.S. women, minorities, and veterans. The study would provide recommendations to promote the participation of women and minorities in entrepreneurship and in the patent system. This data is necessary so Congress and the public can fully understand the demographic nature of the patent applicant pool. This study will be critical in developing policies to help underrepresented groups engage in entrepreneurial activities that are the backbone of our American economy. Women, racial minorities, and low income individuals are significantly underrepresented in the innovation ecosystem. For example, the Institute for Women’s Policy Research reported in 2016 less than 20 percent of U.S. patents listed one or more women as inventors, and under 8 percent listed a woman as the primary inventor. The exclusion of women, minorities, and other underserved communities is beneficial not just for inventors, but for the business sector as well. For these reasons, I am proud to cosponsor this bill. I urge all of my colleagues to support this important legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, we have no further speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. ADAMS ). Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6758, the SUCCESS Act. As the world’s leader for innovation and entrepreneurship, the United States has historically been a breeding ground for the best ideas and creative approaches that improve our quality of life and solve some of the world’s most complex problems. However, currently, women, people of color, and lowincome communities hold significantly fewer patents than other demographics. A recent study even showed that children born to parents in the top 1 percent of income are 10 times more likely to become an innovator and hold a patent than those born into lowincome families. Innovation should not be a skill set only available to the superrich or those with the most resources. The SUCCESS Act is an important first step to better understanding why the patent gaps exist. It will take a collective effort to create a more equitable system. With data collected via the SUCCESS Act, timely research and the number of programs across the Nation addressing underrepresentation, the Federal Government can better promote policies that increase the opportunity for those underrepresented groups to successfully qualify. I strongly believe that it is our duty to ensure that all people have an equal opportunity to compete for patents and participate in the innovation economy. The future of American innovation is diverse, and the SUCCESS Act will help us begin to close the gap in patenting and ensure that all innovators, creatives, and patent seekers have a seat at the table. Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this legislation. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I am again asking that my colleagues support this very commonsense bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to close, and I will be very brief. Mr. Speaker, I would just like to thank the gentleman from Georgia for his hard work on this legislation. We worked together on a number of bills in the past, and I really do appreciate the bipartisan effort in this area. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6758, the SUCCESS Act. This bipartisan legislation would direct the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and the Small Business Administration to study the underrepresentation of women, minorities, and veterans among patent holders. It would also require the agencies to recommend legislative solutions for increasing participation by these underrepresented groups in entrepreneurship activities, and increasing the number of them who apply for and obtain patents. The SUCCESS Act would provide an important first step toward narrowing the race and gender gap among patent holders. One study estimated that per capita GDP could grow 4.6 percent if more women and African Americans were included in the initial stages of the innovation process. It also found that exposure to innovation during childhood has an important impact on a person’s desire to become an inventor. That makes it critical that young people have diverse role models in all fields of study. The bill was strengthened, in the Judiciary Committee, by the Gentleman from Illinois, Mr. SCHNEIDER , whose amendment added veterans to the list of underrepresented groups that will be studied. Promoting greater inclusion in the innovation ecosystem is good for our economy and good for underserved communities, and I am pleased to support the bill. The SUCCESS Act would also extend the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office’s fee setting authority for eight years. Since this authority was first granted to the PTO under the America Invents Act, seven years ago, it has helped put the agency on solid financial footing, and it has enabled the PTO to continue performing the important work of protecting Americans’ intellectual property. I appreciate the leadership of Mr. CHABOT  and Mr. JOHNSON , the sponsors of this bill, and the other bipartisan cosponsors of this legislation. I want to particularly thank Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ , the Ranking Member of the Small Business Committee, for all that she has done to bring attention to the lack of diversity among patent holders, and to the important issues highlighted in this bill. 
ASHANTI ALERT ACT OF 2018 Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 5075) to encourage, enhance, and integrate Ashanti Alert plans throughout the United States, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 5075 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Ashanti Alert Act of 2018’’. 
There is authorized to be appropriated to the Attorney General $3,000,000 to carry out the Ashanti Alert communications network as authorized under this Act for each of fiscal years 2019 through 2022. 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 5075, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Ohio? There was no objection. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, we will vote today on H.R. 5075, the Ashanti Alert Act of 2018. This bill establishes a national alert network for missing adults at the Department of Justice. It will allow law enforcement to coordinate the use of communication systems to alert the public that an adult is missing. In order to issue an alert, the missing adult must either suffer from a proven mental or physical disability, or law enforcement must certify the person’s physical safety may be in danger, or their disappearance was not voluntary. This Ashanti national alert network will be integrated into the existing Blue Alert system. The Blue Alert system issues alerts to notify the public of nearby suspects or threats to their community’s law enforcement officials. This legislation will also allow the Attorney General to designate a national coordinator to work with States to establish alert systems for missing adults and to develop voluntary guidelines States may use in creating their networks. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank SCOTT TAYLOR for introducing this legislation. We appreciate Mr. TAYLOR being here today and appreciate his leadership in this effort. I ask my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, let me say to the manager of this bill that I am delighted to stand with him on this very important legislative initiative. Having been in this body for a period of time, I am reminded of the AMBER Alert. I was here when it was initiated and passed by my friend Martin Frost, who was formerly in this body. And then I believe a lot of work was done on the Silver Alert by our colleague MAXINE WATERS . We all worked together, I remember, on amendments in the House Judiciary Committee on these very issues. So I rise in support of H.R. 5075, the Ashanti Alert Act of 2018. It is a commonsense initiative to realize that whoever is missing, we need to help find those individuals. 
This bill seeks to establish a national communications network within the Department of Justice to help locate missing adults by providing assistance to regional and local search efforts. For our colleagues, obviously, the AMBER Alert dealt with children, and the Silver Alert dealt with senior citizens over, I believe, the age of 65. This bill would initiate, facilitate, and promote Ashanti Alert plans in coordination with States, units of local government, law enforcement agencies, and other concerned entities with expertise in providing services to adults. These are laudable goals and, as a Congress, ones which we have a duty to facilitate. As of December 31, 2017, the National Crime Information Center database included records of 55,968 missing adults. In my own hometown, in the last 3 weeks, two adults went missing who were brother and sister. First, the brother went missing, and there was absolutely no sign of that individual. The sister went to look for that individual, and, of course, then they were both missing. Tragically, we found, ultimately, that a relative had disposed of and killed both of them. If we had an alert system, maybe we would have been able to find them sooner. In fact, many adults go missing each year who are not found until it is too late. Such was the case after whom this bill was named, Ashanti Billie. At 19 years of age, she was abducted from her workplace in Virginia, taken across State lines, and later found dead in North Carolina. Ashanti Billie was too old for the issuance of an AMBER Alert on her behalf and too young for a Silver Alert. This bill fills in the gap for people like Ashanti Billie, missing adults between the ages of 18 and 64, and it does so in coordination with the Blue Alert communications network, which Congress established. The Blue Alert establishes a nationwide network of Blue Alerts to warn about threats to police officers and help track down the suspects who carry them out. While drawing on the Blue Alert Network, the Ashanti Alert Act requires implementing jurisdictions to the established plans and includes minimum standards and resources that help in this case. Had these resources been available when Ashanti was abducted, she may still be here with us today. For these reasons, I support this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. TAYLOR ). Mr. TAYLOR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, H.R. 5075, the Ashanti Alert Act, named for Ashanti Billie, who was tragically taken from this world too soon last September at the hands of a violent criminal. And so now we have undertaken this action with this bill, a bipartisan one, because this is not a partisan issue. The United States does not currently have an alert system for missing adults. If a child or a senior citizen goes missing, law enforcement is authorized to broadcast alerts on major channels or radio stations, and participating citizens share alerts across social media platforms, bringing much needed attention and resources to bear. But still, no such alert exists for missing adults ages 18 to 65. History shows that programs like the AMBER Alert are successful and help save lives. In 2016 alone, there were 179 AMBER Alerts issued in the United States. Over 85 of those cases resulted in recovery, and 43 of them were the direct result of an AMBER Alert. These programs are proven to work, and with the Ashanti Alert, we can close the gap, better protect our family, friends, and neighbors, and save lives with a legacy given to us by Ashanti Billie’s sacrifice. Like other alert systems, the Ashanti Alert lets law enforcement use the tools at their disposal to broadcast information about missing adults on such things as TV, radio, and social media. It also sets a minimum standard for issuing alerts: one, the person suffers from a proven mental or physical disability; two, if law enforcement believes their physical safety is in danger; or three, if they believe their disappearance may not have been voluntary. The Ashanti Alert also integrates with the Blue Alert Network instead of AMBER so that information about missing adults and children are kept separate. This ensures that law enforcement efforts are not duplicated, which could mean the difference between locating a person and saving them. The Commonwealth of Virginia, has already taken steps to address this issue. Last April, the Governor signed a bill into law in honor of Ashanti that establishes a statewide alert system for missing adults. But in order to save lives, the search for missing adults cannot end at a State line. Indeed, according to the FBI’s National Crime Information Center, there are still over 55,000 missing adults in this country. This is a national challenge, and it most definitely demands a national response. Mr. Speaker, Ashanti Billie was a beautiful, young Black woman with a beaming smile. She was a hard worker. She would wake up before sunrise and head to the naval base and start her job. At night, she attended culinary classes at the Virginia Beach Art Institute. She had hopes and dreams and aspirations, and she was passionate about life and brought that positive energy to everyone who met her. Mr. Speaker, 1 year ago today, early in the morning, I met with local constituents, Kimberly Wimbush and Michael Muhammad; the Billie family— parents, Tony and Brandy; and Dyotha Sweat from the NAACP. Being military veterans themselves, the Billie family didn’t understand how this could happen. They were confused and very much worried. b1830 Their young daughter, Ashanti, was missing, abducted from the Little Creek naval base. Mr. Speaker, I knew right then that fateful morning, in my gut and in my heart, that this family would soon receive some tragic news. I knew this family and these friends needed my help. My heart and my team’s hearts were with them. Mr. Speaker, there are no words, no wishes, or no whispers that can bring back or ease the Billie family burden. But make no mistake about it, no amount of darkness can ever keep out a bright light. I may have met with a shaken family that day, but on this day, they sit before us today, in this Chamber, strong, determined, and ready to solidify Ashanti’s legacy. Today’s vote on Ashanti’s legacy will give law enforcement all across our great Nation a new tool to bring resources to bear to locate missing adults who may be in danger, and will, no doubt, save lives. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues’ support. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, could I inquire if the gentleman has any further speakers. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. It was my understanding that the gentlewoman would like to participate in a colloquy. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. CHABOT. I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I am concerned that H.R. 5075 does not explicitly include Native American tribes in the missing adult communications network that the bill would establish. It is my understanding that this network would be established and implemented by the same office at the Department of Justice that implements the Blue Alert system, which includes outreach to tribal partners to educate them on that network. I would like to confirm with the chairman that it is the intent of Congress that this same outreach to tribes be conducted with respect to the missing adult communications network. Mr. CHABOT. The gentlewoman is correct. This outreach to tribes shall be conducted in the same manner as the Blue Alert program, yes. Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank the gentleman. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remainder of my time. Mr. Speaker, in closing, let me thank the proponent of this legislation, Mr. TAYLOR , for a very thoughtful initiative, one that is needed. It is tragic when we lose our constituents, but more importantly, when the families lose their loved ones. Mr. Speaker, I support this legislation. By coordinating with existing 
networks, H.R. 5075 will facilitate the establishment of a communications network for alerts concerning missing adults and have an impact far beyond what it will take to establish it. I am heartened by Mr. CHABOT ’s clarification that this bill is intended to extend to tribal entities and Native American reservations. This past May, we commemorated the second National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Native Women and Girls to bring awareness about how this problem specifically affects Native American communities. I am hopeful that this bill can help address this very serious problem, and the overall bill that addresses the need for families to find their loved ones after the ages of children and before the ages of senior citizen. We can always do more to help local missing adults and to save them. There are families in my district right now who are suffering from the loss of their brother or sister. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5075, the ‘‘Ashanti Alert Act of 2018.’’ This bill seeks to establish a national communications network within the Department of Justice to help locate missing adults by providing assistance to regional and local search efforts. The bill would initiate, facilitate, and promote Ashanti Alert plans in coordination with states, units of local government, law enforcement agencies, and other concerned entities with expertise in providing services to adults.

At 19 years of age, she was abducted from her workplace in Virginia, taken across state lines, and later found dead in North Carolina. Ashanti Billie was too old for the issuance of an Amber Alert on her behalf, and too young for a Silver Alert. The Ashanti Alert Act seeks to fill in the gap for people like Ashanti Billie—missing adults between the ages of 18 and 64. And it does so in coordination with the Blue Alert Communications Network, which Congress established in 2015, under the Blue Alert Act. The Blue Alert Act established a nationwide network of ‘‘blue alerts’’ to warn about threats to police officers and help track down the suspects who carry them out. While drawing on the Blue Alert network, the Ashanti Alert Act requires implementing jurisdictions to establish plans that include minimum standards to ensure that resources are used adequately, accurately and efficiently. Had these resources been available when Ashanti Billie was abducted, she may still be here today. For all these reasons, I enthusiastically support this legislation and encourage my colleagues to support it. Mr. Speaker, I support this legislation. By coordinating with existing networks, H.R. 5075 will facilitate the establishment of a communications network for alerts concerning missing adults and have an impact far beyond what it will take to establish it. And I am heartened by Mr. Goodlatte’s clarification that this bill is intended to extend to tribal entities and Native American reservations. This past May, we commemorated the second National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Native Women and Girls—to bring awareness about how this problem specifically affects Native American communities. I am hopeful that this bill can help address this very serious problem. We can always do more to help locate missing adults and to save lives. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the Ashanti Alert Act of 2018, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remainder of my time. Mr. Speaker, in closing, on behalf of all Members of the House, I would like to offer my condolences to the family of Ashanti. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. TAYLOR for his leadership in proposing this very important legislation. Hopefully, other people will benefit from its passage. Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support it, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5075, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

PREVENTING CHILD EXPLOITATION ACT OF 2018 Mrs. ROBY. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 6847) to amend title 18, United States Code, to expand and strengthen Federal sex offenses, to reauthorize certain programs established by the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 6847 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This title may be cited as the ‘‘Adam Walsh Reauthorization Act of 2018’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from Alabama (Mrs. ROBY) and the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Alabama. 
Mrs. ROBY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 6847, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Alabama? There was no objection. Mrs. ROBY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased we are voting today on the Preventing Child Exploitation Act, which rolls together four bills the House considered and passed last year but the Senate failed to take up and pass. Each of them will make important changes to Federal law to protect children. I would like to thank my colleagues—Mr. RATCLIFFE , Mr. J OHNSON , and Mr. SENSENBRENNER —for their excellent work in crafting and introducing these bills with me and their critical efforts to move them through the House earlier this Congress. The first part of H.R. 6847 is the bill I introduced, the ‘‘Roby bill.’’ It closes a significant loophole in pursuing offenders who engage in sex tourism and prey on children abroad. Specifically, the bill ensures that the definition of ‘‘illicit sexual conduct’’ includes all potential situations where an adult defendant may abuse a child under these circumstances. No longer will they be able to go and prey on foreign children without facing the possibility of significant punishment at home. They will also not be able to escape enhanced sentences for doing so. The bill also closes loopholes that permit those who sexually degrade, humiliate, and abuse children under 12 to avoid sentencing enhancements for repeat offenses. Congress always intended for children to have the greatest protections, and we must ensure that our laws reflect that intent. The next part of H.R. 6847, the ‘‘Ratcliffe bill,’’ closes yet another loophole regarding offenders who commit violent crimes while they are in noncompliant status as sex offenders. Currently, this enhancement applies only to those who committed crimes of violence under Federal, Tribal, D.C., or military law, and the law of any territory or possession of the United States. This bill adds State crimes of violence as predicate convictions, thus ensuring all sex offenders who have been convicted of crimes of violence face heightened punishment where they fail to register. Presently, certain recidivist provisions are not consistent with respect to conduct covered when someone has a prior sex conviction under Federal and State law, as opposed to military law. For instance, under current law, an offender with certain prior military child pornography convictions would not qualify for a sentencing enhancement that someone convicted under a Federal statute would, even if their conduct was the same. This bill fixes this and makes sure that those recidivist enhancements are applied consistently. The third part of H.R. 6847, the ‘‘Johnson bill,’’ fixes a judicially created loophole in the Federal production of child pornography statute. In United States versus PalominoCoronado, the Fourth Circuit reversed a conviction for production of child pornography for insufficient evidence, allowing a defendant to walk free from production of child pornography charges despite photographic evidence he created that he had engaged in sexual abuse of a 7 yearold child. In doing so, the court suggested that a defendant must initiate sexually illicit conduct with the specific intent to create child pornography. This decision has extremely undesirable consequences in the prosecution of the production of child pornography. It has created a new defense whereby a defendant can merely deny a preformed, specific intent to record a sexual offense of a minor and escape Federal conviction. That is an outrageous result, and Congress’ intervention is required to fix the statute. The creation of child pornography must be adequately deterred, and this fix ensures that it will be. Finally, H.R. 6847 includes the Adam Walsh Reauthorization Act, introduced by Crime Subcommittee Chairman SENSENBRENNER , the author of the original Walsh Act. The bill reauthorizes the Sex Offender Management Assistance Program and provides funding for the United States Marshals Service, which is tasked with identifying and apprehending unregistered sex offenders. It also adds new provisions that aim to improve the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act and make it easier for States to comply. Thus far, 17 States, 108 Tribes, and 3 territories are in substantial compliance with the law. The intent of this bill is to ensure many more jurisdictions come into compliance. Over the past several years, DOJ has worked closely with the States to achieve this goal by promulgating flexible guidelines via the continued hard work of the Office of Sex Offender Sentencing, Monitoring, Apprehending, Registering, and Tracking, or the SMART Office. This bill takes several concrete steps to encourage compliance. For example, it addresses concerns many have addressed about juvenile offenders. It is important to keep in mind that only juveniles who have committed the most serious sex offenses are subject to registration under SORNA. Nevertheless, this bill lessens the amount of time a juvenile who commits certain offenses and keeps a clean record must be on the registry. If these youths keep a clean record for 15 years, they may petition to leave the registry. Additionally, the bill codifies 2016 DOJ guidelines which permit the SMART Office to deem a State in substantial compliance with the act even if it maintains a discretionary juvenile registry. Further, the bill alleviates the cost of implementation by explicitly permitting alternative means for inperson checkins for registrants and lessening the number of required check ins. This is a reasonable amendment that will help States with significant rural populations achieve compliance. I want to thank all my colleagues. I am glad to have had the opportunity to introduce the comprehensive child protection bill, which, as I have already noted, will strengthen Federal law to protect children. I also want to, again, thank Mr. RATCLIFFE , Mr. J OHNSON , and Mr. SENSENBRENNER for their work. There can be no keener revelation of a society’s soul than the way in which it treats its children. I implore my colleagues to take that to heart and support this vital, wellcrafted, commonsense legislation. I urge every person in this room to consider this bill, not just as a Member of Congress, but as a parent, a grandparent, an aunt, an uncle, or a friend. Please join me today in supporting this bill and protecting our children. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be on the floor with a fellow colleague in the Judiciary Committee, and we have a similar passion for children over the years. I am pleased to be able to acknowledge the work that the Walsh family, tragically, has had to do in honor of their son, Adam Walsh, and their reauthorization act, which has had a major impact on child violent crimes. So, in this set of bills is H.R. 1188, which I intend to speak on as it relates to protecting our children, but also are bills 
EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT CHILD SAFETY IS THE FIRST PRIORITY OF CUSTODY AND VISITATION ADJUDICATIONS Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 72) expressing the sense of Congress that child safety is the first priority of custody and visitation adjudications, and that State courts should improve adjudications of custody where family violence is alleged, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution. The text of the concurrent resolution is as follows: 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. BUDD). Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. RUTHERFORD ) and the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H. Con. Res. 72, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased we are voting today on this resolution, which expresses the sense of Congress that child safety should be the top priority of custody and visitation adjudications, and that State courts should improve adjudications of custody where family violence is alleged. Custody adjudications are especially difficult cases, fraught with emotion and complex relationships. States must ensure that the judges presiding over these cases are trained to understand these dynamics and apply appropriate evidentiary standards to parties’ evidence. Most importantly, States should ensure that in these disputes, children’s safety comes first. We have seen tragedies happen throughout the United States where the courts failed the children involved in custody disputes. Over the past decade, the Center for Judicial Excellence has documented 653 child homicides across the United States by a parent involved in a conflict related to divorce, separation, custody, visitation, or child support. Last year, Ana Estevez’s 5yearold son, Piqui, was murdered by her ex husband. Despite her efforts to obtain sole custody of Piqui due to her exhusband’s history of abuse, her plea was rejected. Her estranged husband picked up Piqui, as part of their joint custody arrangement, and took him to Disneyland. That was the last time Ms. Estevez saw her son. His body was found 2 months later, and her estranged husband eventually confessed to the murder, a tragedy that should never have happened. Today, we take a step in expressing to States that they must pay special attention to these cases. We hope States will heed this resolution and resolve to evaluate their family court systems and implement measures to put child safety first. I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. SESSIONS ) for bringing this resolution before us. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the House concurrent resolution. I thank my colleague on the Judiciary Committee for his leadership. I want to indicate that, first and foremost, this bipartisan resolution expresses the sense of Congress that child safety should be the top priority of any custody and parenting court adjudications, and that courts should resolve safety risks and claims of domestic violence first, before taking any other interest into consideration. The resolution also underscores Congress’ strong support for the use of scientificbased evidence in family court, including reliance on expert professionals with expertise in relevant types of abuse, trauma, and behaviors of victims and perpetrators by, among other things, establishing specific standards for the preparation of professional reports. This resolution also encourages States to consider models through which such professional experts can be appointed and paid directly by the courts as needed, and expresses the sense of Congress that we hold hearings examining family court practices with regard to the fair adjudication of children’s safety and civil rights. I think many of us as Members of Congress who deal in family issues, and as the founder and cochair of the Congressional Children’s Caucus, and being a student of the Family Protective Services—Child Protective Services, I have seen more than one case where a child is returned to a family and gets caught up in the unfortunate practices of that family situation, that home situation. Yes, they wind up losing their life, children as young as 1 and 2 and 3 years old, helpless, without being able to help themselves. H. Con. Res. 72 acknowledges that the InterAmerican Commission on Human Rights has found that the United States has failed in its legal obligation to protect women and children from domestic violence. It certainly seems appropriate, as we debate this, that I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, and it is not too late, to join me in putting the Violence Against Women Act on the floor of the House with over 160 cosponsors that specifically address the question of domestic violence, domestic abuse. So many of our collaborating groups from all over the country, both conservative and otherwise, are arguing and advocating for the passage of the Violence Against Women Act before its expiration on September 30, 2018. It would be a complement to this sense of Congress. In recognition of the fact that the problem of domestic violence is among the most serious social problems in this country, the resolution makes a number of important findings in this regard. Child abuse, in and of itself, is a major public health issue. It costs billions of dollars annually and, unfortunately, the loss of children’s lives. But the cost of child abuse cannot be measured in simple monetary terms because, as a study by the Centers for Disease Control tells us, children who experience adverse childhood experiences are at a greater risk to develop certain chronic diseases like heart disease and cancer. The consequences for children who experience abuse and neglect are longlasting, longreaching, and cannot be measured easily. As this resolution finds, child sexual abuse, too, as horrific as it is, is a matter that goes routinely underdocumented and underaddressed. Time and again, research confirms that allegations of domestic violence, child abuse, and child sexual abuse are often discounted when it comes to child custody litigation. This is with family members or guardians of a particular child. Tragically, abusive parents are often granted custody or unprotected parenting time, which places children at constant risk. The risk of abuse to the child increases when a perpetrator of domestic violence separates from a domestic partner. Most disturbing is the resolution’s finding that documents a minimum of 568 murders of children in the United States in a 10year period by a parent involved in divorce, separation, custody, visitation, or child support proceedings. In many of these instances, the family courts granted access to the child by the abusive parent over the objection of the protective parent. Finally, this resolution recognizes the need for courts to appoint well qualified professionals, at court expense, who will apply scientifically sound and evidencebased theories to assist in the adjudication of custody litigation. Because such assistance is not routinely provided, parents seeking to vindicate their rights in custody disputes often incur overwhelming debt and may even need to file for bankruptcy relief as a result. In the United States, this should be unacceptable. For these reasons, I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting H. Con. Res. 72. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Concurrent Resolution 72. First and foremost, this bipartisan resolution expresses the sense of Congress that child safety should be the top priority of any custody and parenting court adjudications and that courts should resolve safety risks and claims of domestic violence first, before taking other interests into consideration. The resolution also underscores Congress’s strong support for the use of scientificbased evidence in family court, including reliance on expert professionals with expertise in relevant types of abuse, trauma, and behaviors of victims and perpetrators by, among other things, establishing specific standards for the preparation of professional reports. 
This resolution also encourages States to consider models through which such professional experts can be appointed and paid directly by the courts, as needed. And, it expresses the sense of Congress that we hold hearings examining family court practices with regards to the fair adjudication of children’s safety and civil rights. House Concurrent Resolution 72 acknowledges that the InterAmerican Commission on Human Rights has found that the United States has failed in its legal obligation to protect women and children from domestic violence. In recognition of the fact that the problem of domestic violence is among the most serious social problems in this country, the resolution makes a number of important findings in this regard. Child abuse, inandofitself, is a major public health issue—and it costs billions of dollars annually. But the ‘‘cost’’ of child abuse cannot be measured in simple monetary terms because, as a study by the Centers for Disease Control tells us, children who experience ‘‘adverse childhood experiences’’ are at greater risk to develop certain chronic diseases, like heart disease and cancer. The consequences for children who experience abuse and neglect are longlasting and longreaching and cannot be measured easily. As this resolution finds, child sexual abuse, too, as horrific as it is, is a matter that goes routinely underdocumented and underaddressed. But, time and again, research confirms that allegations of domestic violence, child abuse, and child sexual abuse are often discounted when it comes to child custody litigation.

In the United States, this should be unacceptable. For these reasons, I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting House Concurrent Resolution 72. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. SESSIONS ). Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the distinguished gentleman, who spent his career not only as a sheriff, but a dulyelected constitutional Member in Florida, but also to the distinguished gentlewoman from Houston, Texas, who has served as an attorney serving the people of Houston, Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to make sure that as we respectfully address this issue, H. Con. Res. 72, which urges States to look at improved family court proceedings of child custody cases, ensuring that child safety is a top priority, it makes clear that Congress will use its oversight authority to engage in this issue also. We do not come at this issue lightly, Mr. Speaker. As a matter of fact, the Domestic Violence Legal Empowerment and Appeals Project has provided a great deal of information, not only to Members of Congress, but by visiting the Members, making sure that they understand that their work with the Center for Judicial Excellence and the Protective Parents Association of California have made sure that they saw these issues clearly and talked to Members of Congress about our ideas, not only as we fund Federal programs, but as we understand in our discussions with States that we prioritize and help them look at what is, seemingly, a national crisis. This national crisis is about how our children are dealt with in the court system and looked at. Specifically, this is a concurrent resolution that urges States to develop family court procedures to resolve claims of abuse and family violence before making any other determination in the case, allowing courts to focus on these allegations affecting child safety independently. b2000 What did I just say? Well, what I just said is many times in court proceedings where there is a family violence circumstance, where there is stress in a family, there are examples that either side might talk about what is in the best interest of the child. And courts across this country, whether at their local court, whether a state court, we are asking them to understand that this national crisis deals with children that are being placed in a circumstance that might not be in their best interest, and it calls on States to prohibit the use of discredited or unscientific theories in their family courts. In other words, there are many times provisions in a court or a bias of a court to take one side or the other. Finally, it highlights the problems that some litigants—these are people back in their own home States—face regarding mandatory fees, and Congress is asking the States to look at these. Many times, as the distinguished gentlewoman from Houston talked about, there are fee structures which keep families from fully participating to protect their children because of the cost. This is an important issue. Tragically, millions of children are impacted in the United States of America. They call it domestic violence or child abuse, but the bottom line is that the resulting harm is lasting to our children. Physical, sexual, or emotional abuse, this trauma stays with our children for some period of time and many times it lasts for a lifetime. It also imposes billions of dollars on society where these children need to be handled, dealt with, and worked through a system for them to understand what happened in their childhood would create some difficulties later in their life. Simply put, we believe that family courts need better expertise. Better expertise not only in terms of the legal counsel that is involved, but perhaps outside professionals who would address these issues. In my home State of Texas, we have had to reevaluate the circumstances, not just of divorce, but of domestic violence where a child is involved, trying to focus more directly on the needs of the child and then having that family, two sides for sure, who would come together to see what is in the best interest of that child. Family courts need to address abuse, and once again, many times it is not uncommon for them to have to address these through the frailties of a system, frailties of people who give testimony, and perhaps theories that are not always in the best interest of the child that might be proposed in court. So one story in particular has it of a young girl named Kyra who tragically lost her life at the age of 2 in 2016 while her family was going through the court system. The focus became the battle, not the child, and the child fell in between the processes and, unfortunately, the tragedy occurred because of this huge disagreement between the family to where her father brutally murdered her before setting the house on fire and killing himself. The tragedy involved, rather than highlighting the differences between these two, of the safety of the child. And the safety of the child and of the mother is vitally important. At least 653 child murders by a parent involved in a divorce, separation, custody, or visitation, child support have been documented in the United States over the last 10 years. That is a tragedy. That is a nightmare that is happening directly before us. This is why we believe that listening to outside groups, such as the Domestic Violence Legal Empowerment and Appeals Project and the Judicial Excellence Coalition have come to Congress to say, we would like for you to see what is happening back in your States, back in your communities, back where you are from, Members of Congress, and see if you can shine a spotlight on showing how important children and women are, not just in our society, but in the court system. So what I would say is I would like to thank my colleagues, the gentleman who started this, the gentleman from Pennsylvania, Congressman Pat Meehan, for his dedication to this issue, as well as my dear friend from New York, Congresswoman CAROLYN B. M ALONEY , 
for her leadership as she has joined me on so many issues where we deal with women’s health and women’s safety, children’s health, children’s safety, including disabled children and people who cannot protect themselves. Mr. Speaker, whether you live in Florida, Texas, Pennsylvania, or wherever you might be in this country, it is important for us to understand that the focus on children’s safety in court matters is essential to the Nation’s health and support for the future. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the distinguished gentleman and the chairman of the committee, Chairman GOODLATTE , for allowing this to come forth at this time. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman from Florida for yielding me this time. Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time to close. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. Mr. Speaker, first of all, let me certainly thank Mr. SESSIONS , my colleague out of Texas, for his very important words and moving commentary. I thank Congressman RUTHERFORD for his service and commitment, and the other cosponsors of this legislation, because it really has more impact. Let me conclude my remarks by acknowledging a tragedy in my district. As a hardworking mother was separating from her spouse, it had not yet gotten to the court, but it is evidence of what can happen. The remarks of the dad were, ‘‘Bring them over for me to see them one more time.’’ And even though the relationship between mom and dad was hostile, mom wanted to be cooperative, and brought them over and left them for a moment as she went to her small business. The next call she got was the shrill of police and neighbors screaming, and his call to her, the parent’s call, the father’s call, and he said, ‘‘Now come over and see your two dead children, because I have killed them.’’ So this is constant throughout the Nation, and we need intervention and we need recognition of the tragedies that can happen. So as I previously stated, I strongly support passage of H. Con. Res 72. It is a sober acknowledgement of how family courts in the United States are failing to protect the very children they are sworn to protect in cases involving domestic violence, and obviously these cases have histories of domestic violence. But also as a legislative body, we have far more effective ways to deal with these problems. They can complement H. Con. Res. 72. So I would like to, again, reinforce the bill that was introduced last July— this July, that I introduced, over 150 cosponsors, I believe. I introduced a robust bill to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. This VAWA reauthorization seeks to address the problem of domestic violence from a holistic perspective by attacking the problem from many different angles with resources, recognizing all the different components that are now before us. We need to reauthorize VAWA, not in any watered down fashion, and we need to do it in complement to H. Con. Res. 72. And if we hope to make any dent in this very serious problem and to protect women and children and men who are abused and victimized day in and day out, this is how we need to do it, pass bills like the concurrent resolution and also VAWA. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and join me in this bipartisan effort as well to pass VAWA. As I previously stated, I strongly support passage of House Concurrent Resolution 72. It is a sober acknowledgement of how family courts in the United States are failing to protect the very children they are sworn to protect, in cases involving domestic violence. But, as a legislative body, we have far more effective ways to deal with these problems than merely passing concurrent resolutions. Last July, I introduced a robust bill to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. This VAWA reauthorization seeks to address the problem of domestic violence from a holistic perspective, by attacking the problem from many different angles. We need to reauthorize VAWA—not in any watereddown fashion—if we hope to make any dent into this very serious problem and to protect women, children and men who are abused and victimized day in and day out. I urge my colleagues to support House Concurrent Resolution 72. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I first want to thank the gentlewoman for her comments and for her hard work on this resolution. I also want to thank Chairman SESSIONS for bringing this forward today. I want to encourage all of my colleagues here to vote in the affirmative for H. Con. Res. 72. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. RUTHERFORD ) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution, H. Con. Res. 72, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the concurrent resolution, as amended, was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
KERRIE OROZCO FIRST RESPONDERS FAMILY SUPPORT ACT Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 6580) to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to provide for expedited naturalization processes for the alien spouses of first responders who die as a result of their employment, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 6580 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Kerrie Orozco First Responders Family Support Act’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. RUTHERFORD ) and the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. JAYAPAL ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 6580, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. BACON ), my home State. Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. RUTHER FORD ), our distinguished representative from Florida, my good friend, for yielding some time. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6580, the Kerrie Orozco First Responders Act. This legislation, named after a fallen Omaha police officer, Kerrie Orozco, is a first responders bill that will give our heroes peace of mind every day when they leave their home for work to keep us safe. This legislation is simple, common sense, and compassionate. Under current law, the surviving family members of first responders who have pending immigration applications face delays in the naturalization process. This could weigh heavily on our 
first responders because of the undue burden upon them as they protect our communities. Should they be killed, would their family members who are not U.S. citizens lose their ability to remain in the country? This legislation would allow the immediate relatives of first responders who die in the line of duty to continue to process their immigration application in a timely manner despite the death of their loved one. We owe it to our first responders to ensure their family is taken care of should they pay the ultimate sacrifice of keeping our citizens safe. Supporting this bill will protect those who protect us and it will give them peace of mind. This legislation will extend the same privileges to our first responders that are currently afforded to our military servicemembers. This bill honors our first responders, it values family. This bill is for Hector Orozco and all of the widows and widowers of our fallen first responders. This bill tells our law enforcement officers, our firefighters that we have your back. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of H.R. 6580. Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. I rise today in support of H.R. 6580, the Kerrie Orozco First Responders Family Support Act. Mr. Speaker, I thank the sponsor for introducing this bill. The bill, as is made clear by its title, is a tribute to Ms. Orozco, a police officer in Omaha, Nebraska. On May 20, 2015, after 7 years of service in the Omaha Police Department, Kerrie was fatally shot in the line of duty while serving a felony arrest warrant. She was survived by her husband, Hector Orozco, and her two stepchildren, Natalie and Santiago. H.R. 6580 gives tribute to the sacrifice made by Kerrie and her family by recognizing the sacrifices made by all first responders who are killed in the line of duty as well as their surviving family members. The bill honors their sacrifice by speeding up the citizenship process for the surviving immigrant’s spouses, children, and parents of slain first responders. b2015 Specifically, the bill would waive certain physical resident requirements for surviving immediate family members who are already on the road to becoming citizens. Current law requires such individuals to reside in the United States as lawful permanent residents for 5 years before becoming eligible to apply for naturalization. This bill would waive that 5 year requirement and, thus, allow surviving family members to naturalize more quickly. It is modeled on the Military Personnel Citizenship Processing Act, which became law in 2008 after receiving unanimous support in both Houses of Congress. That bill provides similar benefits to the surviving immigrant family members of U.S. armed services members who were killed in action. H.R. 6580 simply recognizes that domestic first responders also serve this country at great sacrifice both to themselves and their families. This bill is the least we can do to recognize their service and their sacrifice. I congratulate Representative BACON  for introducing this bill and ensuring its vote on the floor. Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank Judiciary Committee Chairman BOBGOODLATTE and Ranking Member JERRY NADLER for their support of this important piece of legislation. I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6580, the Kerrie Orozco First Responders Family Support Act. This legislation is short, but it will have an immense impact on the lives of close family members of certain first responders who die as a result of injury and illness occurring in the line of duty. The Immigration and Nationality Act currently requires that, in order to naturalize and become a United States citizen, a lawful permanent resident must reside continuously in the United States for 5 years prior to naturalization. For spouses, that residency requirement is 3 years. H.R. 6580 waives that residency requirement altogether for the surviving spouse, child, or parent of a Federal, State, or local first responder who dies as a result of injury or illness incurred during line of duty activities as a first responder. There is precedent in immigration law for such a waiver. In fact, the language of H.R. 6580 is patterned on the current law, which waives the same residency requirements for the surviving spouse, child, or parent of a military servicemember killed while in ActiveDuty service in the Armed Forces. First responders routinely place their lives in peril to help those of us who are in need, and when they are killed or injured carrying out their duties, we owe their families a deep debt of gratitude. H.R. 6580 is a small price to pay in return for the sacrifice that first responders make every day. The legislation was named after Kerrie Orozco, an Omaha, Nebraska, police officer, killed while serving an arrest warrant on May 20, 2015. At the time of Officer Orozco’s death, her husband was in the process of becoming a U.S. citizen. H.R. 6580 will speed up that process and make sure other surviving immediate relatives in the same situation are afforded the same opportunity. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the work of the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. BACON ) on this important piece of legislation. I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6580, the ‘‘Kerrie Orozco First Responders Family Support Act,’’ which amends the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 to provide for expedited naturalization processes for the alien spouses of first responders who die because of their employment. This act is named for Kerrie Orozco who died in the line of duty in May 2015, just a few weeks after giving birth to a premature infant. Officer Kerrie Orozco was a sevenyear veteran of the Omaha Police Department and a new mother. As a member of the Metro Area Fugitive Task Force, she was conducting surveillance just before 1 p.m. that Wednesday, May 20, 2015, when the suspect being pursued fired at officers after being spotted. She is remembered not only for her police work but also for her extensive involvement in community service. She was active in coaching baseball and had been coaching since 2009 at the North Omaha Boys and Girls Club. She volunteered with Special Olympics and was president of the Police Officer Ball to benefit Special Olympics in Nebraska. Kerrie was a Girl Scout Leader, participated with Shop with a Cop, and assisted with the Latino Police Officers Easter Egg Hunt. Shop With A Cop is an annual event where 50 children from the Open Door Mission shop for their families and for themselves with an officer at a few local Walmart stores in Omaha. When she went to work on May 20, 2015, she did not know that she would not be returning home that night. Her husband is still waiting for his U.S. Citizenship while he deals with the heartbreak of his wife’s death. For most immigrants, becoming a United States’ citizen is the culmination of many years of hard work. Being a citizen offers new opportunity to have a greater say and a stronger voice in determining our country’s future. There is room in our country for lawabiding individuals from all over the world to come and be a part of the goodness and greatness that the United States of America has to offer. Our first responders put their lives on the line every time they enter the line of duty. As the senior member of the House Committees on Judiciary and Homeland Security and Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security and Investigations, I am humbled to call first responders my friends and also my protectors. I am committed to working tirelessly to assure that they have full support of Congress in getting the resources and training they need to protect our communities but also to ensure the welfare of their families. This legislation provides the same courtesy that is given to the families of men and women in uniform who are killed. The burden on families that have lost a family member is cumbersome enough on its own. By enacting this legislation, we can provide an uplifting moment in their period of grief and sorrow for this generation of spouses and hopefully ameliorating the situation of future spouses in similar circumstances. 
For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to stand with me in the support of H.R. 6580. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. RUTHERFORD ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6580, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ‘‘A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to provide for naturalization processes for the immediate relatives of first responders who die as a result of their employment, and for other purposes.’’. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
RECIPROCAL ACCESS TO TIBET ACT OF 2018 Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1872) to promote access for United States officials, journalists, and other citizens to Tibetan areas of the People’s Republic of China, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1872 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act of 2018’’. 
It is the sense of Congress that the Secretary of State, when granting diplomats and other officials from China access to parts of the United States, including consular access, should take into account the extent to which the Government of China grants diplomats and other officials from the United States access to parts of China, including the level of access afforded to such diplomats and other officials to Tibetan areas. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. RUTHERFORD ) and the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. JAYAPAL ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 1872, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1872, the Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act of 2018, addresses an issue of longstanding and increasing concern regarding China’s treatment of Tibetans living in the Tibet Autonomous Region, also known as TAR, and other Tibetan areas controlled by China. In 1950, the Chinese People’s Liberation Army went into Tibet in order to establish control over the region. In the years since then, as noted by the U.S. Department of State, the Chinese Government has ‘‘imposed severe restrictions on Tibetans’ ability to exercise their human rights and fundamental freedoms.’’ Such restrictions occur with regard to religious practice, freedom of travel, freedom to practice cultural and language preferences, and other aspects of everyday life. In addition, the Chinese Government routinely engages in human rights abuses, such as extrajudicial killings, torture, and arbitrary arrest. In fact, the Chinese Government’s actions are so severe that, in recent years, over 150 Tibetans have selfimmolated in a last ditch effort to get the rest of the world to focus on this problem. In order to prevent documentation of the religious freedom restrictions and other human rights abuses to the outside world, the Government of China has severely limited access by foreign nationals to these Tibetan regions. Such limitations prevent access to U.S. officials seeking diplomatic and consular access, journalists, human rights workers, and even tourists. When rare access is granted, activities are closely monitored by the PRC and information dissemination is restricted. Matteo Mecacci, the president of the International Campaign for Tibet, has stated that the Chinese leadership is seeking to enforce complete isolation of Tibet, often described as being worse than in North Korea, where at least some foreign media are based. Independent international observers are shut out of Tibet or allowed to visit only under strictly controlled circumstances, while numerous delegations of party officials face no obstacles in traveling to Western democracies to spread their propaganda. In fact, travel by Chinese nationals, including those with direct and substantial involvement in the formulation of policies to restrict access to Tibet, is routinely allowed by governments all over the world, including the United States. During fiscal year 2017, for instance, nearly 1.5 million tourist visas were issued by the United States to Chinese nationals. Those visas are valid for 10 years, during which the Chinese nationals can visit the United States multiple times. During that same period, the United States issued nearly 4,500 diplomatic visas to Chinese officials. H.R. 1872 prohibits an individual who is ‘‘substantially involved in the formulation or execution of policies related to access for foreigners to Tibetan areas’’ from being granted a U.S. visa if the Secretary determines that: one, the requirement for specific official permission for foreigners to enter the Tibet Autonomous Region remains in effect; or, two, such requirement has been replaced by a regulation that has a similar effect and requires foreign travelers to gain a level of permission to enter the Tibet Autonomous Region that is not required for travel to other provinces in China; and, three, restrictions on travel by officials, journalists, and citizens of the United States to areas designated as ‘‘Tibetan Autonomous’’ in the provinces of Sichuan, Qinghai, Yunnan, Gansu of China are greater than any restrictions on travel by such officials and citizens to areas in such provinces that are not so designated. Any visas currently held by such individuals will be revoked under the bill. The bill then requires the State Department to report annually to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees as well as the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the number of actions taken regarding visas pursuant to this legislation. According to the State Department, in recent years, there have been very small inroads made with regard to access to the Tibetan areas. And while some have expressed the concern that maybe this bill could make the Chinese Government roll back some of those inroads, moving this bill is the right thing to do. It is time that Congress takes a stand with regard to access by foreign nationals to the Tibetan regions. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Congressman MCGOVERN for his work on this issue. I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.

I ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the Congressional Record during floor consideration of H.R. 1872. Sincerely, EDWARD R. R OYCE , Chairman. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY , Washington, DC, September 20, 2018. Hon. EDWARD R. R OYCE , Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs, Washington, DC. DEARCHAIRMAN ROYCE : Thank you for consulting with the Committee on the Judiciary and agreeing to be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 1872, the ‘‘Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act,’’ so that the bill may proceed expeditiously to the House floor. I agree that your foregoing further action on this measure does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of your committee or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives on this bill or similar legislation in the future.

I will seek to place our letters on H.R. 1872 into the Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill. I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward to continuing to work together as this measure moves through the legislative process. Sincerely, BOBGOODLATTE , Chairman. 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Reciprocal Access to Tibet bill, introduced by my colleague JIMMCGOVERN , who has been working on this issue for such a long time as our ranking member on the Rules Committee and the cochair of the Lantos Human Rights Commission. I would like to thank him for his hard work and dedication to this issue and on this bill. The Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act is about fairness, human rights, and careful U.S. diplomacy at its core. For too long, China has restricted access to Tibet, preventing U.S. diplomats and journalists from observing human rights abuses in Tibet and preventing Tibetan Americans from visiting their home country. This bill seeks to reset that table. H.R. 1872 is premised on the idea that reciprocity forms the basis of diplomatic law and the practice of mutual exchanges between countries. This bill simply requires that, if Chinese officials, journalists, and other citizens are able to travel freely in the United States, it is only fair that their American counterparts are also able to do the same; and if Americans are not granted the same access to Tibet that the Chinese enjoy in the United States, then there should be consequences. This is more than reasonable and long overdue. Tibet is so difficult to visit that a Washington Post journalist said in 2016, Tibet ‘‘is harder to visit as a journalist than North Korea.’’ Mr. Speaker, I had the great honor last year of traveling with our minority leader, NANCY PELOSI , and Congressman MCGOVERN to Dharamsala last year to visit with His Holiness, the Dalai Lama. It was a deeply, deeply moving meeting with him, with the Tibetan Government in exile, and the 10,000plus people who came to a public celebration event while we were there. The world knows that His Holiness is a man of peace and tremendous integrity. He has laid out a 5year roadmap for negotiations with China, and he is willing to work with China to find a way forward. For any peace plan to get a footing, we have to work closely with our global partners to push this issue at this time because, if His Holiness should die, and he will eventually do so, a period of greater instability is likely to ensure making the human rights issues and the possible solutions still more intractable. The timing of U.S. actions here is extremely important. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN ). Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, my colleague from Florida, for the time. Mr. Speaker, when the Dalai Lama was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal in the year 2007—and this was through legislation that I had the privilege of authoring with Tom Lantos, our esteemed late chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee and the only Holocaust survivor to have served in this body—when we passed that in the House and we had the celebration of the Dalai Lama right down the hall, the plight of the people of Tibet was at the forefront of U.S. policy toward China. b2030 But in the years since, as China has gained both in strength and in power, I have grown increasingly worried that Tibet has been pushed to the periphery, to the edges. It is an afterthought. I was worried that China’s bullying and intimidation tactics, on display throughout the world, had extended so far that our United States Congress no longer had the will, no longer had the desire, to speak out in support of Tibet. But with this bill, Mr. Speaker, authored by my good friend and my colleague, Congressman JIMMCGOVERN , we are finally reversing that trend. We are sending a clear message, a true signal, to the regime in Beijing that the United States has indeed not forgotten about the people of Tibet, that Congress will not accept Beijing’s bullying and its intimidation, and that we will stand up in support of human rights for the people of Tibet. From demolishing Buddhist temples to jailing more and more prisoners of conscience, Beijing’s policies in Tibet are not only immoral and unjust, but are threatening the stability of a crucial area for U.S. interests. We must put pressure on China to stop its repression. This bill demonstrates that Tibetan human rights continue to be an important factor in our relations with Beijing, and I encourage all of my colleagues to give Mr. MCGOVERN full support for this bill. Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN ), my colleague, the sponsor of this bill, and a great fighter for human rights. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Washington for yielding me the time and for her leadership on this legislation. I appreciate it very much. And I am grateful to my colleagues from Florida, as well, for their support and for their leadership. Mr. Speaker, today is a great day for human rights. The House is about to approve our bipartisan bill, the Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act, that will impose real consequences for China’s bad behavior in Tibet. America’s foreign policy ought to send a message that we value human rights, that we stand with those working for freedom, that those values compel us to speak out when we see something that is wrong, and that we will hold accountable those who violate the basic human rights we all are entitled to. That is exactly what this bill today is all about. The basis of diplomatic law is mutual access and reciprocity. But while Chinese diplomats, journalists, and tourists travel freely within the United States, the Government of the People’s Republic of China has erected many barriers to travel in areas of China inhabited by ethnic Tibetans. U.S. diplomats, journalists, and tourists must obtain permission to enter the Tibet Autonomous Region, a requirement that does not exist for any other provinciallevel entity of China. Visitors also face obstacles to their ability to travel to Tibetan areas outside the TAR. But under this bill, Chinese authorities who are involved in the design and implementation of policies that restrict travel to Tibetan areas become 
ineligible to receive a visa or be admitted to the United States. This is a victory for human rights of Tibetans and Americans. Restricted access to Tibet has many negative consequences for Tibetans in China and for citizens of the United States. Tibetans are left isolated from the rest of the world. Their welldocumented suffering under Chinese rule— arbitrary detention, torture and ill treatment, extensive government surveillance, restrictions on the use of their language and their religious and cultural practices—all these violations of fundamental human rights are hidden from sight. Preventing diplomats, journalists, and tourists from traveling to Tibet makes it much harder to assess the full scope of these abuses. I know firsthand how important access to Tibet is because I had the opportunity to join Leader PELOSI and several other Members of Congress for a visit there in November of 2015. I saw the tight control the government exercises over virtually all aspects of the daily lives of Tibetans. And I had people thank me for being there, remembering them, and fighting for their rights. On the other side, China’s travel restrictions deny Americans the right to visit one of the most beautiful places on Earth and to experience Tibetan culture in all its richness. In emergencies, Americans may be denied help, due to China’s restrictive policies. I am reminded that in an October 2013 bus crash in the TAR, which left three Americans dead and many others injured, U.S. consular officers faced a delay in obtaining permission to travel to the region. This severely hindered their ability to serve American citizens in distress. Following a 2015 earthquake that trapped dozens of U.S. citizens in the TAR, the U.S. consulate general faced significant challenges in providing emergency consular assistance. This is simply unacceptable. If China wants its citizens and officials to continue to travel freely in the U.S., Americans, including Tibetan Americans, must be able to travel freely in China, including Tibet, beginning now. This bill will move us in the right direction on this basic but very important issue. Let me also take a moment to recognize several organizations with which I have had the privilege to work on behalf of the human rights of all Tibetans. I thank Human Rights Watch, the Office of Tibet, Students for a Free Tibet, and most especially the International Campaign on Tibet. Without their commitment and persistence, this bill would not be on the floor today. With this bill, we are taking an important step forward on behalf of the human rights of Tibetans; we are reaffirming our support for the leadership of His Holiness the Dalai Lama; and we are sending a message to the Government of China that human rights are not negotiable. Supporting human rights is the moral thing to do; it is the right thing to do; and it is the American thing to do for Tibetans in China and everywhere else in the world. Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the actions called for in this bill are measured and calibrated, measured in that they follow the line of traditional diplomacy of taking careful steps without the dangers of overescalation, but calibrated to achieve a real opening, to wisely use U.S. power to open up an opportunity for the two sides to take their next steps. There are many Tibetan Americans throughout the United States whose family members still reside within Tibet, and they are watching this Chamber closely for signs that the United States is willing to help, willing to allow them to return to visit their families, and hoping fervently for a solution to the pain and suffering in Tibet and with the diaspora that has been experienced by generations. This is the time for bold U.S. leadership, and I do believe that is what this bill offers tonight. Our timely consideration of this bill takes an important step forward in leveling the global playing field. This bill seeks to make simple policy changes to enforce reciprocity between our two countries, to make clear that China cannot bar our people from Tibet and continue to expect open access to our country. Allowing for the freedom of movement for people in both of our nations sets an important precedent going forward. Mr. Speaker, let me just say that this has been an incredibly important bipartisan collaboration that we have had. I am very grateful to my colleague from Florida for her work on this, and I am also very grateful to Chairman GOODLATTE and to Ranking Member NADLER for their work on this. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. PELOSI ), the minority leader, who has been a tireless champion on this issue for decades, has led many of us to meet with His Holiness, has worked with His Holiness to come here, and has been a champion for human rights around the world. Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Washington State who, from day one, has been a champion for human rights in our country and throughout the world. I was proud to travel with her to visit with His Holiness the Dalai Lama, where this issue has been on the forefront for many years and currently. I thank Mr. HULTGREN for his leadership and for being part of this legislation, and also CHRIS SMITH and Frank Wolf before him. We have been working on this for a long time. On a previous trip, we visited Tibet, and we called Mr. MCGOVERN the spiritual leader of our trip because everywhere he went in Tibet, and then also in the rest of China, he brought up this issue of reciprocity. It has a human rights aspect to it, but it also is a practical matter that if we want to improve communication and relationships and the rest, if the Tibetan—it is the Chinese Government, but in the form of the Tibetan—local government there wants more people to go to school and visit Tibet and all, as a practical matter, it would be very important for us to have a diplomatic presence in Lhasa. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act as a strong, bipartisan bill. We are very proud of that. It takes an important step forward to advance the future of freedom, dignity, and prosperity for the Tibetan people. Mr. Speaker, I congratulate and acknowledge the leadership of Congressman JIMMCGOVERN , as I mentioned, who is cochair of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission. Ten years ago, he became the chair of that commission. He was working on this issue even before then. His leadership honors the legacy of Tom Lantos, our colleague, and the responsibility of Congress to defend human rights and dignity around the world. That has always been not only bipartisan, but bicameral on this issue. This bill holds China officials accountable for their repressive campaign to cut off Tibet from America and the world. It promotes free, unfettered travel for American diplomats, journalists, and tourists to Tibet, and fosters strong bonds between our peoples. And it sends a clear signal that China’s meddling in Tibet’s affairs is unacceptable and cannot continue. For six decades, the Tibetan people have stood defiant in the face of oppression and brutality from an authoritarian China. The people of Tibet have courageously spoken out for their freedom, and the rest of the world has been stirred to action by their clarion call for justice and dignity. All freedom loving people must continue to speak out until every Tibetan can learn, worship, and live free from persecution and abuse. I might add, sadly, that we would hope that there would be respect for the dignity and the faith of the Uighurs in China as well. In November 2015, I led a congressional delegation—as I mentioned, the first congressional delegation in a long time to enter Tibet—with Congressman MCGOVERN in Jokhang Temple, Potala Palace, and Sera Monastery, and witnessed the strength of the Tibetan people and the beauty of their culture. Last year, again, I led another bipartisan delegation to Nepal and India, where we were blessed to be received by His Holiness the Dalai Lama, and Congresswoman JAYAPAL was part of that. We had the opportunity to see the aspirations of the Tibetan people firsthand, now living in India, especially in the eyes of the Tibetan schoolchildren in Dharamshala. 
These people are there, separated from their parents for the most part, because they are not allowed to practice their faith, speak their language, or enjoy their culture in Tibet because that is suppressed. Today, those aspirations remain in peril as China continues to silence the voices crying out for freedom in Tibet and across the region. Every day, Tibetans, Uighurs—again, the Uighurs are the Muslims in the western areas of China—and the people of Hong Kong and all throughout China are subjected to the threat of oppression and persecution simply for wishing to practice their faith and pursue a more democratic future. b2045 Mr. Speaker, if we don’t speak out for human rights in China because of our commercial relationship with them, we lose all moral authority to speak out for human rights anyplace in the world. As Members of Congress, we have a responsibility to stand with the Tibetan people as they fight to be free to practice their faith traditions, speak their language, and celebrate their cultures. This bill takes a strong step toward that mission, and I urge my colleagues to join in a strong bipartisan ‘‘yes’’ on this vote. Again, I want to commend my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who have for a very long time been such leaders on the issues of human rights throughout the world, including in China, and for whom this particular bill has emerged as one manifestation of where we can make a reasonable, measured difference in our relationship. So I thank Mr. HULTGREN and Mr. MCGOVERN for their leadership in bringing this forth. I thank the Judiciary Committee and my colleague who was so important on our trip. So it is really a joy to see the gentleman on the floor leading this debate. I thank the gentleman for bringing his eloquence, his compassion, his concern, and his leadership to this important issue. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close. I have no further speakers. Mr. Speaker, I would just say that we are incredibly proud to be, hopefully, passing this legislation tonight with such bipartisan support and reminding the world that the United States stands for human rights. We stand for the human rights of Tibetans, and I thank my colleagues on the other side for their work on this. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I thank the minority leader for her comments on this issue and strong bipartisan support for human rights, not only in Tibet but all over the globe. Really, this is a great moment, I think, for this body. I will repeat again that it is time that Congress takes a stand with regard to access by foreign nationals to the Tibetan regions. Again, I want to thank Congressman MCGOVERN for his work on this issue. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1872, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1872, the ‘‘Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act of 2017,’’ which promotes access for United States officials, journalists, and other citizens to Tibetan areas of the People’s Republic of China. As a cosponsor of this bill, I am acutely aware of the importance of this legislation. The Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act of 2017,’’ is the first step in opening access to Tibet because it would restrict access to China as long as the government of China restricts access to Tibet. The act requires the State Department to submit an annual, publicly available report to Congress that includes a list of individuals holding specified senior Chinese leadership positions and an assessment of the level of access Chinese authorities granted U.S. diplomats, journalists, and tourists to Tibetan areas in China. In turn, the listed persons shall be ineligible to enter or to be present in the United States if specified restrictions on foreign travelers entering Tibetan areas remain in effect. When we grant Chinese diplomats’ access to parts of the United States, we should take into account the extent to which China grants U.S. diplomats access to parts of China, including the Tibetan areas. For far too long have we allowed Chinese officials to enjoy our freedoms of movement and expression while we condoned with our silence their draconian restrictions on those very freedoms. China considers any evidence of Chinese or Tibetans showing loyalty to or being in communication with the Tibetan government in exile to be illegal and subject to harsh punishment. Chinese authorities tightly restrict travel and news media in Tibet. Individuals who use the internet, social media, or other means to disseminate dissenting views or share politically sensitive content face arrest and harsh penalties. Tibetan cultural expression, which the authorities associate with separatism, is subject to especially harsh restrictions; those incarcerated in recent years have included scores of Tibetan writers, intellectuals, and musicians. As a nation that stands for basic freedoms of faith and expression, it is imperative that we do not remain bystanders in the perpetual struggle for justice and human rights. This bill is created for the benefit of not only U.S. officials and workers in human rights who have no access into Tibet, but also Tibetans living in oppression and in exile who desperately hope every day for a breath of freedom in the Chinese security apparatus. For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to stand with me in the support of H.R. 1872. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. RUTHERFORD ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1872, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ‘‘A bill to promote access for United States diplomats and other officials, journalists, and other citizens to Tibetan areas of the People’s Republic of China, and for other purposes.’’. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. f 
MIGRATORY BIRD FRAMEWORK AND HUNTING OPPORTUNITIES FOR VETERANS ACT Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 6013) to amend the Migratory Bird Treaty Act to establish January 31 of each year as the Federal closing date for duck hunting season and to establish special duck hunting days for youths, veterans, and active military personnel, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 6013 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Migratory Bird Framework and Hunting Opportunities for Veterans Act’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK ) and the gentleman from California (Mr. HUFFMAN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK ). 
Mr. M CCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6013, the Migratory Bird Framework and Hunting Opportunities for Veterans Act, accomplishes two goals. First, it provides certainty to States by setting a specific Federal framework closing date for duck hunting. Second, it provides States the option to establish special duck hunting days for youth, veterans, and members of the Armed Forces. In addition to the Department of the Interior, I want to thank Ducks Unlimited, Vista Outdoors, the Congressional Sportsmen’s Foundation, and Will Primos among others for their work on and support of this important bill. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, as the gentleman mentioned, this bill amends the Migratory Bird Treaty Act to establish special duck hunting days for youth and veterans. While I generally support expanding hunting opportunities for youth and veterans, it is important that we do it in a way that does not detract from management decisions based on sound science that produces the best outcomes for wildlife populations. This year marked the 100th anniversary of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, a law which codified our Nation’s commitment to honor international treaties that protect migratory bird populations. It is important to remember that prior to its passage, birds like the snowy egret and wood duck were plummeting towards extinction due to market hunting and unregulated commercial trade in bird feathers. Thanks to the protections afforded by the MBTA, these birds and many others have recovered from the brink of extinction, while maintaining opportunities for hunters to participate in waterfowl hunting through science based management and population assessments. Congress has an obligation to ensure that the Secretary of the Interior retains the authority to determine when hunting of migratory game birds can take place in the United States. While the flyway councils play a critical role in developing regulations, establishing the framework for migratory bird management is a Federal responsibility that should be done in consultation with flyway councils. I do want to thank Chairman BISHOP  for working with our staff to make modest changes to the bill to address some of our concerns. We hope to continue working with our colleagues in the Senate to make further refinements and ensure that this bill does not move us forward in a way that departs from sound, sciencebased management. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I ask for adoption of the measure, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6013, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ‘‘A bill to amend the Migratory Bird Treaty Act to establish January 31 of each year as the Federal framework closing date for the duck hunting season and to establish special duck hunting days for youths, veterans, and active military personnel, and for other purposes.’’. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
NEVADA LANDS BILL TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS ACT OF 2018 Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 6299) to modify the process of the Secretary of the Interior for examining certain mining claims on Federal lands in Storey County, Nevada, to facilitate certain pinyonjuniperrelated projects in Lincoln County, Nevada, to modify the boundaries of certain wilderness areas in the State of Nevada, to fully implement the White Pine County Conservation, Recreation, and Development Act, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 6299 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Nevada Lands Bill Technical Corrections Act of 2018’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK ) and the gentleman from California (Mr. HUFFMAN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK ). 
Mr. M CCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6299, introduced by Congressman AMODEI of Nevada, provides commonsense improvements and technical corrections to existing laws that will spur economic development and ensure better land management in several Nevada counties, including Storey, Clark, Lincoln, and White Pine. The provisions included in this bill represent strong collaboration with State and local elected officials and have been supported by the entire Nevada congressional delegation. I want to thank Chairman GOWDY for his cooperation in getting this bill scheduled for consideration and simply conclude by saying this is a good bill. It is going to enhance sound land management and provide significant public benefit to the people of these Nevada communities. I want to thank and commend Congressman AMODEI for his fine work. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I am prepared to close when the gentleman is finished. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON NATURAL RESOURCES , Washington, DC, September 20, 2018. Hon. TREYGOWDY , Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Washington, DC. DEARMR. CHAIRMAN : On September 5, 2018, the Committee on Natural Resources ordered favorably reported H.R. 6299, the Nevada Lands Bill Technical Corrections Act of 2018. This bill was additionally referred to the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. I ask that you allow the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to be discharged from further consideration of the bill so that it may be scheduled by the Majority Leader. This discharge in no way affects your jurisdiction over the subject matter of the bill, and it will not serve as precedent for future referrals. In addition, should a conference on the bill be necessary, I would support your request to have the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform represented on the conference committee. Finally, I would be pleased to include this letter and your response in the bill report and in the Congressional Record. Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to further opportunities to work with you this Congress. Sincerely, ROBBISHOP , Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT AND GOVERNMENT REFORM , Washington, DC, September 20, 2018. Hon. ROBBISHOP , Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN : Thank you for your letter regarding H.R. 6299, the Nevada Lands Bill Technical Corrections Act of 2018. As you know, certain provisions of the bill fall within the jurisdiction of Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. As a result of your having consulted with me concerning the provisions of H.R. 6299 that fall within our Rule X jurisdiction, I agree to forgo consideration of the bill, so the bill may proceed expeditiously to the House floor. I agree that forgoing formal consideration of the bill will not prejudice the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform with respect to any future jurisdictional claim, and I appreciate your agreement to support appointment of members of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform as conferees in any House Senate conference on this or related legislation. In addition, I request the Committee be consulted and involved as the bill or similar legislation moves forward so we may address any remaining issues within our jurisdiction. Finally, I request you include your letter and this response in the bill report filed by the Committee on Natural Resources, as well as in the Congressional Record during consideration of the bill on the floor. Sincerely, TREYGOWDY . 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I agree with my colleague. This is a good bill. We are pleased that it facilitates the implementation of the Multiple Species Habitat Conservation plan for the Lower Virgin River. It authorizes funds for fuels reduction and restoration projects in pinyonjuniperdominated landscapes, makes technical corrections to the boundaries of several wilderness areas and validates a patent associated with a previously authorized land exchange. A previous version of this bill is cosponsored by the entire Nevada delegation, and I recognize that its passage is important to the people of eastern Nevada. I do want to thank the majority and the sponsor for working with the BLM to address many of their concerns throughout the bill’s history. Resolving those concerns and working with the BLM turned this bill into a proposal we can support. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I ask for adoption of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6299, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
DIRECTING SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR TO MANAGE AGRICULTURAL PROPERTY IN POINT REYES NATIONAL SEASHORE Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 6687) to direct the Secretary of the Interior to manage the Point 
Reyes National Seashore in the State of California consistent with Congress’ longstanding intent to maintain working dairies and ranches on agricultural property as part of the seashore’s unique historic, cultural, scenic and natural values, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 6687 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. MANAGEMENT OF AGRICULTURAL PROPERTY IN POINT REYES NATIONAL SEASHORE. 
Mr. M CCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to present this bill on behalf of its author, Mr. HUFFMAN , and its cosponsor, Chairman BISHOP . Chairman B ISHOP has also asked that I commend my colleague from California for his work and collaboration on this measure. Representative HUFFMAN worked to forge consensus with diverse local stakeholders on a complicated issue. When we found local solutions that the local people agree is the answer, as has been done here, we should do everything we can on both sides of the aisle to advance the solution forward. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, this is a bill that is strongly bipartisan. It reaffirms congressional intent to continue to authorize sustainable, working dairies and ranches within a portion of the Point Reyes National Seashore. This is consistent with the seashore’s historic, cultural, scenic, and natural values. It also honors repeated Federal promises that the ranches and dairies in the Point Reyes National Seashore would be offered longterm permits so that they can have the certainty and the clarity they need to obtain financing, make family succession plans, and other decisions necessary to continue operations. For over 150 years, agriculture has been a vital part of the fabric of West Marin, part of my district in northern California. This includes the historic ranches and dairies in the Point Reyes National Seashore and also some northern portions of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. These ranches and dairies contribute to the unique history, character, and cultural heritage of these magnificent national park units. The statutory history of Point Reyes reflects Congress’ intent to continue ranching in the pastoral areas of the seashore to ensure that future generations could experience these working landscapes. We are reaffirming that intent with this bill. I think the agricultural heritage of West Marin is worth protecting. The National Park Service agrees. Across Presidential administrations and since the creation of the seashore and the GGNRA, the Park Service has consistently supported continuation of the ranching heritage in these areas. Today, Congress is reaffirming longstanding policy and decades of diligent efforts by the Park Service. We are also making good on a commitment Interior Secretary Salazar made in November of 2012 to provide longterm assurances for these ranchers and dairies. He specifically directed the Park Service to proceed with extending 20year permits consistent with applicable laws and planning processes. b2100 Toward that same end, this bill directs the issuance of 20year leases and permits after completion by the Park Service of a robust general management plan update process, including public engagement and environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act, which must include compliance with the Endangered Species Act and any other environmental reviews. Through this planning and environmental review process, the Park Service will receive public comment, evaluate possible measures that could improve the environmental sustainability of the ranches and dairies, and ensure the good stewardship of the seashore’s national resources. The general management plan and the NEPA process will inform how the Park Service exercises its broad discretionary authority to set terms and conditions in the leases and the permits, and can develop critical strategies, actions, and policies on a wide range of issues involving land and natural resource management within the seashore. As any visitor to Point Reyes knows, one of the unique features of the seashore is the successful return of the majestic tule elk. This legislation envisions a healthy coexistence of thriving elk herds and the historic ranches and dairies within the seashore through effective management. It provides direction to the Park Service to manage for effective separation between tule elk and livestock in areas where growing elk herds have 
presented conflicts with working ranches and dairies, such as taking up permanent residence on dairies’ critical organic pastureland, interfering with ranch operations, or damaging infrastructure, hardly the outcomes envisioned by the Park Service’s 1998 elk management plan. While providing this general policy guidance, the bill leaves broad discretion to the Park Service to determine how best to manage the elk. It leaves in place all existing tools, while adding a new opportunity to explore relocation and cultural ceremonial activities with interested Native American Tribes. I am grateful for the broad public support that this bill has received, ranging from the Marin Conservation League to the Marin County Farm Bureau and the Marin County Board of Supervisors. I also want to address, briefly, some misconceptions that a few of the bill’s critics have raised. First, nothing in this bill elevates ranching above other uses of the seashore. It specifically does not amend the purpose section of the enabling act, which means that operations of the ranches and dairies will remain consistent with the policies and legal requirements that govern the Interior Department’s stewardship of the land. It is important to remember that less than onethird of the seashore is in agricultural use today. Nearly twice that amount is designated as wilderness. Nothing in this bill expands agriculture. It is limited to the areas where there is currently ranching or dairy operations. I also want to address and emphasize the fact that nothing in this bill suggests elimination of elk from the seashore. I am not aware of a single stakeholder who has suggested eliminating elk. If they had, I would reject it. There is no reason elk and ranching cannot coexist on the seashore if there is effective management and separation in areas of conflict. This bill leaves broad discretion to the Park Service to determine the strategies and actions that make the most sense to achieve that goal. For those worried that this bill may somehow reopen the 2012 decision by Interior Secretary Ken Salazar to not renew for Drakes Bay Oyster Company and to designate and manage Drakes Estero as marine wilderness, let me be emphatically clear. There is nothing in the letter or the intent of this bill that possibly could be read to do that. The bill has nothing to do with the oyster issue. It focuses on making sure the unresolved part of Secretary Salazar’s 2012 decision, the part providing long term assurances for the historic ranches and dairies, is actually carried out. In this regard, I was mindful in drafting the bill of Secretary Salazar’s specific direction in his memo of November 29, 2012, that the Park Service work with the ranches and dairies to ‘‘reaffirm my intention that, consistent with applicable laws and planning processes, recognition of the role of ranching be maintained and to pursue extending permits to 20year terms. . . .’’ Secretary Salazar also directed that ‘‘the values of multigenerational ranching and farming at Point Reyes should be fully considered in future planning efforts. These working ranches are a vibrant and compatible part of Point Reyes National Seashore and both now and in the future represent an important contribution to Point Reyes’ superlative natural and cultural resources.’’ I couldn’t agree more. Finally, we have been careful in this bill not to micromanage or tie the hands of the Park Service. As we made clear in amendments at markup and in the committee report, the Service retains the ability to exercise commonsense discretion in the supervision of the seashore’s agriculture property and in administering its various permits and leases. For example, the Park Service is not financially responsible for operating ranches and dairies. It is not required to bring back property into agriculture if it has been retired or converted to other purposes. It doesn’t have to allow ranching on agricultural property where there is no willing lessee. Nothing in this bill diminishes any of the Secretary’s existing discretionary authority regarding how to manage agricultural property, including setting and enforcing permit terms and conditions and allowing shorter lease or permit terms if a rancher does not want a 20year lease or permit. All of this is common sense. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6687 is a narrowly tailored bill to help ensure that sustainable ranches and dairies continue as part of the fabric of our spectacular Point Reyes National Seashore for generations to come. The bill does this without compromising any environmental standards. It is consistent with both longstanding congressional intent, with Secretary Salazar’s 2012 policy directive, and with the current National Park Service planning process. I am proud that this bill has been a refreshing bipartisan effort here in Congress, and I do want to thank my colleagues on the Natural Resources Committee for their support and assistance, especially Chairman ROBBISHOP  and his staff, as well as Ranking Member RAU´LGRIJALVA and his staff, who have worked diligently to perfect this legislation and to move it forward. I also want to thank my staff, especially my district director, Jenny Callaway, as well as Logan Ferree and Christine Sur from my legislative team, for their hard work to make this bill possible. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I ask for adoption of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6687, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ‘‘A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to manage the Point Reyes National Seashore in the State of California consistently with Congress’ longstanding intent to continue to authorize working dairies and ranches on agricultural property as part of the seashore’s unique historic, cultural, scenic and natural values, and for other purposes.’’. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
FDR HISTORIC PRESERVATION ACT Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 5420) to authorize the acquisition of land for addition to the Home of Franklin D. Roosevelt National Historic Site in the State of New York, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 5420 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘FDR Historic Preservation Act’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK ) and the gentleman from California (Mr. HUFFMAN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK ). 
Mr. M CCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5420, by Congressman FASOof New York, would allow 89 acres to be added to the historic site that was Franklin Roosevelt’s lifelong home and birthplace in Hyde Park, New York, which was designated as a National Historic Site in 1944. The land is currently owned by the Scenic Hudson Land Trust, and they would like to deed it to the National Park Service. The addition would provide important context for visitors and better connectivity to the Hyde Park Trail that links the FDR National Historic Site to the Vanderbilt Mansion National Historic Site to the north. The addition would not require any outlay of Federal funds. The transfer would be by donation, exchange, or purchase, using donated funds only. I would like to commend Congressman FASOfor sponsorship of this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I agree with the gentleman’s description of this very good bill. These two sites draw nearly 200,000 visitors to the Dutchess County region. They are significant contributors to the local economy. It is only fitting that we should work to improve the integration between these two sites and enhance their management and increase their accessibility to the public. I know Representative FASO has worked hard on this bill and that it is a priority for his office. I want to commend him for working across the aisle, including with Senator GILLIBRAND ’s support, and I congratulate him on this success today. Before wrapping up, I do want to mention that the money to carry out the expansion proposed in this bill will likely come from the Land and Water Conservation Fund, a popular program that expires at the end of this week. That is right. After more than 50 years of bipartisan support, LWCF is once again on the brink of expiring. This is despite the fact that a bill to make the program permanent has earned the support of 235 Members of the House. The bill was voted out of the committee by voice, and all this body must do is bring it up on the floor for a vote. I am always happy to support legislation that protects our public lands and cultural legacies, like this bill by Mr. FASO. I urge immediate action, however, on the other step we need to take, and that is bringing forward the bill to address the pending expiration of the LWCF. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I would simply like to remind the ranking member that the transfer of this land would be by donation, exchange, or purchase, using donated funds only. No Federal funds are involved from the LWCF or anywhere else. Mr. Speaker, I ask for adoption of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5420, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn. 
MODIFYING APPLICATION OF TEMPORARY LIMITED APPOINTMENT REGULATIONS TO THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 6599) to modify the application of temporary limited appointment regulations to the National Park Service, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 6599 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. APPLICATION OF TEMPORARY LIMITED APPOINTMENT REGULATIONS TO THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE. 
The modification authority provided by section 1 and any such modification shall expire on the date that is one year after the date of enactment of this Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK ) and the gentleman from California (Mr. HUFFMAN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK ). 
Mr. M CCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, recently, the Office of Personnel Management questioned how the National Park Service rehired temporary seasonal employees. The NPS did not agree with OPM’s interpretation of the relevant regulation but, nonetheless, complied. OPM’s directive caused confusion for Park Service hiring managers and threatened the ability of parks to open and operate as normal this past summer. Additionally, many temporary seasonal employees were unexpectedly left without a job. H.R. 6599 addresses this issue and allows the Park Service to continue its longstanding practices in hiring its essential seasonal employees for 1 year while Congress acts to address the issue systemically. Congressman STEVE KNIGHT of California has brought us this measure, and I would like to commend him for his leadership on the issue. Americans across the country are going to benefit from this work. I would like to thank him for his cooperation, allowing this to go forward. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the balance of my time. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON NATURAL RESOURCES , Washington, DC, September 24, 2018. Hon. TREYGOWDY , Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Washington, DC. DEARMR. CHAIRMAN : On September 5, 2018, the Committee on Natural Resources ordered favorably reported H.R. 6599, to modify the application of temporary limited appointment regulations to the National Park Service, and for other purposes. While this bill was not originally referred to the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I believe your Committee has a valid jurisdictional interest in the measure. I ask that you not seek a sequential referral of the bill so that it may be considered by the House of Representatives this week. This action in no way affects your jurisdiction over the subject matter of the bill, and it will not serve as precedent for future referrals. In addition, should a conference on the bill be necessary, I would support your request to have the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform represented on the conference committee. Finally, I would be pleased to include this letter and your response in the bill report and in the Congressional Record. Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to further opportunities to work with you this Congress. Sincerely, ROBBISHOP , Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT AND GOVERNMENT REFORM , Washington, DC, September 24, 2018. Hon. ROBBISHOP , Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN : Thank you for your letter concerning H.R. 6599, a bill to modify the application of temporary limited appointment regulations to the National Park Service, and for other purposes. As a result of your having consulted with me concerning the bill, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform will not seek a sequential referral and agrees to forego formal action on the bill. The Committee takes this action with our mutual understanding that by foregoing a request for a sequential referral of H.R. 6599 at this time we do not waive any jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this or similar legislation. I appreciate your agreement to support appointment of members of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform as conferees in any HouseSenate conference on this or related legislation. In addition, I request the Committee be consulted and involved as the bill or similar legislation moves forward so we may address any remaining issues within our jurisdiction. Finally, I would ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the bill report filed by the Committee on Natural Resources, as well as in the Congressional Record during floor consideration, to memorialize our understanding. Sincerely, TREYGOWDY . 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, it is correct; this decision created a lot of confusion and frustration. Staff needs at national parks fluctuate throughout the year. They are highly seasonally dependent, and many career personnel work at different parks through the year, a lifestyle that is supported by the ability to return to a position every year without having to recompete for it. Without that certainty, they lose job security, and it becomes extremely difficult to ensure adequate experienced staff throughout the National Park system. I agree with my colleague. I want to thank Representatives KNIGHT and P ANETTA for coming up with this bipartisan solution. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support its adoption, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I ask for adoption of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6599, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
EXTENDING AUTHORIZATION FOR CAPE COD NATIONAL SEASHORE ADVISORY COMMISSION Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 5585) to extend the authorization for the Cape Cod National Seashore Advisory Commission. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 5585 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK ) and the gentleman from California (Mr. HUFFMAN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK ). b2115 
Mr. M CCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5585 extends authorization of the Cape Cod National Seashore Advisory Commission until 2028. The commission provides valuable feedback to the Cape Cod National Seashore, which helps to promote sound park management, improve public access, and ensure that the National Park Service is a good neighbor to the surrounding communities. Mr. Speaker, I ask for adoption of the measure and am prepared to close when my colleague is finished. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. KEATING ), my colleague and champion of the Cape Cod National Seashore. Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, H.R. 5585, to reauthorize the Cape Cod National Seashore Advisory Commission for another decade. One of President John F. Kennedy’s first acts was to sign into law the bill that created the Cape Cod National Seashore, a bill which he himself had previously offered when he was a Senator from Massachusetts. This beautiful expanse of sand dunes, marshlands, highland woods, lakes, rivers, streams, and pristine coastal estuaries stretches from Chatham in the south to Provincetown in the north, and includes the six towns that form the Outer Cape and spans over 43,000 acres. Today, more than 4 million visitors from around the world come to my district every year to experience the natural beauty and recreational opportunities that the seashore offers. In this way, the seashore is crucial for the many local businesses that depend on the cape’s tourism industry for their livelihoods. Yet, even while hosting the millions of visitors each summer, the seashore continues to protect dozens of threatened endangered species, invests in important local science and education, expands cultural arts, and hosts numerous environmental endeavors. One of these projects, the Herring River Restoration Project, will be the largest salt marsh restoration project in New England history. It is important to note that, for many communities on the cape, the parklands make up more than 75 percent of their land area. That is why this regional board—the first of its kind in the National Park System—is so important. It links Federal partners in the National Park Service with their State and local partners to inform the public about park matters; to problem solve on numerous environmental, economic, and public infrastructure issues; and to promote open lines of communication with the National Park Service. Think about it. Six small communities and a large Federal agency drawing several million people into their towns each year, in solutions rather than conflict. Time and time again, this commission has proven itself to be an important forum for the communities that make up the Outer Cape to have productive discussions with their leadership on the Cape Cod National Seashore about issues that affect not only the seashore but the broader Outer Cape region as well. For 60 years, the relationship that the commission has provided between the National Seashore and its host communities represents the best of what a partnership with local entities and Federal officials can and should be. The track record of success that the Cape Cod National Seashore Advisory Commission has shown since its inception clearly demonstrates the need for it to continue its exemplary work for the challenges of the next decade. I would like to thank the chairman of the committee and the ranking member, my two colleagues from California, for their help in moving this bill forward. I urge my colleagues, all my colleagues, to join me in support of this legislation. Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I ask for adoption of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5585. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
FORT ONTARIO STUDY ACT Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the Speaker’s table the bill (H.R. 46) to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a special resource study of Fort Ontario in the State of New York, with a Senate amendment thereto, and concur in the Senate amendment. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the Senate amendment. The Clerk read as follows: Senate amendment:

There was no objection. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. URGING SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR TO RECOGNIZE CULTURAL SIGNIFICANCE OF RIB MOUNTAIN Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Natural Resources be discharged from further consideration of the resolution (H. Res. 418) urging the Secretary of the Interior to recognize the cultural significance of Rib Mountain by adding it to the National Register of Historic Places, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House. The Clerk read the title of the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to dispense with the reading. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. The amendment was agreed to. The resolution, as amended, was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
REQUESTING SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR TO RECOGNIZE THE RICH HISTORY OF THE LOGGING INDUSTRY Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Natural Resources be discharged from further consideration of the resolution (H. Res. 460) requesting the Secretary of the Interior to recognize the rich history of the logging industry and the importance of lumberjack sports by adding the Lumberjack Bowl to the National Register of Historic Places, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House. The Clerk read the title of the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. The text of the resolution is as follows: 
H. R ES. 460 Whereas the Lumberjack World Championships began in 1960 as a tribute to the rich history of the logging industry across the United States, and particularly in Wisconsin; Whereas the Lumberjack World Championships occur annually in Hayward, Wisconsin, the biggest small town in America, which is renowned for its history and beauty; Whereas the Lumberjack Bowl has hosted the Lumberjack World Championships for decades, thereby drawing economic activity in the Hayward area; Whereas hundreds of volunteers from Sawyer County work tirelessly to make the competition a world class event for thousands of spectators every July; Whereas this year’s competition will showcase over 100 athletes across 21 unique events that demonstrate the skills, abilities, and grit of the oldtime lumberjacks; Whereas lumberjack sports continue to increase in popularity, with loyal fans and competitors from across the globe; Whereas many universities across the United States have woodsmen or lumberjack teams that compete at the collegiate level; Whereas the Lumberjack Bowl was formerly a holding pond for the North Wisconsin Lumber Company; Whereas the North Wisconsin Lumber Company Office in Hayward, Wisconsin, was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 7, 1980; Whereas listing on the National Register of Historic Places drives tourism to communities and further denotes the cultural significance of a structure; and Whereas the Lumberjack Bowl still hosts all the events for the Lumberjack World Championships, including men’s and women’s logrolling, chopping, pole climbing, boom running, and sawing: Now, therefore, be it 
Mr. M CCLINTOCK. I have an amendment to the text at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the amendment. The Clerk read as follows: 
Page 2, line 1, strike ‘‘That the House of Representatives—’’ and all that follows through page 3, line 4, and insert the following: ‘‘That the House of Representatives requests that the Secretary of the Interior add the Lumberjack Bowl, the site of the Lumberjack World Championships, to the National Register of Historic Places.’’ 
Mr. M CCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to dispense with the reading. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. The amendment was agreed to. The resolution, as amended, was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
INNOVATIONS IN MENTORING, TRAINING, AND APPRENTICESHIPS ACT Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 5509) to direct the National Science Foundation to provide grants for research about STEM education approaches and the STEMrelated workforce, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 5509 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Innovations in Mentoring, Training, and Apprenticeships Act’’. 
No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this Act and the amendments made by this Act, and this Act and such amendments shall be carried out using amounts otherwise available for such purpose. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. SMITH) and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LIPINSKI ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. 
Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on H.R. 5509, the bill now under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5509, the Innovations in Mentoring, Training, and Apprenticeships Act, was introduced by Majority Leader KEVIN MCCARTHY and cosponsored by a number of Science, Space, and Technology Committee members and approved by the Science, Space, and Technology Committee. H.R. 5509 continues the bipartisan progress the Science Committee has made to expand and improve science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and computer science education programs to create new pathways to STEM careers. We can’t overstate the value of a strong STEM workforce in America. STEM workers drive innovation, manufacturing, scientific discovery, and productivity across the economy. According to the National Science Board’s most recent ‘‘Science and Engineering Indicators’’ report, the number of U.S. jobs that require STEM skills has grown by a third over the past decade. STEM workforce demand is forecast to increase steadily for years to come. Unfortunately, we know that nearly 40 percent of students who embark on a STEM major do not complete it, and only half of STEM graduates are employed in STEM jobs. We also know that apprenticeship and mentoring initiatives can improve the rate of STEM degree completion at both 4year universities and community colleges. America’s competitiveness in STEM fields requires a diverse and flexible workforce comprised of workers with educational backgrounds ranging from certificatelevel technical occupations to Ph.D.s. To this end, H.R. 5509 directs the National Science Foundation to fund initiatives that support innovative partnerships between academic institutions and local industries. The NSF will offer at least $5 million per year over the next 4 years in grants to community colleges to develop new STEM courses and degrees. These programs will combine formal education with onthejob work experiences, such as apprenticeships and internships, by partnering with local employers. Additionally, the pending legislation directs NSF to offer at least another $2.5 million per year for the next 4 years to 4year universities to partner with local industry and offer apprenticeships and other applied learning experiences for STEM undergraduate students. The bill also requires the National Science Foundation to award $2.5 million per year over the next 4 years for research grants to measure student outcomes and the effectiveness of computerbased and online courses for technical skills training. Leader MCCARTHY ’s legislation further directs the NSF to research the difference between skilled technical workforce development in the United States and in other developed countries. Lastly, H.R. 5509 requires the National Science Foundation to conduct research on labor market analysis innovations and America’s skilled technical workforce in order to improve our understanding of this workforce’s trends and needs. The innovative initiatives in this legislation will leverage the hard work and ingenuity of women and men of all ages, education levels, and backgrounds to meet the demand for a STEMcapable workforce. Much like the action the Trump administration has already taken to expand apprenticeships to help meet today’s rapidly changing economy, the Innovations in Mentoring, Training, and Apprenticeships Act takes significant steps to invest in new STEM education and workforce development programs. Such investments will ensure the United States remains competitive in the global economy both today and tomorrow. 
The majority leader’s bill will enhance America’s STEM competitiveness and contribute to our future economic prosperity, so there are many good reasons to support this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5509, the Innovations in Mentoring, Training, and Apprenticeships Act. I would like to thank Majority Leader MCCARTHY for introducing this bill. b2130 Building a workforce with skills in the STEM fields—science, technology, engineering, and math—which can meet the demands of our continually evolving economy is one of the most pressing challenges that we face today. Many companies are having difficulty recruiting and retaining workers with sufficient STEM skills for their needs. This STEM skills gap has existed for years and is continuing to widen. With companies across all economic sectors increasing their reliance on data, automation, and technology driven business models, the need for STEM workers has never been greater. Employers are increasingly concerned that their inability to hire employees with the technical skills they need will affect their capacity to innovate, increase production, and expand internationally. Make no mistake: America’s future economic prosperity is on the line. High schools, community colleges, and universities have been slow to respond, struggling to adapt their curriculum to keep pace with the rapidly evolving needs of industry. There is a need to innovate and encourage partnerships between educators in the private sector to better prepare the next generation of skilled technical workers. Apprenticeships have garnered significant attention in recent years because of the potential to bridge the STEM skills gap. Apprenticeships offer workers practical handson training, nationally recognized credentials, and the potential to earn credit towards an associate’s or bachelor’s degree. At the completion of an apprenticeship, most workers are on the path to a longterm, wellpaying career with little or no educationrelated debt. By investing in education and onthe job training for their workers, employers can develop a workforce equipped with a set of skills tailored to the specific needs of their businesses. Despite the benefits for employers and employees, apprenticeships remain underutilized in the United States when compared with other developed nations. President Obama first called for expanded access to apprenticeships in his 2014 State of the Union Address. In 2016, Congress appropriated funding for the Department of Labor in support of expanding entrepreneurships. H.R. 5509 builds on these efforts and ongoing activities at the National Science Foundation by providing support for the improvement of STEM degree programs and apprenticeship programs in partnership with universities and local employers. This legislation also supports research to find lessons learned from international approaches to skilled technical workforce development. Mr. Speaker, we must prepare a workforce that keeps pace with needs of industry if we are to reach our full economic potential and remain the global leaders in innovation. H.R. 5509 is a good step in that direction. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. LESKO ), who is an active member of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee and a member of both the Research and Technology and Environment Subcommittees. Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, first, I want to applaud the American Legislative Exchange Council members who are joining us tonight and their CEO, Lisa Nelson, and her staff. I thank them for attending. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5509, the Innovations in Mentoring, Training, and Apprenticeships Act. Presently, the American economy faces a shortage of 6 million skilled workers, a number expected to reach 11 million by 2022. This workforce shortage will only continue to grow unless we focus on training the next generation of skilled workers. In Arizona, we are seeing rapid growth in the science, technology, and engineering fields. Our aerospace industry is being strengthened by the creation of university partnerships like the ASU Research Enterprise and Aerospace Arizona. In order to support these growing industries, we must take action. This legislation is a step in that direction by providing grants for innovative approaches to STEM education and related workforce development. The bill expands the workforce pipeline in STEM fields through experiments with apprenticeships and other applied learning opportunities for college students and places a focus on the enhancement of 2year degree programs and technical skill certificates in order to meet the shortage of qualified candidates at all levels. I want to thank the majority leader for bringing this legislation forward, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. COMSTOCK ), who is a member of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee and is the chairwoman of the Research and Technology Subcommittee. Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman SMITH for yielding me the time. I rise in support of H.R. 5509, the Innovations in Mentoring, Training, and Apprenticeships Act. This bill takes important steps in addressing the growing need for a diverse and technically trained STEM workforce. Technological advances have transformed the workplace with almost 20 percent of all jobs in the U.S. economy requiring some level of STEM training. These jobs are expected to grow nearly 9 percent over the next decade, faster than any other employment category; and, of course, we know these are also higher paying jobs, and we want more women and a more diverse workforce here, also. Unfortunately, we also know that we have been failing to keep students in the STEM pipeline. Almost half of all students who start in a STEM major do not graduate with one. Of those who do graduate with a STEM degree, only half go on to a career in a STEM field. It is essential we address these challenges in order to ensure U.S. competitiveness in the global economy. In February, I chaired a Research and Technology Subcommittee hearing, which looked at innovative STEM education and workforce training models from across the country. These models demonstrated how apprenticeships, mentoring, and onthejob training are used to successfully bridge STEM skills gaps. I am happy to say that many of the lessons learned from that hearing are reflected in this bill, including the point that most successful programs are an integration of academia, technical training, and handson work experience. H.R. 5509 directs the National Science Foundation to competitively award grants to community colleges and 4year institutions to develop and improve STEM courses and degrees. These programs will combine formal education with applied learning experiences, such as apprenticeships and internships, by partnering with regional employers needing to fill skilled and technical STEM jobs. This bill also calls for NSF to competitively award grants to determine best practices and measure student outcomes of distance learning and simulated work environment courses for STEM education and technical skills training. Lastly, it directs the National Science Foundation to examine the development and sustainability of skilled technical workforces from across the U.S. and around the world, explore the feasibility of surveying the U.S. skilled technical workforce, and research and develop potential labor market analysis innovations. These programs and important research will help support and build the 
STEM pipeline and the STEM workforce that will drive American innovation in order to meet the challenges of the 21st century economy. I want to thank Leader MCCARTHY  for introducing this legislation and for the opportunity to cosponsor this. I also thank Chairman SMITH and Ranking Member JOHNSON for their great work in ushering this bill through the committee on a bipartisan basis. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I am a proud cosponsor of H.R. 5509 because it recognizes the great work under way in National Science Foundation’s Advanced Technological Education Program. This program works to promote the development of our STEM technical workforce and ensures that it continues to be prioritized going forward. As my colleagues are aware, I have two degrees in engineering. My wife also has a degree in math. This is part of the reason I am an ardent supporter of STEM education, especially education that is aligned with the requirements for indemand careers. One such program in my district is called the National Center for Systems Security and Information Assurance at Moraine Valley Community College. Since 2003, it has received Advanced Technological Education funding from NSF to be a national center of excellence in cybersecurity education. The college provides students with real world learning experiences and provides curriculum, instructional materials, and professional development for cybersecurity educators around the world. We all know that there is a massive nationwide need for cybersecurity professionals. According to the Department of Homeland Security’s National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education, there are currently over 301,000 open jobs in cybersecurity, including over 13,000 in the public sector. To make progress in meeting this need as well as the need in other STEM fields, we will need many more innovative education programs like the one at Moraine Valley and those promoted by H.R. 5509. This type of education benefits students, employers, our economy, and our national security, and it is worthy of this Chamber’s support. I thank Chairman SMITH and Ranking Member EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON for their work on this bill. I thank Chairman SMITH for his bipartisan work on the three bills that we are doing here tonight, and I am hopeful that perhaps there will be more to do before the end of this Congress. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, just briefly, I thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LIPINSKI ) for working with us so well on so many bills for almost 2 years. I think he has been as active on the legislation as any other member of the committee, and as he pointed out or suggested, most of the bills that we passed under the Science, Space, and Technology Committee’s jurisdiction are, in fact, bipartisan bills; and he has, as often as not, been an important player in the passage of those pieces of legislation. Mr. Speaker, there are no other requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. SMITH) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5509, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2018 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 6229) to authorize the programs of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 6229 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘National Institute of Standards and Technology Reauthorization Act of 2018’’. 
Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on H.R. 6229, the bill now under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Virginia? There was no objection. Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I take this opportunity to speak on behalf of my bill, H.R. 6229, the National Institute of Standards and Technology Reauthorization Act of 2018. NIST’s mission is to promote U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement science, standards, and technology in ways that enhance economic security and improve all Americans’ quality of life. Since its establishment in 1901, NIST has helped position U.S. technology at the leading edge, making contributions to innumerable products and services that rely in some way on technology, measurement, and standards. Such technology ranges from developing biometric standards for law enforcement or new materials for protective equipment of our Nation’s firefighters to atomic clocks and earthquakeresistant skyscrapers. This legislation authorizes NIST’s industrial technology services, construction activities, and bolsters the scientific and technical research and services lab activities for 2 years. NIST has the mission and capabilities to contribute to areas critical to the U.S. global competitiveness. To this end, this legislation authorizes increased investments in four emerging technology areas: quantum science, artificial intelligence and data science, advanced communications and the Internet of Things, and composites research and standards development. b2145 These investments will launch discoveries and technical advances that will significantly affect the Nation’s economy in the coming decades. As we have heard in our committee, the potential for artificial intelligence to help humans and further scientific discoveries is immense. By advancing our ability to store and process large and complex data sets through AI and machine learning, computers are able to refine and enhance future predictions. This advanced technology is already creating tremendous developments in many fields, including medicine, manufacturing, and finance. 
This legislation also directs NIST to capitalize on its deep and varied expertise in advanced composites. NIST is directed to connect research that will provide the evidence and data needed to set industry standards and design guidelines to encourage the safe adoption and application of composite materials in U.S. infrastructure projects. NIST plays a very important role in protecting the Nation from cyber threats through its ongoing cybersecurity research. NIST is examining the applications of blockchain technology, and creating voluntary frameworks and standards to help reduce cyber risks to Federal agencies, multiple industries, and critical infrastructure. Its cybersecurity technical standards and risk management frameworks are widely regarded as one of the best and most comprehensive in the world. I want to thank Ranking Member LIPINSKI for cosponsoring this important legislation with me. As the chairman has mentioned, he has been an essential partner with us in getting so many of our bipartisan bills put forward. I would also like to thank Chairman SMITH and Ranking Member J OHNSON  for assisting in ushering this bill through the Science, Space, and Technology Committee on a bipartisan basis. As industry’s national laboratory, NIST is dedicated to supporting research and technology development in the areas of national importance from communications technology and cybersecurity to advanced manufacturing and disaster resilience. This bill supports NIST’s critical work of helping U.S. industries and improving Americans’ quality of life by developing new measurement tools, providing authoritative data, and bringing stakeholders together to find solutions to ensure U.S. competitiveness in the 21st century economy. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.

COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE , SPACE , ANDTECHNOLOGY , Washington, DC, September 24, 2018. Hon. TREYGOWDY , Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN : I am writing concerning H.R. 6229, the ‘‘National Institute of Standards and Technology Reauthorization Act of 2018,’’ which was ordered reported by the Science Committee June 27, 2018. I agree that the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform has a valid jurisdictional interest in certain provisions of H.R. 6229, and that the Committee’s jurisdiction will not be adversely affected by your decision to forego consideration of H.R. 6229. As you have requested, I will support your request for an appropriate appointment of outside conferees from your Committee in the event of a HouseSenate conference on this or similar legislation should such a conference be convened. Finally, I will include a copy of your letter and this response in the Committee Report and in the Congressional Record during the floor consideration of this bill. Thank you again for your cooperation. Sincerely, LAMAR SMITH, Chairman. 
Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6229, the National Institute of Standards and Technology Reauthorization Act of 2018, and I thank Chairwoman COMSTOCK for sponsoring this bill. This is a bipartisan bill that provides support for NIST’s important work carrying out scientific and technical research, and assisting small and mediumsized U.S. manufacturers. The agency’s work helps to advance standards development in critical areas of innovation across all sectors of our economy. NIST’s core mission is to promote U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness. Through its laboratories and user facilities, NIST carries out worldclass measurement science and facilitates the development of standards for emerging technologies. Standards ensure users that promising technologies have been rigorously tested for safety, effectiveness, and reliability. NIST provides its services and expertise to other agencies, academic researchers, and the private sector. This bill provides funding to support NIST’s work in critical areas of national importance, including advanced communications, cybersecurity and privacy, the Internet of Things, quantum information science, and infrastructure resilience. The wireless demands of the 21st century require the advances in measurement science that NIST is carrying out. The devastating hurricanes and other natural disasters that have plagued our communities underscore the importance of NIST’s work in disaster resiliency and new infrastructure materials. In addition, this bill provides significant funding for NIST’s quantum information science and artificial intelligence research programs. Quantum technology has promising applications in healthcare, navigation, encryption, and many other areas. We are only beginning to explore the significant advances that artificial intelligence, or AI, may bring to the world. At the same time, there are significant policy implications for AI, and I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on issues dealing with ethics, workforce impacts, and the humanAI interface as these technologies move forward. Finally, with five Nobel Prizewinning scientists in its ranks, NIST continues to attract some of the Nation’s leading scientists. Even so, recruiting and retaining top talent is a challenge, and this bill provides flexibility to help NIST bring on and train the best and brightest measurement scientists in order to remain at the leading edge of emerging technologies. I am also happy to see the bill increases support for the labs program and funding for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership program. In the future, I hope my colleagues will support increases for necessary improvement to NIST’s aging lab infrastructure. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6229, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. SMITH), the chairman of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. COMSTOCK ), the chairwoman of the Research and Technology Subcommittee, for yielding me time to speak on her legislation. The bill, H.R. 6229, the National Institute of Standards and Technology Reauthorization Act of 2018, is an important bill that has been worked on both by Chairwoman COMSTOCK and the gentleman from Illinois, Subcommittee Ranking Member DANLIPINSKI , and I appreciate their taking the initiative on this legislation. This bipartisan bill was unanimously approved by the Science, Space, and Technology Committee in June. It authorizes NIST’s research and technology programs for 2 years. The NIST Reauthorization Act ensures that the research and development conducted by NIST keeps the United States on the cutting edge of global technological capabilities. NIST is one of the Nation’s oldest physical science laboratories. The technology, standards, and measurements provided by NIST support U.S. competitiveness in key industries, including manufacturing, nanomaterials, 
computing, communications, and cybersecurity. These have realworld applications. Through basic research, NIST sets standards and facilitates the implementation and use of technologies that impact the lives of our constituents every day. Examples include providing the precise official time for the United States that we see on our computers and smartphones, to the thresholds for the smoke detectors that protect our families and homes. For instance, NIST research and standards have improved the selfcontained breathing apparatuses worn by more than a million American firefighters. NIST also provides modeling techniques that allow scientists to develop and test cancer therapies using active viruses that cannot be studied using standard practices. And NIST’s Smart Grid work is improving the reliability and capability of our electric grid. These are just a handful of examples that illustrate why NIST’s scientific and technical research and services are critical to American innovation and industrial competitiveness. Chairwoman COMSTOCK ’s bill significantly increases NIST’s research to facilitate commercial use of emerging technologies. Specifically, this legislation increases the core NIST laboratories account by $125 million to transform more basic and early stage research into usable innovations and new technologies. It accelerates basic quantum information science research and standards development, and provides funds to address fundamental research gaps, enabling the U.S. to take the lead in developing quantum standards and measurements. Chairwoman COMSTOCK ’s bill allows NIST to expand its fundamental and applied cybersecurity research to address key questions relating to privacy, security, and vulnerability of software tools and communications networks. It expands the research infrastructure and scientific staff needed to develop the Institute’s capabilities in artificial intelligence and data science, including rigorous scientific testing to support the development of trustworthy AI systems. It further directs NIST to expand its composites research and standards development to facilitate the adoption of composite technology in American infrastructure. Finally, the legislation encourages NIST to continue to examine the Internet of Things and address measurement and security challenges created by the convergence of digital technologies with the physical world. By supporting this bill, Congress ensures continued U.S. innovation leadership in quantum science, artificial intelligence, big data science, cybersecurity, the Internet of Things, and resilient infrastructure. We can thank Chairwoman COMSTOCK  for her work on this legislation. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6229 and the critical work done by NIST. Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. LESKO ). Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6229, the National Institute of Standards and Technology Reauthorization Act of 2018. As a cosponsor of this legislation, I understand the importance of positioning the United States as a strong leader in scientific research and development. This bill supports basic quantum information science research and standards development, and provides funds to address fundamental research gaps, create a stronger workforce pipeline, and allow the United States to take the lead in developing global quantum standards and measures. This bill also supports developments in our national security. As cybersecurity threats from across the globe increase, it is important the Federal Government have the guidelines in place to defend against potential cyber attacks and protect our sensitive information against foreign adversaries. The bill also provides for the Institute to expand its fundamental and applied cybersecurity research to address key questions relating to measurement of privacy, security, and vulnerability of software tools and communications networks. I want to thank Representative COMSTOCK for introducing this legislation to push the United States forward, and for Chairman SMITH’s leadership in advancing the scientific position of the United States. Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, NIST’s expertise across many fields is critical to our economy, our research enterprise, and our manufacturing sector. This bill puts NIST in a strong position to carry out its work through the end of fiscal 2019. I want to particularly highlight the strong support for the Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership and the Manufacturing USA programs, which receive a robust authorization under the Industrial Technology Services account, and I want to thank my majority colleagues on the Science, Space, and Technology Committee for working with me to match the agency request for fiscal year 2019. I have a strong relationship with Manufacturing USA’s Digital Manufacturing and Design Innovation Institute located in Chicago, just outside my district. Through partnerships with universities, manufacturers, nonprofits, and government entities, they work to develop the technologyenabled manufacturing tools industry needs, pilot them on the factory floor, and train the manufacturing workforce. The digital manufacturing hub is just 1 of 14 Manufacturing USA institutes across the country, each with its own technology focus. Together, they are working to ensure that we have a competitive manufacturing sector in the U.S. into the future. Manufacturing USA and the Manufacturing Extension Partnership play a key role in keeping our economy strong and creating the jobs of tomorrow. Beyond manufacturing, I also want to highlight the critical position pay authority this bill gives NIST to hire talented cybersecurity and quantum information science professionals. b2200 It is often difficult for Federal agencies to attract toplevel talent in these fields, because the Federal pay scale cannot compete with the private sector. This bill grants a limited exemption to the Federal pay scale to ensure that NIST will have access to the right people to lead the Nation and the world in cybersecurity and quantum information science. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairwoman COMSTOCK again for introducing this bill. I want to urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank you again for the opportunity to speak on this important piece of legislation and to thank my colleagues and Ranking Member LIPINSKI for their support. Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. COMSTOCK ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6229, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY VETERANS’ HEALTH INITIATIVE ACT Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 6398) to authorize the Department of Energy to conduct collaborative research with the Department of Veterans Affairs in order to improve healthcare services for veterans in the United States, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 6398 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Department of Energy Veterans’ Health Initiative Act’’. 
No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this Act and the amendments made by this Act, and this Act and such amendments shall be carried out using amounts otherwise available for such purpose. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. NORMAN ) and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LIPINSKI ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from South Carolina. 
Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous materials on H.R. 6398, the bill now under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from South Carolina? There was no objection. Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, H.R. 6398, the Department of Energy Veterans’ Health Initiative Act. This legislation authorizes the Department of Energy, DOE, to conduct collaborative research with the Department of Veterans Affairs, the VA, in order to solve complex, big data challenges in order to improve veterans’ healthcare and basic research in advanced computing and data analytics. The VA hosts one of the world’s largest and most valuable health datasets. Through its voluntary data collection program entitled the Million Veterans Program, MVP, the VA has collected detailed health information and 
genomic data volunteered by over 600,000 veterans. In order to better use this data to provide better healthcare for our veterans, the VA needs more advanced computing capabilities, infrastructure, and expertise than it has inhouse. As a world leader in high performance computing, DOE is well suited to meet this need. In its national laboratory system, DOE possesses a unique set of cuttingedge research capabilities. It hosts six of the world’s top 10 fastest supercomputers, including the Summit computer in Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which is the world’s fastest supercomputer. DOE also funds robust research in computational sciences and data analytics, which can be used to solve a range of complex big data challenges in the physical sciences. The interagency partnership authorized in my bill combines the VA’s clinical and population science expertise with DOE’s big data science in advanced computing expertise in order to solve critical health challenges for our veterans while creating another path forward for the advancement of big data science tools for the American researchers. This partnership, called the Million Veterans ProgramComputational Health Analytics for Medical Precision to Improve Outcomes Now, or the MVPCHAMPION program, will use DOE supercomputers to analyze VA health data and look for patterns that will help inform and improve medical treatment for heart disease, traumatic brain injury, and cancer. Ultimately, the goal of this legislation is for the DOE national laboratories to provide the VA with information it can use to improve healthcare services for veterans. The bill also requires the Department to establish data storage facilities to securely transmit and store data that the VA provides. This will make certain that privacy and security are maintained for veterans who volunteer for the program. In addition, this legislation establishes a pilot program within DOE to create a crosscutting research initiative in artificial intelligence, data analytics, and computational research. This program will help American scientists stay on the cuttingedge as the computing landscape changes and international competition increases, and will promote the development of the computing tools needed to address big data challenges. These tools will both help improve the existing MVPCHAMPION partnership and will advance key DOE mission goals in nuclear security, energy technology, and innovative science research. Our veterans should have access to better healthcare services and our scientists should remain leaders in advanced computing. The Department of Energy Veterans’ Health Initiative Act promises to deliver on both fronts. Once again, I would like to thank Chairman SMITH and the 15 other Science, Space, and Technology Committee members who cosponsored this legislation for supporting my bill. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.

R OE, Chairman, Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN : Thank you for your letter regarding the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs jurisdictional interest in H.R. 6398, the ‘‘Department of Energy Veterans’ Health Initiative Act,’’ and your willingness to forego consideration of H.R. 6398 by your committee. I agree that the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs has a valid jurisdictional interest in certain provisions of H.R. 6398, and that the Committee’s jurisdiction will not be adversely affected by your decision to forego consideration of H.R. 6398. As you have requested, I will support your request for an appropriate appointment of outside conferees from your Committee in the event of a HouseSenate conference on this or similar legislation should such a conference be convened. Finally, I will include a copy of your letter and this response in the Committee Report and in the Congressional Record during the floor consideration of this bill. Thank you again for your cooperation. Sincerely, LAMAR SMITH, Chairman. 
Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6398, the Department of Energy Veterans’ Health Initiative Act, and I thank Mr. NORMAN for introducing this bill. This bill authorizes the Department of Energy to conduct collaborative research with the Department of Veterans Affairs to address large and complex data management challenges associated with veterans’ healthcare issues. H.R. 6398 also directs the DOE to carry out a 2year research pilot program to advance research in artificial intelligence and data analytics for a broad range of applications. These technologies have the potential to significantly improve the efficiency of the use and distribution of our Nation’s resources. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the majority and minority members of the Veterans’ Affairs Committee for working with the Science, Space, and Technology Committee to improve this legislation. Together, I believe we have ensured that this bill will be a positive step toward tackling some of the critical problems that the VA is currently facing in providing our veterans with the care they deserve when they come home. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. WEBER ), the chairman of the Energy Subcommittee. Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6398, the Department of Energy Veterans’ Health Initiative Act. The DOE and VA national research program, housed within the agencies’ Big Data Science Initiative, is called the Million Veterans ProgramComputational Health Analytics for Medical Precision to Improve Outcomes Now, or MVPCHAMPION. This initiative utilizes DOE’s unique capabilities in big data analytics, artificial intelligence, and advanced computing by providing VA researchers access to DOE’s research facilities and scientific expertise while the DOE receives access to a massive collection of data from the VA. Through the MVP program, VA patients volunteer genomic and healthcare data that is transferred into the secure enclave at Oak Ridge National Lab. Part of the data includes the deepest levels of DNA sequencing, which allows for high quality genomic research. With such a rich and expansive dataset, the VA MVP program provides an incredible opportunity to use DOE’S nextgeneration computing capabilities to solve complex healthcare challenges facing our veterans. For the DOE, this application of computer science tools could transform basic and earlystage research. DOE’s core mission areas are full of complex, big data challenges like physics, environmental systems, combustion, and nuclear weapons modeling. DOE is also working to enhance its expertise in biosciences and materials design. Experience working with big datasets and applications in data science, Mr. Speaker, has the potential to improve 
computational science methods for any big data problem. With the next generation of supercomputers, including the exascale computing systems DOE is expected to fill by 2021, DOE will be able to tackle even bigger challenges. Mr. Speaker, increasing computing power will expand DOE’s capabilities and improve the quality of computational tools for any big dataset or any complex problem. Ultimately, the goal of MVPCHAMPION is for the DOE national laboratories to provide the VA with useful information to improve healthcare services for our veterans. The access to the breadth, depth, and complexity of the VA dataset will also advance the next generation of data science tools. Mr. Speaker, it is clear that the DOE is the right partner for this important research. I want to encourage my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. SMITH), the chairman of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, first of all, let me thank the gentleman from South Carolina, Congressman RALPH NORMAN , for yielding me this time to speak in support of his bill, H.R. 6398, the Department of Energy Veterans’ Health Initiative Act. I also want to say, I appreciate his serving as vice chairman of the Environment Subcommittee on the Science, Space, and Technology Committee. This important legislation was approved unanimously by the Science, Space, and Technology Committee and is cosponsored by 15 members of the committee. H.R. 6398 authorizes the Department of Energy to conduct collaborative research with the Department of Veterans Affairs to address complex challenges in veterans’ healthcare by using advanced computational tools. Currently, DOE and the VA collaborate through the MVPCHAMPION initiative. The VA collects genomic and healthcare data from veterans who have volunteered for the program and then securely transfers it to DOE, where it is stored and analyzed in a secure site at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. This partnership and exchange of data benefits both DOE and the VA and provides valuable services to our veterans. DOE is the Nation’s largest Federal supporter of basic research in the physical sciences. It funds programs in applied mathematics and computer and computational science. Under this program, authorized by Mr. NORMAN ’s bill, VA researchers gain access to DOE’s high performance computing research facilities and significant resources, including DOE’s extensive expertise in data analysis and complex modeling. This could help the VA make discoveries about the causes and warning signs of various diseases. It will also speed up care for veterans’ critical medical needs and help the VA develop more effective treatments in the future. By giving DOE access to such a large database of information, the VA will help DOE researchers improve their ability to develop nextgeneration computing systems, algorithms, and models. These are capabilities that are critical to maintaining U.S. science and technology leadership. H.R. 6398 also authorizes a 2year research pilot program to advance basic research in artificial intelligence, data analytics, and computational science. This pilot program supports DOE’s efforts to improve the application of advanced data analysis techniques to big data challenges. Congressman NORMAN ’s DOE Veterans’ Health Initiative Act promotes improved healthcare for American servicemen and women. It facilitates more highyielding DOE collaborations, maximizes resources, and gives other Federal agencies, academia, and industry the opportunity to benefit from the Energy Department’s R&D expertise. We can thank Representatives RALPH  NORMAN and N EAL DUNN for championing collaboration and basic research to support our veterans and American innovation. b2215 I also want to thank Chairman ROE of the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee for his help and cooperation in bringing this bill before the House this evening. Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will support this bill. Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I am sure my colleagues on both sides of the aisle agree that supporting technology to improve the lives of our veterans should be a high priority. Unfortunately, many face an uphill battle to overcome the physical and mental toll of war once they return home. Those who sacrificed so much for our country deserve our best efforts to provide them with the latest technologies to improve their quality of life. There are almost 20 million veterans in our Nation today, and just under half are enrolled in the Department of Veterans Affairs healthcare system. The health records generated from decades of care provide a trove of information that may lead to more accurate diagnoses and treatment of certain conditions and diseases. Highperformance computing and machine learning can help analyze this massive amount of data to make it more useful for delivering better health outcomes, not only for veterans, but also the general population. The Federal Government has made strategic investments over the years to advance data analytics in data science research and development. We have also invested in supercomputing facilities at our national labs, including the Leadership Computing Facility at Argonne National Lab in my district. The programs created by this bill will take advantage of these resources to improve health, deliver a high quality of life, and lower treatment costs while advancing American leadership and artificial intelligence and data analytics. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Chairman SMITH, Representative D UNN, Representative HIGGINS , Representative LUCAS , Representative W EBER , Representative KNIGHT , Representative ROHRABACHER , Representative HULTGREN , Representative B ABIN, Representative COMSTOCK , Representative ABRAHAM , Representative B IGGS, Representative MARSHALL , Representative LESKO , Representative L IPINSKI , Representative ROSEN , Representative BILIRAKIS , Representative G ALLAGHER , Representative BILLJOHNSON , and Representative WALTER JONES for their continued leadership in providing support for our veterans and enabling critical science research. I would also like to thank the stakeholders and researchers who have provided valuable feedback as we develop this legislation. H.R. 6398 supports a program that will encourage innovation in basic science and big data research at DOE, and ensure that we as a Nation are doing everything we can to improve healthcare for our veterans. Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of this commonsense legislation and yield back the balance of my time. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, today we are considering three good bills from the Science Committee: H.R. 5509, the Innovation in Mentoring, Training, and Apprenticeships Act; H.R. 6229, the National Institute of Standards and Technology Reauthorization Act of 2018; and, H.R. 6398, the Department of Energy Veterans’ Health Initiative Act. I support each of these bills, and look forward to their passage. I want to thank Majority leader MCCARTHY  for introducing H.R. 5509, the Innovations in Mentoring, Training, and Apprenticeships Act. This legislation directs the National Science Foundation to support research to improve STEM degree programs and apprenticeships in partnership with the private sector. H.R. 5509 also supports labor market research to draw upon lessons learned in countries already benefitting from an emphasis on apprenticeships and skilledbased learning. This is a good bill that will help to bring the education and training our students receive more in line with the skills employers value most. This will benefit those preparing to enter an everchanging job market, employers seeking to innovate and increase production, and our economy as a whole. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this bill. H.R. 6229, the National Institute of Standards and Technology Reauthorization Act of 
2018, is a twoyear, bipartisan reauthorization of programs and activities for the National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST. I am glad to see that this bill increases funding levels for the agency’s laboratory programs and funds research and standards facilitation for important issues such as advanced communications, cybersecurity and privacy, internet of things, quantum information science, artificial intelligence research, and infrastructure resilience. I am glad to support this bill today, and furthermore, urge my colleagues to support increased funding in the future for crucial laboratory infrastructure enhancements on the NIST campuses. H.R. 6398, The Department of Energy Veterans’ Health Initiative Act, authorizes the Department of Energy (DOE) to conduct collaborative research with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in order to address complex, large data management challenges associated with veterans’ health care issues. Specifically, it aims to leverage DOE’s expertise in high performance computing in order to analyze VAprovided health and genomics data. This bill also directs DOE to carry out a two year research pilot program to advance research in artificial intelligence and data analytics for a broad range of potential applications. It provides the Secretary with the authority to establish user facilities capable of securely storing large data sets created by Federal agencies, academic institutions, or industry at DOE National Laboratories. I appreciate the need to utilize the entire resource base of the Federal government to address the needs of our veterans’ health care. This bill provides an important tool to try and make our veterans lives better, and I strongly support the bill’s passage. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. NORMAN ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6398, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
PRIVILEGED REPORT ON RESOLUTION OF INQUIRY TO THE PRESIDENT Ms. ROSLEHTINEN, from the Committee on Foreign Affairs, submitted an adverse privileged report (Rept. No. 115–978) on the resolution (H. Res. 1017) of inquiry requesting the President, and directing the Secretary of State, to transmit to the House of Representatives copies of all documents, records, communications, transcripts, summaries, notes, memoranda, and read aheads in their possession referring or relating to certain communications between President Donald Trump and President Vladimir Putin, which was referred to the House Calendar and ordered to be printed. HIZBALLAH INTERNATIONAL FINANCING PREVENTION AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2018 Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 1595) to amend the Hizballah International Financing Prevention Act of 2015 to impose additional sanctions with respect to Hizballah, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: S. 1595 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN ) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. ENGEL ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida. 
Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on this measure. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Florida? There was no objection. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, today, we will consider a HouseSenate agreement on additional measures targeting Hezbollah, Iran’s leading terrorist proxy, with tough new sanctions that we will impose with this bill. Last Congress, the Hizballah International Financing Prevention Act was signed into law. This legislation threatened to cut off any financial institution that knowingly facilitates significant transactions for Hezbollah from the U.S. financial system. That was a major step in the financial fight against Hezbollah. In the immediate aftermath of the law’s enactment, Hezbollah’s leader gave a public speech blasting U.S. sanctions as ‘‘unjust and false accusations.’’ Hezbollah also asserted that it ‘‘does not have any funds in any bank in the world . . . or in Lebanese banks and the central bank and the directors of banks must not panic.’’ Well, if a terrorist organization must publicly state that they are not panicking, then they are definitely panicking. And Hezbollah was panicking, Mr. Speaker, following the passage of this landmark legislation. Hezbollah reportedly had to cut salaries, defer payments to suppliers, and slash money stipends to allied parties. Facing increased financial pressure, Hezbollah has also lashed out most recently by bombing a Lebanese bank in an effort to intimidate the board members into noncompliance. But Hezbollah’s cowardly stance and its scare tactics have not worked. Lebanese banks have gone above and beyond the letter of the new U.S. law to proactively offload Hezbollahlinked bank accounts, forcing Hezbollah to look elsewhere for financial services. Yet, as time has progressed, Hezbollah has found temporary, albeit cumbersome, workarounds. It is time to send Hezbollah into a panic again, and this new legislation that we are considering tonight will do just that. First, the legislation mandates the application of sanctions against agencies of foreign states that provide weapons to Hezbollah—namely, Iran. Iran is the principal, external financial backer of Hezbollah, a fact that the leader of Hezbollah has openly admitted to for years. It is estimated that Iranian funding to Hezbollah exceeds $700 million per year. This is in addition to a rapid expansion in both the quantity and the quality of weapons provided to Hezbollah by Iran. In May, the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on the governor of the Central Bank of Iran and another senior bank official, accusing them of funneling millions of dollars to Hezbollah. But more can be done, and more must be done. This new legislation takes aim at Hezbollah’s enablers, both inside and outside of Lebanon. It mandates sanctions against any person or entity that engages in a transaction with anyone aiding Hezbollah’s fundraising or recruitment. This includes Hezbollah’s foreign relations department, its television station, and its companies that maintain Hezbollah’s social media accounts. This legislation also requires the administration to issue a report laying out the assets of senior Hezbollah members and associates. This should clearly be applicable to Hezbollah’s senior allies in the Lebanese Government. Hezbollah is constantly expanding and exploiting its extensive criminal networks from narcotics trafficking to human trafficking in order to escape sanctions and attack Western interests. So to address this new threat, this legislation also imposes transnational organized criminal organization sanctions on Hezbollah’s criminal networks, and it requires the administration to report to us in Congress on Hezbollah’s racketeering activities, which can serve as a basis for applying RICO penalties to Hezbollah. In sum, Mr. Speaker, this legislation is an important expansion of our efforts to take aim at Hezbollah, to take aim at its enablers, and to take aim at its state sponsor, Iran. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this effort to ensure that the United States continues to have the tools to respond to the threats caused by Hezbollah. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON FINANCIAL SERVICES , Washington, DC, September 7, 2018. Hon.

R OYCE , Chairman. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this measure. Let me first thank our chairman on the Foreign Affairs Committee, EDROYCE , who has done great work to get this bill to the finish line. I want to especially thank my dear friend and colleague, ILEANA ROS LEHTINEN , who was so instrumental in crafting this bill and then getting it passed, like so many other things she has done for so many years on the Foreign Affairs Committee. It has just been an honor and a pleasure to work with her, and we are going to miss her. But she has done some great work, and people’s lives will be saved because of the work that ILEANA ROSLEHTINEN  has done, so I want to thank her. I am also grateful to the Members of the other body who have helped push this measure forward. This bill is the product of a good, bipartisan effort aimed at a clear goal to isolate Hezbollah, one of the world’s most dangerous terrorist organizations. With hundreds of thousands of rockets pointed at Israel and fighters returning home, battlehardened from years fighting alongside the Assad regime in Syria, Hezbollah has become more sophisticated and more lethal. Hezbollah, with support from Iran, has served as a lifeline to Assad, allowing his regime to butcher the Syrian people. Without Hezbollah’s support, Assad would have been swept out of power years ago. When he was losing, Hezbollah came in. Iran unleashed Hezbollah, and they turned the tide in the war. Birds of a feather flock together, unfortunately, and Hezbollah has also gained from this relationship. The war in Syria bound Hezbollah and Russia together. The result was deeper coordination and training between the two. Russia talks a good game about fighting terrorism, but its partnership with Hezbollah has shown that Moscow is eager to collaborate with a group that has American blood on its hands. Now is the time to choke Hezbollah off from its patrons. This bill would give the administration every tool it needs to confront this dangerous group. With this measure, we build on a 2015 law by imposing sanctions on anyone who knowingly supports Hezbollah’s fundraising and recruitment efforts. As terrorist groups, including Hezbollah, rely more and more on online crowd sourcing and social media to spread their message, we need to be one step ahead. This bipartisan legislation also imposes sanctions on any part of a foreign government that supplies material support or arms to Hezbollah. b2230 That could include Russia and Iran for the training and assistance they provide to Hezbollah in Syria. This measure would also ramp up oversight on the administration’s strategies when it comes to diplomatic engagement to shut off Hezbollah’s networks and safe havens. This legislation is meant to signal to anyone who supports Hezbollah: Your time is up. Let me add a final note about Hezbollah as it concerns Lebanon. I have been a friend of Lebanon for many years. Back in 2003, I wrote the Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act with my friend Congresswoman ILEANA ROS LEHTINEN . We pressed Syria to get out of Lebanon and allow Lebanon to secure its own independence, free from Syria’s outside influence. Unfortunately, Hezbollah has, so far, endured as a fact of life in Lebanese politics. The Lebanese people deserve better. Hezbollah should stop holding the Lebanese people hostage to its radical agenda. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of our very bipartisan committee, the Foreign Affairs Committee, Chairman EDROYCE , as well as Matt Zweig on his staff—he will be embarrassed that I say that—and Ranking Member ELIOT ENGEL . I thank Mr. E NGEL for those wonderful words. I am going to miss working with him greatly. We have worked on so many important pieces of legislation together. And Mira Resnick and Edmund Rice on his staff, what a delight they have been. I thank them for their collaboration in developing this critical legislation. I am going to miss working with all of them. I also want to thank Senate Banking Chairman MIKE CRAPO and Ranking Member SHERROD BROWN , and John O’Hara and Colin McGinnis of their staff, for their hard work and commitment to achieving the strong, sound, bipartisan agreement that we have before us today. Finally, I thank my hometown Senator, Senator RUBIO, as well as Senator SHAHEEN , who have taken the lead on this effort on the other side. For 30 years, Mr. Speaker, Hezbollah has remained Iran’s proxy. Iran remains Hezbollah’s primary source of financial support. What a terrible relationship these two have had. This bill builds on our past efforts. It ramps up pressure on this dangerous terrorist group. It sanctions regimes, including Iran and Syria, because they are providing weapons to Hezbollah. It targets Hezbollah’s innovative fund raising and recruiting efforts, including its attempt to crowdsource small donations to support its fighters. And it recognizes that Hezbollah is more than a terrorist group; it is also a global criminal organization, an enterprise that profits from drug trafficking, money laundering, and counterfeiting. This bill gives the administration the tools to respond accordingly. We must employ a combination of law enforcement, financial, criminal, civil, and regulatory tools to deter, disrupt, and publicly illuminate the global illicit Hezbollah network. And we have to continue to work together to confront this threat. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, in closing, Hezbollah is a threat to peace and stability across the Middle East. This group is emerging from the Syrian civil war even more dangerous and determined to spread its hatred and violence. Their tactics have grown more sophisticated, and we need to give the administration every tool we can to crack down on this group. This bill is a strong move in that direction. It is a great example of what we can produce when we work 
across the aisle on national security issues. Let me say, I never hesitate to say how proud I am of the Foreign Affairs Committee and Chairman EDROYCE  and the leadership of the committee on both sides of the aisle for what we think as being the most bipartisan committee in Congress. It is important when we are talking about foreign policy that America speak with one voice, and it is important when we talk about foreign policy that politics stops at the water’s edge. This bill is a very important bill. It is a great example of what we can produce when we work across the aisle, and I am glad we are getting it across the finish line before we wrap up our work this month. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I echo Mr. ENGEL ’s remarks that, under the leadership of Chairman ROYCE and Ranking Member ENGEL , our Foreign Affairs Committee is one of the most bipartisan committees of the House. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 1595, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
HACK YOUR STATE DEPARTMENT ACT Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 5433) to require the Secretary of State to design and establish a Vulnerability Disclosure Process (VDP) to improve Department of State cybersecurity and a bug bounty program to identify and report vulnerabilities of internetfacing information technology of the Department of State, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 5433 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Hack Your State Department Act’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN ) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. ENGEL ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida. 
Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on this measure. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Florida? There was no objection. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, a massive breach of the State Department’s unclassified computer network in 2014 exposed grave weaknesses in its information technology systems. And in the years since that attack, problems have continued to mount. The Department’s cybersecurity response program received a D rating, the lowest of any agency, on its Federal Information Security Management Act report card in 2017. And just this month, the Department revealed that it recently suffered a breach of its unclassified email system, which exposed the personal information of some of its employees. Mr. Speaker, more must be done to ensure costeffective solutions to the Department’s information technology security challenges. The Hack Your State Department Act, authored by my Foreign Affairs Committee colleagues TEDLIEUand TEDYOHO, will help address cybersecurity gaps at the Department. This bill will crowdsource solutions and offer a layered approach to information technology security, consistent with the 2017 Report to the President on Federal IT Modernization. This bill achieves this in two ways: First, the bill establishes a vulnerability disclosure process to give security researchers clear guidelines for discovering and reporting cybersecurity vulnerabilities. This is considered a best practice in the private sector and, frankly, should be done in all government agencies. Second, this bill would establish a bounty pilot program at the Department to reward ethical hackers for discovering and reporting vulnerabilities. Numerous privatesector companies and the Department of Defense have used programs like this to improve their cyber defenses at minimal cost. The Department said that its Hack the Pentagon program ‘‘demonstrated the power of engaging the hacker community to help address cybersecurity challenges of the Department of Defense.’’ In its first pilot, hackers identified over 130 unique vulnerabilities, exceeding the Defense Department’s expectations so much that it announced plans to expand the program to all of its more than 700 websites. Both the vulnerability disclosure process and the bounty pilot program are designed to complement persistent network scans currently done by the Department of Homeland Security and other cybersecurity activities undertaken by the Department of State. As a national security Department, the State Department must do more to secure its networks. The Hack Your State Department Act is a small but important step to bring costeffective solutions commonly used in the private sector to bear in support of this goal. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative LIEUof southern California, a very valued member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, for his hard work on this bill. It is important, Mr. Speaker, that we modernize our agencies across government to better deal with 21st century challenges. The State Department is under constant threat of cyberattacks from foreign actors bent on stealing our secrets, disrupting our foreign policy, and undermining our security. Just 8 days ago, it was reported that the State Department’s email system was breached. This time, whoever was behind the attack got ahold of private information about State Department personnel. Who knows what they will get their hands on next time. Mr. LIEU’s bill will help shore up the State Department against this sort of intrusion. First of all, it requires the Secretary of State to get out ahead of this problem. Instead of waiting for the next attack to happen, this bill would mandate a plan for researchers to actively seek out and report vulnerabilities. Secondly, this bill launches a new initiative, a socalled bug bounty program. This seeks to tap the expertise of everyday Americans by rewarding citizens who uncover and report security risks in the Department’s computer system. It will also allow security researchers and friendly hackers to find the cracks in the system so that the Department can patch them. This effort is modeled after a very successful program at the Defense Department, which got off the ground in 2016. Since then, 1,400 people have registered to participate, and they have found roughly 140 vulnerabilities. Our Federal agencies should learn from one another. It is just common sense to put this tested practice to work at the State Department and elsewhere. Mr. Speaker, I commend Mr. LIEU. I am glad to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. TEDLIEU), the author of the bill. Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative ENGEL  for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my legislation, H.R. 5433, the Hack Your State Department Act, that I co authored with my friend, TEDYOHOof Florida. Over the years, the State Department has faced mounting cybersecurity threats from both criminal enterprises and statesponsored hackers. In 2014, for instance, the Department was infiltrated by Russian hackers and had to temporarily shut down its email system. Just last week, the State Department suffered another cybersecurity breach that exposed the personal information of a number of its employees. As an agency with a critical national security role, we must do more to protect the State Department’s cybersecurity. If there is any doubt that diplomatic cables cannot be sent to Washington securely or if sensitive diplomatic subjects are revealed, it jeopardizes the whole operation. As a recovering computer science major, I recognize that there are proven tools at our disposal to improve cybersecurity that the Department has yet to adopt. One such tool is to enlist the help of America’s top security researchers to find weaknesses in our cybersecurity. This legislation will bring that tool to the State Department after it has been proven successful in both the private sector, as well as at the Pentagon. My legislation will do two things. The first step of this bill is to establish what is called a vulnerability disclosure process, which sets clear rules of the road so that, when people outside the Department discover vulnerabilities on Department systems, they can report it in a safe, secure, and legal manner with the confidence that the Department will actually fix the problems. b2245 We cannot afford to allow vulnerabilities discovered in the wild remain known to hackers but unknown to the Department. This should be an easy fix. The second step is to actually pay vetted whitehat hackers to find vulnerabilities. The Department of Defense proved the success of their bug 
bounty program back in 2016. Over a 24 day period, the Pentagon learned of and fixed over 138 vulnerabilities in its systems. A 2017 report to the President on Federal IT modernization stated: ‘‘Agencies must take a layered approach to penetration testing....  A t  a  bare minimum, agencies should establish vulnerability disclosure policies....  Agencies should also identify programs that are appropriate to place under public bug bounty programs such as those run by the Department of Defense or GSA.’’ Today, with H.R. 5433, the House of Representatives is taking these recommendations to heart and helping to improve cybersecurity at the Department of State. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Representative YOHO for partnering with me on this important legislation. I would like to thank Chairman ROYCE , Ranking Member ENGEL , and their staff for moving this bill through our committee. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. I continue to reserve the balance of my time, Mr. Speaker. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close. In closing, I want to again thank Mr. LIEUand Chairman R OYCE . It seems to me, Mr. Speaker, that we have been caught flatfooted before a range of new threats, including cyber attacks. Our agencies have not done enough to root out vulnerabilities, and, frankly, Congress hasn’t done enough either to make sure our agencies across the government have the tools they need to tackle these challenges. I hope going forward we will be able to take a comprehensive look at cyber threats and make sure the State Department, and all our departments and agencies, are up to the task. For now, this bill is a good step in the right direction. It replicates an approach that has worked well over the last few years. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support it, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like to thank my colleagues—TEDLIEU, a hardworking member of our Foreign Affairs Committee, and TEDYOHO, chairman of the Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific—for crafting this bipartisan legislation. By unleashing the expertise of patriotic hackers, this bill will help the State Department identify and patch vulnerabilities on its computer systems. The Hack Your State Department Act takes an innovative approach to improving network security at a Department that is in such desperate need of new solutions and improved capabilities. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this bipartisan bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5433, the ‘‘Hack Your State Department Act’’. This act would direct the State Department to establish what is known in the cybersecurity community as a ‘bug bounty’ program. Bug bounty programs, also known as Vulnerability Disclosure Programs, are comprehensive efforts by an organization to lay out the method by which members of the public may report any security vulnerabilities to an entity. They also lay out which of their resources are covered by this policy, and how any identified vulnerabilities will be addressed. At a time when the computer networks of our government are under constant attack, and have suffered serious breaches in recent years, we must take action to ensure that the information of our citizens and the ability of federal agencies to carry out their duties are resilient. As a longtime advocate of a government that works efficiently for the people, it is clear that current information security practices of federal agencies, including the State Department, must evolve to keep pace with improved standards and policies. Without an honest effort to seek awareness of the security of the State Department network, users, and devices, we will continue to be increasingly vulnerable. To that end, H.R. 5433 recognizes the importance of a dynamic approach that will help secure federal networks and data, beginning with the State Department, as well as provide improved information on vulnerabilities and security practices across the various agencies. Without codifying this concrete measure to improve awareness of federal network security at the State Department, this important agency will remain vulnerable. We have seen an unfortunate loss of cybersecurity talent at the State Department this year. Further, even despite this, the White House has eliminated the position of Cybersecurity Coordinator from the National Security Council. This occurred even after Federal Risk Determination Reports found that communication of threat information within agencies is also inconsistent, with only 59 percent of agencies reporting a capability to share threat information to all employees within an enterprise so they have the knowledge necessary to block attacks. Federal agencies are not taking advantage of all available information such as threat intelligence, incident data, and network traffic flow to improve situational awareness regarding systems at risk and to prioritize investments. For this reason, earlier this Congress, I introduced H.R. 3202, the ‘‘Cyber Vulnerability Disclosure Reporting Act’’, which was passed by the full House and is now in the Senate. H.R. 3202 requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit a report on the policies and procedures developed for coordinating cyber vulnerability disclosures. The report will include an annex with information on instances in which cyber security vulnerability disclosure policies and procedures were used to disclose details on identified weaknesses in computing systems that or digital devices at risk. The report will provide information on the degree to which the information provided by DHS was used by industry and other stakeholders. I would also like to recognize the University of Houston, which has been recognized by the Department of Homeland Security and the National Security Agency as a Center of Academic Excellence for the programs in cybersecurity and cyber defense. In closing, Mr. Speaker, I urge all members to join me in voting to pass H.R. 5433, the ‘‘Hack Your State Department Act’’. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5433, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
HONORING WENDY GRANT (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, Wendy Grant was a south Florida philanthropist who dedicated her alltoo brief life to serving others. Hers was a legacy of service to our community. She was also a wellrespected aide to both Senator Connie Mack when he served here in D.C. and our Governor of Florida, Jeb Bush. Here is a picture of lovely Wendy Grant. It says: A life lived for the greater good. That was Wendy Grant. Wendy was also a zealous advocate for children through her work with the St. Jude Children’s Hospital, and she raised funds for its noble mission year after year. Anyone who knew Wendy loved Wendy. She was famous for her birthday emails recognizing each of her friend’s birthdays and updating us all on everyone’s lives. Remedios DiazOliver, Lilliam Machado, and I were about to bestow upon Wendy the title of Honorary Cuban American, because she loved our history and our traditions. We will present the certificate when we honor her life next week at her church for her service. Wendy Grant was a south Florida person to the hilt. She was warm; she was caring; and she was loyal. We will all miss Wendy Grant dearly. Godspeed, my friend. 
MOMENT OF SILENCE FOR DEPUTY ROBERT KUNZE (Mr. ESTES of Kansas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. ESTES of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life and service of Sedgwick County Sheriff’s Deputy Robert Kunze III. 
On September 16, Deputy Kunze responded to a suspicious character call in a rural area of Sedgwick County. When he arrived, the suspect opened fire, and Deputy Kunze was shot in the neck. The suspect could have fled or killed two witnesses standing close by. But in one final heroic act, before collapsing, Deputy Kunze returned fire, killing the suspect on the spot. The suspect was a convicted felon who had stolen two vehicles and the weapon he was carrying. By killing the suspect, Deputy Kunze ended a violent crime spree and gave up his life to save others. Described as a jokester with a contagious laugh, Deputy Kunze leaves behind his wife, Kathleen, and their young daughter, Alyssa. At his funeral on Friday, Alyssa addressed the crowd with the words that rang across Kansas, saying: ‘‘My dad was a hero. . . . He protected everyone.’’ Today, we continue to pray for Deputy Kunze’s family, as well as Sheriff Jeff Easter and the Sedgwick County Sheriff’s Office. At this time, I ask our colleagues to join in a moment of silence to honor Deputy Robert Kunze. 
COMMANDER DOYLE LYNN (Mr. ROTHFUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the exemplary efforts of Bob Weismantle and the Vietnam Veterans of America Chapter 862 Honor Guard in their remembrance of Commander Doyle Lynn of Hopewell Township, Pennsylvania. Commander Lynn served our country as a U.S. Navy pilot. On May 27, 1965, while flying a combat mission in Vietnam, Commander Lynn’s plane was shot down by the enemy. Following this tragedy, Commander Lynn was deemed missing in action. Fiftythree years later, Bob Weismantle and fellow Vietnam veterans requested that Hopewell Township in Beaver County install a street sign to commemorate their missing comrade. Today, this honor was rightfully bestowed. The Commander Doyle Lynn street sign is proudly mounted on West Wade Street. The care and dedication shown by Bob and the Vietnam Veterans of America Chapter 862 for their missing brotherinarms speaks volumes to their character and the loyalty that our veterans have for one another. Mr. Speaker, I thank all our veterans for their selfless sacrifice defending our country. May God bless Commander Doyle Lynn. 
LEAVE OF ABSENCE By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to: Mr. ROKITA (at the request of Mr. MCCARTHY ) for the afternoon of September 26 and September 28 on account of personal reasons. Mr. DANNY K. D AVIS of Illinois (at the request of Ms. PELOSI ) for today.

PRAYER The PRESIDING OFFICER. Today’s opening prayer will be offered by Pastor Sam Steele of Chapel by the Sea from South Padre Island, TX. The guest Chaplain offered the following prayer: Good morning. Christ Jesus sent people out two by two. Let us pray. Eternal God, as our Senators gather—two from each State—they break down barriers that divide, create an environment of honest dialogue, and bring about positive compromise so that there is unity in our diversity and so our Nation is steadfast in the foundation of the people, by the people, and for the people. Loving God, we lift up to You our brothers and sisters touched by the weather across our land. May we reach out our hands of love and help. Comfort those who suffer, and strengthen those who serve.
