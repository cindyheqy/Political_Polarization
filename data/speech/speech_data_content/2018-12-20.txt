Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, millions of American families will be enjoying the bounty of our great Nation at this very special time of the year without realizing that their tax dollars are subsiding Saudi war crimes in Yemen. It is estimated that every 10 minutes, another Yemeni child dies from starvation, disease, or bombs made in America. President Trump has basically delegated his policy in this region to the Saudis, even after the murder and dismemberment of an American resident directly linked to the crown prince. That has not been enough to alter American policy. So today, once again, a number of us are calling directly and respectfully on Speaker PAULRYANto stop the blockade on behalf of President Trump and allow this House to vote—vote now—on what has already been approved by the United States Senate on a strong bipartisan basis, a resolution to withdraw U.S. support from the Saudi forces in the murderous war in Yemen. Let’s stop America’s role in the worst humanitarian disaster in the world today. 
FAREWELL (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, it is not easy to summarize 32 years in Congress, but I will try. Politics comes from the Greek word ‘‘polites,’’ meaning citizens, and they are the source of our country’s strength. What I remember most, what was especially meaningful, what made me feel fortunate were the colleagues I served with, the people I worked with, and the constituents we helped. To my colleagues, thank you for your public service. You didn’t have to leave families behind or spend extra hours every week in a car or on a plane, but you did it with a genuine desire to advance America’s worthy interests. To my staff members, past and present, in the D.C. and Texas offices and on the committees I chaired, thank you for your dedication and for advising me on legislation and votes and for assisting thousands of constituents. To my constituents, thank you for trusting me to represent you all these good years. It has been a wonderful honor. THE WALLS IN BAGHDAD HAVE COME DOWN (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, The Wall Street Journal last week reported that the ‘‘Baghdad Blast Walls Come Down.’’ It explained that ‘‘the Iraqi Government marked the first anniversary of the Islamic State’s defeat Monday by reopening parts of Baghdad’s Green Zone.’’ Iraqi forces, along with support from the U.S.led alliance, reclaimed the last of Islamic State territory last December. The article notes that ‘‘the changes at the Green Zone reflect declining violence across Iraq that is particularly tangible in Baghdad, and further states that: ‘‘Over 1,000 streets in Baghdad have been reopened during the past 2 years, with 70,000 segments of concrete blast wall removed. The number of civilians killed across Iraq by terrorism, violence, and armed conflict in November fell to its lowest level in 6 years, according to the United Nations.’’ As a grateful dad who has had two of my four military sons serve in Iraq, I am particularly happy for the Iraqi people. In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may we never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. f 
WREATHS ACROSS AMERICA IN PROSPECT PARK (Ms. WILD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. WILD. Mr. Speaker, this past weekend, volunteers across the country honored fallen servicemembers on National Wreaths Across America Day. While the focal point of this national day of remembrance is the laying of wreaths at Arlington National Cemetery, ceremonies also took place at local cemeteries across the country. I had the honor of participating in a wreathlaying ceremony in Prospect Park, Pennsylvania, a tiny borough no more than a mile square, in Delaware County. On a raw and rainy Saturday, 2 weeks before Christmas, nearly 50 community members turned out to lay wreaths upon veterans’ graves at an historic cemetery atop Prospect Hill. Among those honored was George Wood, a soldier who lost his life at Gettysburg on July 7, 1863. As we stood in the drizzle, listening to ‘‘Taps,’’ I thought about the many ways in which people served their communities. Obviously, those who serve in our Armed Forces commit to providing the ultimate service. But on that hilltop last weekend, there were so many others willing to spend the time to step up with their neighbors, honor the sacrifice of others, and bring a community together. I want to recognize Joyce Foresman Capuzzi, the nurse who learned about the Wreaths Across America program and brought her neighbors together to have it in Prospect Park. I want to recognize Reverend Chris Hensley Terrell, the pastor of Prospect Hill Baptist Church, which hosted the event. But the event wouldn’t have been the success that it was without the participation of other volunteers, the members of the Prospect Park Borough Council, the Prospect Park Volunteer Fire Department, and local veterans and their families. There was also great support from the local elementary school principal and students at Prospect Park Elementary, many of whom helped lay wreaths. I want to thank all these community members for allowing me to participate in their ceremony, and I thank them for their service. f 
SYRIA (Mr. HILL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise on the House floor to object to President Trump’s decision to withdraw all U.S. troops from Syria. I encourage the President to remember the poor decision of the Obama administration in 2011, when the United States announced its withdrawal from a ‘‘stable Iraq.’’ ISIS is not defeated and may have as many as 30,000 fighters remaining in Syria. Atrocities being committed by the brutal dictator, Assad, and his henchmen, including Russia and Iran, will now continue with impunity. This opens the door for Iran to consolidate gains. I am especially concerned with the tragic consequences this will have months and years down the road. The United States policy in Syria must ensure the lasting defeat of ISIS, roll back Iranian influence, and achieve a political solution to the crisis. I echo the late John McCain and his message from 2011, as it applies today. This decision is a ‘‘sad case of political expediency supplanting military necessity.’’ 
PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF SENATE AMENDMENT TO H.R. 88, SHILOH NATIONAL MILITARY PARK BOUNDARY ADJUSTMENT AND PARKER’S CROSSROADS BATTLEFIELD DESIGNATION ACT; PROVIDING FOR PROCEEDINGS DURING THE PERIOD FROM DECEMBER 24, 2018, THROUGH JANUARY 3, 2019 Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 1180 and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: 
H. R ES. 1180 Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in order to take from the 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. YODER ). The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 1 hour. b0915 Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. TORRES ), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, thank you and Merry Christmas. It is also Merry Christmastime to the American people, Mr. Speaker, as Congress moves to its final resolution for this term. Mr. Speaker, we can’t forget that there is important work that is still to be done. The American people sent us here to do work and expect us to do that. Today I lay before the House the Rules Committee Print 115–87, the text of the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 88. Now, that may sound pretty pro forma, just like a normal bill, but, Mr. Speaker, what is in here is not a normal bill. In fact, it is a compilation of things which we do every year that are called tax extenders because we have been unable, necessarily, to agree on them for a longer term. So, one year to the next year to the next year, we gather together before we leave, and we normally come to an agreement. We have done this virtually every year I have been in Congress. We say on a bipartisan basis and a bicameral basis: Let’s make sure that we take care of the things that have not been taken care of on a longer basis now. What might that mean, Mr. Speaker? Well, that means that we, as a body, need to be responsible and understand that during the year there have been a number of circumstances also that contributed to people needing tax help. Some of them are fires. Some of them are earthquakes. Some of them are the changing of the circumstances back home where we are trying to make sure that the Tax Code is updated in this tax year now so that if someone—for instance, if they are in a California wildfire—loses everything they have got, they know that Congress has passed laws that help them as they move forward to rebuild their home, to make decisions about their future. It could be, Mr. Speaker, that a lot of work that the gentlewoman from Kansas, who is a member of the Ways and Means Committee, one of your colleagues on that committee, had done to make sure that any whistleblower who saw something that was going wrong at work for taxrelated matters is protected. These are important issues. But they are also important because there are broader activities, and they deal with taxation that was put into the Affordable Care Act. It is called ObamaCare, but it is the Affordable Care Act from years back. What this Republican Congress has done is shielded, protected the American people from many of the devastating effects, notwithstanding that this Congress and the President, President Trump, signed the law that takes away the individual mandate—not the business mandate but the individual mandate. But, Mr. Speaker, there are still three hugely onerous provisions that still lag on from that piece of legislation. Embedded in that is something called the medical device tax. The medical device tax is a tax on the newest technology—not, Mr. Speaker, on the sale of that to where, okay, Uncle Sam wants a little bit more of that, but the onerous part is it is on the manufacture. And when you put a tax on the manufacturing piece, that means that that product is not produced in an effective, efficient way. That means that they are produced one at a time because, upon that manufacture, the tax has to be paid, not upon the sale. It is something we fought on, I thought on a bipartisan basis, but it seems like today it is simply partisan, simply only Republicans, really, when it comes down to it, who are for doing away with the medical device tax. There is something called the Cadillac tax. That is the Democratic Party’s and President Obama’s idea of you really shouldn’t have better healthcare than somebody else, and if you do, we are going to tax that asset. It is at the heart of the Affordable Care Act. This Cadillac tax has been, every single year, deferred, stopped, agreed to. We are not going to apply that Cadillac tax, because it is on people, many of them who work for unions, people who have earned the right to have the healthcare that they have but the Democratic Party wants to tax it. Lastly, the healthcare tax. And that is a tax on every single person that has a healthcare policy. It is about $70. That means that every single American is going to pay an extra tax because they have healthcare. These are things that the Republican Party had worked on, and we thought we were, on a bipartisan basis, going to take care of these issues. We find out, really, today, that is not true. But I think we found out around election time the real effort for the Democratic Party. It is called H.R. 676, Medicare for All. Mr. Speaker, to those of us who have looked at the bill, section 102 lays out every single piece part of healthcare that you could think of, from an audiologist, to a dentist, to a person who may provide massage therapy. Section 104 in that bill outlaws all private health insurance in America if a piece part that was in section 102 is provided or paid for by a health insurer. It outlaws all private insurance. What does that also mean? That means employerprovided insurance under H.R. 676, section 104. So, Mr. Speaker, sometimes you have got to read to the end of the book or watch the end of the movie to see exactly what the plot and the theme is. Mr. Speaker, we have, for the last 8 years, been going down a pathway of thinking that what we were doing was really bipartisan, that our colleagues on the Democratic Party were really opposed to the Cadillac tax because they consented and agreed to it, voted for it, that the medical device tax was something that they understood would cause great harm and increase prices and deny people to get the best technology. We thought they were going along with this. We thought they understood how important it was not to tax medical devices, the latest technology that saves lives. And we thought that they understood that the healthcare tax of $70 on every single health insurance plan in this country was probably a bad idea after we already had the Affordable Care Act signed into law. I find out now I was wrong. I was wrong, and I think the American people were fooled. The medical device tax, the Cadillac tax, and the healthcare tax are in this package, along with the ability to help the people in California and on the West Coast and other people who were a part of natural disasters, people who are seeking help where they are finding an employer doing something wrong, to give them that needed opportunity to protect themselves, a safe harbor. So much is being done in here at the end of the year, but that is not the 
story that was told at the Rules Committee. The story that was told is: Oh, this is just about the top 1 percent. This is just about a special deal. Mr. Speaker, that is a long way from, not just the facts of the case, but the truth. So I am here, as chairman of the Rules Committee, bringing to the floor an opportunity to, once again, do as we have done in the past to say the healthcare tax, the medical device tax, the Cadillac tax—we are asking my colleagues to join with us. It is a very genuine offer. It is an offer that has been extended and accepted for the past few years, since the Affordable Care Act passed. It is the right thing to do. So I will ask each of the Members of this body to pay attention, to see what is in there, help the people who have been a part of natural disasters this year. Let’s get this package done. It is the right thing to do. And I can sincerely look at you, Mr. Speaker, and say thank you. Thank you for your years of service, but thank you for making sure that we were faithful to the end. Even though it is starting to look a lot like Christmas, we still have to do our work. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding me the customary 30 minutes. Mr. Speaker, this rule represents many of the failures of the 115th Congress. To put it succinctly, the legislation before us is a bill which has absolutely no chance of passing into law and a bill that will add billions—billions—of dollars to our national debt. I guess this is a Merry Christmas to those who hold our national debt, but this is not what our constituents sent us to do here. They sent us here to work together and find compromise in order to make our communities, their lives, better. This rule makes in order the Senate amendment to H.R. 88, Shiloh National Military Park Boundary Adjustment and Parker’s Crossroads Battlefield Designation Act. But it is more accurate to say this is the GOP’s second tax scam. Instead of taking this opportunity to use our remaining time here to actually accomplish something, our vote today on this rule will prove to be meaningless. The Senate is leaving town and has left us just a few items that we can accomplish, and this isn’t one of them. However, one item that is ready for passage is Savanna’s Act. Mr. Speaker, Native American women face a murder rate 10 times higher than the national average, with 84 percent experiencing some form of violence in their lifetime. The Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 and the Tribal Law and Order Act have helped bring attention to the high rates of violence against Native women. However, there is still no reliable way of knowing how many Native women go missing each year because the databases that hold statistics of these cases are extremely outdated and in need of reform. Congress hasn’t paid attention to the lives of Native American women. That is why I joined Senator HEITKAMP in introducing Savanna’s Act earlier this year, named after Savanna Greywind, a pregnant, 22yearold North Dakota woman and member of the Spirit Lake Nation, who was murdered in 2017. Savanna’s Act would require the Department of Justice to finally keep a nationwide database of missing and murdered Native women. This is common sense. It passed the Senate unanimously last month. b0930 One Member—one Member of this body—has decided to prevent us from passing Savanna’s Act, and the rest have capitulated, one Member standing in the way of finally doing the right thing for Native women, American women, women who are victims of crime. Shameful, and shame on this body for allowing this and not taking this last week of the 115th Congress to finally bring about some justice to these cases. Now, one thing that this body, the 115th Congress, has been really good for in the face of tragedy has been moments of silence, and that is why, today, I want to take some time that we have left to have a moment of silence. Mr. Speaker, I would like my colleagues to join me in a moment of silence for Savanna. Mr. Speaker, instead of taking action on Savanna’s Act, we are asked to vote on this rule to pass a tax bill which has been crafted in secret and has no chance of becoming law, when we could be doing something for justice, for truth, for victims of crime. This is the 115th Congress. Good riddance. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the argument that we are involved in today is whether we are going to, as this body, on a bipartisan, bicameral basis, understand that it is about hundreds of billions of dollars. It is about hundreds of billions of dollars that the American people have been spared from. Mr. Speaker, we are not undertaxed. We spend too much money. But that is not what this is about. What this is about is control. This is about the control that some in this body want over people’s lives. This is not about whether we are going to arbitrarily cause the Federal Government to be in trouble over a Cadillac tax, a medical device tax, a healthcare tax and blame that on greedy people back home who, by virtue of them wanting to have healthcare and robust healthcare and better healthcare but somebody in Washington does not want them to have it and blames them on being greedy for what might be billions of dollars when you add up everybody across the country; this is about control. This is about controlling people’s lives. And, Mr. Speaker, I will once again say it. I had thought, during these years, we came to an agreement that the Cadillac tax, the medical device tax, the healthcare tax, things that happened during the year, whether they be tornadoes, whether they be wildfires, whether they be other circumstances, would still be able to be reached on a bipartisan, bicameral basis. After all, President Obama signed these into law. After all, the American people understood that their gift for being gracious and working and doing the right thing shouldn’t be an onerous tax. After all, many people who live, as an example, in Minnesota could look up and see where their two Democratic Senators fought hard to make sure this medical device tax that was the lynchpin for tens of thousands of jobs in medical innovation, that we could get together and work together. Now we find out, no, that is wrong. That is wrong. What we want is we want that $180 billion. We want that. You can’t have that, and we are going to tax you because we can, because we can control your life and the outcome of your healthcare; because, actually, those who have great healthcare, yours is greedy, so we are going to tax it. So, Mr. Speaker, that is why the Republican Party in the House of Representatives is here today, as stalwarts of not just the middle class of this country but stalwarts of people who understand people get up and go to work—yes, the union worker, too. That union worker will find out, loud and clear, the party that was for taxing their healthcare, their working healthcare. The people in these States, where medical devices are robust and made America at the top of the world, they will understand. And the people, who are average families like those in Dallas, Texas, which I proudly represent, they will understand somebody was for taxing them further and somebody tried to continue what we have done now for years and not tax them on their healthcare. So it is about control, and I am sure we will find out, as the new year comes around, about H.R. 676, Medicare for All, that will outlaw all employerprovided private healthcare in this country. That is what the bill says. It is very plain. Section 104 gets right to it. That is what this is about. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Speaker, does the gentleman from Texas have any more speakers? Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I do not. Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, it is just about time to finish up here and return home for the holidays, time to see our loved ones and give them a hug. But for Savanna’s family and the countless other Native American families destroyed because of this violence, there will be no return home for them, and we will have failed these families by not passing Savanna’s Act today. Instead, we are here because of a wall—not the wall that you are assuming, not talking about our southern wall. I am talking about the wall of debt, a massive wall of debt that this Republican Congress has built, trillions—trillions—of dollars of debt towering over our children and grandchildren’s future. This rule will build it even higher. That is why I urge my colleagues to oppose the previous question and the rule. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the distinguished gentlewoman from California, not only her comments and her ideas— I know they are well represented by the Democratic Party. I would say to her that the people who vote against this bill will turn their back on the people who had the wildfires in California, the tornadoes in Georgia, the opportunities to help provide proper instructive help on their taxes this year as they enter next year. After all, it did happen this year. But perhaps, more than that, Mr. Speaker, we recognize now more about shifting the blame for 8 years and $9 trillion worth of spending. They called it investment. This Republican Congress, 1 year ago, almost to the day, passed a tax bill that has created the greatest economy in the history of this country. More revenue is coming in today than has ever come in in the history of the country. More people are working today because of that tax bill done 1 year ago. More people, more African Americans, more women, more families have an opportunity to enjoy the benefits of a job and the creation therein that they come home at night a little bit more satisfied, and their children, in the next generation, see work as a positive attribute, and communities are turning the corner. Mr. Speaker, gas is $1.82 in Dallas, Texas. What a far cry from when it was almost $5 at the same time in President Obama’s administration when the Democrats were running the place: the House, the Senate, and the Presidency. Oh, Mr. Speaker, we have not forgotten what a difference it makes, but the fingerpointing still continues. Mr. Speaker, let the R ECORD reflect, itself, that we have more revenue than ever coming in, more people working than ever, more opportunity for people, and part of that success has been because Republicans chose not to have a healthcare tax, a medical device tax, a Cadillac tax, choose not to make in order H.R. 676, Medicare for All, that would outlaw all employerprovided healthcare in this country. Mr. Speaker, the differences between our ideas really find themselves at the center point of what we do today. Last night in the Rules Committee, the distinguished gentleman from Lewisville, Texas, Dr. MICHAEL BURGESS, a retired physician who has delivered more than 3,000 babies, said that he had sat through, for years, these arguments at the Energy and Commerce Committee, and he lamented how the story really is not told about some 3 million people who now have jobs in this country, that a number of them that is undefined also got employer provided healthcare; and that while there may be 1 million out of that 3 million who went to a larger company, it is their families that benefited because there was maybe a spouse behind that and a child or two who had previously been without employerprovided healthcare. Now we are going to find out that Grinch showed up at Christmas, this rush to get out the door where we failed to secure the door, where we were so eager to get home rather than do our work. Mr. Speaker, I can’t imagine that somebody would just want to say, ‘‘It is okay; it is Christmastime; let’s get home,’’ and then stick coal in each of the stockings of the American people who have healthcare, stick coal in the stockings of the medical device employees and employers, stick coal into the stockings of the medical community for doctors who had been providing these leadingedge ideas in medical devices, stick coal in the stockings of the workers of America who might have great healthcare only to find out that somebody who had voted for it for years turned their back. So that is why we are here. Mr. Speaker, here is the bill right here, pretty easy to do. We have seen it a number of times. Nobody complained they didn’t have time to read the bill. They actually know what is in it this time. b0945 They actually know what they would not be supporting. They are going to put their vote and be on the line, and we are going to find out where people really are. So, Mr. Speaker, that is the debate, whether we are going to step up and do our job; whether we are willing to complete the task; whether we are willing to be consistent for the things that we have stood for; or whether we are willing to make excuses about, well, it is just Christmastime, and we have got to get home. Mr. Speaker, I want to say that my party believes that we should not have a white flag in our backpack, that we should not yield and just say, well, the timing was difficult. We should stand on our two feet, not beg on our knees. We should move forward and do our job for the American people, and that is what I am proud to say my party and myself and the Rules Committee stand for. We are men and women who can stay to get the job done, not want to get home and not have performed our duties. So that is the story. That is the story that we are going to tell. So I urge my colleagues to support this rule. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. The previous question was ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the resolution. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Oklahoma is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN ), my good friend, pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 
legislative days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Oklahoma? There was no objection. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, the resolution before us is a very simple one. It provides the House with the maximum flexibility to expeditiously move important legislation before the end of Congress. The resolution allows the House to suspend the rules to consider bipartisan pieces of legislation, including the Senatepassed criminal justice reform legislation, which we will consider later today. It also allows for the House to quickly consider measures to fund the government. As we are up against a deadline, it is important that we have the ability to quickly ensure that the government does not shut down. Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the rule and the underlying legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. (Mr. MCGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE), my good friend, for the customary 30 minutes. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Oklahoma made such a compelling argument for this rule—I can’t believe I am saying this—I am going to vote for this martial law rule. It is a shame that we are at this point, rushing to meet deadlines that have been staring us in the face for weeks and hurrying to finish up important legislative business in the waning days of this Congress. But we are where we are, and we need to be responsible. When it comes to something like funding the government, it is appropriate to use all the tools in our toolbox to keep the lights on. So, while I think rules granting sameday authority should be avoided whenever possible, times like this are why they exist. There is also suspension authority in this rule that would allow this House an opportunity to take up criminal justice reform, a bipartisan first step that our Republican President has already promised to sign. With so much work in front of us today, I am not going to waste time on process. I won’t belabor the President for his words and tweets, which made completing our business tougher than it needed to be. And I will even spare my friends in the majority further conversation about how I wish we weren’t, once again, standing on the brink of another shutdown. Consider it my gift to them for this holiday. This House needs to move quickly and responsibly. Everyone understands that, so I will simply say that I will be voting for this rule. I urge my colleagues to do the same, so we can finish our business and prevent another government shutdown. Mr. Speaker, I have nothing else to say, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend. I am going to certainly accept the gracious gift that he has offered me. I learned a long time ago, when you win an argument, you shut up and sit down. So I want to applaud my colleagues for their work. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. The previous question was ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the resolution. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed.

GRANTS TO NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS ’’ and in serting ‘‘
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOODLATTE ) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. NADLER ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia. 
Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on S. 756, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Virginia? There was no objection. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, today, in what may very well be my last floor statement as a Member of this esteemed body, I rise in strong support of the First Step Act. The bipartisan and bicameral bill before us is a meaningful and historic criminal justice reform measure. This is also an issue that I have dedicated much of my work to as chairman of the Judiciary Committee. Nearly 4 years ago, I and former Ranking Member Conyers created the Criminal Justice Reform Initiative at the Judiciary Committee to address the significant congressional interest in criminal justice reform from Members who do and do not serve on the Judiciary Committee. The purpose of the initiative was to develop bipartisan legislation to address several facets of the Federal criminal justice system, including overcriminalization, prison and reentry reform, sentencing reform, protecting citizens through improved criminal procedures and policing strategies, and civil asset forfeiture reform. In addressing these issues, the committee relied on the work of the Over 
Criminalization Task Force, which held nine hearings on a variety of criminal justice topics during the 113th Congress, as well as the information provided to the committee by interested Members during the committee’s listening session in June of 2015. The work of that initiative has already yielded tremendous results. For instance, the Rapid DNA Act is helping local police departments by allowing them to submit DNA records that are generated by Rapid DNA systems outside an accredited laboratory to be uploaded to NDIS. This is important, as it can confirm or exonerate a suspect in a matter of hours instead of days or even weeks. That bill was signed into law by President Trump last year. The Comprehensive Justice and Mental Health Act of 2015 promotes public safety and community health by facilitating collaboration among the criminal justice, juvenile justice, mental health treatment, and substance abuse systems to ensure those with mental illness receive the treatment and help they need. That bill became law as part of the 21st Century Cures Act. While those two laws are incredible steps forward, the measure we have before us today is the crown jewel of criminal justice reform. The First Step Act before us today couples front end and back end reform to our criminal justice system. Seven months ago, this body overwhelmingly passed the first iteration of the First Step Act. While it only contained backend prison reforms, it was a very real and very important ‘‘first step.’’ During consideration of that bill, many of my colleagues voted against the measure because it did not contain any frontend sentencing reforms. At the time, I noted that I support frontend reforms and, since then, worked with our colleagues in the Senate to ensure that they are included in the bill before us today. On the front end, this bill makes reasonable changes to Federal law to more appropriately tailor sentences for drug offenders. It does not eliminate mandatory minimums but reduces them for certain offenders. It takes a scalpel, not a sledge hammer, to the Federal sentencing scheme. Among other things, the bill reduces some of the harsher sentences for Federal drug offenders. It reduces the penalty for a third Federal drug offense from life imprisonment to not less than 25 years. This is a sensible change. We want to punish repeat offenders, but we do not want our Federal prisons to become nursing homes. Importantly, this bipartisan legislation backstops these sentencing reductions by ensuring violent offenders are eligible for sentencing enhancements under the drug statutes. Congress enacted these minimum sentences 30 years ago to protect our communities from violent offenders. The bill ensures they carry out that mission. On the back end, the First Step Act places a new focus on rehabilitation. The bill establishes a risk and needs assessment as the basis of an effective recidivism reduction program and, more importantly, an efficient and effective Federal prison sentence. The First Step Act will incentivize prisoners to participate in evidence based recidivism reduction programs, productive activities, and jobs that will actually reduce the risk of recidivism. Finally, this comprehensive package contains the reauthorization of the Second Chance Act, a provision sponsored by the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. SENSENBRENNER ). This measure authorizes funding for both public and private entities, including nonprofit organizations, to evaluate and improve academic and vocational education for offenders in prisons, jails, and juvenile facilities. Reentry is a vital component of criminal justice reform. Nearly every Federal prisoner will someday be released. We all have an interest in ensuring exinmates become productive members of society. I would be remiss if I did not point out the overwhelming bipartisan support from outside interest groups that the First Step Act has received. Numerous organizations on both the left and the right have enthusiastically endorsed this bill. Finally, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chief House champions of the First Step Act, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. COLLINS ), who, in January, will take the position of ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee. He, along with the new chairman, Mr. NADLER , I hope, will continue the request for more criminal justice reform. I also want to acknowledge the gentleman from New York (Mr. JEFFRIES ). They worked tirelessly to advance this legislation, and both Mr. COLLINS and Mr. J EFFRIES should be applauded for their bipartisan approach to this issue. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this historic legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 756, or the amendments thereto, the First Step Act, as passed by the Senate. This legislation has traveled a long journey to get to this point. Along the way, various aspects of the bill have changed. Although I do not agree with all of the changes, on balance, the measure has greatly improved, thanks to the hard work of many Members on both sides of the aisle from the House and the Senate. Before I get to the substance of the bill, I want to recognize some of the people most responsible for getting us here today. There are a number of champions of criminal justice reform in the Senate, but I particularly want to recognize and thank Senators DICK DURBIN and C HUCK GRASSLEY for their commitment to getting a bill that includes important sentencing reforms to the President’s desk. In the House, I want to thank my Judiciary Committee colleagues, HAKEEM  JEFFRIES and D OUG COLLINS , who worked together and with us to achieve a bipartisan compromise that is the foundation of this bill. I also thank the ranking member of the Crime Subcommittee, Representative SHEILA JACKSON LEE, who has helped hold this legislation to a high standard, knowing that so many are counting on us to address longstanding injustices. There are many others in the House who have fought for substantial reform for years, upon whose labors this bill was built, who deserve our thanks. Finally, let me recognize Judiciary Committee Chairman BOBGOODLATTE , who is retiring at the end of this term. He and I have not always seen eye to eye on a range of issues, including some aspects of this bill, but I appreciate his efforts as chairman over the past 6 years to work with my Democratic colleagues on the committee. Today, we join together in supporting an important, bipartisan bill. I thank him for his leadership in bringing us to the final stage of its consideration and for his service to Congress and to the country. As for the bill itself, S. 756 makes a number of reforms to our Federal sentencing laws. It also establishes a new system to provide incentives to some Federal prisoners to participate in programs that will reduce the risk that they will commit crimes once they are released. The prison reform provisions in this bill are similar to those in H.R. 5682, the Housepassed measure with the same name as this new bill. The bill before us today includes provisions intended to address concerns that I and many others raised about the fairness of the new recidivism reduction system for Federal prisons. For instance, this revised bill establishes an independent review committee of outside experts to assist the Justice Department in the development of the risk and needs assessment system that would determine the programming for inmates, their risk categories, and their eligibility for early entry into prerelease custody. Also, the bill expands the option for prerelease custody to include supervised release. Changes such as these, in addition to authorizing more funding for the expansion of programming to reduce the risk of recidivism by inmates, help make this new system more fair. In the other direction, however, I am disappointed the bill excludes additional categories of offenders from being able to earn early entry into prerelease custody, reducing the risk reduction incentives for those who perhaps need it the most. 
The prison reform provisions of this bill also include a number of very positive changes, such as banning shackling of pregnant and postpartum inmates, fixing the calculation of time off earned for good behavior, improving application of compassionate release, and providing other measures to improve the welfare of Federal inmates. In addition, the bill reauthorizes the Second Chance Act, a historically bipartisan effort to help exoffenders successfully reenter their communities after having served their time. Critically, this bill would not only implement these reforms to our prison system, but it also takes a crucial first step toward addressing grave concerns about our sentencing laws, which have for years fed a national crisis of mass incarceration. It was largely due to the absence of provisions changing our sentencing laws that some of us opposed the House version of this bill, but that exclusion has been remedied, and we now support this bill wholeheartedly. Among the sentencing reforms contained in this bill are expanding the existing safety valve to allow judges greater authority to sentence low level, nonviolent offenders below the mandatory minimum, applying the crack cocaine sentence reductions from the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 retroactively, reducing certain minimum sentences for recidivist offenders, and stopping the unfair ‘‘stacking’’ of mandatory sentencing enhancements for certain repeat firearms offenders. Although we must do far more to address the injustice of mandatory minimum sentences and other policies that lead to mass incarceration, these changes recognize the fundamental unfairness of a system that imposes lengthy imprisonment that is not based on the facts and circumstances of each offender and each case. This legislation is not the end of the discussion. As the title of the bill suggests, it is a first step. It will not solve longstanding problems with our criminal justice system—issues and injustices that will require more aggressive and comprehensive reforms in the future—but it does make substantial reforms, and it demonstrates that we can work together to make the system more fair in ways that will also reduce crime and victimization. Therefore, I support this bill, and I ask my colleagues to do the same. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time, and I ask unanimous consent that the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) be permitted to control the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. COLLINS ), and I ask unanimous consent that he be permitted to control the time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Virginia? There was no objection. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague, Chairman GOODLATTE , as he is leaving now to continue his quest, going out running to another hearing, but I want to thank Chairman GOODLATTE for all that he has done and everything that he has expressed not only for our committee, but also for this bill, and also for Mr. NADLER and his support coming forward in this. We appreciate the work they have done and what we are seeing today. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 756, the First Step Act. This is historic legislation that will make our communities safer, save taxpayer money, and start addressing the revolving door of incarceration and crime by helping formerly incarcerated prisoners get a second chance at life. I have said this so many times over the last couple of years. This is simply an M and M issue. This is about money and morals. This is about doing good with the taxpayer dollar and also giving people a chance, from a moral perspective, to have a second chance. b1115 The legislation we are considering today is the culmination of extensive work with our colleagues across the aisle and in the Senate. I can proudly say that this is a truly bipartisan, bicameral bill. I thank my friend and colleague HAKEEM JEFFRIES , who has been instrumental in this effort. We wouldn’t be here today without his commitment to improving not only the justice system but individual lives. He has been a partner in many things, and this is the culmination of a large step. I thank him for that. This bill is the result of compromise reached through extensive negotiations with the House, the Senate, and the White House, all of which want to address serious problems within our Federal criminal justice system. The Federal prison population has increased from less than 25,000 in 1980 to over 183,000 today. Each year, tens of thousands of Federal prisoners return to their communities after completing their sentences. In fact, Mr. Speaker, if you take State, Federal, and local individuals incarcerated, 95 percent of them, at some point, will come home. That is a question for each of us. That is a moral imperative on each of us, on how we are punishing and also how we are preparing them for reentry. Unfortunately, almost half of these individuals reoffend after release. This cycle of recidivism drains taxpayer dollars, strains the limited resources at the Department of Justice, and undermines community safety. First, this legislation will provide lowrisk inmates with the incentives and the resources they need to develop new skills and break their bad habits so that they emerge from prison as Americans ready to be productive members of society instead of repeat offenders. Secondly, the legislation includes carefully tailored sentencing reforms to address inherent disparities in our sentencing laws while keeping violent criminals from the incentives and benefits of the bill. Amending our sentencing laws requires care and balance, and I believe the negotiations over this bill have resulted in that balance. After many years of seeing how this has worked on the State level, through many studies and many evidencebased approaches, we are seeing this work. Finally, the legislation includes the Second Chance Reauthorization Act, authored by my friend and colleague Congressman SENSENBRENNER . This legislation will reauthorize and reform grant programs that have been crucial to States working to improve reentrance services and to increase public safety. This is also sort of special from my perspective as well, for in my home State of Georgia, Governor Nathan Deal, a former distinguished Member of this body, went home and began spearheading criminal justice reform legislation that has made Georgia safer while saving taxpayer dollars. States like Georgia, Texas, and South Carolina have shown us that you can reduce both crime rates and incarceration rates through evidencebased approaches and carefully tailored sentencing laws. The First Step Act, which is based on these States’ successful reforms, uses evidencebased approaches to drive down the recidivism rate among Federal prisoners. Also, Mr. Speaker, President Trump recently said this is an issue that unifies people, and it has unified a broad range of my colleagues in the Congress. Speaker RYANhas led on this issue for a long time, and today’s bill would not be possible without his work and the work of Chairman GOODLATTE , Congressman JEFFRIES , SHEILA JACKSON  LEE, our majority leader, and so many others. As we continued on, it also transcended the House and went into the Senate, where Chairman GRASSLEY and Senators CORNYN , PERDUE , LEE, DURBIN, and W HITEHOUSE have negotiated tirelessly, and many legislators have worked to reach this compromise. Yes, it is a compromise. It is something that we have worked on and studied and worked to find something that works for the American people. I would also like to thank Jared Kushner and the Office of American Innovation for all their work and support in this legislation. When he came to the table, he came to the table with a fullon passion to find results and to get solutions. For that, Jared has been invaluable in this process. Mr. Speaker, when I came to Washington, I came to legislate. I came to be a part of representing my district and my State and this country. I am 
proud that my colleagues and I were able to do so here with the First Step Act, a bill that gives prisoners a second chance and makes communities safer. Finally, there is a group out there that is pretty amazing, a group from both sides of the political spectrum: hundreds upon thousands of advocates across the country, adding their voices to the reform effort. Their commitment, focus, and drive helped us get to this point, and today, we have a chance to move forward with historic, meaningful legislation to improve lives, make communities safer, save taxpayer money, and make the judiciary system fairer. Mr. Speaker, as Members well know, none of us stand here without help from others. I am blessed in my office to have people who are dedicated to not only finding solutions but sticking with it. Jon Ferro in my office, who is my counsel, has worked on this tirelessly. In fact, Mr. Speaker, I am probably going to have to have some days built in for him to take off because he has not slept much in the last month. But he has tirelessly fought for this and worked with both the Senate and the White House to make sure this is an approach that will work and do what is intended. And Erica Barker in my office, who, even with the trials of going through her own law school experience, has been invaluable, along with the rest of my office and the rest of the folks that we named already. This is the time to pass something that makes sense, that has been studied, that is backed up by evidence. It is a thing that the Founders, I believe, had envisioned. We fight where we need to, but when we can find agreement, we find agreement for the American people. Again, Mr. Speaker, it is about ‘‘M and M’s.’’ It is about monies and morals, being smart on money and giving the people the chance that they need. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me indicate to the American people happy holidays and thank the gentleman from Georgia for his bipartisan reach to help us understand the impact of this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. JEFFRIES ), the incoming chair of the Democratic Caucus and the original cosponsor of this legislation. I thank him for his embrace of all of us as we worked our way through this legislation. Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentlewoman from Texas, SHEILA JACKSON LEE, for yielding and for her tremendous leadership on the criminal justice reform effort over the years. I also want to thank all of the members of the House Judiciary Committee, in particular, Chairman GOODLATTE , as well as J ERRY NADLER and, of course, CEDRIC RICHMOND and K AREN  BASS, who were phenomenal assets to this effort. Let me thank my good friend DOUG COLLINS , who has been a tremendous force of nature as it relates to making sure that this Congress did something about overcriminalization in America. From beginning, middle, and end, it has been an honor to work with Mr. COLLINS on a wide variety of things in this great body, in particular, on this effort to break the back of the prison industrial complex. I thank DOUGCOLLINS for his tremendous leadership. In 1971, President Nixon declared drug abuse public enemy number one. It was the beginning of the failed war on drugs. At that point in time, there were less than 350,000 people incarcerated in America. Today, there are 2.2 million. We incarcerate more people in the United States of America than any other country in the world. We have 5 percent of the world’s population and 25 percent of the world’s incarcerated individuals. It is a scandal. It is a stain on our democratic society. It is not a Democratic problem or a Republican problem; it is an American problem. Today, the House of Representatives comes together as Americans to begin to solve it—Democrats and Republicans, the left and the right, progressives and conservatives, the National Urban League and the Koch brothers, the House and the Senate, as well as the Trump administration—proving that good things can happen under the Capitol dome when we set aside partisan bickering to solve problems on behalf of the American people. And what a problem that we are endeavoring to solve with the First Step Act, making sure that currently incarcerated individuals, the victims of mass incarceration in this country, can successfully reenter society, transform themselves, become productive citizens; dramatically reduce recidivism; and save taxpayer dollars. That is what the First Step Act is all about. It will also strike a blow against the unfair sentencing laws that were put into place as a result of the failed war on drugs and provide some retroactive relief to those individuals sentenced unjustly as a result of the disparity between crack cocaine and powder cocaine. The First Step Act is a product of work that this body has decided to do out of recognition that we cannot allow overcriminalization to continue to persist in this country. Now, the mass incarceration epidemic has been with us for over 40 years. It will not take simply the waving of a singular legislative magic wand to eradicate, but it will require sustained effort, sustained commitment, sustained intensity, and a meaningful first step. That is what we are doing today. I urge all of my colleagues to support this effort to reform our criminal justice system in a manner consistent with the notion of liberty and justice for all. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT ). Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. One of the highlights of my being in Congress was getting a call from Ed Meese, asking if I would work with him on criminal justice reform. I was glad to do that. It was amazing, having the ACLU and Heritage working together and groups working together, but more of our focus was on requiring intent to be proven before you could lock up people, take away their freedom, things like the 5,000 or so Federal crimes that allow violations of regulations that no elected official has ever participated in to be the basis for somebody losing their freedom. Those were important. But that is not what this criminal justice reform bill is about. That is why some call it a jailbreak bill. Under the bill, there are some good things, improvements on rehabilitation. I am glad that TEDCRUZ’ amendment passed in the Senate, so that violent carjackers are not going to be allowed to have a chance to have their time cut. But there are 1,466 offenders relating to coercion, enticement of children into sex crimes, who will be eligible. There are 5,934 offenders relating to bank robbery involving violence or risk of death, and they will be eligible. There are others involving violence on officers, law enforcement officers. Look, on behalf of the sheriffs, the prosecutors, people like me—I was a State felony judge—we worked very hard to come together on a proper sentence. Plea agreements were made for a lesser sentence. The National Sheriffs’ Association says it ‘‘stands firmly opposed to this very dangerous bill.’’ Crime rates will go up within 2 years, if this bill passes, which apparently it will, but somebody needed to state what is coming when we do this. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, let me take the tone of Mr. GOODLATTE , Mr. C OLLINS , and Mr. JEFFRIES in saying that this is a momentous occasion. What I am grateful for, Mr. Speaker, is the faith community; the advocates who have been working with families for decades; mothers who welcome home sons and daughters; prisoners or exprisoners like those I met just a week ago at the Houston Reentry Program who indicated that they could not find a job; members of the Congressional Black Caucus; our present chair, Mr. RICHMOND ; and our chairelect, Ms. B ASS. People from all walks of life have recognized that this is not going to increase crime, but quite the opposite. Through our faith, we understand that humanity and the recognition of someone’s dignity helps them to be a contributing member of society. 
So I rise to support this bill that includes the First Step and the sentencing reform reduction act. I rise because so many people have worked over the years to ensure that this bill will work. It is important to note what we are overcoming. The ACLU said: ‘‘Over the past 4 to 5 decades, U.S. criminal justice policies have driven an increase in incarceration rates that is unprecedented in this country and unmatched elsewhere in the world. Our country has over 20 percent of the world’s incarcerated individuals, despite having less than 5 percent of the world’s population.’’ In 2015, it was estimated that 6.7 million persons were involved in the adult correctional systems, and almost 2.2 million were in prisons or jail, 180,000 in the Federal system, all costing us money and the value of those human beings that can serve their country. So I am grateful for the work that we came together on, that we overcame some of the challenges. I want to mention Mr. JOHN LEWIS, who is the conscience of this Congress, who worked with us to ensure that sentencing reform would be part of the ultimate bill. b1130 We acknowledge other members of the other body, Senator DURBIN , Senator GRASSLEY , Senator H ARRIS , and, of course, Senator BOOKER , among others. I thank Mr. GOODLATTE in his last bill for his commitment to moving criminal justice reform, even in the last Congress, and the new ranking member and soon to be chair, Mr. NADLER , who put all of his energies in ensuring that we could effectively move this bill. We worked with Senator DURBIN , and we worked with Senator GRASSLEY , who wanted to make sure that this was a wonderful partnership, the same kind of partnership that my good friend, Mr. JEFFRIES , spoke of, conservative viewpoints, religious viewpoints, and those advocacy groups who had fought for years against mandatory minimums. We have come a long way. Justice has to be equal, and it has to be fair. It has to be righteous and reasonable, and, in that, it has to have any number of those participating. Eric Holder, who worked on this issue, recognized that we had to have a partnership between these two fine elements: reduction, and, as well, the First Step Act, sentencing reduction. I know that this bill—and hope it will be signed, because the President indicated he wants the finest prison reform bill that we can have anywhere. Let me proclaim on the floor that we have made that giant step, but we have added the opportunity for almost 5,000 people to see their families, under supervision, by sentencing reduction— over 50,000 over a 10year period—not individuals who haven’t had the opportunity for training, for job training, for counseling, for opioid treatment, all matched together with the sentencing and prison reform bill. So we have elements like the safety valve and retroactive application of fair sentencing. To all of my friends in the advocacy community, you have been victorious, and I thank you. Reforms enhance mandatory minimum sentences for prior drug offenses, recognizing that the crack cocaine disparity was destructive in the work that we have tried to do—stacking. Let me also say that there was concern that there be no oversight over this bill. I am glad that they took my amendment before an Independent Review Committee so that the discretion of wardens and the DOJ are not random, but they, in fact, will have an independent outside committee to look at this matter. I am grateful that my friend, Mr. DANNY DAVIS, who has worked so hard, got his Second Chance Reauthorization in the bill, which is extremely important. I am so grateful, and you will hear from Congresswoman BASSfor her ongoing passionate concern about the treatment of pregnant women, and I look forward to working with her in the future. We have groups like the ACLU, The Brennan Group, the NAACP, and others who have worked hard on this type of legislation, and we are grateful for their continued insight and keeping us honest as we move forward. I want to acknowledge, if I could, the idea, again, that there will be those who will be preying upon us. In this season of caring and giving, I hope the Nation will be praying, praying for a better Nation, praying for the opportunity for people who went astray, and to recognize that what we have put in this bill are limits to ensure that these persons released will have the right kind of training and counseling, because we have increased the funding, we have worked with the groups that need to be worked with, and we have protected pregnant prisoners. And, finally, Mr. Speaker, something that I hope will grow in our compassion, that we have reformed an aspect of the criminal justice system as relates to juveniles, and, that is, that there is no more solitary confinement. I appreciate the sponsors accepting that from both myself and Senator BOOKER . It is a bill of compassion. It is not a bill of crime. It is a bill that America can be proud of. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. SENSENBRENNER ), who has provided such leadership on this issue and many others for this Congress. Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, Congress has spent years talking about reducing crime, enacting fair sentencing laws, and restoring lives. Today, we are putting our words into action, and this is historic. I am proud to have been a leader in this effort for over a decade: First, introducing the original Second Chance Act with the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. DANNY K. D AVIS), then serving as chairman of the Over Criminalization Task Force in 2013, and introducing a comprehensive criminal justice reform bill with the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT). This Congress, I sponsored the Second Chance Reauthorization Act, which helps prisoners rejoin their families and reenter society. I am happy to note that the First Step Act includes this reauthorization. The Second Chance Act was originally passed with bipartisan support and signed into law in 2008. This first ofitskind legislation authorized Federal grants for vital programs aimed at improving the reentry process and reducing recidivism. Grants have been used for a wide range of improved supervision practices and reentry programs, including employment assistance and job skills training, treatment for mental and substance abuse disorders, education, housing assistance, family services, and mentoring. Reauthorizing the Second Chance Act is an essential step to reducing our prison population and improving the overall criminal justice system. By providing the resources needed to coordinate reentry services and policies at the State and local levels, this legislation will ensure that the tax dollars spent on corrections do not simply fuel a revolving door in and out of prison. I urge my colleagues to support the First Step Act. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. BASS), the incoming chair of the Congressional Black Caucus and a member of the House Judiciary Committee. Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the First Step Act. For 40 years, our failure to adequately reform our criminal justice system has resulted in punitive mandatory minimum sentences and mass incarceration. African Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans have borne the brunt of this legacy. Between 1980 and 2014, there was a 700 percent increase in the number of women in custody. This was nearly twice the rate of male imprisonment. Women are often held for nonviolent, low level drug offenses. Unfortunately, these women are entering a malecentered penal system that is not designed to meet their physical or mental health needs. What is needed is criminal justice reform that understands that women in the system have unique needs. This is the first step toward addressing the needs of women. Improving the health outcomes of pregnant women who are in custody is in the First Step Act. My language would restrict the use of restraints on pregnant women, which increases the risk of complications during childbirth. Some of the stories shared by women who were restrained during pregnancy are horrific. One woman was shackled in labor and dislocated her hip. She experienced 
stomach muscle tears and an umbilical hernia. She was left with permanent deformities and pain. Another woman tripped over her shackles, fell to the ground, and miscarried at 20 weeks. The idea that a woman needs to be shackled at the end of her pregnancy or in labor and delivery as though she is going to escape while delivering a child is ridiculous, brutal, and, in my opinion, a human rights abuse. One mother recounted being shackled after having an emergency caesarean section. She stated: ‘‘With the weight [from the shackles] on my stomach, it felt like they were ripping open my C section.’’ Mr. Speaker, do we have no shame? This egregious abuse of human rights in Federal prisons must end. I hope Congress continues to address this issue. In the 116th Congress, we will continue to move the needle forward by developing comprehensive criminal justice reform that specifically looks at the needs of women in the system. I thank the Members who supported this legislation, and I thank Representative JEFFRIES , Representative S HEILA  JACKSON LEE, Representative C OLLINS , and Representative NADLER for introducing and passing the First Step Act. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. RICHMOND ), a gentleman who has become a friend on this issue, one that I remember sitting in Houston talking about this, and also to say, now it has become a reality. Mr. RICHMOND. Mr. Speaker, I commend Representative COLLINS for success on this very important issue. Oftentimes people ask what is required of us, and it is to do justice and love mercy, and that is exactly what the First Step Act does. Is it a perfect bill? No, it is not. Is it a first step? Yes, and it is a good first step. For too long, we have been passing the law of diminishing returns on our criminal justice system. Every dollar that we spend on incarceration actually makes our neighborhoods and our communities less safe. So does this bill address the strained relationships between police and the communities that they serve? Yes. Does it address the criminalization of poverty? No, and it leaves many unjust sentences in place. However, there is no doubt in my mind that this bill is a positive step in the right direction. It expands safety valve provisions that allow judges to block unfair sentences. It rolls back stacking rules that allow defendants to be charged with multiple crimes for a single incident. It prohibits the shackling of pregnant prisoners. It would also provide $75 million per year for programming to help prisoners prepare for life after incarceration, and it will also allow early release to some prisoners who participate. More than 4,000 prisoners will be eligible for release under this program. This bill also includes an amendment I introduced in the Judiciary Committee that will ensure that the prison reform provisions of the bill would apply retroactively to all prisoners sentenced after 1987. But what it does is it restores many of our family units and corrects the overcorrection we made during the crack epidemic in the early nineties. And, also, what it does is send a message to the country that we realized our mistake in how we handled crack cocaine and substance abuse. And now we see the opioid epidemic, and we are adjusting our approach to that: more loving, more substance abuse, more of a mental health crisis when we talk about it, and we are going to go back and do the same for the cocaine and crack addiction. So with that, let me thank all of the parties involved: Congressmen JEFFRIES , COLLINS , GOODLATTE , Ranking Member NADLER , SHEILA JACKSON  LEE, and other committee members for bringing this legislation to the floor. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I inform the gentlewoman that we are ready to close at this time, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, let me quickly move to my closing by really reemphasizing happy holidays to the American people and to thank our colleagues for recognizing the humanity of all individuals. Just in closing, imagine you are a mother, child, or loved one of an incarcerated person that was robbed by a system that played Russian roulette with his or her life, because that system decided they were criminals rather than victims of a public health crisis or of a bad start in life or a lack of resources as a child. This bill recognizes that people start life in many different ways, but they can be saved. They can be relevant. They can be with their families. So I am grateful for the amendments added, the protection of juveniles that will not be in solitary confinement, and I am grateful for the Independent Review Committee that indicates that there will be an oversight on how wardens issue the earned good time and how they are treating those who are incarcerated, an Independent Review Committee in the Institute for Justice. Finally, I would offer to say, we have money. And that money is at least a quarter of a billion dollars in terms of the amount of money that we will have over a period of time—some $250 million is the approximate amount, at least, in that figure that we have that will be invested in this particular bill. Finally, a bill that has been around for a very long time, the Second Chance Act, has a new lease on life, and that will be part of the bill, and we will continue to work with our colleagues going forward to emphasize the redemption of those who are trying to do right. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, as we close up this debate, this is one of those times when I really come to this well and understand and discuss from this podium that those things we do here matter. There are so many times we pass paper around this floor, we pass it and talk about bills in terms of line numbers and what it will do here, the code numbers, but at the end of the day, this is one that actually has faces behind the line. It has the faces of those who are currently incarcerated that now have a chance to have some programs so that when they do get out, they go home and are productive citizens. b1145 It has faces behind the lines of those right now who will be making mistakes, making bad choices even as we speak here on this floor, Mr. Speaker, but will have the opportunity to have a redemption in their life. We have heard opposition, and there have been some others who have opposition. It has even been said, ‘‘You are soft on crime; you are not helping law enforcement’’; although, we have folks like the International Association of Chiefs of Police, Fraternal Order of Police, National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, National District Attorneys Association, some that don’t want to come on, and I understand that. But I stand before you as a son of a Georgia State Trooper, someone who has been there when I watched my father go out and do his job when others didn’t want to, when I know that this bill will help in the long run not only helping with not only the redemptive part, but also making sure that when people come out, they are not committing more crimes. When we are saving money and helping people, we are helping law enforcement do their job when we understand this. I have also heard from others who have sort of dismissed the data from States that said that this is not something that is evidence based. It is working in conservative States. It is working in some liberal States, but it is working in places like Georgia and Texas and Oklahoma and Kentucky. This is where this works. Some said, ‘‘Well, we don’t need to do anything because we need to punish them.’’ Some are so looking backwards that all I will say to this is, Mr. Speaker, how is it working for us right now? Over 50 percent of these folks are recidivizing a short time after getting out of prison. These are folks going back in and committing more crimes. If we can do something to stop that, then this is something worth standing for; this is worth the time and the effort. When we come here today, we come here today to go back to the old principle that I said is about M and M, 
money and morals, and that is the best place to be, Mr. Speaker. I urge adoption of this act, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOODLATTE ) that the House suspend the rules and concur in the Senate amendment to the House amendment to the bill, S. 756. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
PANDEMIC AND ALLHAZARDS PREPAREDNESS AND ADVANCING INNOVATION ACT OF 2018 Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 7328) to reauthorize certain programs under the Public Health Service Act and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act with respect to public health security and allhazards preparedness and response, to clarify the regulatory framework with respect to certain nonprescription drugs that are marketed without an approved drug application, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 7328 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
Title XII (42 U.S.C. 300d et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following new part: ‘‘PART I—MILITARY AND CIVILIAN PARTNERSHIP FOR TRAUMA READINESS GRANT PROGRAM 
Part B of title III (42 U.S.C. 243 et seq.) is amended by inserting after section 319D the following: 
Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall issue final guidance regarding the ability of personnel funded by programs authorized under this Act (including the amendments made by this Act) to participate in drills and operational exercises related to allhazards medical and public health preparedness and response. Such drills and operational exercises may include activities that incorporate medical surge capacity planning, medical countermeasure distribution and administration, and preparing for and responding to identified threats for that region. Such personnel may include State, local, tribal, and territorial public health department or agency personnel funded under this Act (including the amendments made by this Act). The Secretary shall consult with the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Defense, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and other applicable Federal departments and agencies as necessary and appropriate in the development of such guidance. The Secretary shall make the guidance available on the internet website of the Department of Health and Human Services. TITLE IV—PRIORITIZING A THREAT BASED APPROACH 
Section 502 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 352) is amended by adding at the end the following: ‘‘(ee) If it is a nonprescription drug that is subject to section 505G, is not the subject of an application approved under section 505, and does not comply with the requirements under section 505G. ‘‘(ff) If it is a drug and it was manufactured, prepared, propagated, compounded, or processed in a facility for which fees have not been paid as required by section 744M.’’. 
Subchapter C of chapter VII of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 379f et seq.) is amended by inserting after part 9 the following: ‘‘PART 10—FEES RELATING TO OVERTHE COUNTER DRUGS 
have the meanings given such terms in section 505G. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS ) and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. ESHOO ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous materials in the RECORD on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. H.R. 7328 includes both the Pandemic and AllHazards Preparedness Act and the OvertheCounter Monograph reform language. Both of these bills have passed this House separately, and this today in front of us includes bipartisan, bicameral agreements on these programs. Passage of this bill is critical to our national security; and on this 100year anniversary of the Spanish flu, I can think of no more appropriate piece of legislation to be considering. I urge all Members to support the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7328. This is a good bill. I think it is an 
important one. It is the Overthe Counter Monograph Safety, Innovation, and Reform Act of 2018. Kind of a mouthful, but what it does is it streamlines how overthecounter drugs are regulated. This will enable the FDA, the Food and Drug Administration, to act faster to address safety issues associated with overthecounter drugs and bring innovative overthe counter drugs to market. The legislation will also establish a new user fee program to provide the FDA with reliable and stable funding to implement the reforms in this bill. These user fees are already in place with the pharmaceutical industry, with others. It works very well, and it allows hiring the necessary additional staff to oversee the overthecounter market. This updated legislation, very importantly, reflects that it is both bipartisan and bicameral, and I urge the entire House to support the bill. I also want to point out that, rolled into this bill, H.R. 7328, is what we call PAHPA, the Pandemic and AllHazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act. I am very proud to have authored this originally in a past Congress. But also my partner in this Congress has been Congresswoman SUSAN  BROOKS . I couldn’t ask for a finer partner. The legislation really reflects months of negotiations and compromise reached by both the House and the Senate, and the bill makes important updates to, as I said, the overthe counter monograph program. What we are considering in terms of this particular bill is an update, and it directs Federal agencies to respond to new and emerging threats and strengthens our Nation’s existing preparedness and response programs. This has a great deal to do with our national security, and that is why it is so important. The legislation not only reauthorizes critical programs to allow our country to be prepared to respond to naturally occurring and manmade disasters—and we know these threats are real—but it also meets the challenges that we face today and those that we anticipate facing in the future. I am very glad that this legislation was rolled into H.R. 7328, and I once again want to salute the work that Congresswoman SUSAN BROOKS did on this particular bill that is part of H.R. 7328. Mr. Speaker, I have two speakers on my side, but I will reserve the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from California has the only time remaining. The gentleman from Texas has yielded back the balance of his time. Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. DINGELL ), my friend and colleague. Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 7328, and I thank all of my colleagues for the very hard work that has gone into this. This important bill reauthorizes the Pandemics and AllHazards Preparedness Act, and it also gives the FDA revenue and authority to improve their oversight of the overthecounter drugs. Although the hour is late, I am very glad we are sending this bill to the Senate today, and I urge my colleagues to quickly pass this bill before the 115th Congress expires. I know we all want it to expire, but we can do some good things before it does. Today, 60 percent of all medicines sold in the U.S. are over the counter; yet the FDA has only 18 fulltime employees overseeing that entire market. That is not reflective of the way that our healthcare systems run, and it is putting patients at risk every single day. Our bill reforms the system for the better by creating a new user fee program to give the FDA resources it needs to improve public health, and it allows the agency to update OTC monographs by administrative order rather than the ineffective rulemaking process we have been watching. This will be a big win for patients, who will benefit from the improved safety of their products, as well as the industry, as they will have a reliable pathway to bring new, innovative products to market. We haven’t seen a new sunscreen on the market in more than a decade. I want to thank all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in the Energy and Commerce Committee for all of the time and the effort they put into this legislation. I especially want to thank Kim Trzeciak of the committee staff for all of her hard work. Let’s get this done before we go home for the holidays. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 7328. Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. DEGETTE ). Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Speaker, today we have an opportunity, as well as the wonderful items in this bill that Mrs. DINGELL talked about, to make long overdue reforms to the way that the Food and Drug Administration reviews overthecounter medicines. Nearly 7 in 10 parents report giving their children an OTC medicine to help treat a sudden medical symptom. Similarly, 81 percent of adults use OTC drugs as a first response to a minor ailment. Despite the widespread use of these medicines, though, the FDA is forced to use a cumbersome and archaic monograph pathway for review and approval. This antiquated, 40year review system does not keep pace with recent medical advances and the burgeoning of the OTC market, which now has over 300,000 drugs. As a result, the current monograph fails to respond to OTC safety issues in a timely and effective manner. During the 2 years between 2004 and 2005, the CDC reported 1,500 cases of children under the age of 2 visiting emergency rooms due to serious side effects of overthecounter drugs of cough and cold products. Since this finding, the FDA has been trying to revise the cough and cold monograph to warn parents about the risks that these common drugs can cause. But the FDA can’t do that because they are hamstrung due to the burdensome process it has to undergo to revise these monographs. This bill, H.R. 7328, which I worked on with my colleagues, Mr. LATTA , Mrs. DINGELL , Mr. G REEN , Mr. B URGESS, and Mr. G UTHRIE , is a rare triple win because it helps regulators, consumers, and industry: It modernizes an outdated FDA process; It ensures consumers get access to safe and effective overthecounter drugs; It provides industry with the certainty to innovate and develop cutting edge OTC products; and It gives the FDA the tools and resources to remove dangerous and ineffective products from the market. Let’s pass this bill right now, and let’s urge the Senate to get something done and pass this before the Congress ends. Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I don’t have any other speakers, but let me just close by saying I think that, between the chairman of our subcommittee and my two colleagues and their remarks—and mine included— that these are very good bills that are going to accomplish good things for the American people. So whether it is what was rolled into H.R. 7328—PAHPA and the underlying bill, the Overthe Counter Monograph Safety, Innovation, and Reform Act—I feel very confident that, with its passage, we will have accomplished something that is excellent for the American people. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7328, which includes the bill I authored, H.R. 5333, the OvertheCounter Monograph Safety, Innovation, and Reform Act. With more than 240 million Americans using OTC products every year, it is time to update and complete the outdated regulatory framework used for oversight of these medicines. This bill will modernize the broken monograph system, strengthen consumer protection, spur innovation, and increase consumer choice. Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of my bill—the Pandemic and AllHazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act of 2018 or PAHPA. I’m proud to have introduced this important bill with my good friend Representative ANNA ESHOO who was one of the original authors of the 2006 PAHPA bill and lead author of the last reauthorization in 2013. This bipartisan public health and national security effort will ensure our nation is better prepared to respond to natural disasters like hurricanes, emerging infectious diseases like 
Zika or Ebola, and chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear attacks whether from terrorist groups or from nation states. The threats we face are not hypothetical. Since August of this year, 315 people in the Democratic Republic of Congo have died from Ebola. The ongoing Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo is now the second largest outbreak in history. More than 530 cases have been reported with 18 new confirmed cases over the weekend. Thanks to PAHPA and the 21st Century Cures Act, we are more prepared for biological threats and attacks. In July, the FDA approved the first drug to treat smallpox— TPOXX. But, TPOXX is not the only recent approval at the FDA. On July 10th, the FDA approved an autoinjector which provides a onetime dose of an antidote to block effects of a nerve agent. This new antidote and TPOXX will help protect Americans from biological attacks. But, PAHPA is much more than just a biodefense bill. It also helps ensure a coordinated health care response to hurricanes. During the 2017 hurricane season, Hurricanes Florence, Harvey, Irma, Jose, and Maria killed hundreds of Americans and showed us that we need to do better to prioritize the needs of every person in our communities. The PAHPA bill we are considering today does that by prioritizing our nation’s most vulnerable populations—our children, senior citizens, and people with disabilities. It reauthorizes the advisory committee focused on the specific needs of children, and creates NEW advisory committees to ensure the needs of the elderly and people with disabilities are considered. The bill provides liability protections for doctors who volunteer after a medical disaster. In addition to these Good Samaritan provisions, the bill also ensures more health care professionals like nurses and doctors can be hired and trained when facing a public health crisis by strengthening the National Disaster Medical System, which provides grants to our regional health care network. It also ensures we have a robust supply of vaccines, basic equipment like gloves, hazmat suits, masks and more in our Strategic National Stockpiles located all across the country, so these professionals have the equipment they need. PAHPA ensures our preparedness and response capabilities will include a robust pipeline of medical countermeasures by reauthorizing and increasing funding for the BioShield Special Reserve Fund and BARDA—the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority. BARDA’s work over the last decade has resulted in FDA approvals for more than 42 different medical countermeasures. The development of medical countermeasures is a lengthy and often risky endeavor, which is why sending a clear signal that BARDA remains a strong and committed partner with academic institutions and the private sector in these efforts is so important. In September, we saw another example of the success of research funded by BARDA when the FDA approved ReCell—the first spray on skin product ever approved for use in the United States. This new treatment will help treat burn victims so that they can heal faster and with less risk of infection from painful skin grafts. By using a piece of a patient’s skin about the size of a credit card, a doctor can turn it into a single cell based solution that can be sprayed over the patient’s burns so that new skin can grow and replace the damaged and burnt skin. While the investments BARDA is making into innovative research and new treatments are critical, it is also important that we continue to address threats that have been around for years. It has been 100 years since the 1918 pandemic influenza killed millions of people around the globe including 675,000 in the United States. Some experts predict that we are due for another global pandemic influenza. To address that threat, the bill we are considering today authorizes $250 million for the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (the ASPR) to address threats like pandemic influenza. Specifically, the bill directs the ASPR to work to increase manufacturing capacity and stockpile medical countermeasures. While the PAHPA bill we are considering today authorizes funding for research into known threats like pandemic influenza it also maintains the flexibility that is the foundation of our medical countermeasure enterprise to deal with unknown threats for which we may have no defense today. The PAHPA reauthorization bill we are considering is the process of months of committee work in both the House and Senate. I cannot emphasize enough how critically important it is to reauthorize PAHPA this year, and I encourage the Senate to quickly take up and pass H.R. 7328. I would urge all Members to support this critical piece of legislation. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 7328. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
b1200 ASHANTI ALERT ACT OF 2018 Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and concur in the Senate amendment to the bill (H.R. 5075) to encourage, enhance, and integrate Ashanti Alert plans throughout the United States, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the Senate amendment is as follows: Senate amendment: 
Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the following: 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Ashanti Alert Act of 2018’’. 
‘‘There is authorized to be appropriated to the Attorney General $3,000,000 to carry out the Ashanti Alert communications network as authorized under this title for each of fiscal years 2019 through 2022.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky). Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. COLLINS ) and the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia. 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 5075, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia? There was no objection. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5075, the Ashanti Alert Act of 2018. This bill directs the Department of Justice to establish a national communications network, the Ashanti Alert Communications Network, to support the regional and local search efforts for missing adults. It fills the gap between the AMBER Alert and the Silver Alert. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Congressman SCOTT TAYLOR for championing this bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, this is H.R. 5075, the Ashanti Alert Act of 2018. I rise to support the Senate amendment to H.R. 5075, the Ashanti Alert Act of 2018. This bill seeks to establish a national communications network to help locate missing adults by providing assistance to State, Tribal, and local search efforts. This bill would initiate, facilitate, and promote Ashanti Alert plans in coordination with States, Indian Tribes, units of local government, law enforcement agencies, and other concerned entities with expertise in providing services to adults. I was pleased when we initially passed this bill last September, and I am even more pleased with the Senate amendment, and so I rise to support this legislation and indicate that as of December 31, 2017, the National Crime Information Center database included records of 55,968 missing adults. In fact, many adults go missing each year that are not found until it is too late. In particular, the young woman who the bill is named after, Ashanti Billie, was too old for the assistance of an AMBER Alert on her behalf and too young for a Silver Alert. Had these resources been available when Ashanti Billie was abducted, she may be here today. Mr. Speaker, I enthusiastically support this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of H.R. 5075, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. COLLINS) that the House suspend the rules and concur in the Senate amendment to the bill, H.R. 5075. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
CLEAN UP THE CODE ACT OF 2018 Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 7093) to eliminate unused sections of the United States Code, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 7093 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Clean Up the Code Act of 2018’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. COLLINS ) and the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia. 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials to H.R. 7093, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia? There was no objection. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, this bill is in part a response to the work of the current committee’s OverCriminalization Task Force. The Judiciary Committee created this task force to look at the growing problems of overcriminalization and overFederalization of criminal law. The bill before us adheres to these principles by eliminating several sections of the Federal Criminal Code that have either never been charged, criminalized conduct that should not land someone in Federal prison, such as unauthorized use of the Woodsy Owl image or slogan, or both. This is a sensible, goodgovernment measure, and I urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. Speaker, I would also like to thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT ) for his work on this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. Mr. Speaker, I join with the manager of the bill to support H.R. 7093, the Clean Up the Code Act, as a measure that takes a small step toward addressing the problem of overcriminalization as a result of the hard work of the OverCriminalization Task Force, of which we look forward to continuing in the next Congress. This bill repeals several criminal penalties for violations that do not involve serious wrongdoing, or at least not serious enough to warrant criminal prosecution and the consequences of a criminal record. For example, this bill repeals laws that make the unauthorized forprofit use of the Smoky the Bear and Woodsy Owl characters punishable by fine and/or imprisonment for up to 6 months. The conduct that these laws are designed to deter or punish certainly do not merit criminal sanctions. 
We are grateful for the Clean Up the Code Act, and I ask my colleagues to support H.R. 7093. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of H.R. 7093, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize and thank for their efforts Representative STEVE  CHABOT and Representative H ANKJOHNSONfor their work on this bill. I ask my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. COLLINS) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 7093. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
JUSTICE AGAINST CORRUPTION ON K STREET ACT OF 2018 Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 2896) to require disclosure by lobbyists of convictions for bribery, extortion, embezzlement, illegal kickbacks, tax evasion, fraud, conflicts of interest, making false statements, perjury, or money laundering. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 2896 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Justice Against Corruption on K Street Act of 2018’’ or the ‘‘JACK Act’’. 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on S. 2896, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia? There was no objection. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I support S. 2896, the JACK Act. This bill applies to the penalties for failure to disclose under the Lobbying Disclosure Act, failure to disclose State or Federal court convictions for the offences of bribery, extortion, embezzlement, fraud, and tax evasion. Mr. Speaker, I would urge all my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise as well in support of S. 2896, the Justice Against Corruption on K Street Act of 2018, also known as the JACK Act. The JACK Act would require lobbyists to publicly disclose any State or Federal convictions for certain crimes of character, such as bribery, extortion, embezzlement, illegal kickbacks, tax evasion, fraud, conflicts of interest, making false statements, perjury, or money laundering. As many of you have known, this bill impacts lobbyists and impacts individuals, such as Mr. Abramoff, who pleaded guilty to a number of counts in 2006. This is an important bill that was sponsored by Mr. COHEN , and I ask my colleagues to support this legislation, again, S. 2896, the Justice Against Corruption on K Street Act of 2018, the JACK Act. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of S. 2896, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. COLLINS) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 2896. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. f 
VICTIMS OF CHILD ABUSE REAUTHORIZATION ACT of 2018 Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 2961) to reauthorize subtitle A of the Victims of Child Abuse Act of 1990. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 2961 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Victims of Child Abuse Act Reauthorization Act of 2018’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. COLLINS ) and the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia. 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on S. 2961, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia? There was no objection. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, this legislation takes a number of positive steps to protect children; for example, it reauthorizes the appropriation of Federal grant funds until 2023 for the Department of Justice programs to prevent child abuse and assist victims of such crimes. In doing so, the bill also provides important liability protection for mandatory reporters such as, and including, pediatricians, educators, and law enforcement. This will protect these individuals from criminal and civil liability from not just reporting suspected child abuse, which they are mandated to do, but also for assisting with investigations of suspected child abuse. Mr. Speaker, as a father, I can think of no greater responsibility than protecting the most vulnerable among us, our children. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2961, the Victims of Child Abuse Act Reauthorization. This bill updates and reauthorizes this important law so that we can better prevent and address child abuse in our communities. This is very important legislation, just for the fact of the number of children that are abused. In my own community in Texas and in the city of Houston, we have had some atrocious cases; one just reported in our newspaper of a 5yearold under a stairwell, locked, lying flat on his back, weighing 70 pounds, with no food and water, abused by two parents, the stepchild of one of the parents. What a horrific and horrible life. The Administration for Children and Families reported that over 4.1 million referrals for 7.4 million children were made to Child Protective Services in the United States in 2016. Our Federal Government must provide resources to ensure that these cases are carefully, compassionately, and comprehensively addressed at the local level. This bill recognizes the sensitivity of these issues and helps integrate social services, mental and physical healthcare, and law enforcement. With the resources and legislative updates in this bill, child advocacy centers can extend their outreach to underserved communities and expand programs, such as offering longer term counseling. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Representatives POEand C OSTA here in the House and Senators BLUNT and C OONS  in the Senate for leadership on this issue. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, again I just want to emphasize it couldn’t be a better day for us, especially with the First Step Act and the things we are moving forward on criminal justice. I join the gentlewoman from Texas in saying this is a good bill, and I urge adoption. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD several letters dealing with S. 756: a letter from the ACLU; a letter from the Judicial Conference of the United States; and a letter from the Center for American Progress. 
THELEADERSHIP CONFERENCE , ACLU, Washington, DC, December 19, 2018. Re THE ACLU AND THE LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE URGE YOU TO SUPPORT 5.756, THE FIRST STEP Act. Hon. PAULD. R YAN, Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. NANCY PELOSI , Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARSPEAKER RYAN AND MINORITY LEADER  PELOSI : On behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, we write to urge you to vote YES on S. 756, the FIRST STEP Act. This legislation is a next step towards desperately needed federal criminal justice reform, but for all its benefits, much more needs to be done. The inclusion of concrete sentencing reforms in the new and improved Senate version of the FIRST STEP Act is a modest improvement, but many people will be left in prison to serve long draconian sentences because some provisions of the legislation are not retroactive. The revised FIRST STEP Act, however, is not without problems. The bill continues to exclude individuals from benefiting from some provisions based solely on their 
courtappointed counsel. We may be in touch with further observations or concerns after the Judicial Conference has studied this issue in detail. Relatedly, the Judicial Conference supports expanding judges’ authority to terminate supervised release for compassionately released inmates. Ongoing supervision of certain offenders, such as those in hospice care, may be wasteful of public resources. 
NOVEMBER 28, 2018. Hon. MITCH MCCONNELL , Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Hon. CHARLES E. G RASSLEY , Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Hon. CHARLES SCHUMER , Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Hon. DIANNE FEINSTEIN , Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. DEAR LEADER MCCONNELL , LEADER SCHUMER, CHAIRMAN GRASSLEY AND RANKING MEMBER FEINSTEIN : We, the International Community Corrections Association (ICCA) and National Criminal Justice Association (NCJA), add our voices to the many urging passage of the First Step Act before Congress adjourns for the year. The First Step Act of 2018 (S. 3649) is bipartisan, common sense legislation based on innovations adopted and tested in the states over many years. The bill would require the federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) to adopt a risk and needs assessment system to determine the recidivism risk of each prisoner as part of the intake process and to provide evidencebased recidivism reduction programming based on each individual’s criminogenic needs. Eligible inmates who successfully complete the recidivism reduction programming and/or other productive activities shall earn time credits allowing them to complete their sentences in a residential reentry center or in home confinement. Further, the bill would require BOP to ensure there is sufficient prerelease custody capacity to accommodate all who are eligible. The First Step Act would also restore judicial discretion for some nonviolent offenses where federal mandatory minimum sentences have been found to be too rigid, reduce the enhanced mandatory minimum sentence for certain firearm offenses, and apply the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 retroactively. ICCA members have been at the forefront of the evidencebased practices movement for decades. ICCA members operate residential reentry centers and have extensive experience delivering communitybased services to justiceinvolved individuals. NCJA members are the state criminal justice planning agencies who fund and oversee community based services and are responsible for planning across the justice system. NCJA members are keenly aware that successful reentry rests on the provision and quality of communitybased services. ICCA and NCJA look forward to working closely with BOP on implementation of the bill. The First Step Act is important legislation and we urge its swift passage. Sincerely, ELLEN DONNARUMMA . President, International Community Corrections Association. CHRISTIAN KERVICK , President, National Criminal Justice Association. [From the Center for American Progress, Dec. 19, 2018] 
STATEMENT : T HECENTER FOR AMERICAN  PROGRESS APPLAUDS THE SENATE FOR PASSING THE FIRST STEP A CT (By Julia Cusick) WASHINGTON , D.C.—Yesterday, the Senate passed the FIRST STEP Act by an 87–12 bipartisan vote. The bill would reform the federal criminal justice system by revising some sentencing laws and letting judges consider sentences below the mandatory minimum for more people. The legislation would also establish a system of programs to provide incarcerated people with skills and tools to succeed when they go back to their communities after serving their sentence. Following the passage of the bill, Ed Chung, vice president for Criminal justice Reform at the Center for American Progress, provided the following statement: The Center for American Progress applauds the Senate for passing the FIRST STEP Act with overwhelming bipartisan support. The Senate’s version of the legislation, while far from perfect, includes crucial sentencing reforms that safely reduce the footprint of the federal criminal justice system from the front end. Additionally, the Senate added important checks on the U.S. Department of Justice as it creates a risk and needs assessment and a system of programs and education in the Bureau of Prisons. These changes, which were priorities of CAP when we announced our support for the bill, would not have been possible without the leadership of Sens. Dick Durbin (D–IL), Chuck Grassley (RIA), Cory Booker (D–NJ), and Kamala Harris (D–CA). These champions all resisted earlier calls to accept a more moderated version of the bill that omitted sentencing reforms and made sure the legislation was as progressive as possible in the current political climate. We look forward to the House quickly passing this version of the bill followed by enactment of the legislation in the coming days. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support S. 2961 to save our children, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. COLLINS) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 2961. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
b1215 VETERANS SMALL BUSINESS ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2018 Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (S. 2679) to provide access to and manage the distribution of excess or surplus property to veteranowned small businesses. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 2679 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Veterans Small Business Enhancement Act of 2018’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. MARSHALL ) and the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kansas. 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Kansas? There was no objection. Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 2679, the Veterans Small Business Enhancement Act of 2018. This important, bipartisan legislation, introduced by Senator DUCKWORTH and Senator KENNEDY , aims to help veteran entrepreneurs cut costs and enhance their economic opportunity by giving them access to surplus Federal property. The Federal Surplus Property Program allows certain nongovernment organizations to acquire equipment and property that the Federal Government no longer needs. This legislation adds veteranowned small businesses to the program’s list of eligible recipients, which already includes minorityowned and womenowned small businesses. The Veterans of Foreign Wars, the National Association of State Agencies for Surplus Property, and the American Legion support this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close if the gentlewoman from New York is prepared as well after her remarks, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2679, the Veterans Small Business Enhancement Act. Currently, the Federal agencies make their excess property available to other agencies and eligible organizations that serve the public. Today’s bill is a commonsense expansion of the list of eligible entities that receive surplus property. By adding qualified veteranowned small businesses to the list, it ensures veteran entrepreneurs have the resources they need to start and grow. With more than 2.5 million veteran owned small firms, this bill puts them on equal footing with other entities that provide important services to our country. Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important bipartisan legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. MARSHALL ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 2679. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
TAXPAYER FIRST ACT OF 2018 Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 7227) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modernize and improve the Internal Revenue Service, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 7227 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
or requests filed or pending on or after the date of the enactment of this Act. 
The Secretary of the Treasury (or the Secretary’s delegate) shall work collaboratively with the public and private sectors to protect taxpayers from identity theft refund fraud. 
ADMINISTRATION .—Section 232 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 432) is amended by inserting after the third sentence the following: ‘‘For purposes of carrying out the return processing program described in the 
Beginning 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Treasury (or the Secretary’s delegate) shall verify the identity of any individual opening an eServices account with the Internal Revenue Service before such individual is able to use the eServices tools. Subtitle E—Other Provisions 
Section 2004 of the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 (26 U.S.C. 6012 note) is repealed. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. RICE) and the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. LEWIS) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from South Carolina. 
Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 7227, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from South Carolina? There was no objection. Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, this is a bipartisan, commonsense measure that I am proud to have worked on alongside Mr. LEWIS and many members of the Ways and Means Committee for the past 2 years. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 7227. I am proud of the product and of the process. I thank the gentleman from South Carolina for all of his help and all of his great work. Let me also thank Chairman BRADY  for his tireless work and commitment to this bill. From start to finish, he worked with us to advance good, responsible policy. This afternoon, I again thank him, the gentlewoman from Kansas (Ms. JENKINS ), and the gentleman from Florida (Mr. BUCHANAN ) for serving as partners in leading this effort. I also thank our staff again for their good and great work. They refused to give up; they refused to give in. They worked together on behalf of the American taxpayers and of the American people, and they did a great and superb job. For over a year, the Ways and Means Oversight Subcommittee hosted hearings and roundtables. We listened and asked questions. We asked Democratic and Republican Members to share their concerns and ideas. We reached out to taxpayers and advocates. We negotiated. We took our time, and, Mr. Speaker, I believe that we did it and we did it right. Together, we developed a bill that improves the independent appeals process and taxpayer services. We worked together to ensure that taxpayers—especially those who are lowincome, disabled, and senior citizens—receive fair, quality, and timely help and support. For these reasons, I am especially proud of our work to prevent private debt collectors from excessively targeting lowincome taxpayers. As a result, our bill will ease the burden on those who are already struggling to keep a roof over their head and food on the table. From the beginning, we committed to bipartisanship, and we refused to abandon our course. I believe that this experience took our subcommittee and our institution back to our roots. Mr. Speaker, at every crossroad, we remembered the lessons from the past and chose to put the taxpayer first. The process was transparent and inclusive, and the product is strong and timely. For these reasons, Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. RICE) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 7227, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. f 
VEHICULAR TERRORISM PREVENTION ACT OF 2018 Mr. ESTES of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and concur in the Senate amendments to the bill (H.R. 4227) an act to require the Secretary of Homeland Security to examine what actions the Department of Homeland Security is undertaking to combat the threat of vehicular terrorism, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the Senate amendments is as follows: Senate amendments: 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. ESTES) and the gentleman from California (Mr. CORREA ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kansas. 
Mr. ESTES of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Kansas? There was no objection. Mr. ESTES of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4227, the Vehicular Terrorism Prevention Act, introduced by the gentleman from Ohio, Representative LATTA . H.R. 4227 requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to examine the threat of vehicular terrorism and develop a strategy to improve DHS support for the efforts of emergency responders and the private sector to prevent, mitigate, and respond to such a threat. Terror groups, including ISIS and al Qaida, have urged supporters to carry out attacks in their home countries using any means necessary, including vehicular ramming. Terrorists and inspired homegrown extremists have heeded this direction and have carried out vehicularbased attacks in the past several years, including in France, England, Spain, Ohio, and New York City. DHS has existing resources and programs that can be better utilized to prepare frontline personnel in local communities to address the threat of vehicular terrorism. H.R. 4227 requires the Secretary to develop a plan on how to improve and increase these capabilities. This bill passed the House on March 22 of this year. The Senate made minor changes to this measure and passed it with unanimous consent on December 18. I thank Representative LATTA for his work on this important measure, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise to urge the House to concur in the Senate amendments to H.R. 4227, the Vehicular Terrorism Prevention Act of 2017. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the Senate amendments to H.R. 4227. They are technical in nature and would enhance H.R. 4227, a bill to require the Department of Homeland Security to report to Congress on what it is doing to help emergency responders and private sector partners counter the threat of vehicular terrorism. It would also explain how DHS is using existing DHS programs like grants, information sharing, training, and research to help in this effort. I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I reserve the balance of my time. b1230 Mr. ESTES of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. LATTA ), the sponsor of the bill. Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support the Senate amendment to my bill, H.R. 4227, the Vehicular Terrorism Prevention Act. It previously passed the House by a vote of 417–2 and was amended by the Senate to make simple technical corrections. Over the past several years, we have seen an increased frequency of terrorists around the world using vehicles, oftentimes rental vans or trucks, to commit violence. The United States has not been immune to these attacks as we saw in New York City at the end of last year when a terrorist killed 8 people and injured 11. This bipartisan legislation will ensure that the Department of Homeland Security is doing their due diligence to guard against attacks like this in the future. It would require the DHS Secretary to assess the activities the Department is undertaking to combat the threat of vehicular terrorism and submit a strategy to Congress on its findings and recommendations. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman MCCAUL, Ranking Member T HOMP SON, Senator B ILLCASSIDY , and the staffs of both the House and Senate committees for their work in advancing this legislation. I urge my colleagues to join me in concurring with the Senate amendment to H.R. 4227. 
Again, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me. Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, as threats to our homeland continue to evolve and as violent extremists seek to exploit soft targets, the risks posed to our innocent bystanders from vehicular terrorism continues to grow. A vote today to concur with the Senate amendment to H.R. 4227 is a vote to bolster preparedness and response to these emerging threats. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ESTES of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. ESTES) that the House suspend the rules and concur in the Senate amendments to the bill, H.R. 4227. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
STEPHEN MICHAEL GLEASON CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL ACT Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 2652) to award a Congressional Gold Medal to Stephen Michael Gleason. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 2652 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Stephen Michael Gleason Congressional Gold Medal Act’’. 
Under such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, the Secretary may strike and sell duplicates in bronze of the gold medal struck under section 3, at a price sufficient to cover the costs of the medals, including labor, materials, dies, use of machinery, and overhead expenses. 
Medals struck pursuant to this Act are national medals for purposes of chapter 51 of title 31, United States Code. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. HUIZENGA ) and the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. CLAY) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan. 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material on this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Michigan? There was no objection. Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, this important bill has wide bipartisan support, and I urge all Members to support this legislation. Mr. Gleason who was a former player with the New Orleans Saints, has done significant work in the area of ALS—in ALS education and advocacy and its damaging effects. I, like many people in this Chamber and many people across the country, have been touched by this personally, with friends or family members, and we know the ravages that occur with this horrible disease, ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this important legislation, the Stephen Michael Gleason Congressional Gold Medal Act, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2652 and its House companion sponsored by my friend, Representative CEDRIC RICHMOND , which awards a Congressional Gold Medal to Stephen Michael Gleason, whose tireless work for people living with ALS should be honored. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. RICHMOND ), the sponsor of the House version of this bill. Mr. RICHMOND. Mr. Speaker, let me thank my colleague, Mr. CLAYfrom St. Louis, and my colleague from Michigan. I understand the difficulty in saying very loud the ‘‘New Orleans 
Saints,’’ but I just want to also thank Senator BILL CASSIDY , and Senator PATTY MURRAY for authoring this bill and working so hard to get it across the finish line. I would also like to thank Representative CATHY MCMORRISRODGERS and Representative S TEVE  SCALISE for working with me in the House. The Congressional Gold Medal is a special award, and today we are coming together to support giving it to a special person. This is an award for people who dedicate themselves to causes bigger than themselves and for those who work tirelessly to help the lives of others. Both of those describe the son of Who Dat Nation, Steve Gleason. Steve, after being diagnosed with ALS, came together with his team to form Team Gleason, and he declared then that there would be no white flags in dealing with ALS. Steve is a selfless individual who has used his life to raise awareness of ALS and who has been instrumental in developing technology in order to combat this disease. He has done so much that has tangibly improved people’s lives now and will continue to do so for years to come. That is why I am proud to introduce this bill in the House and to be standing here today concurring in the Senate bill to honor Steve’s contributions to society. Mr. Speaker, I would urge my colleagues to support giving the Congressional Gold Medal to our son of Who Dat Nation, Steve Gleason. Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to reserve, but I would like to note to my friend from Louisiana, as a Lions fan, it is much easier to be supportive of a Saints player than if this guy had actually been a Green Bay Packer. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I have no football team in St. Louis, but we do have the Kansas City Chiefs, who are doing pretty well. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I urge Members to vote for this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I will note to my colleagues that as a Detroit Lions fan, I, too, don’t have a football team, but I am proud to stand on the floor today and note that this is an important time to address these things. We all, as a nation, are thankful for the work of Mr. Gleason in this important issue, and I do urge support from all of my colleagues. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. HUIZENGA ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 2652. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.

RBIC ADVISERS RELIEF ACT OF 2018 Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 2765) to amend the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to exempt investment advisers who solely advise certain rural business investment companies, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 2765 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘RBIC Advisers Relief Act of 2018’’. 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material on this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Michigan? There was no objection. Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, this critical bill has broad and extensive bipartisan support, and I urge all Members to support this legislation. A few years ago, we had gone in and done a technical fix regarding small businesses, and this Rural Business Investment Company, or the RBIC, deals with language that will allow the advisers to go in and deal with rural businesses—not just small business, but these rural businesses. We think that this is an important step to helping rural America continue the economic recovery that they have seen over the last year or two. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that the House is taking up S. 2765, a bill that shows once again that Democrats support investment, job creation, and the development of wealth in rural areas. The bill is simple. It extends the exemption from registration in the Dodd Frank Act to certain advisers to small private funds known as Rural Business Investment Companies, which are regulated by the USDA and are required to provide significant financing to rural area small businesses. Mr. Speaker, I support the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I just want to note that we are having our second Senate bill from Louisiana, so we are covering our colleagues from down in Louisiana. I just want to encourage my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. HUIZENGA ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 2765. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed.

b1245 INNOVATIONS IN MENTORING, TRAINING, AND APPRENTICESHIPS ACT Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and concur in the Senate amendment to the bill (H.R. 5509) to direct the National Science Foundation to provide grants for research about STEM education approaches and the STEMrelated workforce, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the Senate amendment is as follows: Senate amendment: 
Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the following: 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Innovations in Mentoring, Training, and Apprenticeships Act’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. SMITH) and the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. BONAMICI ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. 
Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on H.R. 5509, the bill now under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5509, the IMT Apprenticeships Act, was introduced by Majority Leader KEVIN MCCARTHY with my support and that of the ranking minority member of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee. It increases our STEM workforce and improves our national competitiveness. The IMT Apprenticeships Act directs the National Science Foundation to fund initiatives that support innovative partnerships between academic institutions and local industries. These programs combine formal education with work experiences such as apprenticeships, pairing local employers with the STEM industry. This bill also requires the NSF to conduct research on market analysis innovations and America’s skilled technical workforce. I would like to thank Leader MCCARTHY, Ranking Member E DDIE BERNICE  JOHNSON , and Senate Commerce Chairman JOHN THUNE for their efforts on this bipartisan bill. The IMT Apprenticeships Act enhances America’s STEM competitiveness and contributes to our future economic prosperity. Mr. Speaker, I urge its support, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5509, the Innovations in Mentoring, Training, and Apprenticeships Act. I thank Majority Leader MCCARTHY for introducing this good legislation. In the interest of time, I will be placing extended remarks in the RECORD today. I rise in support of H.R. 5509, the Innovations in Mentoring, Training, and Apprenticeships Act. I thank Majority Leader MCCARTHY  for introducing this good legislation. Building a STEM workforce that can meet the demands of our continually evolving economy is one of the most pressing challenges we face today. With a persistent and widening STEM skills gap, companies in all sectors continue to struggle to meet their needs for skilled technical workers. We must do more to ensure we are preparing a workforce that can keep pace with these demands, and not just in the near term. Apprenticeships are a promising approach to bridging this gap. By investing in education and onthejob training for their workers, employers can develop a workforce equipped with skills tailored to their specific needs. After completing an apprenticeship program, workers are on the path to a longterm, wellpaying career. H.R. 5509 directs the National Science Foundation to provide grants for developing or improving associate, certificate, and applied learning programs at community colleges and universities in partnership with employers. This bill also directs NSF to support research on the skilled technical labor market. These are important steps in the right direction. In order to build a strong skilled technical workforce we must do more to expand access to these careers. Women make up nearly half of the workforce but only 6 percent of apprentices. I am glad this bill highlights the need for better outreach and I look forward to exploring what more can be done to ensure women and other underrepresented minorities have the 
same opportunities to benefit from apprenticeships. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I would like to speak in support of H.R. 5509, the innovations in Mentoring, Training, and Apprenticeships Act. I comment Majority Leader MCCARTHY for his leadership in addressing this important issue with this legislation. I am heartened to see so much attention being paid to the importance of developing a STEM workforce that is equipped to meet the demands of an increasingly automated and technologydriven economy. As Ranking Member of the Science Committee, I am committed to ensuring all students and individuals seeking a career change have access to the education and technical skills training they need to pursue highpaying, meaningful STEM careers. It is high time we as a society recognize the value of apprenticeships as avenues to high quality careers. We have work to do to change the perception of skilled technical labor and it starts by recognizing that our STEM workforce includes so much more than just those with advanced STEM degrees. A strong STEM workforce is built on the foundation of blue collar STEM workers— workers who use their extensive STEM knowledge and skills day in and day out without the need for a traditional fouryear degree. Blue collar STEM workers contribute to our nation’s economic competitiveness in immeasurable ways. What good is it for a company to have the most innovative engineers and scientists if they don’t have the laboratory managers, technicians, mechanics, IT workers, machinists, and welders to transform their ideas into reality? We will need more blue collar STEM workers if we are to keep pace with our global competitors. One key barrier to developing a strong STEM workforce is the misalignment between the education and training provided at community colleges and universities and the knowledge and skills employers need. H.R. 5509 takes us in the right direction by directing federal support for developing and improving STEM associate degree and applied learning programs in partnership with local employers. In the new congress I look forward to continuing to explore ways in which Congress can help strengthen the blue collar STEM workforce that is so vital to our success. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. SMITH) that the House suspend the rules and concur in the Senate amendment to the bill, H.R. 5509. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. NASA ENHANCED USE LEASING EXTENSION ACT OF 2018 Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 7) to amend title 51, United States Code, to extend the authority of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to enter into leases of nonexcess property of the Administration. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: S. 7 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘NASA Enhanced Use Leasing Extension Act of 2018’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. SMITH) and the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. BONAMICI ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. 
Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on S. 7, the bill now under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the bipartisan NASA Enhanced Use Leasing Extension Act of 2018 facilitates commercial access to NASA infrastructure and facilities. NASA’s enhanced use lease authority gives NASA a crucial tool to partner with the private sector. For instance, NASA used EUL authority to lease SpaceX, the historic Apollo and Space Shuttle launch Pad 39A, promoting the transition from allgovernment space activities to commercial ventures. I would like to thank Senator ROGER  WICKER for his initiative on this bill which allows NASA to continue to implement this key authority while Congress works out a longterm solution to NASA’s use of excess property. Mr. Speaker, I urge its support, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 7, the NASA Enhanced Use Leasing Extension Act of 2018. In the interest of time, I will be placing extended remarks in the RECORD . Let me just say that this is a commonsense bill to extend an authority that helps NASA more efficiently manage its assets. I rise in support of S.7, the ‘‘NASA Enhanced Use Lease Extension Act of 2018’’. Enhanced use leasing, or ‘‘EUL’’ allows the National Aeronautics and Space Administration—NASA—to enter into agreements with state and local governments, academia, private sector entities, and other Federal government agencies to lease nonexcess and underutilized properties at NASA. NASA’s EUL authority allows the agency to accept lease revenues, in turn helping NASA to reduce operating costs and make improvements to facility conditions. The EUL authority helps NASA manage the agency’s real property, including the preservation of underutilized or unique, historic properties. According to NASA, in Fiscal Year 2017, five NASA Centers used enhanced use leasing resulting in a total of approximately $5.4 million in net revenue for the agency. Congress granted NASA authority to demonstrate enhanced use leasing at two NASA Field Centers as part the Fiscal Year 2003 Consolidated Appropriations Resolution. The Fiscal Year 2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act expanded the authority to agencywide use. Since then, the authority has been amended in 2008, and further amended in 2012 to allow NASA to accept inkind considerations for leases for the purpose of developing renewable energy production facilities. The NASA Transition Authorization Act of 2017—Public Law 115–10—extended NASA’s EUL authority until December 31, 2018. The bill we are considering today provides a clean oneyear extension until December 31, 2019. This extension will allow NASA to continue existing EUL arrangements and to make progress on developing new arrangements that are currently underway. I urge my colleagues to pass S.7, the ‘‘NASA Enhanced Use Lease Extension Act of 2018.’’ Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I support passage of S. 7, the ‘‘NASA Enhanced Use Lease Extension Act of 2018’’. NASA’s enhanced use leasing or ‘‘EUL’’ authority provides the agency with tools to help manage its real property. NASA has, for example, used EUL to preserve underutilized property and make improvements to facility conditions. EUL allows the National Aeronautics and Space Administration—NASA—to enter into agreements with state and local governments, academia, private sector entities, and other Federal government agencies to lease nonexcess and underutilized properties at NASA. According to NASA, in Fiscal Year 2017, NASA used enhanced use leasing resulting in a total of approximately $5.4 million in net revenue for the agency. Congress first granted NASA authority to demonstrate enhanced use leasing in the early 2000s. Since that time, Congress has expanded and extended the agency’s EUL authority. The NASA Transition Authorization Act of 2017—Public Law 115–10—extended NASA’s EUL authority until December 31, 2018. The bill we are considering today provides a clean oneyear extension until December 31, 
2019. This extension will allow NASA to continue existing EUL arrangements and to make progress on developing new arrangements that are currently underway. I urge my colleagues to vote yes and pass S. 7, the ‘‘NASA Enhanced Use Lease Extension Act of 2018.’’ The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. SMITH) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 7. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
NATIONAL INTEGRATED DROUGHT INFORMATION SYSTEM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2018 Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 2200) to reauthorize the National Integrated Drought Information System, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 2200 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘National Integrated Drought Information System Reauthorization Act of 2018’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. SMITH) and the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. BONAMICI ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. 
Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on S. 2200, the bill now under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, S. 2200 has broad bipartisan support, and I urge all Members to support this legislation. This bill reauthorizes and enhances priority NOAA programs, especially the Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act. The Weather Act, signed into law by President Trump 2 years ago, already has made tremendous advances in the accuracy and timeliness of weather forecasting and the rapid integration of the private sector. S. 2200 accelerates advances in model development and data assimilation, increases the use of innovative computing technologies and leasing strategies, promotes targeted research for the next generation of weather satellites, and further engages the growing commercial weather industry through reauthorization of the Commercial Weather Data Pilot program. I would like to thank Senate Commerce Chairman JOHN THUNE for his leadership on this bill, which enables NOAA to protect lives and property and advance the economy of the United States. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2200, the National Integrated Drought Information System Reauthorization Act of 2018. The NIDIS program has grown tremendously since its creation in 2006, and this reauthorization will aid in continuing its mission to provide a drought early warning system by coordinating and integrating drought research through key Federal, State, local, and Tribal partnerships. This bill also includes a reauthorization of the Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Act, which Senator NELSON and I introduced this Congress with bipartisan support. This bill provides valuable resources to better understand, detect, assess, monitor, and respond to both marine and freshwater harmful algal blooms and hypoxia events. Updating this program and investing in research on harmful algal blooms and hypoxia will help Oregonians and people across the country who are facing the dangerous effects of exposure to harmful algal blooms in drinking water sources, oceans, and lakes. Recently, we have seen harmful algal blooms cut off access to clean drinking water for residents of Salem, Oregon, and they have stifled recreational activities on the Willamette River. Harmful algal blooms in the marine environment produce dangerous toxins that make Oregon’s prized Dungeness crabs toxic and deprive fishing communities of income. As cochair of both the House Oceans Caucus and the House Estuary Caucus, I am pleased to reauthorize the research programs that help us better predict and guard against harmful algal blooms in marine and freshwater systems. Additionally, this bill contains provisions to reauthorize funding for programs from the Weather Research and Forecasting and Innovation Act of 2017, which I fully support. Other language in this bill regarding NOAA’s Earth prediction innovation center, computing resources, and our nextgeneration satellite architecture, though valuable, is completely new to this body and is deserving of robust, discussion which has been missing. Though I am supportive of the NIDIS, the algal blooms bill, and the Weather Act programs that are reauthorized in this legislation, I would like to note that we have not had a hearing, a markup, or any substantive discussion of these programs in the House of Representatives this Congress. These critical issues do warrant such discussion, given the number of Americans affected by either drought or toxic algal blooms and hypoxia events, and all Americans benefit from NOAA programs that provide timely and accurate forecasts. I look forward to the Science, Space, and Technology Committee providing a forum to discuss these significant issues next Congress. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would just like to thank the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. BONAMICI ) for all of her good work on the Science, Space, and Technology Committee over several years’ time. I also want to express my appreciation to her for being instrumental in the number of bipartisan bills that the Science, Space, and Technology Committee has brought to the House floor. In fact, as of today, 33 of the 35 Science, Space, and Technology Committee bills that have passed the House floor have been bipartisan bills. Ms. BONAMICI has worked on any number of those bills to help make sure that they are bipartisan, and to the extent that those bills have been changed, they have been improved because of her input. So I really want to thank her for her friendship over the years and for her contributions on the Science, Space, and Technology Committee over the years. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I do thank Chairman SMITH. I have been on the Science, Space, and Technology Committee my entire time in Congress, and I thank him for his years of leadership and service to the committee. Even though Chairman SMITH and I have not always agreed on every issue, he has been always willing to listen and to work with me and my colleagues on my side of the aisle on bills like the Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act of 2017, which we worked on for several years together and is now law. So, again, I thank Chairman SMITH for his years of service to the committee. I wish him well in the new chapter of his life. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentlewoman from Oregon for those very nice comments. They are much appreciated. I also want to take just a minute to thank the ranking member of the full committee, EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON , my colleague and friend from Texas. We also would not be here without her effort over the many, many years and her help in making sure that 33 of the 35 bills that the Science, Space, and Technology Committee has passed on the House floor were, in fact, bipartisan. I also want to congratulate her on being the next chairman of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee. I know she brings a lot of intelligence and a lot of commitment and will do great work on behalf of the country as chairman of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 2200, the ‘‘National Integrated Drought Information System Reauthorization Act of 2018’’. This bill also reauthorizes the ‘‘Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Act,’’ as introduced by Senator NELSON and my colleague on the Science Committee, Ms. BONAMICI . Both of these existing programs have years of successful accomplishments, and their reauthorization ensures that NOAA will be able to continue supporting communities that are dealing with the impacts of drought and toxic freshwater and marine harmful algal blooms and hypoxia events. The Weather Research and Forecasting and Innovation Act that the House passed in a bipartisan fashion last year was a great accomplishment for the Science Committee, and I am happy to see the existing weather laboratories, cooperative institutes, joint technology 
transfer initiative and research programs within NOAA’s Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research will be reauthorized with this bill. As Congresswoman BONAMICI mentioned earlier, this bill reauthorizes critical programs at NOAA that benefit countless Americans, which I fully support. However, I am disappointed in the process used to bring NIDIS, HABHRCA, and the Weather Act to the floor today for reauthorization. The brandnew language in this bill related to NOAA’s Earth Prediction Innovation Center, computing resources, and our next generation satellite architecture has never gone through the standard committee process in either the House or the Senate. By not providing an opportunity for hearings, markups, or any debate on these key pieces of legislation we rob our colleagues of the opportunity to advocate for their constituents, and do not do justice to the importance of these provisions. I hope we will do better to abide by regular order next Congress, and it is my intention to do that on the Science Committee. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. SMITH) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 2200. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. AMASH. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
b1300 PERMISSION TO REDUCE TIME FOR ELECTRONIC VOTING DURING PROCEEDINGS TODAY Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that, during further proceedings today in the House, the Chair be authorized to reduce to 2 minutes the minimum time for electronic voting on any question that otherwise could be subjected to 5minute voting under clause 8 or 9 of rule XX. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. BOST). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from North Carolina? There was no objection. 
STOP, OBSERVE, ASK, AND RESPOND TO HEALTH AND WELLNESS ACT OF 2018 Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and concur in the Senate amendment to the bill (H.R. 767) to establish the Stop, Observe, Ask, and Respond to Health and Wellness Training pilot program to address human trafficking in the health care system. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the Senate amendment is as follows: Senate amendment: 
Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the following: SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Stop, Observe, Ask, and Respond to Health and Wellness Act of 2018’’ or the ‘‘SOAR to Health and Wellness Act of 2018’’. 
Part E of title XII of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300d–51 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following: 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. GUTHRIE ) and the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. BENRAY LUJA´N) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material in the RECORD on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Kentucky? There was no objection. Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Montana (Mr. GIANFORTE ), my good friend. Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, Montanans didn’t send me here to shut down the government, but they also didn’t send me here to let their priorities die in a lameduck session that is in every part lame. I stand here still urging this body to take up a public lands package and secure the border. A public lands package should include the permanent reauthorization of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. A public lands package should include the Yellowstone Gateway Protection Act that permanently conserves public land in Paradise Valley. A public lands package should include 
H.R. 3764 to provide longoverdue Federal recognition to the Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians. Mr. Speaker, we could just kick the can here on government funding, on our public lands, and on border security all because CHUCK SCHUMER and NANCY PELOSI are folding their arms, shaking their heads no, and refusing to secure our border. Mr. Speaker, this lameduck session doesn’t have to produce lame results. I urge my colleagues to take up a public lands package and to secure our border. Mr. BEN RAY LUJA´N of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Senate amendment to H.R. 767, the SOAR to Health and Wellness Act of 2018. This bill establishes a training program for healthcare and social service providers in order to better identify potential victims of human trafficking when they come into contact with healthcare or social services professionals. The bill provides grants to appropriate entities to help train these providers on how to identify and appropriately treat potential victims of human trafficking. Nearly 21 million people worldwide are victims of human trafficking, forced labor, or sexual exploitation. At some point, many of these unidentified victims will come into contact with a healthcare provider or social services professional. It is critical for these providers to know how best to care for these individuals and how to ensure they can coordinate their treatment with other providers in a way that is culturally relevant, trauma informed, and patient centered. Helping healthcare professionals better recognize the signs of trafficking and improve their ability to intervene can truly be the difference between life and death. Mr. Speaker, the House passed H.R. 767 on February 26 of this year, and we are now considering the amendment to the bill that the Senate agreed to yesterday. These changes reflect bipartisan efforts to streamline the text of the legislation, while maintaining the bill’s intent and scope as originally passed in the House. I want to thank Congressman COHEN  for sponsoring this important piece of legislation and for his leadership on this issue. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill. I have no further speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I enjoyed working with my colleague from New Mexico in moving this bill forward. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 767, the SOAR Act, will head to the President’s desk after passage today. It is critical in ensuring adequate treatment of victims of human trafficking. Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. GUTHRIE ) that the House suspend the rules and concur in the Senate amendment to the bill, H.R. 767. The question was taken.

CODIFYING USEFUL REGULATORY DEFINITIONS ACT Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 2322) to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to define the term natural cheese. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 2322 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Codifying Useful Regulatory Definitions Act’’ or the ‘‘CURD Act’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. GUTHRIE ) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material in the RECORD on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Kentucky? There was no objection. Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, before us today is a bill to define the term ‘‘natural cheese.’’ The House sponsor is our Speaker from Wisconsin, obviously, from the cheese State and the dairy State. What we are debating is S. 2322, the CURD Act. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support its passage, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the bill we are considering under suspension of the rules, S. 2322, the Codifying Useful Regulatory Definitions Act, or the CURD Act. This bill has not proceeded through regular order and codifies into the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act a highly prescriptive definition of ‘‘natural cheese’’ that should be determined by the FDA, not by Congress. This legislation creates a statutory definition for a specific category of cheese and expressly distinguishes what shall be considered natural cheese from the other standards of identity for processed cheese currently defined in regulation. The bill then codifies these regulatory standards of identity into the statute and expressly preempts any nonFederal definition of the term ‘‘natural cheese.’’ The FDA has the authority to define this term, yet proponents of this legislation prefer legislative expediency over sound regulatory decisionmaking. Supporters insist that this definition is needed in statute immediately to assure it quickly applies. However, instead of waiting to proceed through regular order or following the regulatory process, stakeholders are asking for an immediate statutory change because of ongoing litigation that this bill will help to resolve for some stakeholders. Mr. Speaker, I am concerned that by rushing this legislation through we have not been given adequate time to consider the implications for this change or how this definition might impact consumers and other industry stakeholders. The FDA is best positioned to consider the public health impacts of defining this term and how it would interact with other agency efforts regarding nutrition labeling, such as a broader definition for the term ‘‘natural.’’ Additionally, I am concerned by the precedent this legislation creates and believe that passing this bill only encourages stakeholders to seek additional statutory changes or definitional clarity for the products when they believe the FDA has not acted as expeditiously as they wish or when they are facing litigation. We should be making changes to the Federal statute when they are necessary and in order to protect the public health, not when industry is seeking a favorable outcome that could be achieved through regulatory process. I do not believe this change is warranted in this circumstance. Finally, Mr. Speaker, I strongly believe that legislation like the CURD Act should be considered through regular order, and I am opposed to this bill, given that the House of Representatives has held no hearings on this issue and has not marked up the bill under consideration today. The Senate passed this bill in the dead of night, with no discussion or debate on the floor. I believe we are abdicating our duty to fully consider the implications of this statutory change if we pass this bill today. On the substance, Mr. Speaker, the Center for Science in the Public Interest, Consumer Reports, and The Good Food Institute are all opposed to this legislation and have raised serious concerns about the impact of this change on consumer confusion and transparency. I include in the RECORD letters in opposition to the bill from all three. 
IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST , Washington, DC, December 19, 2018. DEAR MEMBER : The Center for Science in the Public Interest writes to urge you to oppose the CURD Act (H.R. 4828, S. 2322). This misguided bill would define ‘‘natural cheese’’ in a way that actually muddles, rather than clarifies, the term. For example, it would allow the use of artificial colors and additives in ‘‘natural cheese’’ and would also make labeling for cheese inconsistent with U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) labeling requirements and possibly also with the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA’s) labeling requirements for other ‘‘natural’’ foods. The bill could also prevent the term ‘‘natural’’ from being used on nondairy cheese alternatives that may otherwise rightly be considered natural by consumers. The stated purpose of the bill is to draw a clear line for consumers between ‘‘natural cheese’’ and processed cheese. Yet we have seen no evidence that consumers are confusing processed cheese with natural cheese in the marketplace. The FDA’s current standards of identity for processed cheese types already require that these cheeses include a specific statement of identity on the label indicating that they are ‘‘process cheese.’’ And there are currently strong incentives for the manufacturers of process cheese to avoid ‘‘natural’’ claims, as this could expose cheesemakers to liability. Rather than protecting consumers, the bill would confuse them by permitting misleading ‘‘natural’’ claims on products that most Americans would not consider natural. For example, a nationally representative telephone survey conducted in May 2018 by Consumer Reports found that more than 80 percent of consumers say ‘‘natural’’ should mean no artificial ingredients were used. Yet the CURD Act allows for the use of synthetic food dye, artificial flavors, and other artificial additives in socalled ‘‘natural cheese.’’ Similarly, an overwhelming majority of Americans surveyed felt that use of the term ‘‘natural’’ should be reserved for foods that deploy natural agricultural practices to produce the food’s ingredients, including by limiting the use of hormones, pesticides, and antibiotics. In contrast, the bill would allow the term ‘‘natural cheese’’ to appear irrespective of the agricultural practices used to produce the cheese’s ingredients. The bill would also make labeling for ‘‘natural cheese’’ inconsistent with USDA and with likely future FDA requirements for ‘‘natural’’ on food labels in general. The USDA currently permits the use of the term ‘‘natural’’ on products that contain no artificial ingredient or added color and which are only minimally processed. In addition, understanding that ‘‘natural’’ can have many meanings, the USDA requires a brief statement of meaning on labels to avoid confusion, stating, that the food is ‘‘*no more than minimally processed and contains no artificial ingredients.’’ The FDA is also currently considering adopting a definition of ‘‘natural’’ and may create similar requirements based on comments in its public docket on the issue. Yet the bill would authorize the claim ‘‘natural cheese’’ to be used on cheese in a manner that fails to align with either the USDA’s current rules or prospective FDA requirements, leading to inconsistency and confusion across the marketplace. Finally, the bill defines ‘‘natural cheese’’ in a manner that could be interpreted to prohibit use of the term on nondairy alternatives intended for consumers who are vegan, lactose intolerant, or who otherwise wish to avoid dairy cheeses. Use of the term ‘‘natural’’ should not be prohibited on these products, provided the products otherwise meet consumer expectations for use of this term. The FDA is currently working on a definition of ‘‘natural’’ that would be nonmisleading, based on consumer understanding, and apply uniformly to all FDAregulated foods, including cheese. Congress should not act prematurely to carve out a definition for ‘‘natural cheese’’ before the agency has taken action to define ‘‘natural’’ for other products. For these reasons, we urge you to vote ‘‘no’’ on the CURD Act. Sincerely, SARAH SORSCHER , Deputy Director of Regulatory Affairs, Center for Science in the Public Interest. 
through a process that prioritizes the public interest and involves the input of all stakeholders. This effort intends to define the term ‘‘natural’’ in a way that is not misleading and based on consumer understanding, and that applies to all foods in the marketplace overseen by the agency. We support this initiative, especially because our April 2018 survey found that 88% of Americans think that all companies should meet the same standard for the ‘‘natural’’ label. Congress should not shortcircuit this important work by setting a special definition of ‘‘natural cheese.’’ The CURD Act ultimately places the interests of cheese producers ahead of the broad need for consumers to understand what they’re buying and feeding their families. We urge you to support a clear, consistent, and accountable food marketplace for consumers, and vote no on S. 2322. Sincerely, JEANHALLORAN , Director, Food Policy Initiatives Consumer Reports. CHARLOTTE VALLAEYS , Senior Policy Analyst Consumer Reports. WILLIAM WALLACE , Senior Policy Analyst, Consumer Reports. 
b1315 Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, we should not displace the important role of the FDA in determining the correct terminology and approach to regulating and labeling food products like cheese. Changes to the statute should be considered in broad daylight, with robust discussion and significant input from consumer, industry, and government stakeholders. That has not happened in this case, and for these reasons I oppose the bill and urge my colleagues to oppose the bill as well. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I support S. 2322, the CURD Act, which would define the term ‘‘natural cheese’’ within the Federal statute and, with passage, head to the President’s desk. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. GUTHRIE ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 2322. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. AMASH. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 6418) to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to conduct a study regarding the accessibility of websites of the Department of Veterans Affairs to individuals with disabilities, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 6418 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘VA Website Accessibility Act of 2018’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE) and the gentleman from California (Mr. TAKANO ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee. 
Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Tennessee? There was no objection. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6418, as amended, the VA Website Accessibility Act of 2018. Mr. Speaker, in the interest of time, I will allow Vice Ranking Member TAKANO to discuss the bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6418, as amended, the VA Website Accessibility Act of 2018. This bill from Representative ESTY mandates that the VA finally make all of its websites compliant for visually impaired individuals. This is a longoverdue action that the Blinded Veterans Association has tirelessly advocated for to make VA communications and information fully accessible to everyone, and I am proud to support this bill.

Mr. Speaker, once again, I encourage all Members to support this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore.

DOUGLAS FOURNET DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS CLINIC Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 3444) to designate the communitybased outpatient clinic of the Department of Veterans Affairs in Lake Charles, Louisiana, as the ‘‘Douglas Fournet Department of Veterans Affairs Clinic’’. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 3444 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF DOUGLAS FOURNET DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS CLINIC IN LAKE CHARLES, LOUISIANA. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE) and the gentleman from California (Mr. TAKANO ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee. GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Tennessee? There was no objection. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. HIGGINS) to discuss this bill. Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 3444, which renames the VA communitybased outpatient clinic in Lake Charles, Louisiana, after First Lieutenant Douglas Fournet. Mr. Speaker, I was proud to sponsor the House version of this bill. Douglas Fournet is an American hero deserving of the highest tribute. He joined the Army in 1966 and was deployed to Vietnam. There, Fournet served as rifle platoon leader of the 2nd Platoon, Company Bravo. In the A Shau Valley of Vietnam, the platoon came under sniper fire. With an enemy mine in the way of the platoon’s advance, Fournet ordered his men to take cover. He then ran uphill to the mine and attempted to disarm it with a knife. Before he could succeed, the mine was detonated. Douglas Fournet was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor in 1970. He is the sole recipient from southwest Louisiana. Douglas Fournet gave his last full measure of devotion in service to his country and in defense of his platoon. Our freedoms are paid for by the blood of patriots like First Lieutenant Fournet. Renaming of the Lake Charles VA clinic is a small tribute to his courage and forever enshrines the legacy among southwest Louisiana veterans. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join with me and honor the life, legacy, and gallantry of First Lieutenant Douglas Fournet. I urge favorable passage. Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 3444, a bill to designate the communitybased outpatient clinic of the Department of Veterans Affairs in Lake Charles, Louisiana, as the Douglas Fournet Department of Veterans Affairs Clinic. I support this bill from Senator CASSIDY to name this clinic after Louisiana Medal of Honor recipient Douglas Fournet. I have no further speakers. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in support of S. 3444, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I encourage all Members to support this legislation for an American hero, First Lieutenant Douglas Fournet. It is a privilege to recommend this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 3444. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
FOREVER GI BILL HOUSING PAYMENT FULFILLMENT ACT OF 2018 Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 3777) to require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to establish a tiger team dedicated to addressing the difficulties encountered by the Department of Veterans Affairs in carrying out section 3313 of title 38, United States Code, after the enactment of sections 107 and 501 of the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 3777 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Forever GI Bill Housing Payment Fulfillment Act of 2018’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE) and the gentleman from California (Mr. TAKANO ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee. 
Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous material during consideration of S. 3777. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Tennessee? There was no objection. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 3777, Forever GI Bill Housing Payment Fulfillment Act of 2018. Mr. Speaker, the Forever GI Bill is one of several landmark bills that this Congress has enacted to help our Nation’s veterans; however, the implementation of this law has been bumpy, to say the least, and there have been veterans who have been underpaid due to the Department of Veterans Affairs’ inability to modify their ancient IT systems to properly implement the law. While I am encouraged by Secretary Wilkie’s decision to reset implementation of the IT modifications, we owe it to our veterans to conduct proper oversight of this process. That is why I am proud to support this legislation introduced by my good friends Senator BOOZMAN of Arkansas and Mr. A NDY BARRof Kentucky on the House side. This bill would require the VA to create a ‘‘tiger team’’ that would produce a plan to ensure all GI bill users who were underpaid as a result of the IT systems not being in place are made whole. The bill would also require periodic updates on the VA’s progress on providing these underpayments to veterans. Mr. Speaker, this bill will ensure the VA does the right thing and pays student veterans what they are owed under the law. I encourage my colleagues to support S. 3777, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 3777, the Forever GI Bill Housing Payment Fulfillment Act of 2018. This bill from Senators BOOZMAN and SCHATZ will help keep the VA accountable as it moves forward to fix the issues it has run into in fully implementing the Forever GI Bill. As we continue our oversight over VA’s implementation of the Forever GI Bill, I am glad this bill provides us with more tools to do so. 
I have no further speakers. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in support of S. 3777, the Forever GI Bill Housing Payment Fulfillment Act of 2018, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I encourage all Members to support S. 3777, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to rule IX, I rise to a question of the privileges of the House, and I send to the desk a privileged resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the resolution. The Clerk read as follows: 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, TITLE I—CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS SECTION 101. FULLYEAR EXTENSION. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does the gentlewoman from California wish to present argument on the parliamentary question of whether the text presents a question of the privileges of the House? Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I do. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman is recognized on the question of order. Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, the House and Senate Democrats and Republicans of the Appropriations Committee have worked hard and long to come up with bipartisan legislation to meet the needs of the American people. Right now, we are in the midst of Congress delaying. The market is down almost 5 points for this and other reasons. This is not the time for us to shut down the government. We have a product developed in a bipartisan way for the reasons described by the Clerk, who read it, and it is privileged because of the time of the year, because of the extent of the concern that the American people have, and because of the harm that will be done to them if the government shuts down. It would be totally irresponsible. That is why I consider it a privilege to rise to say: Let’s keep the government open by passing this bipartisan legislation first introduced by Congresswoman LOWEY , our distinguished Democratic leader on the Appropriations Committee. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair is prepared to rule. The text presented proposes legislative language to continue funding for certain elements of the U.S. Government. The text, by proposing legislative language unachievable by a simple resolution, does not qualify as a question of the privileges of the House. For what purpose does the gentlewoman from California seek recognition? Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I appeal the ruling of the Chair. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is: Shall the decision of the Chair stand as the judgment of the House? For what purpose does the gentleman from California seek recognition? 
Mr. M CCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion. The Clerk read as follows: Mr. MCCARTHY of California moves to lay the appeal on the table. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to table. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote. A recorded vote was ordered. The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were—ayes 187, noes 170, not voting 75, as follows:

SHILOH NATIONAL MILITARY PARK BOUNDARY ADJUSTMENT AND PARKER’S CROSSROADS BATTLEFIELD DESIGNATION Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1181, I call up the bill (H.R. 88) to modify the boundary of the Shiloh National Military Park located in Tennessee and Mississippi, to establish Parker’s Crossroads Battlefield as an affiliated area of the National Park System, and for other purposes, with the Senate amendment thereto, and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. MITCHELL ). The Clerk will designate the Senate amendment. Senate amendment: 
Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert: 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Shiloh National Military Park Boundary Adjustment and Parker’s Crossroads Battlefield Designation Act’’. 
Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the motion. The text of the motion is as follows: 
Mr. Brady of Texas moves that the House concur in the Senate amendment to H.R. 88 with an amendment consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 115–87. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 1180, the amendment consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 115–87 shall be considered as read. The text of the House amendment to the Senate amendment to the text is as follows: 
In lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted by the Senate, insert the following: DIVISION A—RETIREMENT, SAVINGS, AND OTHER TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2018 
DISASTER AREA .—The term ‘‘Indiana severe storms and flooding disaster area’’ means an area with respect to which, during the period beginning on May 4, 2018, and ending on December 17, 2018, a major disaster has been declared by the President under section 401 of the 
meets the requirements of such section and in applying such section, the date the class of participants is closed shall be the effective date of the later amendment. 
The Secretary of the Treasury may not regulate, prohibit, or restrict the use of a contingent fee in connection with tax returns, claims for refund, or documents in connection with tax returns or claims for refund prepared on behalf of a taxpayer. DIVISION B—TAXPAYER FIRST ACT OF 2018 
COUNSEL .—The Chief of Appeals shall have authority to obtain legal assistance and advice 
The Secretary of the Treasury (or the Secretary’s delegate) shall work collaboratively with the public and private sectors to protect taxpayers from identity theft refund fraud. 
FOR PURPOSES OF CYBERSECURITY AND THE PRE VENTION OF IDENTITY THEFT TAX REFUND  
Not later than 2 years after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Treasury (or the Secretary’s delegate), in coordination with the Bureau of Fiscal Service and the Internal Revenue Service, and in consultation with private sector financial institutions, shall submit a written report to Congress describing how the government can utilize new payment platforms to increase the number of tax refunds paid by electronic funds transfer.

Subtitle E—Other Provisions 
Section 2004 of the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 (26 U.S.C. 6012 note) is repealed. 
Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the bill that is currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this important tax and oversight legislation. This bill has key timely components, each of which will help our economy continue moving in the right direction and provide help to families and communities damaged by disaster. First, I think it is simply irresponsible to wait until next year to deliver crucial tax relief for families in 14 States and territories who are struggling today to recover from this year’s devastating wildfires, hurricanes, flooding, earthquakes, and other severe storms. California alone, 17,000 structures destroyed; nearly 90 lives lost throughout the Carolinas; throughout these other States, so many families waiting to hear from Congress that they will receive relief now and not next year. Both parties need to come together to help these communities rebuild, and rebuild today. This bill allows disaster victims to immediately access funds from their retirement accounts to begin their home rebuilding. It ensures losses from these disasters are immediately deductible and helps small businesses keep their workers on the payroll, even when their operations have been interrupted by these severe storms and wildfires. Together, we can, we will, and we should help these communities rebuild today. Secondly, working with the Senate, we have reached common ground on important retirement savings reforms. The House version of this bill already passed with many Democrats’ votes. These reforms will help families save more throughout their lives, start saving earlier, while also helping our small businesses offer retirement plans to their valued workers. This bill includes bold redesigns and restructuring of the Internal Revenue Service, the first bipartisan reforms to that agency in nearly two decades. Working together, Republicans and Democrats in the House passed this redesign package 414–0 earlier this year. 
It is time now to send these reforms to the President’s desk to ensure that the IRS is an agency truly focused on quality taxpayer service. We are also offering bipartisan tax relief from some of ObamaCare’s most damaging, harmful, and egregious taxes. Specifically, this bill provides relief from the Cadillac tax that punishes companies that provide good healthcare to their workers, the medical device tax that has chased thousands of jobs overseas, and relief from the health insurance tax and the tanning tax. These harmful taxes stifle innovation, reduce jobs, and increase the cost of families’ health insurance. This package also makes good progress on two temporary tax provisions that expired at the beginning of this year. Temporary tax policy is hardly ever good tax policy. We have an opportunity here to set a new tone for how we treat these temporary tax extenders moving forward. Additionally, in this bill, we proactively eliminate any potential uncertainty for our churches and community groups so nothing distracts them from their core mission. We have included a small number of straightforward, timesensitive technical corrections to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Technical corrections, as we know, are normal and traditional with any big piece of legislation, especially with rewriting the Tax Code. These small tweaks are important and will ensure our new Tax Code works as intended, to grow the economy and increase wages for middleclass families. I urge all my colleagues to support these measures so we can send this important legislation to the Senate soon. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I recall this very quaint time when some of us arrived in Congress when the legislative session would wind down. There would always be this stellar photograph of the Speaker of the House and the Republican leaders and the Democratic leaders and the Republican and Democratic leaders in the United States Senate, who would be photographed on the front page of most major dailies on the phone speaking to the President of the United States, regardless of what the President’s political affiliation might be. So here we are closing the second session of the 115th Congress when we had time to do this. Instead, this is the second iteration of an irresponsible manner in terms of process that was offered to the Democratic minority in this House. On Monday night, we got notice of this without even seeing the substance of the proposal that was in front of us. This is not the way regular order functions nor, as I have just referenced, the way that legislative sessions are supposed to conclude. My friend—and I mean that with all sincerity—the chairman of the committee, noted that the American people are waiting to hear from Congress. Well, let me tell you this about these tax bills. It didn’t take the wealthy long to hear from Congress. They heard from them right away, and the offering that they had was more concentrated wealth and more tax relief for people at the very top in America—taking that top rate from 39.6 to 37 percent, a cut in the corporate rate to 21 percent, doubling the estate tax, and here we are again with another vehicle that is not paid for. So where do we find revenue right now as a percent of gross domestic product? It is at 16.4 percent. And we are hearing, well, just maybe this tax bill might bring us to 17.5 percent, when the historic battle that the two parties have had in this House has generally been about between 18 and 19 cents on the dollar. So a year later, what do we have in front of us? The same procedure: closed doors, no hearings, not one witness. And if you pick up some gossip in the hallway about what this is to include, that is generally conceded now to be a point of achievement. So a year later, we are rushing another package through to correct the errors that were delivered in the first bill. And, by the way, these were not small errors. A couple of them were big enough to drive a Mack truck through. Not one hearing, not one witness, not one piece of evidence documented to put in front of this committee. So this is a lastditch effort by our Republicans to revisit their tax law and ensure that it further benefits those who really are the strongest already in our society. They want to jam through some of these provisions to help corporations at the expense of shining some light on how we might have found a substantive opportunity to achieve a bipartisan outcome. The American voters delivered a resounding rebuke last month, and our friends don’t seem to understand what that message was about. On election day, the tax bill polled that 49 percent were against and 41 percent were for. And if you think it was just a messaging problem, that would be a mistake. They should have joined with us to advance some very important matters that are in this legislation; and when we would have had an opportunity to fix these together through transparency, hearings, witnesses, I think we could have easily accomplished a different outcome. I oppose this legislation because it is also not offset. For the third time this year, the party of fiscal rectitude that always lectures us when there is a Democratic President about balancing the budget went out and borrowed more than $2 trillion for the purpose of providing a tax cut to the people at the top—$2 trillion added to the budget deficits. Can you imagine what the reaction would have been if Barack Obama or Bill Clinton did that? The outrage would have been empowering in this institution. We would have heard about it for years at a time. But, no, it is okay to do it and then call it juice to the economy. b1545 Well, there are many items in here that we fully approve of, but we disagree with the approach that is being taken, and we disagree with many of the substantive matters that are being offered. There is a national principle involved here, and that is, we come to the aid of all members of the American family when natural disasters settle in, not on a piecemeal basis. And we will, I assure you, try very earnestly and very quickly next year to address many of these same issues. And I guarantee you this, for all members of this committee, there will be hearings, and there will be witnesses, and it will be done in daylight to make sure that there is an opportunity for all to be heard, including our Republican friends. To close on part of this measure as well, this bill significantly erodes the Johnson amendment by allowing certain tax exempt organizations to make political statements during the ordinary course of activities. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself an additional 2 minutes. So this would allow now priest, rabbi, imam, minister, to stand at the pulpit and offer an endorsement of a particular candidate for public office. What happened to Jefferson’s wall of separation? What happened to the idea that, unlike Europe and places like that where they have had religious strife for centuries, that we were able to avoid that because of the wall that Mr. Jefferson very skillfully constructed? This is a dangerous precedent that threatens to politicize charitable and philanthropic organizations. Finally, the health provisions in this bill do nothing to increase accountability for the device industry, employers, or health insurers. If we are going to provide tax relief to corporations, we should have guarantees that the savings will be reinvested in innovation; put more dollars in workers’ pockets, and lower insurance premiums. Another issue that is not in dispute, Mr. Speaker, is the following: Overwhelmingly, that tax cut went to share buybacks with corporations and dividends. It did not come to the benefit of people who needed tax relief every single day. There are a number of provisions here that we find very supportable, but the idea that we are doing this in the closing minutes of the 115th Congress, I think, is objectionable to our side. The proposal before us is not paid for. It did not go through the regular order, and I urge our colleagues to oppose this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I know everyone in Congress is eager to get back to a full week of Christmas shopping, but I am proud to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. RICE) who represents a community devastated by disasters in 2018. Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I stand in strong support of the tax and oversight package before us today. I appreciate the concern about the deficits from my colleague across the aisle, but I would remind my colleague that President Obama added $2 trillion in deficits in only 1 year. Mr. Speaker, this bill adds to the successes, the amazing successes of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which became law last year, and our economic potential in America has, once again, been unleashed and America is, once again, the land of opportunity. Unemployment is at a record low, Mr. Speaker. Consumer confidence and small business confidence are at historic highs, and wages are growing at their fastest pace in nearly a decade. Mr. Speaker, my friends across the aisle can say that this bill benefited only the wealthy, but I can tell you, I represent three of the poorest counties in South Carolina, Marion County, Dillon County, and Marlboro County, and all three of those counties, in 2016, were at or about 10 percent unemployment. Today, each one of those counties, largely as a result of this tax bill, are below 6 percent. For the first time in 30 years they are below 6 percent unemployment. When we passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, our message was clear: We will not wait another 30 years to take up tax legislation. We will consistently work to improve the Tax Code. The legislation before us is an opportunity to build on the economic momentum that is creating opportunities and lifting people up in South Carolina and across the country. Two years ago, Hurricane Matthew made landfall in South Carolina, and just a few days before a tax filing deadline, people were ignoring evacuation orders from disaster officials to ensure they could meet their IRS filing deadlines. Can you imagine having to choose between boarding up your house or filing a tax return? That is what my constituents had to do. Ambiguity under the current law results in the IRS waiting to grant a deadline extension for weeks after a natural disaster. My bill, the Disaster Certainty Act, would create an automatic 60day extension following a Presidential Disaster Declaration, and it is included in this bill. Additionally, this package includes the Hurricane Florence Tax Relief Act, which I introduced with Congressman HOLDING . This legislation gives disaster victims the flexibility to access emergency funds, encourages charitable giving, and enhances the deduction for personal casualty losses. Immediately following a disaster, families are faced with the cost of home repairs and temporary housing, but most do not have these funds at their disposal. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this package. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. LEVIN), the ranking member of the Health Subcommittee, who has served this institution with great distinction and dedication over many years. (Mr. LEVIN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. NEAL, and I salute his eloquent statement. I hope everybody listens. Usually, legislation has either rhyme or reason, or both. This bill has neither. It is dramatically unreasonable. It adds insult to injury. It would further increase our growing Federal debt, this time by almost $100 billion. Driven by the irresponsible 2017 tax law, our projected annual deficit has already more than doubled since President Trump came into office, more than doubled; mainly to benefit, as Mr. NEALhas spelled out so well, the very wealthy. The majority thought the first tax bill of theirs would at least be helpful politically. It turned out, for voters, sour music. It was, as described earlier, hyperpartnership at its worst; no hearings. Nothing like it. So, on this last day of votes this session, and close to my last of thousands and thousands of votes over 36 years, I will proudly vote ‘‘no.’’ Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LAHOOD), a key member of the Ways and Means Committee. Mr. LAHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman BRADY for yielding time, and for his tireless leadership on improving our country’s Tax Code. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 88, the Retirement, Savings, and Other Tax Relief Act of 2018. Since the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act last year at this time, our economy has boomed. And under the direction of Chairman BRADY , the Ways and Means Committee hasn’t stopped working on advancing and improving our Nation’s tax laws. In doing so, our committee has worked to make positive reforms to the IRS, and I am proud that this legislation includes language from my bill, the Improving Assistance for Taxpayers Act, which will bolster protections for taxpayers by requiring the IRS to respond promptly to Taxpayer Assistance Directives issued by the Taxpayer Advocate Service. Specifically, the IRS would be required to respond to Taxpayer Advocate Directives within 90 days. Implementing these changes will improve accountability and, therefore, more efficiently address systematic issues within the IRS. Not only does H.R. 88 take important steps to make our tax system more accountable, but it also includes important provisions that will provide certainty to our agriculture community in central and west central Illinois. Representing the country’s eighth largest congressional district in terms of corn and soybean production, I have seen firsthand the positive impact of the Biodiesel Tax Credit on our agriculture community. Biodiesel producers have been hurt in the past by lapses in this credit, which has hindered their ability to plan for the future. H.R. 88 provides a longterm extension and a path forward for the Biodiesel Tax Credit, which will provide positive assurances for our producers in the Midwest. As Americans continue to reap the benefits of progrowth tax reform, it is important we continue to finetune our Tax Code to work better for the citizens of this country. H.R. 88 takes important steps toward doing just that, and I have been proud to work alongside Chairman BRADY and the other members of the Ways and Means Committee to ensure we put taxpayers first, and that is what this bill does. I urge my colleagues to stand with me and support this legislation. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DOGGETT ), the ranking member of the Tax Policy Subcommittee. Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, the voters told them: The party’s over. Go home. But before going home, they want to go big with another big, irresponsible national debtbusting bill. Republicans are struggling to stuff just a little more silver in their donors’ pockets as they get pushed out the Capitol door. Republicans are ending this session the very same way they began it in January of last year, with arrogance, with duplicity, with total indifference to the needs of working families across our country. And this bill comes from the ‘‘Great Cover Up Committee,’’ the committee that covers up as much of its tax work as possible from the public; the committee that secretly changes the tax law to directly benefit the Trump family; and the committee that refuses to even review, under existing law, the Trump tax returns; the committee that believes in overlook, not oversight of the corruption that pervades this Trump administration. Since Trump took office, the Republicans have feverishly pursued two goals: Take away healthcare from the many, and award the few with more tax benefits. Last Friday, a Republican judge in Texas ruled that they can take away the coverage. He declared the entire act of the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional. And so what is the response today from the actions of our indicted Texas 
As I look across to the other side, I think we are all the same. I can remember, as a child growing up, sitting down and making up a list and sending it off to the North Pole, telling Santa Claus everything I wanted. But I can remember coming down on Christmas morning, and I never got everything I wanted, but I was really thankful for everything I got. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman. Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, this is bipartisan. This is who we are. If we cannot secure the future for those who have done so much for us, what are we doing here? This is a wonderful opportunity for us to act at a time of year when it is much more important to give than it is to receive. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER ). Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I listened to my friend from Pennsylvania talking about bipartisan opportunities, things we agree on. You know, the railroad tax credit is something that we could have done in a heartbeat, but unfortunately, it is wrapped into a really embarrassing piece of legislation, which is a fitting symbol to the wrapup of 8 years of Republican rule of the House Ways and Means Committee. We are in the process of again making the Tax Code more complex, which they have done every year they have been in control: talk about tax simplification, make it more complex. Those complexities were for people who actually needed it the least. We have lavished massive tax cuts on the most welloff in this country and done nothing to reduce the growing income inequality. They have assaulted the Affordable Care Act and actually put it at risk. I hear about the improvement of IRS customer service. For 8 years, they have assaulted the IRS in their war against taxes, and they have used taxpayers as the hostages. Employees there haven’t had the resources to be able to deal meaningfully with the everincreasing Tax Code to help taxpayers with their premiums. They have had no time to listen to the American public. You have seen major tax bills after major tax bills with no public hearings, no expert witnesses, no opportunity to really try that bipartisanship. Mr. Speaker, I reflect now on our friend PAUL RYAN, who is leaving office, and what a sad note to end on. The Federal Government in November spent twice as much as it took in. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from Oregon. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, after hearing PAULRYANtalk for years about deficits on the Ways and Means Committee and on the Budget Committee, he leaves a legacy of exploding deficits. You talk about burdens for our children: $2.3 trillion extra of national debt. Think for a moment: We can’t balance the budget when times are as good as they are and unemployment is as low. We have had 8 years of increasing employment. I was just in the Cloakroom while Donald Trump was spouting off on TV, and I was watching as the Dow Jones plunged over 500 points. It is a verdict on the reckless Republican leadership in tax and spending, and they are leaving Democrats with serious problems to address. But I know, under our chairman and Democratic leadership, we will at least listen to the American public. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has again expired. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, we will allow the public to know what we are voting on, and we will actually be able to start building on the foundation of things that make a difference: rebuilding and renewing America, closing the income gap, allowing those most fortunate in our economy to be able to pay a little more so that we don’t have to sacrifice services for the elderly, the poor, and students, and be able to rebuild and renew this country. I am looking forward to that opportunity for Democrats to take control, and this sorry Congress cannot end fast enough. Mr. Speaker, I urge rejection of this proposal. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I recognize, under a Democrat majority, every American will be taller and smarter and better looking. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. HOLDING ), who helped lead legislation dealing with disaster relief. Mr. HOLDING. Mr. Speaker, I rise to urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill. This is a broad package, including a host of strong policy proposals supported by both Republicans and Democrats in both Chambers. If I may, Mr. Speaker, I would like to touch upon two specific parts of the bill. As you know, my home State of North Carolina was devastated by Hurricane Florence this past September. The damage is widespread, and the recovery efforts will take years. Folks impacted are in need of help, which is why I am grateful this package includes my legislation that I introduced with Mr. RICE, providing significant tax relief to individuals and businesses hurt by Hurricane Florence. Better yet, we have expanded the scope of my bill to include countless Americans who have been impacted by several natural disasters that have befallen our Nation 
Specifically, this legislation will enact penaltyfree access to retirement savings and provide tax incentives for employers and small businesses to ensure they keep employees on the payrolls. It will also make it easier for folks to claim tax deductions for the cost of destroyed property and will encourage people across the country to donate to recovery efforts by suspending limits on charitable contributions. Altogether, this bill will lessen the tax burden on folks impacted by natural disasters so they can use more of their money to recover, rebuild, and get back on their feet. This is one piece of a larger disaster relief package, and I am so glad to see it moving forward in this overall bill. The second provision I would like to briefly highlight is an important one that will assist lowincome taxpayers with issues concerning the IRS. Taxes are already a major burden on lowincome individuals living paycheck to paycheck, and the last thing they need to have to do is worry about dealing with the bureaucracy of the IRS. So lowincome taxpayer clinics provide much needed relief guidance and support to lowincome individuals, providing them with representation for the IRS or in court on audits, appeals, and other tax disputes. They provide this for a very low fee. So I am glad these provisions are included in the overall package, and I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the overall package. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PASCRELL ), the always erudite Mr. PASCRELL . Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, the bill before us today did not go through committee like a bill this large should. We could have offered amendments to address some of the most pressing issues with this tax bill. I would have started with how this bill cherrypicks winners and losers, with many of the losers being in States like the State I live in, the State of New Jersey. This is, again, let me repeat, ‘‘Weekend at Bernie’s.’’ They prop up the dead tax bill, make it look alive, and then they bring in something that makes it look even more dead. That didn’t work; this will not work. You didn’t run on it; you will not run on this. b1615 Our State got slammed by the new cap on the State and local tax deduction, better known as SALT, State and local taxes, the oldest deduction in the books. The GOP tax scam took money from homeowners and communities in my State and others to fund their massive giveaway to big corporations. The data is there. It is clear. It is succinct. It is definitive. Republicans even bragged about using their tax scam to hurt New Jersey and the region. Imagine that. Imagine bragging about deliberately hurting millions of people. My amendment would have restored this critical deduction, but it was blocked. This bill before us today provides targeted relief to victims of disasters, but only a select few. There have been 13 disasters since we last held a committee meeting on a tax bill, and I 
don’t see them listed here, not to mention the tax relief that victims of Hurricane Sandy never received in the first place. There is a bill that would provide disaster tax relief to all federally declared disaster areas automatically, which it should be, so we don’t have to play these partisan games of picking and choosing. If we want to help people, let’s vote on it. There are provisions in this bill that I would have supported, but our chairman made no such attempt to reach us. In fact, we didn’t have any witnesses. In fact, we didn’t have any hearings. How about that for democracy? Instead, this is nearly $100 billion. It is unpaid for; you are very good at that. It is undebated; you think you know all of the answers. And it is very, very partisan. So much for reaching out. And most important, it utterly ignores the needs of workers in this country. Mr. Speaker, did you hear that General Motors just announced 14,700 workers are losing their jobs? Does this bill do anything to address that? No. In fact, the underlying tax bill they are trying to fix today—remember Bernie?—did nothing to help those workers either. General Motors moves American jobs to China and Mexico. They will be paying a lower tax rate for the pleasure, from 21 percent to a minimum of just 10.5 percent. How do you justify that? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from New Jersey. Mr. PASCRELL. And we continue to let them deduct the cost—get this. We allow them to deduct the cost of moving their operations overseas. How unAmerican do you get? We need to stop that. There is a bill, by the way, to do that, if you noticed. If you can believe it, General Motors saved more than $150 million so far this year thanks to the GOP tax scam, and they appear to have benefited by as much as $6.5 billion by the tax holiday for offshore cash hidden in this GOP bill. The data is clear, Mr. Speaker. Read it. Yet here they are shipping jobs overseas just in time for the holidays. You might think after they were repudiated at the ballot box that Republicans would show some humility and extend a hand to work with us, reach out. No. All they could do is smile and say: Bernie, it is your year. Don’t worry about it. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. PAULSEN ), an outstanding key member of the Ways and Means Committee. Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I want to first speak, in general, in support of this tax package overall, which includes some very, very good tax policy. But I want to highlight and specifically draw attention to one very important provision, a bipartisan provision, and that is a further delay of the medical device tax for a 5 year period. My preference, Mr. Speaker, would have been to have a permanent repeal of the device tax, but I understand you have to compromise on things, and that is a good compromise, so 5 years is what we get. And look, during a period of time when there are very few issues that a lot of policymakers, unfortunately, in Congress can agree upon, there is no doubt that there has been strong, bipartisan, broadbased support to repeal and eliminate a very bad policy that was put in place as a part of ObamaCare and repealing this device tax. This is about making sure that our Nation, our country, America, continues to lead the world in this important ecosystem that is central to improving patient care and also creating highquality jobs. We all know the medical device industry in America is truly an American success story. It is a Minnesota success story. I can speak to the 400,000 people around the country who are directly employed. I can speak to the 35,000 folks who are employed in Minnesota in this industry. And these are hundreds and hundreds of companies, by the way, Mr. Speaker, that I have had the chance to visit and tour, companies you may have never heard of. They may have 5 employees or 10 employees, but every single one of them has that doctor, that engineer, that entrepreneur who is working to improve or help save lives for patients. The device tax, however, unfortunately, caused the loss of about 29,000 jobs as it was put in place. Back this last July, Members will recall that the House voted, overwhelmingly—bipartisan support—to permanently repeal this device tax with historic levels of support, both Republicans and Democrats. Nearly 300 Members voted together to get rid of it. It is really about protecting innovation, and it is about protecting small businesses. Eighty percent of medical device companies have less than 50 employees, and 93 percent of these companies have less than 500 employees who have good, highpaying jobs. We are also a net exporter, exporting around the world in this industry. The Affordable Care Act, Mr. Speaker, imposed a new 2.3 percent excise tax on all medical devices. It doesn’t sound like much, but keep in mind, this is not a tax on profits. It is a tax on your sales; it is a tax on your revenue; and that is where we saw the negative impact, because it already takes 8 to 10 years for these companies to become profitable in the first place. They deal with FDA regulation, and they deal with reimbursement issues. This raised the bar. This raised the hurdle. It made it much more difficult for these companies to become profitable in the first place. It is about giving predictability and giving certainty for these companies so that they can continue to help innovate and help patients. That is what it is really about, making sure that new, lifeimproving and lifesaving products are coming to market. I visited and met with engineers, technicians, owners, and entrepreneurs of these companies who work day in and day out coming up with the ideas for the innovation that really makes America the forefront leader. Mr. Speaker, I would encourage support for this bill. It is a good compromise, and it makes sense. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. JUDY CHU), wellknown for her financial acumen. Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 88. This bill contains a provision that can only be described as sneaky. It is an antichoice provision that has no place in a tax bill. It tries to circumvent our Supreme Court and redefine ‘‘person’’ by allowing parents to open 529 college savings accounts for unborn children. Actually, this provision is unnecessary because, under current law, parents can already do this. They can open 529 college savings accounts for future children in their own name and then change the name of the beneficiary after the birth of their child. But the implications of adding ‘‘unborn child’’ directly into the Tax Code are serious. This is a thinly veiled attempt to codify the legal concept of the unborn child and, therefore, claim that, legally, the fetus is separate from the mother. This language has appeared in Republican tax bills before, and antichoice extremists did not attempt to hide its reason for its inclusion. When this provision appeared in the House version of H.R. 1, the GOP tax scam, the spokesperson for the antichoice group March for Life stated publicly: 
We hope that this is the first step in expanding the child tax credit to include unborn children as well. 
This is an obvious attempt to lay the legal groundwork for undermining a woman’s constitutional right to an abortion. It is an outright attack on women’s reproductive rights. Right before Republicans must turn over control of the House to Democrats and before a record number of Congresswomen are sworn in, Republicans are making a lastditch effort to erode women’s constitutional rights to control their own bodies in order to score one last point for an extremist base, and all in a bill that they know is dead on arrival in the Senate. Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to reject this bill and vote ‘‘no.’’ Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. MAST). 
Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, this is not a debate on education, but I am worried about the ability of my colleagues to add. As we talk about tax and rates and terms thrown out about things like ‘‘irresponsible’’ and ‘‘giveaways,’’ I think it is incumbent that we reflect on those terms and what that actually means. When we think about the rates that were passed, you think about somebody’s rate going from 15 percent down to 12 percent, or from 25 percent down to 22 percent, or from 28 percent down to 24 percent, and you think about that as an overall of a 10 percentage point move. Or you think about the top three brackets coming down from 39.6 percent down to 37 percent. Or going down another point below that, maybe a 3.6 percent decrease, total, on the top three brackets, and 10 percent on the bottom four brackets. That is not an inequitable distribution of those tax cuts. You think about the term being thrown around when somebody says it is a giveaway. When somebody says that it is a giveaway to allow somebody to keep more of their earnings, what they are saying, fundamentally, is that a person’s earnings don’t belong to them; they belong to the Federal Government, and the Federal Government can give those earnings back to them. That is not the truth. All of the earnings, the work of somebody’s hands, the fruits of somebody’s labor, those are the earnings of the individual, and they are good enough to give the Federal Government some of those dollars to go out there and function. When you think about that term ‘‘irresponsible,’’ what my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are saying is that it is irresponsible to allow somebody to keep more of the fruits of their labor. I rise in support of this bill. I encourage my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to reflect about the things that they are saying, the lies that they are literally out there saying. I hope that they can go to work for the American people instead of going to work online. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, we don’t object to the three brackets being lowered for the American people in the middle class. We object to the idea that there were no hearings on this and the top brackets were reduced, doubling the estate tax exemption, cutting the top rate from 39.6 percent to 37 percent. If you want to do that for people at the very end of the economic scale, we are in. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON  LEE). Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I think it is interesting to suggest that anyone is telling an untruth when 24 hours ago this House committed to passing a CR to stop the government from being shut down and the United States Senate passed it without objection to keep the government open. Here we are now, with the government on the verge of closing because the President owns it, and we are talking about a bill that creates $53 billion in deficit and does not help the middle class and small businesses and has a pox on women as relates to choice. What kind of crisis are my friends trying to build a few days before we rise to take leadership as a majority in the 116th Congress? Maybe we should have hearings, but maybe we should stop this bill altogether and get back to keeping the government open and passing a continuing resolution so that the working people in all of these agencies, including Border Patrol agents and others, can do their job. This is an insanity that keeps on growing. Mr. President, let’s stop doing this and keep the government open, and let’s have hearings on this tax bill to ensure that we do what is right for small businesses, working families, and women of America. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to address their remarks to the Chair. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, could we have clarification as to how much time is remaining on each side. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Massachusetts has 61⁄2 minutes remaining. The gentleman from Texas has 8
1⁄2minutes remaining. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ ). Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the bill and, in particular, opposition to section 407, which would, essentially, repeal the Johnson amendment. The Johnson amendment protects the integrity and independence of charities and houses of worship by ensuring that they do not endorse or oppose political candidates. One of the characteristics of American religious institutions that has made them so sacred is that they are separate from government and separate from campaign profits. b1630 If Americans want to get involved in partisan elections, we know how to do that, but what we are seeking when we attend church, synagogue, mosque, temple, or any or house of worship is something quite different. This distinction has long been reflected in how our law treats religious institutions differently than political institutions, to preserve their sacred place in American society, houses of worship must stay above the political fray, and refrain from endorsing candidates for political office. Current law strikes as balance, and it is important to emphasize what houses of worship with taxexempt status can do: they are permitted to advocate for policies that are consistent with their values, and they can help their members become engaged in the political process by organizing events, registering voters, and getting them to the polls. They just can’t tell people who to vote for. It is no surprise that a wide array of religious organizations and faith leaders support the Johnson amendment and oppose section 407 of this bill, out of an understandable concern that political parties and candidates seeking power would be empowered to use their congregations as tools and pressure them for their endorsements. I think we can all agree that Americans have had enough of political partisanship. They do not want more of it, and they certainly don’t want it in their houses of worship where so many seek refuge from the tumult and chaos of their daytoday life. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the bill for this and many other reasons. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. ESTES). Mr. ESTES of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Retirement, Savings, and Other Tax Relief Act of 2018. In a long overdue move, and one with strong bipartisan support, this bill modernizes the IRS and improves the efficiency of the agency in dealing with taxpayers. As one of the only former State treasurers in Congress, I understand our need for our country’s tax collection agency to adopt a culture of customer service and to help taxpayers file taxes, retrieve information, resolve issues, and make payments. In addition to reforming the IRS, this bill also provides needed certainty to businesses by making certain tax cuts permanent, and extending others so that families and businesses know what to expect from our Tax Code in the future. While our economy is booming, businesses of every size I meet with in my district in Kansas consistently say that the number one thing they need from Washington is certainty. We owe it to job creators and workers to provide that certainty so that they can provide for other expansions and other decisionmaking. To support workers and families, this bill makes it easier for businesses to provide retirement plans for more employees who previously did not have access to them, and allows families to save more for retirement. To support entrepreneurs and small businesses, this bill will allow new companies to write off more of their initial startup cost and allow startups to expand easier and faster without hitting limits on certain tax benefits like that for research and development. Finally, this legislation also helps victims impacted by the recent wildfires, hurricanes, and other natural disasters by allowing victims to access retirement accounts without penalty 
costs will exceed revenues every year for the foreseeable future. The only way these benefits can be paid going forward is if the Trust Fund borrows from taxpayers. Congress designed the Black Lung Benefits Act to be financed by a tax on coal production—not the taxpayers. Another consequence of failing to act is that the accumulated debt will pile up each year. The Trust Fund will have to borrow to also pay debt service and interest costs each year. When the debt reaches the breaking point, the only solution is a taxpayer bailout. It is irresponsible to allow the coal industry to privatize gains and socialize the costs. Although black lung disease had been on the decline after the passage of the 1969 Coal Act, in recent years it has returned with a vengeance. Recent studies show that rates of black lung disease have reached 25 percent in Appalachia. The rates of progressive massive fibrosis, the most severe form of black lung disease, are now at epidemic levels, and are now being diagnosed in younger miners. Treating these miners will require costly medical care. Mr. Speaker, allowing the excise tax rate to expire does a great disservice to coal miners, their families, and taxpayers. I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill. Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois, Mr. Speaker, again, I stand on this Floor and oppose the myopic, Republican mission that asks hard working Americans to pay for wasteful tax cuts for wealthy corporations. With baby boomers retiring and needing security, the first Republican tax cuts seriously damaged the health of the Medicare Trust Fund. This bill is more of the same—exploding the deficit and threatening Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare. After decades of wage stagnation—when over 41 million laborers earn less than $12 an hour, when almost none of their employers offer health insurance, when more than one quarter of Americans struggle to cover housing costs—the Republican bill preferences health care industries over lower health care costs for consumers. Rather than fixing their Failed Tax Law’s harmful provisions toward hardworking Americans, this bill makes fixes for industry moguls. This bill fails to roll back the double taxation on residents in Illinois via the cap on the State and Local Income Tax Deduction. This bill fails to restore the personal exemptions taken from millions of families with children. This bill fails to help home owners whose houses lost value by capping the mortgage interest deduction. Rather than helping all Americans affected by disasters, the Republicans are picking and choosing which disaster victims that they feel deserve relief. Rather than uniting Americans, this bill seeks to divide our places of worship by allowing churches and religious organizations to make political statements. People in Chicago expect government to help real people. I oppose this dangerous bill that threatens the economic security of our country and citizenry. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 1180, the previous question is ordered. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BRADY ). The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. f 
FURTHER MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE A further message from the Senate by Ms. Lasky, one of its clerks, announced that the Senate has passed a bill of the following title in which the concurrence of the House is requested: 
S. 3277. An act to reduce regulatory burdens and streamline processes related to commercial space activities, and for other purposes. f 
REPORT ON RESOLUTION PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF SENATE AMENDMENT TO HOUSE AMENDMENT TO SENATE AMENDMENT TO H.R. 695, CHILD PROTECTION IMPROVEMENTS ACT OF 2017 Mr. COLE, from the Committee on Rules, submitted a privileged report (Rept. No. 115–1090) on the resolution (H. Res. 1183) providing for consideration of the Senate amendment to the House amendment to the Senate amendment to the bill (H.R. 695) to amend the National Child Protection Act of 1993 to establish a voluntary national criminal history background check system and criminal history review program for certain individuals who, related to their employment, have access to children, the elderly, or individuals with disabilities, and for other purposes, which was referred to the House Calendar and ordered to be printed. 
PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF SENATE AMENDMENT TO HOUSE AMENDMENT TO SENATE AMENDMENT TO H.R. 695, CHILD PROTECTION IMPROVEMENTS ACT OF 2017 Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 1183 and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: 
H. R ES. 1183 Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in order to take from the Speaker’s table the bill (H.R. 695) to amend the National Child Protection Act of 1993 to establish a voluntary national criminal history background check system and criminal history review program for certain individuals who, related to their employment, have access to children, the elderly, or individuals with disabilities, and for other purposes, with the Senate amendment to the House amendment to the Senate amendment thereto, and to consider in the House, without intervention of any point of order, a motion offered by the chair of the Committee on Appropriations or his designee that the House concur in the Senate amendment to the House amendment to the Senate amendment with an amendment consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 11588. The Senate amendment and the motion shall be considered as read. The motion shall be debatable for one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Appropriations. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the motion to its adoption without intervening motion. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Oklahoma is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN ), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. b1645 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Oklahoma? There was no objection. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, today the Rules Committee met and reported a rule for consideration of the Further Additional Continuing Appropriations Act, 2019. The rule provides for 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee. Mr. Speaker, the appropriations package in front of us represents the fourth appropriations package to fully fund the government for fiscal year 2019. While the Congress has completed its work with respect to almost 75 percent of total discretionary spending, including, notably, the Department of Defense, Health and Human Services, Education, and Labor, roughly 25 percent of this discretionary spending remains outstanding. Today’s bill will provide a shortterm continuing resolution to February 8, 2019, to ensure that the entirety of the Federal Government remains open and operating while the Congress continues its work. I have said on numerous occasions both on this floor and elsewhere that continuing resolutions are not the best way to fund the government, but allowing the government to shut down, even in part, is much costlier and much worse. It is our obligation to our constituents to keep all of the government open and operating to provide needed services to them. Mr. Speaker, from an appropriations perspective, this year has been remarkably successful. Earlier this year, we sent 5 of the 12 appropriations bills to the President for his signature before the beginning of the fiscal year. That is the best record in 22 years. 
With hard work from both sides of the aisle in both Houses of Congress, our earlier efforts represented a return to regular order and to the normal legislative process. For us to drop the ball now, at the end of the year and at the end of this Congress, would negate much of the good work that has already been done this year. As I have said so often on this floor, the primary obligation of the Congress is to fund the American Government and to keep it open and operating. The American people deserve no less. With this package under consideration today, Congress will do just that with respect to 7 of the 12 main spending bills: Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies; Commerce, Justice, Science, and the Related Agencies; Financial Services and General Government; Homeland Security; Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies; State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs; and, finally, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies. As my colleagues can see from this list, the group of bills covers a broad array of vital government programs the American people rely upon. It includes key departments like the Department of Homeland Security, the Food and Drug Administration, the Border Patrol, and the State Department. It covers services like funding roads, operating security checkpoints at airports, passport services, food inspection services, importation and exportation of goods and services, banking services, and thousands of other important government functions. Perhaps just as importantly, it covers approximately 800,000 employees, about half of whom would need to be furloughed and about half of whom would likely be deemed essential and be required to work without a guarantee of pay. While continuing resolutions are in no way, shape, or form the best way to do business, the measure before us today will at least ensure that the government remains open and operating and will continue to provide the needed services for our Nation and our constituents. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the coming weeks to complete our work on funding the government for fiscal year 2019. Importantly, this bill also includes funding for disaster relief and to secure the border. The American people have made their voices heard, and they have told us time and time again that they want additional border security. To that end, this bill appropriates $5 billion for the purpose of securing the border. Finally, Mr. Speaker, this bill also appropriates $7.8 billion for disaster relief. As we have seen time and again in places like New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, the East Coast after Hurricane Sandy, and my own hometown of Moore, Oklahoma, after devastating tornadoes, disasters require a helping hand. By appropriating these funds we offer our fellow Americans who have been afflicted by disasters the help that they need and require. Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the rule and the underlying legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. (Mr. MCGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE), my good friend, for yielding me the customary 30 minutes. Let me begin, Mr. Speaker, by again thanking my colleague from Oklahoma for the work that he and other appropriators did to try to keep the government running. We are here right now not because of the appropriators. We are here right now because Donald Trump has made a mess of things. Mr. Speaker, it is surreal that we are here today, days before the end of a Congress, hours before onequarter of the Federal Government runs out of money, scrambling to keep the lights on at the brink of the third Republican government shutdown this year, because we are not dealing with divided government. Republicans today control not only this Chamber, but also the Senate and the White House. They have been fighting among themselves for weeks over whether and how to keep the Government of the United States open for business. It would be comical if it weren’t so serious. This proposal that we are being given right now is not a solution. It is a political temper tantrum all to please one man: the person sitting at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. It doesn’t solve the disagreements in this Chamber or the Senate, and it doesn’t prevent the shutdown America is facing. This President and this majority ran on fear during the last election: fear of immigrants, fear of those seeking asylum, and fear of anyone who doesn’t look exactly like them. What happened, Mr. Speaker? They were resoundingly rejected. The American people chose a different course. They don’t want a government that reacts only to the wants of the President’s evershrinking base, the small segment of society that actually supports his offensive border wall. Let me remind my colleagues, according to polling, Americans, by a 2 to1 margin, want the President to compromise on the wall to avoid a shutdown. This proposal is exactly what the President may want, but it is precisely what the American people rejected. The Senate passed a bipartisan continuing resolution to keep the lights on. This House was prepared to pass it until the President’s latest outburst. Governing by tweet isn’t governing at all. If the President’s most senior advisers are Fox & Friends and Rush Limbaugh, maybe we shouldn’t be surprised when we find ourselves here today. But this morning, this House came together to pass sameday authority so the majority could move quickly on a bipartisan, shortterm continuing resolution. Democrats joined our Republican colleagues in this effort to provide the tools needed to keep the lights on. This is how you are using them? This isn’t a serious plan. To even vote for disaster relief, this bill requires you to support the President’s offensive wall. Democrats and the American people have already rejected this false choice. This wall is a medieval solution to a 21st century problem. What is next, Mr. Speaker, money for a moat around MaraLago? This will not become law, what we are doing right now. This is a waste of time. If it even passes here—which is a big if—it is dead on arrival in the Senate. I say to my friend: The clock is ticking. Let’s get to work on a clean bill that can make it to the President. This isn’t that. This is just offensive. Again, let me remind those in this Chamber the Senate, in a bipartisan way, came together by a voice vote and supported a continuing resolution, a clean CR, to keep the government running for 7 weeks. That is it. It is all we are proposing here today. This Chamber can’t even do that. This is a disgrace. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject it, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I want to make a couple of comments before I yield to my friend from Alabama and fellow Rules Committee member for 3 minutes. Let me just quickly point out that we are really talking about border security here. This clearly isn’t simply a wall. Frankly, there is not enough money involved here. This is a matter of providing additional security. It is important to note the Border Patrol union itself fully supports what the President is trying to do. This is the type of thing they have asked us to provide them so that they can provide us with the security that we tasked them to give to the American people. The disaster relief is something I think probably both sides should be able to agree on. We know there is a genuine disaster. We have had fires, and we have got hurricane relief. I have a very detailed summary here of all the various items that would be taken care of. I would be more than happy to provide that to my friend. That is something that we should do before we go home. That is something, frankly, Americans have a right to count on. I remember—and I was with my friends in this endeavor—during the Sandy debate and how desperately we needed aid at that point in time and how severe the reaction was when Congress went home without getting that done and came back in January. I 
think the reaction was appropriate. So this disaster relief is extraordinarily important, and I hope that we focus on that in our debate as well. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Alabama (Mr. BYRNE ), who is a fellow member of the Rules Committee. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I want to add my support to this rule. When did protecting the American people—knowing who is entering our country and having a secure border— become some kind of radical or partisan idea? I am stunned to see the length to which some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will go simply to oppose enhanced border security, including a border wall. In fact, it seems they are willing to shut down the Federal Government instead of supporting President Trump’s urgent request for $5 billion to fund the border wall. What is especially strange is that some of my colleagues on the other side have already supported a wall in the past. Some have even voted in support of a border wall. What has changed? I think the answer is very simple. I think some of my colleagues are so committed to appeasing the socalled resistance that they find themselves opposing a very basic and commonsense idea like border security just because they want to earn points from the most extreme part of their political base. This is really not a complicated issue. This is about the safety and security of the American people. This is about keeping terrorists out of our country. This is about keeping illegal drugs out of our country. This is about keeping criminals out of our country. This shouldn’t be hard. Why am I so passionate about this? Because this is a critical issue. When I talk to the people I represent back in Alabama, they are passionate about it. This is one of the top issues I hear about at events and townhalls throughout Alabama. In fact, the phones in my office have been ringing all day with people urging us to stand strong, secure our borders, and build the wall. Mr. Speaker, I think this is a fight worth fighting. I think pushing to ensure the safety of the American people is worthy, and it is absolutely a critical fight. So I urge my colleagues to stop playing to the resistance. Come back toward a commonsense idea like securing our border. Pass this amendment. Pass this funding bill, and ensure the safety of the American people. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, if I could just respond to my colleague, if I thought for one second building a stupid wall would somehow secure our borders, I would be for it. But every expert I have talked to, including people on the border, say they need more personnel and say we ought to invest more in electronic equipment to surveil our borders. I don’t know of a wall that has ever been built that people haven’t climbed over or dug under. This is ridiculous. By the way, when the President campaigned, he said that he wanted to build a wall and that Mexico was going to pay for it. Now he wants to build a wall that by all accounts is going to be useless in terms of protecting our borders, and he wants the American taxpayers to pay for it. Well, you have $5 billion. How about rebuilding our roads and our bridges that are crumbling in this country? If you have got $5 billion that you don’t care what you do with, how about investing it in affordable housing? Or how about dealing with the issue of climate change? Or how about making sure that some of the 40 millionplus Americans in this country who don’t have enough to eat have food? Wasting money on something so ridiculous is offensive. So we want border security. We are happy to work with you on enhanced border security, but this isn’t it. This is a campaign slogan. This is a waste of taxpayer money. It is ridiculous. It is embarrassing. For the President to want to shut down the government over this is disgraceful. By the way, on the disaster package, just so my colleagues understand this, the disaster package in this bill does not include $600 million in nutrition assistance for Puerto Rico. So unless this Congress takes immediate action, 1.4 million of our fellow citizens of Puerto Rico stand to suffer deep cuts in food assistance, causing many of them to go hungry. That is shameful. Where is the help for them? b1700 Of course, we should pass a clean CR to ensure that our government remains open. But my friend talked about disaster assistance, and I just wanted to point out that one thing that is missing in their disaster package is the nutrition money for our fellow citizens of Puerto Rico. I am sure there are others. We are rushing this thing through. There is no transparency here. We thought we had a deal to keep the government open for 7 weeks. Then, all of a sudden, I guess the President tuned into ‘‘Fox and Friends’’ and changed his mind. You don’t know where this President is going to be daytoday or hourtohour or minutetominute. But he is the guy who said that he would be proud to own a shutdown. Well, I think it would be a disaster for this country to have another shutdown. I think it would be expensive. I think we should to do everything we can to avoid it, and that is why we ought to send a clean CR back to the Senate. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I just want to make a couple of comments with regard to the statement my good friend made. We are actually talking, really, in a sense, not about not $5 billion. We are talking about $3.3 billion. The Senate bill that passed actually added $1.7 billion, which is a tacit admission that physical barriers do make a difference. We all agree that the amount of money we are talking about here would not build an entire wall. Quite the opposite, it would just provide some physical barriers at points along the border that are weak and need additional security. My friend says that nobody is interested in this. Frankly, the border security unions are. The Border Patrol has endorsed the President’s proposal. The men and women we have tasked to defend our borders tell us this is something that they need. They have gone so far as to say they would support a government shutdown. I hope we don’t have that. I am not for a government shutdown. I never have been for a government shutdown. But this is not an extraordinary amount of money in a bill, frankly, that totals well over $250 billion, when you add up all the spending. And being able to put additional security there is important. To my friend’s point about Puerto Rico, I think that is a good point. I think that is a fair point to make. We should probably go back and take a look at that. I do know that Americans desperately need assistance in a variety of areas, Puerto Rico included. Agriculture help is necessary, as well as help for rebuilding military installations and schools that have been destroyed. Why can’t we get that done? This is a very substantial package. There is actually more money in this bill for disaster relief for American citizens than there is for additional border security. So I think this is an eminently sensible proposal. Mr. Speaker, I urge its adoption and the adoption of the rule, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I don’t really want to prolong this debate much longer here. Every day with this administration is another selfmade crisis, another demonstration of bad faith. No one can trust what comes out of the White House, what the President says. His word is worthless. And here we are, as evidence of that fact. Mr. Speaker, the government is set to run out of money tomorrow. We are running out of time to act. But, apparently, this is exactly what President Trump wants. Last week, he said he would be ‘‘proud to shut down the government.’’ Today, he confirmed he wouldn’t even sign a clean CR to keep our government open for just a few more weeks. It is irresponsible and abhorrent to attach funding for his offensive border wall to a bill to keep the lights on. 
That is why, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up the Senate amendment to H.R. 695, which is the clean CR that has already passed the Senate by a voice vote. Every Democrat and every Republican stood together and passed the CR. It wasn’t controversial over there. Somehow, it is controversial here. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the RECORD , along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Massachusetts? There was no objection. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. MITCHELL ), my good friend. Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, we all took an oath. I know we remember that oath—for me, it was pretty meaningful; it was my first oath of office— to keep our citizens safe, to protect them, protect them at our borders, protect them in the case of disasters. In fact, in the past, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have supported a border wall, border protection. But now, since the name ‘‘President Trump’’ is on it, it is evil; it is bad. How politically convenient. I remind you of the oath we took to protect the citizens in this Nation whom, apparently, we are so ready to toss aside when it is politically expedient. You talk about a deal that was made. The Senate may have made whatever deal they wished to make. I am unaware that we work for the United States Senate, Mr. Speaker. I represent the people of the 10th Congressional District, and I will tell you what they say. They want our borders secure. They want us to take care of people in disasters. There are heartaches for the folks in Florida, George, and California who were devastated by disasters. They ask why we can’t fund disaster relief for those people. Please, let’s not talk about a deal that was made in the other House, because we are not responsible to them. We are responsible to the people who elected us. One last point: We are at this point of struggling over keeping the government open—and let’s be honest about it, it is part of the government. The other side of the aisle talks about shutting down the government. It is about 20 percent, 25 percent of the government. We are at this point because the Senate won’t make a deal that doesn’t protect the fairly tenuous position that the future Speaker has on the other side of the aisle, and she doesn’t want to make a deal. I spent 35 years in private business. Compromise is the way it works. A compromise was offered and summarily rejected within minutes in the Senate by Mr. SCHUMER and then by Ms. PELOSI . I urge my colleagues to support the rule, pass the resolution, and send it back to the Senate and tell them to do their job. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I just respond to the gentleman that we are all for compromise. This 7week CR is a compromise. The clean CR is a compromise. In a bipartisan way, unanimously in the United States Senate, they accepted it. The President said he was for it. Then he changed his mind after watching ‘‘Fox and Friends’’ or listening to some rightwing radio host. The gentleman talks about protecting the border. We want to protect the border. We want to invest money in things that will actually protect the border, not in a press release, not in a sound bite, not in something that is a total waste of money, like a wall. But what about the fact that the President is going to shut the government down over a stupid wall and that means that the men and women who work for the Department of Homeland Security, the people who protect our borders, will not get paid, and we are not going to support them? One of my Republican colleagues, when he was faced with that question, said: ‘‘It’s actually part of what you do when you sign up for any public service position.’’ Really? That is how we treat and respect the men and women who are charged with protecting our borders? We turn our backs on them during the holiday season? Merry Christmas. We are not going to pay you. What they need, if you go to the border and talk to them, are more personnel. They want us to invest in more electronic equipment to help them surveil the border. They will tell you that this idea of a wall is dumb. It doesn’t work. It is not going to protect this country. It is a waste of money. We had a deal to move this CR forward, and the President changed his mind. He reneged on his word. He didn’t keep his promise. And here we are. So, as Republicans fight with Republicans here in the House, thankfully, the Senate, in a bipartisan way, came up with a solution. There was a compromise. Democrats are willing to support that compromise. But, somehow, it is not enough. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON  LEE). Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I know what it is like to be waiting on disaster aid and not getting it. Among other things, this potential or socalled disaster aid is missing dollars needed by the people of Puerto Rico. I walked the streets and saw how desperate the need was. It doesn’t even include the $600 million in assistance for Puerto Rico to deal with food nutrition. I remember, in the time of Hurricane Harvey, we begged for an extension for the food nutrition program called Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, and in 3 days, we served 30,000 people. You have to feel the pain to understand. Really, Mr. Speaker, this is a sham and a shame, because Republicans are in the United States Senate—let the American people understand that—and they fostered this compromise. They came together. They have sent it to the President. They spoke to the President. The President agreed that we would do it in this manner and that we would look at this issue on the other side of 2019. What happened here? A callous disregard of Border Patrol agents; callous disregard of Customs and Border Protection; callous disregard of the National Guard and the military who are down at the border, who are out there every day; and a callous disregard of Jakelin, the 7yearold who died because we don’t have adequate health facilities, medical care, medevac, and the kind of decent living conditions— yes, decent—that are warranted. We are shutting down Commerce and Justice. We don’t have enough judges at the border. We don’t have enough judges to deal with the asylum cases. So if these folks want border security, it is not just a wall. It is technology. It is the agents. It is understanding that human beings are coming across the border. It is medical care. It is, as well, the security that we need. So I am here to say, Mr. Speaker, as I close, what a sham and a shame. Let’s get the Senate bill and put it on the floor. Yesterday, I introduced H.R. 7332 that says no American tax dollars will be paid for the wall. Mexico will pay for it. Border security will be based upon technology, personnel, and barriers. Let’s pass that bill and pass the CR from the Senate. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, sometimes, in the heat of debate, it is easy to miss what the real essence of the dispute is. When I vote for the rule—and I don’t expect my friend to vote for the rule; that is always a partisan exercise—but when I vote for the underlying legislation, I will actually be voting to fund the government. If my friends vote ‘‘no,’’ they will be voting not to fund the government. So if they are worried about funding the government, all they have to do is vote for this bill, because it funds the government. The second thing I will be voting for is disaster relief. My friends have said that there are other areas that are worthy of relief. That is probably true. I don’t have any quarrel with that. But I wouldn’t vote against this disaster relief because it wasn’t enough. I would 
vote for this and then try to get additional in the time that we have remaining. Finally, I will be voting for enhanced border security. We all know we have a problem. We all know that our border is not as secure as we would like. There is a debate over wall versus no wall. This really isn’t a wall. The wall would be $25 billion. Our friends have offered $1.7 billion. The President has been the one who has compromised, who has come back with $5 billion. So we are talking about $3.3 billion for various physical barriers at spots that we all agree would almost certainly work, done with the cooperation of our own people at Homeland Security. Finally, we are talking about not paying border agents. Border agents have told us this is what they need. That is what their union has said. That is what their elected representatives said. We want to do what the President has proposed. The President isn’t shutting down the government. The President is willing to sign legislation that funds all the government. He has asked for disaster relief, something that should not be controversial in this Chamber, in my view, but sometimes is. Finally, he has asked for an awfully modest amount of money to provide additional security along the border that the Border Patrol itself has asked for. That is really what is at issue. b1715 So when you vote against this legislation, you will be the ones voting to shut down the government, not the President, not my colleagues in this Chamber, not the Senate and whatever they decide to do in their infinite wisdom, but a ‘‘no’’ vote on the underlying legislation is a vote to shut down the government. A ‘‘yes’’ vote for the rule, which my friends would differ with, and that is fair enough, but a ‘‘yes’’ vote for the underlying legislation is the vote to keep the government open, take care of the disasters that we are faced with, and provide modest additional support for our border agents and Border Patrol. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I just need to correct the RECORD on a few things here. It was the President who said he would be proud to shut the government down. My colleague may recall not too long ago the President had a meeting with Speakerdesignate PELOSI and Leader SCHUMER over in the Senate. He bragged about it on camera. The President invited the cameras in, and he said: I would be proud to own a shutdown. That is what he said. So we know where the President stands on this. He doesn’t care about shutting the government down. We should. The gentleman said that votes on rules are always partisan. Well, for the most part they are, but not this morning—not this morning. My Republican friends brought a martial law rule to the floor, which we don’t really like because it basically condenses the process and we don’t have a lot of time to look at things. But nonetheless, we said we would vote for it. Almost every Democrat voted with Republicans to move this socalled martial law rule forward so that we could bring up the Senatepassed continuing resolution today and keep the government running and be able to pay the men and women who protect our borders. So we came in good faith, and we did that. We want border security. We just think wasting billions of dollars on a stupid wall that doesn’t do anything to protect our country is the wrong way to go. So if you want to vote to keep the government open, then you should vote with us to defeat the previous question because, if we defeat the previous question, then I will bring up the Senate passed continuing resolution, and we can all vote for it. We can all keep the government running. We can all go home and have a merry Christmas and a happy new year. That is how simple it is. My Republican friends are bringing a rule to the floor that says that, if you vote for this rule, there is no separate vote on the border wall. It is all together. They know what is going to happen. If it passes the House, it will go over to the Senate, and they are not going to accept this. They have already had a bipartisan compromise. They had a deal with the President until he changed his mind. So if you want to keep the government open, then vote with the Democrats on defeating the previous question, and we will bring up a clean CR and we will do the right thing. We will do what we thought we were going to be doing this morning until the Republicans got into a fight with one another, and here we are. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire of the gentleman how many more speakers he has. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close whenever my friend is. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I am looking at a headline here today. It says: ‘‘U.S. stocks clobbered, with Dow losing nearly 500 points, amid White House drama over government shutdown.’’ Mr. Speaker, creating chaos in the stock market is how a drama queen might act, but it is not how any President should behave. This is totally manufactured by the White House crisis. This is ridiculous that we are at this point, after all the agreements that have been reached in the Senate and, we thought, here in the House. The President turned the TV set on and started watching FOX News and got carried away and now is reneging on his agreement. That is unfortunate. But I would again say to my colleagues: Let us defeat the previous question, and we will bring up a clean CR. We will keep this government open, and we will do the right thing by the American people. And most importantly, we will make sure that the men and women who are protecting our border get paid during this Christmas holiday. It is the right thing to do. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend. As always, it is a spirited debate, and I want to be the first to say he is exactly right on a point he made. He did, earlier today, actually help me on this side of the aisle. I was evidently much more persuasive this morning than I have been this afternoon. But my friend is exactly right. On many occasions we have worked together, and I want to thank him for that. I also want to review just quickly what I see, at least, Mr. Speaker, as the main issues here. Number one, we all say we agree we want to keep the government funded, and I believe we all do. We don’t believe in government shutdowns. We all believe the government ought to be funded. The underlying legislation does exactly that. I think all of us, on both sides of the aisle, care about Americans who have been hurt in disasters, and we have shown that time and time again. We have struggled on occasion, but we generally get aid to where it is needed; and if we overlook somebody, we try and come back and do that again. This bill makes a goodfaith effort to provide billions of dollars in assistance to Americans who need it through no fault of their own, who have been ravaged by fire, who have been damaged by hurricanes, who face a variety of disasters, not just in the United States, but in the territories as well. If, again, we have overlooked something, we should go back and try and take care of that as well. Finally, it provides a very modest amount of money. Remember, this package, together, is over $250 billion. The difference between the two sides— unless my friends object to disaster relief, which I doubt they do—to be fair, is really $3.3 billion. That is what the President thinks he needs, an additional expenditure along the border, or $5 billion if you want to characterize it that way. But the difference between the two sides is only $3.3 billion. That doesn’t build a wall. We have been told the President is uncompromising. He is not uncompromising. He has been, for 2 years, talking about an 
elaborate border security of $25 billion. This is 5, not 25. This would not build a wall, but this would provide additional security. We all know there are points along the way where physical barriers matter and make a difference. I think that is what the President is asking for. My friends worry, and rightly so, about people not getting paid during a government shutdown, which I hope we avoid, quite frankly. But the men and women on the border have asked the President to do this. They support what he is trying to do. When we send troops into combat, I listen to what they have to say and what they need. So does this Congress, and it tries to provide it. We put people in a difficult situation along the border, and they tell us these are the sorts of tools they need. The President is trying to respond in this case, and I think we should support him in that effort. So, Mr. Speaker, I want to encourage all Members to support the rule. Today’s bill represents the next step toward fulfilling our primary obligation as Members of Congress to fund the government. While continuing resolutions are never the best way to fund the government, today’s measure will allow us to keep the entire government open and operating and providing needed services for our country and our constituents until February 8 of 2019. This measure will give Congress the time it needs to complete the rest of our work and fully fund the government through the end of fiscal year 2019. I want to applaud my colleagues for their work. The material previously referred to by Mr. MCGOVERN is as follows: 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous question. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered.

b1824 So (twothirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the Senate amendments were concurred in. The result of the vote was announced as above recorded. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. CHILD PROTECTION IMPROVEMENTS ACT OF 2017 Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1183, I call up the bill (H.R. 695) to amend the National Child Protection Act of 1993 to establish a voluntary national criminal history background check system and criminal history review program for certain individuals who, related to their employment, have access to children, the elderly, or individuals with disabilities, and for other purposes, with the Senate amendment thereto, and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. BYRNE ). The Clerk will designate the Senate amendment to the House amendment to the Senate amendment. Senate amendment to the House amendment to the Senate amendment: 
Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the motion. The text of the motion is as follows: 
Mr. Frelinghuysen moves that the House concur in the Senate amendment to the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 695 with an amendment consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 115–88. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 1183, the amendment consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 115–88 shall be considered as read. The text of the House amendment to the Senate amendment to the bill is as follows: 
OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE  For an additional amount for ‘‘Operation and Maintenance’’ for necessary expenses to dredge Federal navigation projects in response to, and repair damages to Corps of Engineers Federal 
FOREST AND RANGELAND RESEARCH  For an additional amount for ‘‘Forest and Rangeland Research’’ for necessary expenses related to the consequences of Hurricanes Florence and Michael, and calendar year 2018 wildfires, $1,000,000, to remain available until 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The motion shall be debatable for 1 hour, equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Appropriations. The gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN ) and the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. LOWEY ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey. b1830 Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 695, a bill making further additional continuing appropriations for the fiscal year 2019. This measure keeps our government open until February 8, 2019, and prevents a costly, destabilizing government shutdown. This continuing resolution reflects the House position on 
border security and provides $5 billion for the construction of physical barriers at our borders. This is the same amount that was provided in the Homeland Security funding bill approved by the House Appropriations Committee back in July of this year. In addition, this legislation includes $7.8 billion in supplemental funding for disaster relief. Congress has always been responsive to hurricanes, and wildfires, and typhoons, and other natural disasters. We must continue to do so to help our fellow Americans as they rebuild their lives and livelihoods. I don’t support a government shutdown, and I never have. Americans deserve stability and predictability of a government that is 100 percent operational. I would have much preferred to complete negotiations on our remaining seven bills with our Senate counterparts, but there were several very challenging issues that remained. As I stated before, a continuing resolution is the last resort when it comes to funding the Federal Government. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this bill, and I urge the Senate to do the same, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, last night, the Senate unanimously passed legislation that would fund our government through February 8. Democrats are disappointed that Congress would kick the can down the road once again; yet, we remain willing to pass that bill to keep the government open. Unfortunately, even that simple, stopgap measure is apparently unacceptable to a President hellbent on shutting down the government over his wasteful wall. And instead of showing leadership and moving forward with the Senate legislation, despite the President’s tweets, House Republicans have caved once again to Trump’s political whims. They now have put up this grab bag of legislation that wastes taxpayer dollars, fails to meet the urgent needs of disaster victims, and, frankly, is dead on arrival in the Senate. With all the challenges facing our country, from soaring healthcare costs to crumbling infrastructure, it is inconceivable that Republicans want to spend $5.7 billion on an unnecessary wall that President Trump himself promised Mexico would pay for. Moreover, the disaster supplemental attached to this bill shortchanges nutrition needs in Puerto Rico, needs that were apparent 16 months ago. Republicans have continued their pattern of denying science by grossly underfunding mitigation and resilience against future disasters caused by climate change. Mr. Speaker, this bill is nothing but another attempt by lameduck Republicans to appease President Trump. It is a fitting final act for the most chaotic and dysfunctional Congress in modern history. Mr. Speaker, I oppose this reckless and irresponsible bill. I urge my colleagues to reject this legislation, and, instead, pass the Senate’s clean CR. Keep our government open, and prevent a Trump shutdown. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DUNN). Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, just over 2 months ago, Hurricane Michael ravaged the panhandle of Florida. It was a devastating Category 4.9 storm, which damaged more than 90 percent of Tyndall Air Force Base, decimated our agriculture industry, and destroyed entire communities. Mr. Speaker, the folks back home in my district, the Second District of Florida, are hurting. This supplemental disaster relief funding is a downpayment on getting the hardworking folks in my district back on their feet. This funding, by no means, is even close to what we will need to completely rebuild, but it is a start. I commend President Trump for remaining steadfast in his commitment to our Nation. After Hurricane Michael, President Trump and Vice President PENCE came down to the Second District and made it clear that we have their support and we will rebuild. Mr. Speaker, I will continue to fight for the disaster relief funding in the coming months and years because the survivors of Hurricane Michael across the South deserve nothing less. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR ), the ranking member of the Energy and Water Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member, Mrs. LOWEY from New York, for yielding. And here we are, again, and again, and again—in fact, that is the ninth continuing resolution that the Republicans have punted in this Congress rather than getting the job done. This President claims to be a great dealmaker, but what kind of a deal does he even want? He keeps switching the goal posts again and again. It reminds me of a child who flips over a Monopoly board when he realizes he is about to lose. The President’s nonsense is compounded by the dysfunction, sadly, of the House Republicans. They are about to vote on funding a bill that has no chance of becoming law, zero chance of becoming law. All of this because they want to waste money on a border wall that Mexico was supposed to pay for and won’t work anyway because it is 13th century technology. Imagine billions of dollars being able to pay some of the student loan debt around this country, or help our teachers earn better salaries, or pave the roads and bridges around this country that need repair, or invest in good cleanair energy jobs. Take your pick, Mr. President, but $5.7 billion for a wall that won’t even work? No thanks. The American people expect so much more of us in this Congress. Sadly, the Republican leadership and this President are attempting eleventhhour shenanigans to get a wall that voters across this country, clearly, definitely rejected when they sent a new majority to Congress. And, frankly, they can’t get here fast enough. The American people deserve better. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’ Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER ). Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the importance of any funding bill, including funding for the border wall, as well as funding for our communities and farmers who have been hit hard by natural disasters. For those of us representing rural communities, we know how important the agriculture community is, not just to the livelihood of those areas, but to our entire Nation. Our farmers are often the unsung heroes of our Nation, helping to create and maintain the breadbasket that our country is known for. In short, the American farmer feeds the world. It is not by accident that American agriculture produces the safest and most abundant food supply in the world. It is through blood, sweat, and tears over generations. In my home State of Georgia, agriculture is our top industry. Blueberries represent a $1 billion industry across Georgia, and the commodity is the backbone in many of our communities. After several hurricanes and other natural disasters, it is past time that Congress takes a stand to support our agriculture community by addressing their needs. I have been fighting for months to secure the disaster relief needed by our farming community, especially blueberries. Plain and simple, disaster relief funding must be included in any endoftheyear funding package. Georgia has faced devastating weather recently, including hurricanes and freezes. Georgians in every corner of the State are feeling the impact. Whether it is along the coast or southwest Georgia, the need for disaster funding is very much alive. Our number one responsibility is to our constituents, those who have put their faith in us to do what is right for our districts and for our country. For this reason, Congress should stay here until we get this job done. We need border security and we cannot kick the can on disaster funding. I urge my colleagues to help us get this to the finish line and to provide the help that millions of Americans are depending on. Vote for our national security. Vote for our farmers and growers who desperately need disaster assistance. Let’s get this done. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. SERRANO ), 
the ranking member of the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee. Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me this time. For me, this is a very simple thought; it is the same thought I have had all along; this country, of all countries, should not be building a wall. This country, the land of opportunity, the land of freedom, the land where people come to build a new life, should not be building a wall. So what do we do? There isn’t the support necessary for building the wall, for funding it. So at the last minute, we sneak it into a socalled mustpass bill, or otherwise, you shut the government down. But the President has already said that he doesn’t mind taking credit or taking responsibility for shutting this government down. This is very simple. People say, well, there is aid here, disaster aid. We have been dealing with this disaster issue now for over a year, and still, we don’t do the right thing. This is simple for me. We can’t build a wall. This wall will be a waste of money. I don’t know who, but as we speak here, there are people already who know how to get over, through, and under the wall. The wall is not what we need. What we need is immigration reform, and we need another outlook. But, lastly, again, I repeat: of all of the countries in the world, this is the one that can’t go down in history as being the greatest democracy when it builds a wall. And in my city, there is a statue that says: Give me your tired; give me your poor. But not if they come from Mexico. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. WENSTRUP ). Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, our Federal Government was founded for one purpose: to fulfill the charges set forth in the Constitution, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty. Lawmakers take an oath to uphold the Constitution. We fail in our sworn duty if we refuse to ensure the sovereignty, security, and wellbeing of this Nation through secure borders. The situation at the border is a serious problem that demands our immediate attention. It has been constantly brushed aside because somewhere along the way, our conversation about border security got muddled. The wall, border patrol, surveillance of human trafficking routes, all of these have been recast exclusively into the context of immigration policy. Border security is, indeed, a part of immigration policy, but it is much more than that. It is part of keeping drugs off our streets and keeping Americans safe. Our porous borders can allow drugs, cartels, and even terrorists into our Nation. An unsecure border makes it impossible for us to enact meaningful immigration reform as we cannot expect any legal system to work if we do not have control of who is entering. Funding for border security is not a political point. This is about keeping America safe, keeping illicit drugs out of our country, and protecting American families and our own precious lives. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 21⁄2minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. PRICE), the ranking member of the Transportation, House and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee. Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, once again, we find ourselves only hours away from the third Republican shutdown of the Trump Presidency, and we know how we got here. b1845 Seven key appropriations bills, six of them teed up with bipartisan support, could have and should have been passed in September or, for that matter, this very week. Instead, Republicans came up with a 6week continuing resolution, and now they have backed down even on that. Instead of taking ‘‘yes’’ for an answer following last night’s Senate vote on this continuing resolution, the best House Republicans could come up with is a craven attempt to placate the President and his antiimmigrant demagoguery. Despite telling us for years that Mexico would pay for this grandiose border wall, the President and the Speaker have decided that fulfilling this foolhardy campaign promise is worth shutting down the government. The President said so himself last week. ‘‘I will take the mantle,’’ he said. ‘‘I will be the one to shut it down.’’ To add insult to injury, as though throwing billions in taxpayer money at the President’s wall wasn’t bad enough, the Republican majority now has cynically added muchneeded disaster recovery funds in the final hour, despite knowing full well that this bill is no more than a political stunt. Mr. Speaker, we know we need these disaster funds. I have repeatedly stressed the urgency of increased funding for the millions in my State still reeling from disasters. But it is cynical; it is deceptive; and it is cruel to hold the needs of these people hostage to fulfill President Trump’s antiimmigrant wish list. Our Nation faces many pressing needs: disaster recovery and comprehensive immigration reform. But the best Republicans can give us is political games and Twitter tantrums. We have a responsibility to our constituents to keep the government open, and by providing cover to the President’s impulses, my colleagues are failing on that responsibility. So let’s end this charade. Let’s pass the Senate continuing resolution, and let’s fulfill our most basic responsibility, to fund our government. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. ROTHFUS ). Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation, which will continue operations for several Federal agencies and, importantly, appropriate funds to be used in securing the southern border. We have talked for years about securing our border. This is important for the entire Nation. My perspective comes from representing a district hardhit with the opioid epidemic. Mexico and the United States have a mutual interest in securing our border. Heroin, fentanyl, methamphetamines, and other narcotics flow northbound while, importantly, illicit cash is flowing southbound. This illicit cash is fueling a reign of terror by Mexican drug cartels that have murdered more than 200,000 Mexico citizens over the last 10 years, and only 5 percent of them have been prosecuted. They have killed priests. They have killed journalists. They have killed students. And they have killed each other. There are mass graves all over Mexico. Mr. Speaker, we need to secure that border for the benefit of both countries. It is past time we do this, and I ask support for this legislation. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. ROYBAL ALLARD ), who is the ranking member of the Homeland Security Subcommittee. Ms. ROYBALALLARD. Mr. Speaker, Democrats understand the critical responsibility we have to keep our government funded and to serve the needs of the American people. But House Republicans are driving our Nation to the brink of another disastrous government shutdown. Republicans, who control the House, the Senate, and the White House, have the power to keep our government open. Yet, at a time of great economic uncertainty and right in the middle of the holiday season, Republicans are refusing to stand up to the President who made it clear he would be proud to shut down the government if he cannot force American taxpayers to spend billions of dollars on an immoral, ineffective, and expensive wall. The fact is that serious homeland security vulnerabilities will not be addressed if the President is allowed to squander $5.7 billion on a border wall. This includes not being able to hire more law enforcement agents to focus on opioid, gang, trade, and child exploitation investigations; no funding to recapitalize the Coast Guard’s air and sea fleets, including the procurement of our first heavy icebreaker since the 1970s. As Arctic ice recedes, Russia, China, and other countries are winning the race to lay claim to the vast resources of that region where, at times, there is no U.S. presence. 
There will be no funding to hire additional Customs officers to intercept illicit drugs and other contraband, almost all of which comes into our country through the ports of entry. Mr. Speaker, there will be no increased funding for first responder grants to help States and localities better prepare and respond to terrorism and disasters of every kind. All of these funding needs have strong, bipartisan support, yet these critical national security needs simply cannot be met if we waste $5.7 billion on an overly expensive and unnecessary border wall. On election day, the American people sent a message that they want a government that works for them. Unfortunately, House Republicans continue to ignore them and are steering our Nation into a Trump shutdown. The Senate passed a clean, bipartisan CR extension to keep our government open. It is time for House Republicans to do the same on behalf of the American people. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CULBERSON ), who is a member of the House Appropriations Committee. Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will join me tonight in voting for this important bill to keep our word to the American people. Keeping our word to our constituents is one of our most important responsibilities, and the President and those of us who ran to secure the southern border promised that we would see this wall built in those parts of the border where it makes sense. We are relying on the good judgment of our sector chiefs down on the border to tell us whether a fence makes the most sense or a wall or perhaps a weir dam in places on the Rio Grande River where you simply dam up the water. Where the local sector chief believes that is probably the best way to secure the border, we are going to follow that recommendation. But this $5 billion that is set aside in this bill for construction of border fencing and a wall is consistent with what the full Appropriations Committee did this summer. We debated this extensively, Mr. Speaker. We all talked about this. This is not a new number. This is something that the full committee voted on and approved when the Appropriations Committee voted the Homeland Security bill out of committee this summer. This is consistent with what the committee did. This keeps our word to our constituents, and we are also keeping our word to those Americans who suffered as a result of the disasters in California with the wildfires and the flooding that occurred from the hurricanes. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN again for his support of the people of southeast Texas who suffered from Hurricane Harvey. It was my privilege, as the Representative from District Seven in west Houston, to help spearhead that recovery package for Hurricane Harvey that brought together the delegations from Florida and Texas. Mr. Speaker, we put together, with the chairman’s help, the largest hurricane recovery package in the history of the United States and made sure that the people who need that money got it as soon as possible. That is another reason it is so important to pass this bill to make sure the floodravaged people of Florida get the help they need. Above all, this is about keeping our word to our constituents, something I have been proud to do in representing the people of west Houston in District Seven for 18 years. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important piece of legislation tonight. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. LEE), who is a senior member of the Appropriations Committee. Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentlewoman for yielding and for her leadership on so many issues. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening in opposition to this bill. It really is a hateful and unAmerican demand for $5 billion to build President Trump’s border wall. Let’s be clear: President Trump and congressional Republicans aren’t negotiating. They are holding our government hostage and demanding this wasteful, expensive wall as their ransom. Republicans control the House, the Senate, and the White House. Mr. Speaker, you would think that they could at least keep the government open. Instead of passing the Senate passed, clean continuing resolution to prevent a shutdown, Republicans want to vote on this unnecessary border wall. Mr. Speaker, this is completely irresponsible. Federal workers rely on their paychecks, especially during the holidays. People have planned national park trips over the holidays. Is President Trump really going to shut down the American government in the midst of this holiday season during their vacation, during their time with their families? How sinister and mean spirited can the President and our Republican colleagues be? But this wouldn’t be the first time that the Republicans were manufacturing a crisis. The Republicanled shutdown in 2013 cost our economy $24 billion. If President Trump shuts down the government—for the third time this year, I might add—he will sabotage our economy. Instead of pushing forward with this bill, House Republicans should allow a vote on the Senatepassed continuing resolution to keep the government open. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this disastrous bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. JODYB. H ICE). (Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for his great leadership. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill and urge my colleagues to come together in support of securing our Nation’s southern border. We finally now have an opportunity before us that enables us to take a step in resolving the immigration and border crisis, frankly, one that is growing daily in its scope and complexity, largely because of the inaction of this body. But we have the opportunity now to change that. The $5 billion requested by the President is a relatively small amount when we consider the Federal Government’s discretionary spending this year is at a whopping $1.3 trillion. That comes to about $2.5 million a minute. If you do the math, this $5 billion comes to less than 1
1⁄2days’ worth of Federal spending, about 33 hours. To give people some degree of comparison, in late 2016, the Department of Transportation awarded a little over $1 billion in a grant to the city of San Diego to expand its trolley service 11 miles. That is roughly $100 million per mile for something that the DOT estimated only 25,000 people would use. If we can spend $1 billion on a trolley for 11 miles that very few people will even use, then, certainly, we can spend $5 billion to do something that is going to benefit and protect our Nation, our border. Wherever walls have been built on our border, whether we are dealing with San Diego or El Paso or Tucson or wherever, the walls have been effective tremendously. The border wall in itself is no magic bullet. There are some other things we need to do: closing the asylum loopholes, for example; making EVerify mandatory; ending chain migration; and shifting toward a meritbased immigration system. But this is our opportunity to secure the border, and I urge support for the bill. But these other solutions cannot be effective unless we can ensure that our border is secure. These solutions are mutually supportive. It is now or never, Mr. Speaker. We made a promise to the American people and they sent us here to fulfill that promise. This bill also provides some much needed disaster relief for States like Georgia. I urge my colleagues to support the funding bill, to support the President, and—most importantly—to support the American people. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER ), who is the Democratic whip. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. What a sad day. Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN , I feel badly that you are leaving on this note. I know it is not your wish. I know that, if you were in charge, we would have reached agreement. I know, under your leadership, we passed—we didn’t pass them. Six bills were forged in a bipartisan way, not our bills, your bills. Mr. Speaker, the seventh bill is also agreed to, save one item, so that approximately 96 percent of the legislation has been agreed to by both sides, and the United States Senate has passed a continuing resolution based upon those bills by voice vote. Yet here we are, twisting in the wind at 7 p.m. on the day before the government shuts down. What a sad performance. What a regrettable lack of responsibility, how we have undermined the faith of our people, treated the Federal employee terribly, and given cause for the rest of the world to think: What are they doing? There is not one person on the Republican side of the aisle who believes that, if they pass this bill, it will be accepted by the Senate. Not one of you believes that. So we are playing political games here to pander to the President of the United States, who sadly rejected a compromise that was reached by all of us. b1900 The majority leader of your party and the Speaker were for this compromise. We were for this compromise and the Senate was for this compromise. One person, why are we here? I will shut down the government, absolutely. I am proud to shut down the government. That is what the President of the United States said just a few days ago. And today, he put the entire Congress in a tizzy. How sad it is that the Republican leadership of this Congress and the last Congress have consistently been unable to meet their fiscal responsibilities. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Maryland an additional 1 minute. Mr. HOYER. John Boehner brought a bill to open up the government and, sadly, only 78 Republicans would follow their leadership—Mr. Boehner, Mr. Cantor, Mr. MCCARTHY —only 78, and the rest, including the present Director of OMB, voted to keep the government shut down. So I am not surprised that we are here, but it is sad that we are here acting so irresponsibly. If we have one duty as we come here, it is to have our government function effectively for our people. We are failing tonight. This is a pretense. This bill is going nowhere. The Senate won’t accept it. Perhaps the Senate will send it back, amended—perhaps. But we are, we think, adults. Let’s act responsibly. Defeat this bill. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Maine (Mr. POLIQUIN ). Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Speaker, I don’t quite understand what the other side is saying today, talking about politics and being irresponsible and not compassionate. Are you kidding me? Here in the House of Representatives and in the Senate we take an oath to support and defend our Constitution. That means keeping our families safe. There is no more important responsibility, nothing more important than keeping our families safe. That means rebuilding our military, and, yes, it also means securing our borders and knowing who is entering our country. I don’t know why it is so hard to make a distinction between what is legal and what is illegal entry. I come from Maine. We have a 600mile border with Canada. They are great neighbors. But I feel for the people down in the southwest part of our country. It is common sense to secure our borders, know who is entering our country. I will tell you, my heart goes out to these folks who have made their way from Central America to the other side of the border fence with Texas, in Mexico, wanting to come in here. But we don’t know who they are, beyond the fact that we do know, according to Homeland Security, there are 600 folks who have criminal backgrounds. These folks have been offered asylum and work permits by the country of Mexico—every single one of them—and they have refused. Now they want to enter our country. Fine, but they have got to do it legally. In rural Maine, we have been hardhit by the opioid epidemic. There is nothing more difficult than this issue in rural America. Eighty percent of this terrible, cheap heroin—deadly heroin— which is a substitute for the opioid pills comes over that southwest border. The House should pass this bill and secure our borders. It is common sense. The best Christmas gift for America is securing our borders, and I support this bill. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DELAURO ), the ranking member of the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Subcommittee. Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, if the other side of the aisle thought this was such an important bill, they should have brought it to the floor. That is what we do here. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment before us. It is staggering that the Republicans have the United States careening toward another government shutdown. The American people do not want a shutdown. Hundreds of thousands of workers will be sent home. Many others will continue to work without pay. Parks and museums will close down. In fact, according to the estimates by The Connecticut Mirror, this Trump shutdown—and he does own it—could impact as many as 1,500 Federal employees in Connecticut, right before the holidays. The American people don’t want a wall. It does not reflect our values as a nation. Experts are telling us it is not an effective use of taxpayer dollars with regards to maintaining border security. It is money we should be spending on working families, on roads and schools in our communities, not a fence in the desert. It is not just a border wall, which was a nonstarter. Disaster relief provisions of the CR are inadequate. It fails to meet the communities devastated by disaster, risking the future of children who suffer from severe trauma. Communities are still picking up the pieces. It leaves out $600 million of antihunger and nutrition support for women, infants, and children in Puerto Rico. That is unacceptable. The President and the Republicans have two choices: perform the basic job of governing and keep the government open, or perform for Fox News. They have chosen the latter. It is an outrageous tantrum. This is not government for the people and by the people. It is government by tantrum and tweets. Please vote ‘‘no.’’ Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. RICE). Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, opioids and illegal immigration are two cancers of a porous southern border, and my constituents have had enough. Illegal immigration holds down wages and diminishes our middle class. The Democrats say they are for border security; they just don’t want to pay for it—empty words. It is funny, Mr. SCHUMER voted for a border wall in 2006, but he is against it now. Why? Because our President wants it? Empty words. In 2017, 150 people in my district in 2017 were killed by opioid overdoses. My law enforcement agencies tell me that 85 percent of those drugs come across our porous southern border. You say you are for border security, but you don’t want to pay for it— empty words, playing politics. There were 150 people killed in my district. They are in your districts, too. It is a cancer. It doesn’t just affect my district. It is across this entire country. You say you are for border security, and you won’t take any action to stop it. Mr. Speaker, it has gone on long enough. Illegal immigration holds down wages, stretches our social safety net, holds down our middle class. The opioids kill people across our country. It is a cancer and it is growing. It is not even leveling off. It is growing, killing people in my district and yours, too. Empty words, shame on you. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I want to make it clear that most of the opioids, 
the drugs, are coming through the ports of entry. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. BISHOP ), the ranking member of the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Subcommittee. Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, as a legislative body, one of Congress’ core responsibilities is to keep the government open and working for the people. Another core responsibility is to help communities struck by disaster to recover and rebuild. The continuing resolution before us is not a sufficient response to these vital needs. It includes only token disaster relief for rural communities and farmers in middle and southwest Georgia that were devastated by Hurricane Michael and other disasters that occurred in 2018. It does not include a number of provisions that were being negotiated. It only includes $8 million for impacted rural communities, instead of $150 million. It does not change the percentage recovery for crop losses from 85 percent for those with crop insurance to 90 percent and from 65 percent for those without crop insurance to 70 percent. It includes less than half of the estimated need for the Emergency Forest Restoration Program, $200 million instead of $480 million. It does not include the lower threshold for pecan tree mortality to 7.5 percent, but leaves it at the current level of 15 percent, which is totally inadequate. It does not include the most recent estimate for the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands Disaster Nutrition Assistance, which is $8.5 million instead of $9.3 million. Finally, it does not include any of the $600 million for Puerto Rico nutrition assistance. Unfortunately, it does include significant funding for a misguided and wasteful wall on our southwestern border. This wall would do nothing to improve our Nation’s security and is a serious misallocation of taxpayer dollars. It should have been stripped from this important legislation and considered separately. Furthermore, this legislation is dead on arrival in the Senate. We must do better. We must meet the significant needs of my Georgia constituents and Americans across the country who are still rebuilding from Hurricane Michael. We must pass a government bill that would avoid the damage caused by a government shutdown. I urge my colleagues to reject this bill. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. ADERHOLT ), a member of the committee. Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the disaster supplemental package, especially as it relates to agriculture and rural development. As chairman of the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Subcommittee, I worked with the ranking member and other members who represent districts that have been impacted by this historical weather that is related to disasters to support bipartisan relief to the farming and rural communities. From hurricanes to volcano activity, to deadly wildfires, this supplemental provides Federal financial relief to those most negatively impacted by the national disasters. While many of us favor limited government, there are times like these where Federal assistance is needed and is warranted. Members from the Southeast to California, to Hawaii, to communities in between represent districts with agriculture and rural constituents who have suffered devastating losses to their livelihood. In my home State of Alabama, for example, producers of cotton to vegetables have lost everything. In Georgia, Florida, North Carolina, and South Carolina, producers of crop or livestock lost their source of income now and into the future. At a time when hardworking farmers invested limited dollars and countless hours of labor, their livelihoods were wiped out within hours by a onceina lifetime storm. These farmers and producers take financial risks that are unknown to most Americans. Even if the delivery of this critical relief is delayed by the normal administrative process, lenders and bankers must see a signal from the Federal Government that financial support will be coming before the next cropyear. I want to highlight, just briefly, those parts of the package that relate to agriculture and rural communities. The agriculture portion of the bill totals $1.4 billion. A majority of the funding supports the hardworking farmers and ranchers who produce crops and livestock for food on our dinner tables. The package also provides funding for critical watersheds damaged by the hurricanes and fires. Lastly, the funding provides for basic nutritional needs for those who qualify in the Northern Mariana Islands. In closing, I ask my colleagues to support this bill as we build America’s communities impacted by these natural disasters. b1915 Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. MCCOLLUM ), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies. Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this new Republican continuing resolution that is going nowhere. House Republicans continue to cater to every whim and Twitter temper tantrum that the President throws, abdicating their responsibility to the American people. Last night, the Senate passed by voice vote a continuing resolution, and the House was ready to follow suit today. And the President said he would sign it. But, rather than keeping his word, the President appears to have put the demands of conservative pundits over the American people, causing a government shutdown. It is time for Republican leadership to stand up to the President and pass the agreedupon continuing resolution that will bring back economic certainty to our economy. The President has still not used the money that Congress appropriated for border security last year, yet Republicans are ready to give him the same amount of funds this year, and we agreed to that. But there is no reason to waste $5.7 billion on a border wall that experts have stated will not do what the President has promised. Our country faces many challenges— opioid epidemic, increasing effects of climate change, the rising cost of prescription drugs, an infrastructure that is crumbling—and Congress should be working on these issues. So let us stand together. Let us pass a responsible spending bill that will keep the Government open, give our local and State governments, our businesses, and, most importantly, the American people, a sense of stability this holiday season. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are again reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. SCALISE ), the Republican whip. Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the chairman’s leadership on this. Mr. Speaker, this is about keeping America safe. This is not a complicated vote, but it is an important vote that really defines whether or not we are going to stand for border security in this country. For decades it has been promised. There have been bills going back to the 1980s where we were promised that we were going to get a secure border, and it never happened. So now we have a President who ran on this issue. This isn’t something that just popped up. It was front and center during the campaign. He said: I am going to secure the border. I am going to build a wall. The people on the other side, our Democrat friends, said they didn’t want that. Some of them actually said they want open borders. Some on the other side, Mr. Speaker, have said they want to abolish ICE, the very border patrol agents that are keeping the interior of America safe. Who are ICE? Who are the people they want to get rid of, Mr. Speaker? Those ICE agents, last year alone, saved over 900 kids from human trafficking. That is stuff that came across our border. We are a Nation of immigrants and a Nation of laws. My greatgrandparents 
came here from Italy, and I am proud of that. We, by the way, Mr. Speaker, let more than a million people into this country legally every single year. The most generous country in the world. We should be proud of that. For those people who want to say it is a country of closed borders, this is about getting back to rule of law. This is about keeping America safe and saying there is a legal way to come here. President Trump has said that. Even on asylum, he said, if you want to seek asylum, there is a legal way to do it. But it is pretty hard to claim asylum, Mr. Speaker, when you came through Mexico and you forced yourself across that border and Mexico said: We will offer you asylum. We will even offer you work permits and a job—and you said ‘‘no.’’ So it is really hard to say you are claiming asylum here in America when you turned down asylum in Mexico when you were coming across their border. So it is not about asylum. It is about rule of law. What do you say, Mr. Speaker, to the millions of people from other countries all around the world who are waiting—in some cases 10 years, 15 years, 20 years—to come to America legally? They are waiting in these theoretical lines, and they are doing it the right way. Then you have got a few thousand people who say: We are just going to storm across your border regardless. And the President stands up and says: You know what, I want to secure this border. We have a choice to make, Mr. Speaker. Are we going to stand with the President and say we are going to give you the tools to secure the border or not? It is a straightup vote. You are either for border security or you are against border security. Let’s not hide behind it. When you saw that meeting at the White House last week when you had the Senate minority leader and the future Speaker of the House going over to the White House, they didn’t want to give the President money for the wall because they didn’t want to give him a win. You saw them. They were bragging. They just wanted to assign blame: Are you going to take blame for the shutdown? But they said: We don’t want to give you money for the wall. And they have said it since. So if they have got a personality conflict with the President, don’t let the security of this Nation get in the way of that. This President said: This is something I believe in because I care about the American people, and I have a responsibility to keep this country safe. I wish everybody who came here across the border wanted to come here to seek the American Dream. But, Mr. Speaker, we know that there are people that have come across this border with ill intentions for our citizens all across the Nation. Again, I mentioned last year the 900 children who were saved from human trafficking. My colleagues have talked about the opioids, the illegal drugs that come across our border. Mr. Speaker, the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security says, on average, every single day in America, 10 known or suspected terrorists try to come into this country illegally. Some on the other side have said: Oh, the number is not 10. Okay, then, what is your number? How many terrorists coming into this country illegally every single day are enough? I say none. There is a legal way to come here. Those are the people, by the way, that we know of. How many people that want to break our laws, that want to do harm to our citizens, that want to jump in front of other people who are trying to come here to America the right way, how many more people have tried to come across that we don’t know about because we don’t have a secure border? So we have a President who says: I need tools. And, oh, by the way, there are some things that are in law. Right now, we, in law, tell the President where he can and can’t build the wall, what materials he can and can’t use. So he has got ideas. Mr. President has shown ideas of how to actually build a better border security wall at a cheaper cost, and yet the law prohibits him from building it cheaper, in a better way, more efficiently for the American people. How ridiculous is that? So we remove that in this bill and tell the President he can build the wall however he wants, in the most efficient way, to keep America safe. Again, Mr. Speaker, as I close, we have got a choice to make. There is going to be a bill before us in a few minutes that we get to vote on to say, are we going to stand up for the rule of law and keeping this country safe and supporting the President’s ability to secure America’s border or not? You can vote ‘‘yes,’’ or you can vote ‘‘no,’’ but don’t hide behind politics. This isn’t about the personality of the person in the White House. It is whether or not we are going to respect the rule of law and keep America safe. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. RYAN), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Legislative Branch. Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, this has been a really interesting debate, because our friends on the other side, Mr. Speaker, it is like they have amnesia and nothing happened before the election a couple of years ago. All of these promises about a border wall were followed by the cheers and the chants of: And who is going to pay for that wall? And you remember all your fans would stand up: Mexico is going to pay for that wall. Who? Mexico. And here we are today getting ready to shut down the Government over you asking the American taxpayer to pay for this border wall. And then some of you even are saying that we have hollow words, that our words don’t mean anything, when this President is going back on the promise that he made. He said Mexico was going to pay for it. He said it at the rallies. He was in Ohio. He was in the swing States. And now he is going back on his word on that. And he just went back on his word where he promised the entire Senate he was going to support the continuing resolution, and you are calling us and saying our words are hollow. Are you kidding me? Now, look, I am for border security. I am for border security. But I am not for a wall. You know what, I like cars, too. I am for cars. I am not for the Model T. I like planes. I don’t want a glider that was designed and built by Wilbur Wright. I like my phone, but I don’t want to go back and get the rotary dial out. You guys are living in the past. And this Government is in chaos. It is in a freefall. The market is in a freefall. The staffing at the White House is in a freefall. The Secretary of Defense is gone. We are pulling out of Syria. What is going on? You are in charge of the House, the Senate, and the White House. Get a grip, and learn how to govern the country. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded that they should direct their comments to the Chair, and, once again, Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President; otherwise, they will be ruled out of order. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ ), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies. Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this legislation. We are at this point because of President Trump’s recklessness and House Republicans’ refusal to govern responsibly. We are already nearly 3 months behind schedule on completing the fiscal year 2019 appropriations bills. Mr. Speaker, Democrats would prefer to get our work done instead of kicking the can down the road. However, it appears that the only thing that seemed possible for us to accomplish before adjourning for the holidays was to pass the CR until February 8 that the Senate passed unanimously last night. However, after another Twitter tantrum, House Republicans are once again catering to Trump’s worst impulses with this terrible bill. This bill wastes billions of taxpayer dollars, fails to fully address the urgent needs of disaster victims, and will fail in the Senate. It is a waste of time for us to consider it. 
Our country faces many pressing needs, and there is simply no reason to waste $5.7 billion on President Trump’s immoral, unnecessary, irresponsible wall. Mr. Speaker, $5.7 billion would completely rebuild Tyndall Air Force Base, rebase the F–22s and F–35s, and completely rebuild all damaged Marine Corps facilities in North Carolina with money to spare. These are facilities and equipment that were wiped out by Hurricane Michael. The disaster supplemental funds in this bill are designed to be a sweetener but aren’t even enough to give us a toothache. Democrats have always been willing to negotiate how best to secure our border, but we will not support the President’s boondoggle vanity project that Mexico was supposed to pay for. Likewise, we strongly support a comprehensive disaster supplemental, but this bill completely fails to address mitigation and resilience efforts that will prevent future disasters. We are now less than 36 hours from another Trump government shutdown. Democrats were prepared to bail out Republicans once again by providing the votes to pass a clean CR, yet they can’t take ‘‘yes’’ for an answer. No wonder voters have said they have had enough. This is no time for political games. It is time to go home for the holidays. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are yet again reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT ). Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, we hear references to an ‘‘immoral’’ wall. We have heard ‘‘wall’’ demonized. Yet, I read yesterday that President Obama, in his new house, has constructed a 10 foot wall around his property. Now, either the walls work or they don’t. And if we are going to have Democrats continue to say they don’t work, then you need to stand up and say: Mr. Obama, tear down your wall. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. QUIGLEY ), the ranking member of the Financial Services Subcommittee. b1930 Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, your point is well taken. I will address my remarks to the Chair. Mr. Speaker, the arguments we have heard tonight remind us of the tale full of sound and fury signifying nothing, reminding us who told us that tale. Every border chief since the border chief under President Reagan has said a wall will deter a crosser from somewhere between 90 seconds and 3 minutes. Mr. Speaker, $5 billion for that. If they really want to protect our country, and that is what they are so bent on doing in spending $5 billion, my subcommittee can help you. In January of 2017, with a high degree of certainty, the entire intelligence community said the Russians attacked our democratic process. We are not prepared for their next attack. DNI Coats warned that the lights are flashing red. We spent $380 million on election security in 2018—nothing since then. Mr. Speaker, 40 States do not even have sufficient equipment to put on software that blocks this hacking. Mr. Speaker, 13 States don’t even have a paper trail. The last time our democratic process was called into question for such matters was during Bush Gore, where this very body spent $3.5 billion to protect its integrity. We can—we must—do better. By the way, you have control of the House and Senate. You don’t need to yell at us, folks. You can yell at your own caucus. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, Democrats support strong, smart border security, but we will not allow Republicans to fleece American taxpayers by making them pay $5.7 billion for Trump’s ineffective wall. I remind my friends that 88 percent of opioids seized come through the port of entry. Let’s get the facts on the table. I will say my other comment includes praising Chairman FRELING HUYSEN for his distinguished career in public service, for the debates on a bill that has an actual chance at becoming law. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to vote ‘‘yes’’ on the bill, to keep the government open until February 8, to support critical border security, which is badly needed, and to look after the needs of so many Americans who have suffered from so many disasters over this past year. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 1183, the previous question is ordered. The question is on the motion by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN ). The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, this 15 minute vote on the motion will be followed by a 5minute vote on the motion to suspend the rules and pass H.R. 6602, if ordered.

SUICIDE HELP LINE (Mr. ROTHFUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, as we approach the holidays, I want to take a moment to talk about a difficult subject: suicide. Suicide is epidemic in our Nation. According to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, suicide is currently the tenth leading cause of death in the United States, ending 48,000 lives in 2017. For those who are suffering, you need to know you are not alone and there are many who care about you. There is hope for healing. Every person was created for a purpose, though it may be difficult at times for a person to find that purpose. 
One of the most basic, and often most effective, ways to help prevent suicide is to ensure that our loved ones, friends, colleagues, and anyone else in our lives feels connected and has a sense of belonging. There is great virtue in reaching out to the marginalized and neglected, especially young people who may be lonely or bullied. For those who are despondent and having suicidal thoughts, services like the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is vital. The hotline is a free support service available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week: 1–800–273–8255, 1–800–273– TALK. As we enter this season of hope, let those who are hopeless encounter the encouragement that everyone needs. 
CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, during this holiday season, I am baffled as to why and how we have gotten here to this place. In the last 24 hours, a tweet went out from the White House that would end the Syrian war, to the opposition of the national security team—General Mattis, the Secretary of State, the National Security Advisor, and others who thought that a tweet ending the war was never heard of in the history of the United States. In the course of these 24 hours, we are in the midst of a political collapse, a catastrophic collapse, and a shutting down of the government. Included in the shutting down of the government will be the funding for the State Department and Homeland Security. It is clear that we are at a constitutional crisis, one that requires the attentiveness of this body, and to recognize the leaving and retiring of General Mattis, who has indicated: Maybe you can have a Secretary of Defense that fits your thinking. What thinking? And then to hear from North Korea: Maybe you can remove the troops off of our borders. This is a time for us to speak up, to protect the American people, and not a time to shut the government down. I hope the President is listening. 
THE IMPROVING HEALTH OF THE STATE OF MAINE (Mr. POLIQUIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Speaker, during this joyful time of year, I would like to give thanks for the improving health of my great State of Maine. Because we have cut taxes and regulations, our small businesses are growing and hiring more workers and paying them more. Maine’s 2.7 percent unemployment is the lowest rate in 50 years. We are rebuilding our military to keep our families safe, while supporting 6,000 shipbuilders at Bath Iron Works. We have passed legislation that guts online human trafficking, which protects our daughters and our sons. We have made the biggest financial commitment ever to combat the opioid epidemic, giving thousands of struggling Mainers hope for recovery and better lives. Child poverty in Maine is dropping, while education is closer to home, where it belongs. We have strengthened Social Security and Medicare so our seniors have more peace of mind. Our veterans, our beloved veterans, are now able to receive their healthcare closer to home, and our small hospitals that provide those services must get paid on time; otherwise, interest accrues on the outstanding bills. And Maine’s pristine natural environment is living up to our brand: Vacationland. The way life should be. Mr. Speaker, Maine families are doing better and better, and I am grateful to have the opportunity to help. Merry Christmas and happy holidays to all, and may God always bless the United States of America and our great State of Maine. f 
b2015 RECOGNIZING LINDEN PUBLIC SCHOOLS CAROLING FOR A CAUSE (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the students, faculty, staff, and friends of Linden Public Schools in New Jersey for spreading holiday cheer while helping those in need. Each year, members of the Linden Public Schools load into buses with Santa Claus and travel through their town to sing carols and collect donations for a charity gift drive. Staff and students put their hearts into planning the event, which they call Caroling for a Cause. This year, they collected more than 1,000 gifts from across the community. Those gifts will help bring smiles to the faces of more than 300 children. Mr. Speaker, this is the season of giving, and the Linden Public Schools are leading by example. I thank the students, faculty, and staff who participated. And I applaud Superintendent Danny Robertozzi for supporting Caroling for a Cause. I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing everyone who participated. They are helping make sure their friends and their neighbors in need have a Merry Christmas and happy holidays. COMMENDING REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP FOR LISTENING (Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I commend our Republican leadership today for listening to our conference and putting back into the continued resolution the needed disaster relief for the southern States and for the West Coast, and the border security measure demanded by most Americans in this country. To not do so, to just accept the product that the Senate punted over here, would have been a travesty and a dereliction of our duties here, I think, in the U.S. House of Representatives. These are very important things that need to be done and need to be accomplished, with the caravan amassing on our southern border and the security measures that, although heroically done so far by our Border Patrol folks, need to be augmented with this asset. Heaven knows, our southern States, having been affected by hurricanes; and farmers depending on decisions to be made in this place; and, on the West Coast, with the fires in my own district, the stability needed from the funding that would come from a disaster relief package, I am really pleased to see the work of the House today put this back out there and send it over to the Senate, where I hope they will have the guts to actually deal with it. 
DEMANDING VIETNAMESE GOVERNMENT RELEASE MICHAEL NGUYEN The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. BERGMAN ). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. ALGREEN ) is recognized for half the time until 10 p.m. as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the leadership on both sides of the aisle for extending this opportunity for us to speak tonight. This is an important issue for all Americans. I rise tonight on behalf of Mr. Michael Nguyen, an American citizen. Mr. Michael Nguyen, an American citizen who was on a mission of mercy to Vietnam and who is being detained in Vietnam. I would ask that persons please not allow the last name Nguyen cause you to think anything other than the fact that he is an American citizen who makes America the beautiful a more beautiful America. He was on a mission of mercy. He is being detained; being detained without the benefit of bail, something that we routinely expect to be the case in this country; being detained without the benefit of a lawyer, something that we are all entitled to under the Constitution in this country when charged with criminal offenses; being detained 
without the benefit of a speedy trial, something that we take for granted; being detained in Vietnam, Mr. Speaker. This is something that every American ought to be concerned about, when we have one of our own being detained without the benefit of bail, without the benefit of a lawyer, and without the benefit of a speedy trial. Mr. Nguyen is a resident of California’s 45th District, and Mr. Nguyen is being represented by Mrs. WALTERS . Mrs. WALTERS is here tonight. I know that she has been engaged and involved in doing what she can to help extricate Mr. Nguyen from his circumstance. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. MIMI WALTERS ). Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise to demand the Vietnamese Government immediately release Michael Nguyen, an American citizen and Orange County resident who has been unjustly detained for over 5 months. Michael is a loving husband and father of four, a smallbusiness owner, and an active member of his community and church. He has no criminal record in the United States. This summer, while visiting elderly relatives, Michael was arrested by the Vietnamese Government. He is under investigation for allegedly violating article 109 of the Vietnamese criminal code, activities against the government. Article 109 is an arbitrary and vague charge the Vietnamese Government often uses to justify baseless arrests. Michael could be held for months without formal charges as the Vietnamese Government investigates. Despite repeated requests by my office, the Vietnamese have yet to produce any evidence substantiating Michael’s arrest. These unjust actions are further exacerbated by the Vietnamese Government denying Michael’s family’s request to visit him while in prison. During the investigation, the Vietnamese Government permits only monthly visits by the U.S. State Department. These visits are the only opportunity Michael has to hear messages from his loved ones. Mr. Speaker, Michael’s family has been devastated by this ordeal. I had the opportunity to meet with them again just this last week when I was back in Orange County, and I am here tonight on their behalf, to echo their calls for his safe return. The Vietnamese Government has not only denied an innocent man his freedom, it has completely disrupted the lives of a loving wife, four young daughters, and countless friends and family members across the country who are praying for Michael’s homecoming every single day. Michael’s wife, Helen, is a nurse who works long hours with many emergency oncall days. During Michael’s absence, she has been a single mother to their four young daughters. The girls miss their father dearly. His detainment has made it difficult for them to focus on their schoolwork and their extracurricular activities. These girls should not have to spend one more sleepless night worried about their father’s safety. Their entire family has demonstrated incredible strength during this ordeal. I am constantly inspired by their love and devotion to Michael. Mr. Speaker, this unjust detainment has gone on far too long. Michael’s detainment is only the most recent example of Vietnam’s troubling human rights record and lack of transparent legal system. Earlier this year, the Vietnamese Government unjustly detained William Nguyen, an American citizen of no relation to Michael. I am deeply concerned for Michael’s safety and wellbeing, and I demand his release immediately. In the meantime, I call on the Vietnamese Government to allow Michael’s family to visit him in prison. Mr. Speaker, as you can imagine, this time of year is especially difficult for Michael and his family. While most families across our Nation will have the opportunity to spend time together celebrating Christmas, the Nguyen family will cope with Michael’s absence. This Christmas, I pray for good news for the Nguyen family. Michael’s story has touched so many people. Several of my colleagues have heard of Michael’s detainment and have joined in my fight to secure his release. I am grateful for their support and their willingness to join tonight’s Special Order. While I will not be returning to Congress next year, I am confident that my colleagues will continue the fight to bring Michael home. I am extremely grateful for my colleagues’ engagement, and I will continue to support their efforts any way I can as a private citizen. Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for the extraordinary work that she has done to extricate Mr. Nguyen. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. CORREA ), a person who came to Congress and has done an outstanding, great job since he has been here. I don’t know whether he came to be a freedom fighter, but that is how I know him. He really takes a stand against injustice. Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to address this body, and I demand that the Government of Vietnam respect human rights, religious freedom, and international law as it pertains to an American citizen, Michael Nguyen, who is being held without formal charges, under arrest in Vietnam. This unjust imprisonment raises issues, especially since he has never broken the law in the United States. He is a loving father, member of the local church, business owner, and model American citizen. Yet, when he was traveling to Vietnam to visit his elderly relatives, he was arrested. Why? We don’t know. Apparently, he has been arrested for ‘‘activity against the people’s government,’’ yet we don’t know the circumstances or the reasoning. We ask one very simple thing from the Government of Vietnam: to play by the rules, respect human rights, respect religious freedom, and release Mr. Michael Nguyen, an American citizen who is being detained without formal charges. Mr. Speaker, I urge that he be safely released and that he be returned to his family in the United States. Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his powerful words and look forward to our continuing to work together to extricate Mr. Nguyen. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. YOHO), another Member who has been involved and engaged in this process, who has been with us on phone calls when we have talked to our Ambassador to Vietnam, and who has been a party to our contacting the Secretary of State. Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. ALGREEN ) for organizing this Special Order. It is an honor to be here to advocate on behalf of one of America’s citizens. I have the honor of chairing the Asia and the Pacific Subcommittee on Foreign Affairs. I have been to Vietnam, and I got to meet with their Prime Minister, with their ambassadors, and with so many people over there. The Vietnamese people are a wonderful people. They have a society that is a communist society, but it is opening up. Vietnam has made great strides in the last 15 to 20 years, moving in the direction that we would like to see, with an open society, free markets, as much as they can be in a communist country. When I was there, the thing that surprised me was the vibrancy of the people, their outlook on life. They yearn for freedom and liberties, just like all people do. That is an innate thing that our creator has endowed all of us with, that yearning of freedom and liberty. I became aware of Michael Nguyen’s plight. We have intervened on phone calls. We have written letters. We have talked to the incoming chair of ASEAN. We just asked them; I am not going to demand. I am not going to try to have a power game against Vietnam. But what I do want to do is just talk to them, human to human. We have an individual who left Vietnam, adopted America, and become an American citizen. b2030 He has been a model citizen. He is the parent of four children, a family man, a businessman, and he went over to Vietnam with the intent of visiting relatives, elderly relatives, and he got caught up in a situation. We talked to the Ambassador. We talked to people in the legislature from Vietnam and said: I don’t want to 
interfere in Vietnam law, and, certainly, if this guy is involved in what you are saying, by all means, prosecute to the fullest extent of the law because we would do the same thing. But I think what you have here is a case where a person was caught up in something. If you look at his past here and his record here and the people we have talked to in Vietnam, this is a good man. This is a family man that went over there for honorable reasons. And so we asked the people of Vietnam to look into this matter and to address this and do what is right, do the humanly right thing. If you are a parent, if you are married, you have got a mother and father. You have got a spouse. Think of your children. If you were to be removed from your family with no phone calls, no lawyer—and these are things that we value in this country, the liberties and freedoms that we have, that we have had and we have been fighting for over 200 years to preserve and protect. To have that taken away from you is just unthinkable. I know the pain and the suffering that not just Michael Nguyen, but his family is going through. Here we are in the Christmas season, and this is the season that we should all come together. I am asking Vietnam, the leaders of Vietnam to look into this case and to rapidly go through it as fast as we can. Because, like I said in the beginning, we value our relationship. They are our 16th largest trading partner. We have a military agreement where they have allowed our military vessels in there for other reasons for national security. This is something that we want to make sure that our relationship with Vietnam continues to grow. But I can say this: If human rights issues get in, as Mr. GREEN brought up, this is one of our own American citizens. If Vietnam overlooks these things, it is going to be hard for us as a nation to move forward with them in relationships. So I am going to plead with the Vietnamese leadership to expedite the case of Michael Nguyen and to do what is right. Return him back to America. Return him back to his family, and let’s try to do that before the end of the year. I appreciate Mr. GREEN for doing what he has done. He has done a stellar job. And I appreciate all of the Members who have stood up for such people. These are things that happen in Congress that the American people don’t know we do, that they should applaud both sides. This is not a partisan issue. This is an American issue that we all should be proud of that we are fighting for somebody who is an American citizen. I know Vietnam, if they are listening, and I am sure they are, they will do the right thing, and the right thing is to return Michael. Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments, and I want to reiterate what he said about this being a bipartisan issue. This is an issue that crosses the lines that sometimes divide us. There is no chasm between us when it comes to the extrication of Mr. Nguyen. We want him back. I would like to call to the attention of all who are within the sound of my voice, who are viewing this at home, that there is another Member who is not here tonight but who has played a significant role in this effort to bring Mr. Nguyen home. He is Mr. ALAN LOWENTHAL . Mr. L OWENTHAL is from California’s 47th Congressional District, and he has been a real champion on causes such as this. He understands the laws of Vietnam. He understands the culture of Vietnam as well as any, and he has really had a major push to try to get Michael home. I want to thank the gentleman from California (Mr. LOWENTHAL ) for what he has done. While he is not here physically, I do know that he is here in spirit. What has been said about Michael’s detention is correct. Michael is being detained without bail, as has been indicated previously. In Vietnam, unfortunately, the investigation can go on for weeks, months, and can exceed a year. When investigations go on for this length of time and the person being detained does not have the opportunity to visit with family members, is denied access to family members during holiday seasons, such as what is occurring here now in our country, when a person is detained without the benefit of bail, without the benefit of speedy trial, when this happens, unfortunately, the detention itself becomes punishment. The detention itself becomes egregious. The detention itself becomes reason for us to complain to the Government of Vietnam. If you have charges, yes, you should investigate, but you should file your charges. You should not detain and then at some point have some charges brought that may or may not necessitate a long period of additional detention. This is an American citizen. We have expectations. We believe that every country has a right to its autonomy, every country is sovereign unto itself. But we also believe that every country should respect the human rights and dignity of people who are within the confines of their country. Mr. Nguyen has a necessity to be with his family and his four young children. They miss him. They want to be with him. This is their father who is expected to be at home, especially around this time of year when we are all celebrating the holidays, many different holidays, but they are celebrated in this country. We are making an appeal, a human cry, a clarion call to the Government of Vietnam to release this husband, release this father, release this man who has been on missions of mercy to Vietnam to work with his wife as a volunteer when they are helping young children to receive surgery. He has demonstrated his love for the people of Vietnam. He has demonstrated his willingness to go above and beyond, to be of service to the people of Vietnam, and I ask that the Government of Vietnam release him. Let him come home. If you have charges, sure, you should file them; but if not, let’s not allow the investigation to become a form of punishment. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank all of the Members who have appeared on the floor tonight. There are others who would be here, but circumstances do not permit. I want to thank the leadership for allowing us to get this message out to the masses, to the American people, and, hopefully, to officials in Vietnam. I want to thank the Secretary of State and our Ambassador to Vietnam for their intervention. We are all doing as much as we can, but we all have to do more. Until he comes home, we have not done enough. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
RECOGNIZING SPECIAL CONSTITUENTS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. TENNEY ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a few special constituents in my region who deserve recognition. 
Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, this past October, the Mohawk Valley lost a local businessman, leader, and a dear friend when Bill Chanatry, owner of Chanatry’s Hometown Market in Utica, New York, passed away at the age of 89. Bill was raised in Utica and graduated from the highly acclaimed Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute— many of you known as RPI—and enjoyed a 40year career as an engineer, eventually serving in the Army Corps of Engineers in Japan during the Korean war; and later he joined General Electric Aerospace Electronics Division, where he served as a project manager for the U.S. Navy E–2C Surveillance Radar Team in Utica, New York. Chanatry’s, the family grocery store, was founded in 1912 by Bill’s father and his two uncles. In 1991, Bill eventually retired from General Electric, GE, and became the president of Chanatry’s and oversaw a significant expansion and innovation, using his unique skills in engineering to really bring Chanatry’s into the forefront and to maintain it as a family, homeowned business catering to the needs of families in our community. But along with all of these lifelong achievements that Bill had, Bill’s legacy is better defined by his terrific family: his loving wife, Janet; five children, Ameena, Joanne, Michael, Bob, 
and Mark; and, of course, all of their children, grandchildren, and many greatgrandchildren as well. The strong personal relationships that Bill cultivated with so many people in our community are thanks to his integrity, his loyalty, his ultimate belief in the goodness of humankind. Much of the love that he had came from his very strong devotion to faith. He also was known to attend daily mass. He also was such a good friend to so many as he worked in his postretirement, in his postGE life, retirement life at Chanatry. Bill’s son, Mark, a longtime friend of mine, dear friend, stated that his father’s greatest lesson to him when it came to rebuilding the number one grocery store in Utica year after year is simply: ‘‘Chanatry’s business was built on treating people right.’’ And that was Bill’s message. Mark and his family continue that great legacy left by their father, Bill. For anyone who has been to Chanatry’s, it is really hard to imagine walking through the market and not seeing Bill attending to every aspect of the business, taking the time to talk to individuals, to help consumers and people coming in and individual customers, which is something that he did every single day. It was a big part of his life. He was also just hard to miss. He was full of energy, full of excitement, a lot of fun to be around. Our community will dearly miss Bill Chanatry, and especially his friends, his family, and his customers. Mr. Speaker, our entire community really lost a true leader in Bill Chanatry, someone who was always able to innovate and actually reinvent himself, and someone who—I think what is most important—actually made a difference. 
Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, next, I would like to recognize another really terrific person, a dear friend of my family. I would like to honor the incredible life of a man named James VanSlyke of New Hartford, New York. Jim VanSlyke passed away on June 6, 2018, 1 day before his 89th birthday. He is survived by his loving wife of 62 years, Virginia, whom we all know as Ginny; his children, Matt, Patrice, Andy, and Mary; his grandchildren, greatgrandchildren; and nieces and nephews. Hailing from Hamilton, New York, Jim stayed in his hometown after high school, attending Colgate University, also in Hamilton. He received a full academic scholarship and graduated in 1952 with a master’s degree in science. My mother’s hometown also happens to be Hamilton, where she and Jim attended high school together. At Colgate, Jim also met my father, who was a college classmate of his. Immediately following Jim’s graduation from Colgate, Jim went on to serve in the United States Army. After honorably serving our Nation, Jim continued his lifelong journey of service and moved back to Mohawk Valley, where he dedicated 66 years of his life in the town of New Hartford. Upon his return, James began his 31 year career in New Hartford School District, serving as a math and science teacher, a coach, a guidance counselor, and a principal for both the junior high and senior high school. I had a the honor of attending New Hartford High School during his tenure as principal. Back to Mr. VanSlyke, as I always called him. He was respected, sometimes feared, but always a person with common sense and someone who could be relied on for sage advice for many high school students, including me. Later in his life, Jim ventured into another form of public service, where he served seven terms as the town and village justice for the town of New Hartford. Jim was regarded as a knowledgeable, fair, and hardworking man, always making sure that he knew each aspect of the law relevant to the case at hand. b2045 If Jim didn’t know the answer to something, he was quick to admit it and also quick to find the answer. He was willing always to listen to another’s perspective, including other attorneys. His intelligence was selfevident but humbly portrayed. As an attorney, I appeared before Jim on many occasions in court. He always asked me about my family, and especially my mother’s sister, whom he was quite fond of, my Aunt Polly, who was also a classmate at Hamilton High School. Jim was also a very talented high school athlete and a college athlete, as I learned from my mother kind of the hard way. I am always going to remember, there was an article written by someone I actually went to Colgate with, I believe, and it was in Sports Illustrated. It described Jim’s famous son, who is a professional baseball player and also my classmate in high school. He used to sit right behind me, a baseball player named Andy Van Slyke, who many know, who also later became a coach. I remember the article described Jim Van Slyke and Andy as coming from a family with no athletic talent, to which my mother immediately said: 
He was the star of Hamilton High School in every sport, and he went on to Colgate to be a star as well. 
Though Jim never served as a professional athlete like his son, Andy, Jim was a star in all of our minds. He was a terrific person, a great educator, and later in life found a passion for cooking. His culinary skills provided another way to express his deep love for his family by bringing them together at the dining room table. Mr. Speaker, please join me in recognizing the life of one of New Hartford’s greatest educators, Jim Van Slyke. Our community will forever remember the life and legacy of Jim Van Slyke. We will also remember Jim’s sense of humor and his kind and humble manner in every aspect of his life. EXPRESSING GRATITUDE TO CONSTITUENTS , 
Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I now want to just say a few words about my term in the 115th Congress and what an honor and a privilege it has been for me to serve. I want to first thank my constituents who have been terrific. I have really enjoyed my time with them, serving them, and working very hard every day to try to find results—actually excellent results—in the 115th Congress. I think we have reached some unprecedented levels in our last 2 years. I also want to thank my supporters. They were terrific, a lot of fun. It was a great time, a lot of hard work, a lot of anguish, and a lot of frustration. But through it all, they were very tough and hung in there in spite of our loss this past November. A lot of my volunteers, also among the supporters, were terrific. I want to thank them for so much work, so many phone calls, and just a great opportunity to serve with them. I also want to thank a lot of the people in our community who serve in social service agencies who have done so much to help the truly neediest people in our communities. I am grateful that they reached out to me and I was able to give back to them and provide muchneeded resources on the Federal level. I really appreciate their good counsel and care and what they provided to me and my staff in making sure that we were able to understand the issues and bring those issues back to Washington and deliver to our constituents. I wanted to also thank the local officials in my district throughout the community who have been an invaluable resource for bringing issues to the table that needed to be resolved and their hard work, their belief in me and some of the amazing accomplishments we had throughout the eightcounty region and to the many towns and villages, it was really an honor to serve. Some of the resources we brought back to the city were tremendous. So I want to thank them for their sage advice, their counsel, and their good friendship. I hope that we can continue to provide solutions and realize good things for them in the future. Also I thank my friends and my family who have been through a lot in my rather short time in public service. It has been very exciting and filled with a lot of ups and downs, but a lot of challenges. I am just grateful for them to kind of hang in there with me through all of this. I stand here today as a Member of the 115th Congress. I also served three terms in the New York State Assembly. I have been a lifelong Republican. I never missed a vote since I was 18. 
Oddly enough, I have never been endorsed by my local Republican committee for any office I ever sought until this year. So maybe it is bad luck in the end. But I wanted to just say thank you to so many of the rank and file and people who serve in this capacity in both sides, in all parties, in what they bring to the table and how important it is to our constitutional Republic and democratic principles. I want to just say I am grateful to them. Toward that, I also want to just say thank you, especially to my colleagues. You hear so many terrible things about Congress, and I myself thought: What is wrong with these people here? But I have gotten here and realize there really are terrific people who care about this country. They care about their constituents, they care about preserving our constitutional Republic, they care about democratic principles, they care about serving mankind, and they recognize the importance of where we are in the world. I say that about people I have met genuinely on both sides of the aisle, there are really terrific people who serve in this office. I may not agree with everything that they have to say, but they have been really terrific to me. I especially want to thank my freshman class. They have changed my life in so many ways. It has been such an honor, including, Mr. Speaker, a couple of my favorite colleagues here, but I wanted to say that I really appreciate the fact that our freshman class, the incoming class for the 115th Congress, took a very special measure. It was spearheaded by my colleague, Congressman MIKEJOHNSON . We signed a commitment to civility; something that I thought was a really great idea, a terrific idea, something that really meant a lot to us who have signed on to this. We have endeavored to stick to that commitment to civility. I know I have. Among some of the pledges we made was to introduce legislation and make every effort to make sure it was bipartisan. I am honored to say that every piece of legislation that I authored, unless it was district specific, was cosponsored by one of my Democratic colleagues, and I always wanted to get one of my freshman class members when I could. So I am grateful to all the Democrats and the Republicans, everyone who signed that commitment and came forward to try to work on resolutions to stand together and to really work to get to know each other. I think we did make a difference. Unfortunately, it isn’t soundbite worthy. The media didn’t really cover it. But I think it is something people should really look at that makes our class so unique and why we accomplished so much this first term. I really want to just say thank you all to my family. My family has been terrific. They stood through a lot. It was very hard for my family to go through the political process, as ugly as it has become, which is why that commitment to civility is so important and why I was so dedicated to it. It is okay to advance your cause, to argue, and to disagree. I am a lawyer. That is a natural instinct, and that is good. But to make sure in the end that we don’t hold grudges, that we stand for each other and respect each other when we walk away, and I think our freshman class showed that this year. I am honored and proud to be part of that. I am not done, but I think that my colleague from Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON ) would like to say a few words. Mr. Speaker, I yield to Mr. ARRINGTON . Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlelady from New York—and let me say the gentlelady from New York has served these United States so admirably and so effectively and with such dignity and honor. Gentle because she has a big heart soft for this country. She mentioned the civility and the commitment to civil discourse. She was part of leading that effort and leading by example. A gentlelady, she was class every day and in every way in her term in serving the people of New York in her district. Gentlelady from New York, she is a New Yorker, and I am a Texan. The only folk I know who may rival Texas in toughness are New Yorkers. She is tough, she is strong, she is passionate, and she fought every day for her constituents and for this country she loves. So I just wanted to say that it has been an honor and a privilege to serve with CLAUDIA TENNEY , United States Representative, CLAUDIA TENNEY . I am a better person, I am a better servant leader, and I am a better Representative of my people in west Texas because of the time I spent with you. So I know your folks back home are proud, your freshman class—and I will say this on behalf of our freshman class, and I can say it with confidence—you make us proud. We are going to miss you, but I know we haven’t seen the last of you and your service to this country. Ms. TENNEY. Thank you so much Representative ARRINGTON . You are terrific. I might add something about the commitment to civility and why it really reflects who you are also and why it was such an honor to serve with you. I remember all of us having the discussion, the freshman class, with the Democrats. We were at one of our social events, and you were just always the consummate ‘‘let’s get along, let’s be ladies and gentlemen, let’s work together. We have got to do this, because in the end the tables are going to turn. You are going to be in power, and we are not, or you are going to be in the majority, and let’s just not look at that. Let’s go beyond that.’’ I still remember those conversations with you. You are a terrific Member. You served honorably. You have a wonderful family. I really am grateful for your friendship and your support. None of these friendships end here. This is an amazing 2 years in this 115th Congress. I think it was really special. Maybe everybody feels that way when they go to Congress, but I think our group was really different, and I am including the Democrats in that as well. We had a great group, and as we move into 116—I am sorry I am not going to be joining you all—but let’s keep on the tradition of what we have done. Let’s stay together and continue to work to protect our constitutional Republic. I am a huge Lincoln fan, and I have said this many times, certainly in my community, but I look back on some of the tough times that we are facing ahead, and I remember what Lincoln said at one point. I would say the enduring message from his body of work was: Can we save this Republic? Can we save it? Can we be selfgoverning? We can, but we have to work together. We have to fight the fight. We have to stand on our principles and find a way to compromise in the end. I feel like that is what we have done with so many great bills and so many accomplishments. If you look at what happened in the 115th—and I think we can all take credit for this across the board—the accomplishments are something that we haven’t seen in decades in Congress. In just one Congress all of our agenda was passed and done, and much of it was bipartisan. I wish it all were, but maybe as we go into the 116th we can make that happen as well. But I just want to say thank you so much to you and all my colleagues who served with me, whether they are in the freshman class or not, I love you guys. You have been terrific. My life has changed, and my life is better because of my service here and meeting all of you and finding out, yes, there are really good people who serve this Nation, and they are here in Congress— not everybody. But there are a lot of us out there. I am so proud and honored to have been serving here for 2 years and to have met the people I met, whether they are in Congress, whether they are the great staff or the people who work here, the people behind me who we keep up at late hours to do their job, but it has really been an honor. I want to say thank you so much to you. One last thing, I do want to say thank you to—first of all, I want to thank again the chairman of my committee, the Honorable JEB HENSARLING —who is retiring—for his terrific service and great work and what an honor it was to serve on the Financial Services Committee. Also to the staff of the Financial Services Committee, I want to say thank you. They were terrific, and they helped us every day come up with an incredible agenda and very bipartisan work. I am grateful to them to have had a number of bills that were originally sponsored by me that either 
were included in other bills, the S. 2155, or others, and for their help in getting those across the finish line and having five original sponsored bills that ultimately became law. So I want to say thank you to them. I also want to say thank you, last but not least, to my hardworking staff. First of all, I put them in alphabetical order so you don’t know who is better than the other, but I want to say I loved having them on my staff. They did a tremendous job. Let me just say a hearty thank you to my staffers, Hannah Andrews, Alexandra Cade, Haim Engelman, George Iverson, Maria Giurastante—I can never say Maria’s name—Kate Kelly brought me to New Orleans my first time, Samantha LaMarca who was with me from the times in the assembly, Rebecca Lumsden, Patrick O’Brien, Nick Stewart, Robert Simpson, Michael Stademeier, Kathy Vences, Brett Wakeman, and Katie Ziemba. I want to thank so many terrific interns who joined us and inspired us every single day with their excitement, their youth, their enthusiasm, and the fact that they were all so much more technically proficient than I was, so I could just hand them my phone with trust that they could fix whatever it was that was wrong with it. I want to say thank you to them for the hard work and the hours that you put in throughout the last 2 years. It wasn’t easy. We were in a tough position, whether it was the media, whether it was just the position we were in as a targeted seat in the Nation. But you came through. We did terrific work. We made groundbreaking strides in our community. I want to say from the bottom of my heart, thank you to all of you for what you have done and what you have done to serve us and serve my community and always have a servant’s heart as you dealt with all the constituents and the literally, I don’t know if it is thousands, but every time one of my constituents contacted me directly and I got to the message, I copied, I pasted, and I sent it to you, and you reacted and helped the constituent out. b2100 I really am grateful to all of you for doing that because I love the job that I do. I love serving. I love doing this kind of work to help people. For the first time, I really felt like we got to help people in the last 2 years. Again, I want to say the last thank you to my family members: my son and my parents. My parents, who passed away, never got to know that I actually got here. I just want to say thank you to them for instilling in me the integrity, the loyalty to people and the compassion for fellow human beings and for helping this world, and also for the tenacity that I got from my mother, who was really my inspiration. I want to just say one of my favorite quotes that my dad used to always say when I used to be in all the sports I attended, whether it was curling—yes, I am a curler—whether it was basketball, horse shows, equestrian—I did that as well—golf and a lot of sports I got into, my father would quote, when I was disappointed that I didn’t win, from Rudyard Kipling’s poem ‘‘If.’’ I am just going to pick out part of it. ‘‘If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster and treat those two imposters just the same,’’ and the poem goes on. But that is exactly what it is. It isn’t about winning and losing. It is about how you play the game. We did a great job. I want to say thank you, lastly, to my son, who has been my inspiration. I am hoping that I get to see him at Christmas, but I am not sure I will, because he is currently serving as a captain in the Marine Corps. So we are very proud of him in our family for answering the call to serve. But I do want to say thank you so much again to everyone who has been so kind to me. Whether it is Pat and Doris, the ladies in the Lindy Boggs Room, everyone who is working here, it is really a highly professional operation. You hear terrible things about Congress, but it is not true. There are a lot of terrific people that work here that aren’t just Members. They are the people who keep the trains running on time, the people who make this happen. I just want to say thank you again for letting me have this tremendous honor to do what I have done for the last 2 years. I wish everyone the best of luck and God bless. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
STANDING WITH THE PRESIDENT The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON ) for the remainder of the hour. Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I wanted to address this body and commend my Republican colleagues for standing with this President. We are facing a national security crisis on our own homeland, at our borders, and our Commander in Chief has pleaded with us for the resources and tools necessary to secure the border and to protect the American people. The President understands his first job and the first job of the Federal Government, which is to keep its citizens safe. He understands and I believe most Americans understand that the current situation is anything but safe. Mr. Speaker, I am from the great State of Texas. Being a State along the border, I can tell you it is absolutely chaotic. This President has been hamstrung and for too long we have let people pour into this country illegally and we have allowed criminals and gang members and criminal activity and drugs. A lot of bad stuff comes over here and wreaks havoc on our communities on account of us being derelict in our duty to do our first job to provide for the common defense. So, Mr. Speaker, this President has come along at such a time as this—a strong man, a strong leader, who ran on an agenda to put America first and the American people first. That is exactly what he has done. I have never seen a politician more hellbent, more doggedly committed to delivering on what he promised. At the center of those promises and that agenda that he ran on was securing the border and building the wall. I am one who believes that comprehensive border security is more than a wall. I believe it is technology. I believe it is boots on the ground. It is a number of things. If we are going to truly be effective in the long run, we have got to fight this battle on a number of fronts. I believe that the driver of illegal immigration is supply and demand. As long as we have demand in this world for a better life and for the job opportunity and the services that we provide in this country, and as long as we provide the supply of jobs and services to folks who come here illegally, they will continue to come. I do believe that, no matter how high you build a wall, or how long, you have got to turn off the magnets that are drawing people here. Chief among them are hiring people who are not in this country legally. I welcome the freedomloving, lawabiding immigrant. This is a Nation of immigrants. But I will only welcome them if and when they respect our laws, our sovereignty, and the safety of our citizens. We have a process. It is not perfect. We should work on it. We should improve it. But we have a process by which you can legally enter this country, and a million people do that every year. Millions more are standing in line to get a piece of this incredible land of opportunity and all the blessings of liberty that this country offers. So, understand this. The American story and the story of the immigrant are indistinguishable, inseparable. I am proud that we are the leading Nation in terms of immigration and welcoming the immigrant and that we continue to circulate the new blood of those who are hungry for freedom and opportunity into the system, into this country’s bloodstream. It is part of the greatness of America, no doubt. But we are also a Nation of laws. As the President has said, without borders, you don’t have a country. Without security, you don’t have freedom. So we must uphold the laws of the land. We must fix the broken pieces of the immigration system. We must close the loopholes. We must turn off the magnets. And, yes, we must build a wall, a fence, and whatever physical barriers make sense. That physical barrier, that wall, that fence is a fundamental component of comprehensive border security. Most of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have already voted to 
provide resources: $1.6 billion in the last budget. The leader of the Senate Democrats, CHUCK SCHUMER , has voted for 700 miles of fencing along the border. So he, too, has committed and understands and appreciates the need for physical barriers along the border where they make sense. I think we are long overdue to put some common sense in this United States Congress. I am proud that my colleagues, again, on the House side, my Republican colleagues, have continued to drive the agenda of America first and keeping America safe as the first and foremost responsibility of this Federal Government all the way to the end of this 115th Congress. Today was a proud day for me to come alongside of my colleagues and this President and vote for the funding that he has requested for that fundamental component of border security in the wall. I am proud to have done that. I am grateful that we have a leadership that listened. This morning, we had a wonderful meeting. It was wonderful because the leadership listened. Our majority leader, KEVIN MCCARTHY ; our whip, STEVE SCALISE , our outgoing Speaker, PAUL RYAN, listened and allowed the Members to drive the strategy and the decision today to put that funding bill on the floor, to vote for it, and send it over to the Senate. That is our job. I am proud of my colleagues’ passionate and very compelling pleas to the leadership and to our team to make that vote happen today. Today is a great day for America’s security. It is a great day for border States. It is a great day for the citizens who expect their government to do its first job. Mr. Speaker, again, I am grateful for the opportunity to have served in this 115th Congress with the likes of JACK BERGMAN , Representative C LAUDIA  TENNEY , and so many more. I am proud of our freshmen class for restoring civility, the theme of our class with our Democratic colleagues, and I am proud of all the results. In west Texas, leadership, at the end of the day, is about results. If you don’t deliver results, you cannot claim to be a leader. Whether it was rebuilding military or unleashing the full potential of this economy through tax reform and regulatory relief or improving services to our veterans or it was defending our fundamental Godgiven rights, the rule of law, the Constitution, and traditional American values, we have done what we said we would do in this House as Republicans, as conservatives, and as Americans first. I am proud of that. God bless these United States of America, my colleagues, and go west Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. TENNEY ). Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I want to say thank you, again, to my colleague, JODEY ARRINGTON , of west Texas, for his terrific remarks. Yes, we did accomplish basically everything we set out to do in the 115th Congress. I would be remiss if I didn’t mention one more thing that Mr. ARRINGTON  just referenced, the gentleman from Texas, is that every one of us contributed in the freshmen class to perpetuating and finding a new part of our commitment to civility. I just wanted to mention our colleague from Florida, Mr. CHARLIE  CRIST, who actually came up with these nice bands that so many of us wear. It says: Practice the Golden Rule. It is emblematic. We wear them because we are endeavoring to meet our pledge for our commitment to civility. I hope that you all and Congressman CRIST and everyone continues on this great path next year, including both sides of the aisle. I hope everybody works on their commitment to civility. But I want to say thank you again to my colleagues, also to our Speaker pro tempore, the great president of our class, the amazing General JACK BERGMAN , who is now a Member of Congress representing Michigan. I am really honored to be among some of the great people that serve here. I want people to rest assured there are good people in Congress. There really are. Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New York. Again, we salute her service and we are so proud to have served with her, if only for one term. But, again, this is not the last that we have seen of the gentlewoman and her service to this great country. We will certainly carry on our friendship for years and years to come. What a special bond our classmates have, and what a unique privilege our constituents and people back home have given us. And I know the gentlewoman cherishes that. I know she has stewarded that. I wish they could see the gentlewoman every day, because they are already proud, but they don’t know the half of it.
