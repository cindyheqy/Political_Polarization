Ms. BORDALLO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the crew of the USS Frank Cable, a submarine tender homeported at Naval Base Guam. The Frank Cable and her crew were selected for the 2018 Secretary of the Navy’s Environmental Award for large deck combatants in recognition of the crew’s efforts. The Frank Cable crew have worked diligently to minimize waste aboard and helped to clean up local communities, both on Guam and where they are deployed abroad. Caring for our island and conserving Guam’s natural resources are among my top priorities, and I am immensely proud of the Frank Cable crew’s achievement. The Secretary of the Navy’s award this year, plus a second award to the USS Frank Cable, the 2017 Chief of Naval Operations Environmental Excellence Award, are examples of the partnership between the U.S. military and the people of Guam that we need. I, again, applaud the USS Frank Cable crew on their awards, and I hope that the military will continue to act as responsible stewards of our island. 
21ST CENTURY BEAN The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. MARSHALL ) for 5 minutes. Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, if I could today, I would like to share a story about one of my favorite communities in Kansas. At 3,681 feet of elevation, Goodland, Kansas, sits on the border of the KansasColorado line. You can look to the west and see the Rocky Mountains literally rising out of the Earth. Partially because of that elevation and the many hot, dry days there, the farmers have struggled for decades for a great crop. But about 20 years ago, one of my good friends, Alan Townsend, and the farmers who make up 21st Century Bean, started growing pinto beans. They had some success, and then they started growing blackeyed peas and garbanzos as well. Today, 21st Century Bean grows 40 million pounds of beans every day. They had success at that, and they said: You know what else we can do? We can process and package these here. So they formed a processing plant and hired more employees. That was a success. Eventually, they hired a trucking company. They now have their own trucking company to ship their products. Today, and every day, 21st Century Bean ships out enough beans to feed a million people across this country. The great thing is, their main customer is food banks across this great country as well. I am so proud that we have made food banks such a priority in this year’s nutrition bill, the farm bill. This year, we are going to increase spending from $15 million to $60 million for food banks. Some other significant products coming out of this nutrition bill is that we are going to make access to nutrition easier for the elderly, for those in the military, and, what I am especially proud of, we are rewarding children for making healthy choices like fresh vegetables and fresh fruit, as well as the greatest drink known to mankind, wholesome milk. Mr. Speaker, as an OB/GYN for the past 30 years, I certainly know how important nutrition is, from preconception, during pregnancy, breastfeeding moms, and all the way to the last decades of life. I am so proud that this bill has made a priority helping protect 
those on the edges of life: the newborn and the elderly. I am proud that our country spends $115 billion every year to help those who need food assistance and spends another $3 billion of nutrition assistance across the world. But what I am really proud of, though, is this gives everybody on food stamps and nutrition assistance a chance, an opportunity for some type of work training. I think there is no greater gift we can give to people than teaching them how to fish, as well as giving them fish when they are in need. I think that this is a great thing to do. I think it is a great opportunity for people. Over 80 percent of Americans believe in this policy. I believe that this is not a punishment, but rather an opportunity we give to people. I stand so proudly behind the nutrition component of this farm bill, which we have strived so hard to improve. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF JUDGE PAUL W. DANAHY, JR., ON HIS 90TH BIRTHDAY The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. CASTOR ) for 5 minutes. Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Judge Paul Danahy, Jr., a leader of distinction from Tampa, Florida, and part of Florida’s Greatest Generation. Judge Danahy is celebrating his 90th birthday this week. Judge Danahy was one of the longest serving members of Florida’s Second District Court of Appeals. The judge may also wish to be remembered for working his way through college at the legendary Tampa’s Valencia Garden restaurant as the only Anglo member of the Spanish waiters for many, many years. Wherever Judge Danahy worked and served, he earned a reputation for working tirelessly and gaining the respect of all he worked with. Born in Hopkinton, Massachusetts, Judge Danahy was drawn to Tampa to play basketball at the University of Tampa. In Tampa, he found both a new hometown and the love of his life, Georgia Reed. Judge Danahy enlisted in the Army during the Korean war and has a very unique military record, including three honorable discharges from two branches of the military: the Marine Reserves, the U.S. Army Infantry, and finally from service in the Army Counter Intelligence Corps, a precursor to the CIA. Upon return from military service, he found his true calling and earned his law degree from the University of Florida in 1957. Judge Danahy became an influential member of the Florida House of Representatives, serving from 1966 to 1974. True to form, Judge Danahy played a significant role as part of what many believe to be Tampa’s greatest State legislative delegations during the 1960s and early 1970s. There, amongst other progressive policies, he drafted and championed the first ethics law in the State of Florida, which continues in force to this day and is now firmly ensconced in Florida’s constitution. The Florida we know and love today would not be possible without the contributions of Judge Danahy and his partners in Florida’s Greatest Generation. After leaving the legislature, Judge Danahy’s service was only beginning. He was appointed to the Second District Court of Appeals in 1977, and sat on the bench a recordshattering 33 years, serving as chief judge from 1986 to 1988. In his 30th year at the court, Judge Danahy received a fitting recognition: the largest conference room at the Tampa branch of the Second District Court of Appeals was named the Judge Paul Danahy, Jr., Conference Room. This recognition not only honored his recordsetting time on the bench, but also his legislative accomplishments. He was largely responsible for obtaining the legislative funding to bring the branch to Tampa. Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pride to honor and send many wishes to a great Tampanian, part of Florida’s Greatest Generation of leaders, Judge Paul W. Danahy, Jr., on his 90th birthday. His legacy continues as the patriarch of an evergrowing family to whom he imparts his wisdom and through whom his lessons and beliefs will surely echo in the years to come. 
POSITIVE IMPACT ON OUR ECONOMY The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. LAMALFA ) for 5 minutes. Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, today, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is already having an incredibly positive impact on our economy. Hundreds of companies have already offered billions in bonuses and raises for their employees, far from the crumbs predicted by some of my colleagues, or the predicted Armageddon. The best part is, this is just the beginning, as the law won’t even take full effect until next year, when we retire much of the current tax calculation process and the burdens of it. That is when taxpayers will notice the biggest difference when filing their tax returns. Despite these early positive signs, some individuals claim people should still pay more in taxes. They also think they themselves should pay more, like our friend Bill Gates. He says: ‘‘I need to pay higher taxes. I’ve paid more taxes, over $10 billion, than anyone else, but the government should require the people in my position to pay significantly higher taxes.’’ Interesting. Not to be outdone, Mr. Gates’ fellow billionaire buddy and Berkshire Hathaway CEO, Warren Buffett, has offered similar ideas about the need for people like himself to pay more in taxes. Fine. But the amount of financial security established by people like this is obviously far from mainstream Americans and what they earn themselves. Before they amassed their current fortunes, were they as considerably outspoken on the need for progressive taxation, long before establishing themselves as some of the richest men in the world? I don’t think so. Indeed, these days, much of their funds are stashed away in foundations and not voluntarily paid forward as taxes to the U.S. Government. I find that interesting. In short, no amount of taxation would truly impact their lives as it would for mainstream, middleincome Americans. It does impact everyone else. What is more, I do hear some people in the mainstream who are middleincome folks saying they wouldn’t mind paying more in taxes for this or that. What I don’t get is why they demand that their neighbor does so, too. In America, many middleincome families enjoying lower rates question how well their government is spending and managing what they tax them for now. For them, the government report card isn’t so good. They don’t wish to entrust government with more of their earnings and more of the hard work from the sweat of their brow to an inefficient bureaucracy, even if their neighbors demand that they do, or that the government demands it of them by its power of taxation. So what I am proposing is a bill with my colleague, Majority Whip STEVE  SCALISE , called the Donate Extra Money Against National Debt Act, or the DEMAND Act, for those who demand to pay more. This bill will allow those who want to pay more than required to simply check a box on their tax return and donate as much money to the Treasury as they would like. Our bill would add to the 1040 tax form a check box and a line stating: By checking here, I signify that in addition to my tax liability, I would like to donate the included payment to be used exclusively for the purpose of paying down the national debt. Before, there was no simple or obvious way to accomplish this. This makes it easy and obvious in how to do so. This way, anyone who feels the need to pay more in taxes has an easy way to do so. For millions of other hardworking Americans and business owners who suffered under our previous Tax Code and tax law, they will not be forced to do so under that Code any longer. This bill, indeed, is one of those rare winwins. Bill Gates and Warren Buffett or anyone who feels they are not paying enough can donate as much money to the Treasury as they would like, while everyday American businesses will thrive in a probusiness and progrowth climate, all this without Congress demanding more or people haranguing their neighbors. After all, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is already working. U.S. companies are already paying out more than $4 billion 
in bonuses, while over 4 million American workers have already received a pay raise, bonus, or other financial investment. Even Warren Buffett recently referred to the new law as being a ‘‘huge tailwind’’ for American businesses. b1215 As much as Senator SCHUMER or Minority Leader PELOSI would like to trumpet tax reform as unpopular, bad for the economy, Armageddon, or just crumbs for people, they are missing the point. Tax reform grows more popular each day, especially as more and more Americans see more in their paychecks and begin to realize how they stand to benefit under this new law, especially when the full extent of the law has not yet been felt until next year. Instead of taking away those savings and benefits, the majority whip and I are giving the people who feel so strongly the option to help pay down the deficit on their own accord voluntarily. I applaud the philanthropic work of Mr. Gates, Mr. Buffett, and others, but the DEMAND Act doesn’t force anyone to do anything; it allows certain individuals who demand to pay more in taxes to put their money where their mouth is. Indeed, Senator Biden, a few years ago, said paying taxes is patriotic, so let those who demand to pay more, who want to pay more, lead the way in the new patriotism. 
THE WHITE HOUSE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York (Mr. JEFFRIES ) for 5 minutes. Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address another egregious misrepresentation coming from you know who. How dare anyone refer to an overpriced luxury golf course as the Southern White House. Let’s be clear about something: The Civil War is over. Jefferson Davis failed. The Confederacy lost. There is no such thing as the Southern White House. Thousands of Americans died on the battlefield and shed blood, sweat, and tears to make certain that, in this country, only one institution connected to the executive branch stood in the land of the free and the home of the brave. That institution is located right here in our Nation’s Capital. The address is 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. It was built by slaves. The White House does not belong to the ghosts of the Confederacy. The White House does not belong to Vladimir Putin or his indigenous collaborators. The White House does not belong to a privately owned real estate cartel to be used and abused as a prop for an infomercial. We are a government of the people, by the people, and for the people. The White House belongs to the American people. TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for 5 minutes. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to dispute the absurdity that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act benefits only the wealthy, leaving nothing but crumbs for the rest. As someone who started contributing to my family’s household income at age 12, I am all too familiar with the many struggles of our country’s working and middle classes. Despite their steady perseverance in the face of politicians whose fiscal philosophy was ‘‘government knows best,’’ the working poor and middle class have been chewed up by the system that same philosophy promulgated. Republicans’ Tax Cuts and Jobs Act delivers a modern Tax Code that is fiscally responsible, levels the playing field, and supports workingclass Americans. Republicans understand that progrowth tax reform means simpler and fairer taxes that provide muchneeded relief to the middle class and our small businesses. It also means security for American jobs, more take home pay for the workforce, and a level playing field for Americans’ farms and businesses. By doubling the standard deduction, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will move more lowincome Americans into the zero tax bracket. For married couples filing jointly, this translates to $24,000 yearly that is free—free—from Federal taxes. This also means that working class Americans will be able to take home more of their hardearned paychecks. Currently, over 70 percent of the people in the United States already take the standard deduction. By doubling the standard deduction, even more Americans will be spared from itemizing, and the process will be so simple that they can file on a postcard. For those few Americans who do elect to itemize, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act preserves the child and dependent care tax credit, the adoption tax credit, the deduction for charitable contributions, the home mortgage interest deduction for existing mortgages, and the deduction for newly purchased homes for interest on up to $750,000 of mortgage principal. It also continues to allow for writeoff of State and local property taxes up to $10,000. Finally, it expands the medical expense deduction in 2018 for medical expenses exceeding 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income and rises to 10 percent beginning in 2019. Last, by lowering the crippling taxes on businesses, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act translates to an increase in employment and workers’ wages. We are seeing the lowest unemployment rate since 2000, and 4 million workers and counting have seen the benefits of these historic tax cuts in their income. Businesses across the country are giving bonuses, pay raises, and new investments. Bonuses alone amount to over $4 billion across businesses countrywide. The evidence that tax cuts provide substantial relief for the working and middle classes is clear. The Democrats’ approach was to defend a Tax Code riddled with high taxes and loopholes, but I am proud that Republicans delivered on our promise to bring relief to American workers and happy to say that we are only beginning to see the benefits of this historic tax cut for America’s businesses, workers, families, and job creators. 
THE HEROIC ACTS OF JAMES SHAW, JR., AND TAMMIE JO SHULTS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. COHEN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, malevolent actions and accidents give an opportunity for people to rise to heroic actions. America is a country familiar with heroes. At a sad and awful event this weekend in Nashville, Davidson County, at a Waffle House where four individuals were killed and four injured by a crazed individual with an AR–15, a man named James Shaw, Jr., rallied all of his courage and strength to rise to the occasion of heroics, to get the assailant, take his gun from him, and to save his life and other people’s lives. James Shaw, Jr., is a lifetime Nashvillian. He didn’t plan to be a hero that day, but he rose to the occasion. I take my hat off to him and commend him for his actions in saving other lives. Just a week or so earlier, we had a Southwest Airlines plane that would have crashed if it weren’t for a great pilot, possibly, a plane that, tragically, had a piece of the wing come off and fly into the airplane and cause the death of a passenger and chaos on the plane. The pilot, a trained Navy fighter pilot, Tammie Jo Shults, stayed calm and brought that plane in safely without any other loss of life or injuries. She is a Sully part 2: Sullenberger, who took that plane in New York and landed it in the river and saved a lot of people’s lives. We all honored Sully, as we should and should have. We need to honor Tammie Jo Shults in the same way. She is Sullenberger part 2. And James Shaw, Jr., of Nashville is a hero of the same dimension, and he saved many American lives. Those acts need to be remembered, reflected upon, and honored. I do so today, and I know other Members of this House do as well. 
HONORING JUDGE PATRICIA GIFFORD The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. BROOKS ) for 5 minutes. Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of 
Judge Patricia Gifford, who recently passed away, unexpectedly, just shy of her 80th birthday. She was a pillar in the Marion County, Indianapolis, Indiana, community; a role model for so many lawyers and judges; and a dear friend. She will be forever remembered for inspiring women and redefining the role of women in the courtroom. She was one of only two females in her law school class. She was part of a team of the first women in the country appointed to prosecute only sex crimes cases, primarily rape cases, and she was the sixth female to assume the bench in Indiana. In 1992, Judge Gifford gained international recognition for presiding over the famous rape trial of former heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson. The extensive international media coverage could have easily turned that trial into a circus, but not under her watch. Judge Gifford was widely praised throughout the country for keeping order throughout the trial and presiding over a fair trial. Those of us who practiced in her court expected nothing less. She retired after a 30year distinguished career on the bench. The people of Indiana’s Fifth Congressional District, and especially those in Marion County, are forever grateful for Judge Gifford’s many contributions to our Hoosier community. We join her family—her husband, Bob Butsch; her daughter, Jennifer Butsch Petit; and her family—in mourning our loss. 
NATIONAL MENINGITIS AWARENESS DAY The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. PAULSEN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues to support a resolution that I am introducing to raise awareness of the danger of meningitis B. Nearly 1,000 Americans contract the meningitis disease each year, and for more than 15 percent of the victims, it is, tragically, fatal. I want to share the stories of two of those victims here today. Emily Stillman was born on September 11, 1993. She used to joke that she had the unluckiest birthday, but her mom, Alicia, was always quick to reply: No; it was one of the luckiest days of our lives. Emily was a 19yearold sophomore at Kalamazoo College in Michigan when she contracted meningitis B, and on January 31, 2013, Emily called home complaining of a headache. She was hospitalized for just 36 hours, and then she passed away. Emily had a rare strain of meningitis for which there was no approved vaccine yet in the United States. It was a shock, of course, to the Stillman family that their young daughter, who was so vibrant and full of life, was taken away at such a young age. Then, in 2014, just a little later, the vaccine for meningitis B was finally approved by the FDA and made available here in the United States after I and several other of my colleagues had been advocating for its approval. Yet, even today, fewer than 10 percent of young people receive the meningitis B vaccine. Emily’s mother, Alicia, who is in the gallery with us today, founded The Emily Stillman Foundation to help preserve her daughter’s memory and also advocate both for vaccination and organ donation. Mr. Speaker, Patti Wukovits also lost her 17yearold daughter Kimberly in 2012. Patti is also joining us here in the House gallery today. Her daughter Kimberly Coffey was a high school senior on Long Island and was just 17 years old when she contracted meningitis B back in 2012. Her parents, of course, were blindsided, thinking she had been vaccinated. Within hours of being hospitalized, she went into cardiac arrest and her organs began to fail. Her mother had to make that agonizing decision to actually remove her from life support. To honor Kimberly’s memory, Patti founded The Kimberly Coffey Foundation, with the mission of also educating others about the importance of vaccination against meningitis B. Mr. Speaker, the resolution that I am introducing today will designate April 24 as National Meningitis Awareness Day to help educate other parents and other young people about the dangers of meningitis and the important need for vaccination. Alicia Stillman and Patti Wukovits already know that alerting families about a simple vaccine can prevent a tragedy. It is also time for us, Mr. Speaker, to broaden the awareness so that they are not just doing this on their own. 
b1230 BREAKING THE SILENCE: ADDRESSING SEXUAL ASSAULT ON CAMPUS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. POE) for 5 minutes. Mr. POE of Texas. ‘‘Have courage and be kind.’’ These were the words Megan Rondini left behind on a whiteboard in her school apartment. Yesterday, at a Sexual Assault on Campus Forum at Rice University in Houston, Texas, sponsored by the Victims’ Rights Caucus, Megan’s father, Mike Rondini, spoke these words. He is from Austin. He tries to live by these words every day. Megan Rondini was sexually assaulted while a student at the University of Alabama in 2015. Doing everything a sexual assault victim should do, Megan immediately called the police and went to the hospital, but the hospital did not have a sexual assault forensic examiner or a SANE on staff, meaning no one there was trained to properly deal with a sexual assault victim or properly collect DNA evidence for a rape kit. As a former prosecutor and a judge, I have seen, firsthand, the trauma and pain that rape causes victims. Sometimes that pain never goes away. The hospital’s failure to provide adequate care left Megan feeling hopeless and alone. After the hospital, she went to the police station, and there she was treated with disdain. The police didn’t believe her and instead read her, the victim—get this—the Miranda warnings. Are you kidding me? Rape is never the fault of the victim. When Megan sought counseling at the university, the counselor abruptly interrupted her and told her she was close to the family of the rapist and promptly turned Megan away, providing no other counselor. Megan was completely failed by the system—by the university, the hospital, and the police. Mr. Speaker, not long after, she took her life. Megan’s story is heartbreaking, but her memory reminds us that we must be tenacious in fighting sexual assault on campus and everywhere else. The unfortunate reality, Mr. Speaker, is that stories like Megan’s are common. Congressmen OLSON , CULBERSON , and I joined together at the forum yesterday, and we all heard stories about this, firsthand, from victims. It is always personal. When victims are ignored and rejected, they feel like they have been abandoned, and in many cases, they have been. They are forced to relive their attack over and over again. Last year, I introduced, along with my friend, CAROLYN MALONEY , the bipartisan Megan Rondini Act, a bill that would require hospitals to provide access to a SAFE (Sexual Assault Forensics Examiner) or a SANE (Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner) or have a plan in place to get a victim to a nearby hospital that can provide forensic medical services. Professor and sexual assault nurse examiner Nancy Downing from Texas A&M testified yesterday that by providing SANEs to rape victims, a hospital can dramatically improve a victim’s chance to recover emotionally and medically from the attack. In addition, I am a cosponsor to CAROLYN MALONEY ’S(NY) bipartisan legislation to require colleges to have a sexual assault victim advocate on staff to assist and advise sexual assault victims. There should be no more school counselors that turn victims away. The director of public policy for Texas Association Against Sexual Assault, Chris Kaiser, also testified, and he talked about how the Association and other associations are working on many levels to provide a culture of change within law enforcement and the attitude of peace officers regarding this type of crime, and also, more reporting require. 
Treating victims like criminals is never okay. Remember, Mr. Speaker, rape is never the fault of the victim. As we become more aware of this dastardly crime, some schools, like Rice University, have made excellent strides to address sexual assault on campus. The Rice dean of undergraduates, Dr. John Hutchinson, and former Rice student body president, Justin Onwenu, both testified about the many positive proactive steps Rice has taken; a guide for other universities. Rice University requires all students to participate in a studentdriven 6 week course that teaches young college students to notice the signs of sexual assault and work to change the culture that allows sexual assault to occur on campus. It is work like this that will help foster a culture change where survivors of sexual assault will feel supported by our community. Sexual assault on campus must end. We must change the culture to prevent this crime. We must give victims support to recover and become survivors, and we must let offenders know they will be held accountable for their acts, and they will meet the law. Mr. Speaker, we should follow the words of Megan Rondini: ‘‘Have courage, and be kind.’’ And that is just the way it is. 
b1400 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Ms. FOXX) at 2 p.m. 
PRAYER The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: Eternal God, we give You thanks for giving us another day. We pause in Your presence and ask guidance for the men and women of the people’s House. Enable them, O God, to act on what they believe to be right and just, and to do so in ways that show respect for those with whom they disagree. In this, may they grow to be models and good examples in a time when so many in our world are unable to engage gracefully with those with whom they are at odds. Bless us this day and every day, and may all that is done within the people’s House be for Your greater honor and glory. Amen. 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House her approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Madam Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. The question was taken; and the Speaker announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Madam Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8, rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn. f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the gentleman from the Northern Mariana Islands (Mr. SABLAN ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. SABLAN led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
IN MEMORY OF HAROLD K. GRAVES, JR. (Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and passing of Harold K. Graves, Jr. A native of Kentucky, Harold later lived in Oklahoma, moved to California at a very young age, and eventually to Nevada County. Throughout his life, he developed a reputation for being a natural born leader, whether it was as a young man leading his fellow mates in the neighborhood at playtime or carrying on through his service in Vietnam and in civilian life. He went through basic training at Fort Ord, California, was chosen for Officer Candidate School in Georgia, and then went on to Ranger School. First Lieutenant Graves received many distinguished awards for his heroism in combat, including the Silver Star, Bronze Star, Purple Heart, and many more. He was a special assistant to a general for a time. When he learned after one day that one of his duties was setting out nametags for dinner, he requested to move on to a different type of tougher duty. That was his leadership. That was Harold. Back home, Harold quickly became a leader in his community as well. He served as president of many community organizations, including the local chamber and Rotary. With his Hollywood actor looks, he charmed many, including his beautiful wife, Patricia. They went on to have two beautiful daughters, Jennifer and Kerry, and four wonderful grandchildren. In his service to Nevada City and Nevada County, Harold was president of the local Vietnam Veterans of America chapter and became an honorary member of the Blue Knights Law Enforcement Motorcycle Club. I was proud to have known him. Even in hard times, such as after he laid the motorcycle over, he still had that charm and presence even when he was recovering. We will miss him. He was a great asset to our community and to the United States, as well as his family. God bless him and his family. f 
DEMOCRATS WILL KEEP OUR PROMISE (Mr. SABLAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SABLAN. Madam Speaker, Republicans have relentlessly tried to undermine the pillars of Americans’ retirement security. The Trump budget alone calls for $500 billion in cuts to Medicare, almost $1.5 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, and $72 billion in cuts to Social Security disability. Democrats will keep our promise to our seniors and protect the health, wellbeing, and financial security of American families by strengthening Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. Moreover, the Trump budget calls for cuts to vital childcare development block grants that help ensure working parents have access to quality, affordable child care. Democrats are calling for expanded childcare assistance and universal access to highquality preschool programs so every child can have a strong start. 
SOLIDARITY WITH THE PEOPLE OF NICARAGUA (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to condemn the actions of Daniel Ortega against the people of Nicaragua who peacefully protested the regime. Ortega has taken a page out of the Castro and Maduro playbook and has unleashed his national police to kill more than 30 young Nicaraguans and injure many others over the weekend. He is presenting a false narrative that the political protests are political maneuverings by the opposition, giving him the excuse to censure all independent media, while his people beat, jail, and kill students who are fighting 
for their basic rights. He has changed presidential term limits, dismantled democratic institutions, and committed electoral fraud. Madam Speaker, this is a country that has endured two dictatorships and a civil war. We must demonstrate our solidarity with the people of Nicaragua. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to pass my NICA Act to cut funding to Ortega, and I urge the administration to sanction more Ortega officials who are committing human rights abuses. We must not allow Ortega’s actions to go unpunished. 
A BETTER DEAL (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. KILDEE. Madam Speaker, it is wrong that Republicans continue to pursue policies that clearly benefit only the wealthiest Americans and large corporations, in particular, leaving middle class Americans behind. They have undermined our healthcare system, raising premiums on Americans and increasing the cost of prescription drugs. That is the impact of what this Republican majority has done. At a time when we see more Americans concerned about rising healthcare costs, we really ought to be figuring out ways to work together. I know Democrats and Republicans can do that. But instead, the Republican majority is focused on tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans and the biggest corporations, essentially passing huge benefits—$250 billion—to CEOs and wealthy shareholders, mostly through stock buybacks, which is money that does not go to America’s workers. Now, Republicans are using their deficitexploding tax plan to justify huge cuts that could impact Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. That is a raw deal. Democrats are offering a better deal. We want to grow our economy and create highwage jobs that support a family, not just so they can just get by, but so they can actually succeed. We have a plan for opportunities. 
b1537 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. LAMALFA ) at 3 o’clock and 37 minutes p.m. ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I do. The SPEAKER pro tempore. On that basis, pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. ROS LEHTINEN ) will control the 20 minutes in opposition. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. 
Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 10 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. ENGEL ), and I ask unanimous consent that he be allowed to control that time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, as the Nazis ravaged Europe, confiscation of property was just one of the many injustices Holocaust victims endured. In the almost 75 years since World War II ended, helping to repair the wrongs inflicted by the Nazis by restoring the property of millions of people who had their lives torn apart has proven a difficult and challenging problem. The 2009 Holocaust Era Assets Conference addressed the ongoing injustices created by the Holocaust, including guidance related to restitution of 
property wrongfully seized. However, among the 46 signers to this declaration, including the United States, there are vast disparities in the degree to which the laws and policies of each country fulfill these principles to compensate survivors. This act will help hold governments accountable that have fallen short of their commitment to these important principles. This bill requires the State Department to assess the laws and policies regarding the return or restitution for wrongfully seized Holocaust era assets by countries that participated in the 2009 Holocaust Era Assets Conference. This bill states that it is the sense of Congress that the Secretary should continue to report to Congress on Holocaust era assets. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to do something that I never would have thought that I would do in my time in Congress. I am here to stand in opposition to a bill that purports to seek justice for Holocaust survivors. Anyone who knows just the slightest bit about my tenure in Congress knows how hard I have worked over the years in support of Holocaust survivors. I have held hearings on the plight of survivors. I have introduced bills to seek justice for survivors. I have pressed Germany to honor its obligation and its commitment to survivors to ensure that Germany takes care of the health and home care needs of all survivors so that they may live out their remaining days in the dignity and comfort that they deserve. I have fought against those who denied the Holocaust, and I have spent countless hours speaking with and visiting with the many survivors that I have now come to know as dear friends; listening to their stories; hearing them recall the atrocities that they somehow managed to live through; and then hearing how, even today, more than 70 years later, they still face the injustices of humanity’s darkest period. In fact, it was Speaker RYAN who named me as one of the congressional members on the Holocaust Museum Board just last year, and I am truly honored and humbled to have been named to this position. So I think my history of support for Holocaust survivors and their families is well established and well known, which is why I cannot, in good conscience, stand here before you, Mr. Speaker, before my colleagues, before the American people, and before the Holocaust survivors who are listening to offer my support for this bill. And with all due respect for my colleagues, and they are good friends, because I know that their hearts are in the right place, this bill is not what it purports to be. That is the problem. Let’s start with the name, Mr. Speaker. Justice for Uncompensated Survivors Today Act. Where is the justice, Mr. Speaker? This bill is nothing more than a mere reporting requirement. It has got a fancy name. It is going to give us the feelgood that you are doing something for survivors, but it is just a reporting requirement. What do survivors gain from that? There is no actionable item in this bill. There is nothing to compel any government to do anything in this bill. There is simply no real action here. This is a Claims Conference justice, and by that I mean the Claims Conference wants to appear to be doing all that it can for survivors, but it is nothing more than that. It is a smoke screen. We should not be fooled, Mr. Speaker. This bill has the full support of the Claims Conference precisely because it does the bare minimum. It keeps the tension away from the sad truth. What is the truth? That the Claims Conference has utterly failed our Holocaust survivors. There is no denying that the Claims Conference has a particularly checkered history: its flawed process, its failure to support fully the Holocaust survivors’ needs, its opposition to allowing survivors real justice, and, of course, the embezzlement and fraud issues. b1545 There is no denying that this bill moves the needle not 1 inch closer to justice. It has a fancy name, but there is no justice. Just look at the timeframe here, Mr. Speaker. The report is due in 18 months, and then what? And how many of the survivors will pass away before this report even gets issued? So I am sorry to say, but the JUST Act just falls so far short of what survivors need today that I cannot stand before my friends and colleagues and I cannot stand before my Holocaust survivors and offer a voice of support for this bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of this bill, Mr. Speaker, first, let me thank Senator BALDWIN and Senator R UBIO for their tireless efforts on behalf of Holocaust survivors and their heirs. I would also like to acknowledge the important work of my New York colleague, Congressman JOECROWLEY , and C HRIS SMITH, who introduced the House version of this legislation. The Justice for Uncompensated Survivors Today, or JUST, Act would shine a light on any country in Europe stalling on the return of or restitution for wrongfully confiscated or transferred Holocaust era assets. Nearly 75 years after the end of World War II, we are still debating property rights for Holocaust victims. That is truly astonishing. According to the Holocaust Immovable Property Restitution Study, a substantial amount of property confiscated from European Jews hasn’t been returned to its rightful owners or its owners haven’t been compensated at all. We must ensure that the United States is holding governments to their obligations and ensuring their property is properly returned. Holocaust survivors have waited too long for justice. We cannot let them wait any long. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I previously discussed how passing just a reporting requirement is not justice for survivors, never mind the title. It may be vigilance, but there will be no justice served for a single survivor when this body passes this bill and sends it to the President for his signature. Mr. Speaker, there is something even worse than not providing justice for survivors, and that is depriving them of justice. I want to talk about one of the principles in this bill that, while on the face of it, might read like it is a simple principle—perhaps it sounds like good, common sense—and this is what it does: This bill directs the Secretary of State to submit a report to Congress that assesses and describes the nature and extent that certain countries have gone to in order to meet the goals and objectives of the 2009 Holocaust Era Assets Conference. Again, it sounds reasonable. It is always good to hold countries accountable, especially when we are talking about seeking justice for Holocaust survivors. But one of the big flaws of the 2009 Conference, and what this bill does by asking the Secretary to report on how governments are complying with these goals, is that it enshrines a principle of running out the clock on survivors. The principle, which is specifically highlighted in this bill, the JUST Act, is the notion of allowing governments to use the assets of heirless property claims to provide for other survivors’ needs. Essentially, what this is saying to the governments that have claims against them or that have obligations to survivors whom they must meet is: Go ahead. Stall as long as you can. Wait them out. Then use those assets to pay off your obligations. How long have survivors had to wait now, Mr. Speaker? Over 70 years. And the longer they wait, the longer those states which have obligations to survivors are allowed to stall, the less that these states will be on the hook for. Even worse, this rewards states for stalling. It compounds the injustice to survivors. Using property and assets that were denied to survivors for over seven decades to then pay off other survivors is sickening. Every survivor deserves justice, and that includes all who have lived 
through the unthinkable but are no longer with us today. This practice is nothing more than a smokescreen for Germany’s and other Claims Conference failures to forthrightly provide for all survivors’ needs. Let’s think about it this way, Mr. Speaker: The Claims Conference will support the idea of using heirless claims to provide for other survivors, sure, but will the Claims Conference support the idea that survivors still being denied their justice by the insurance companies should be allowed to sue those insurance companies in Federal court? Nope. Mr. Speaker, I wonder why that is. If my colleagues want to support this bill and if they think that using heirless property to pay for the needs of other survivors is the best we can get, then fine. But I challenge each and every one of you to believe that we can do more, we must do more, and that we have a moral responsibility to do more for survivors. Surely, if we can tell governments in Europe that it is okay to benefit from their unwillingness to resolve the outstanding property claims against them for 70 years, then we can tell our survivors that it is okay for them to go to Federal court and fight for their justice. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ), the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, and I ask unanimous consent that he control that time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. POLIQUIN ). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. ROS LEHTINEN ), the chairman emeritus of our committee, for her tireless work advocating on behalf of Holocaust survivors. Let me say at the outset here that no one in Congress, no one in this Congress, has done more to advocate on behalf of survivors than ILEANA  ROSLEHTINEN , and I believe that to be true through her entire tenure in this body. Let me also explain the thoughts, as explained to us, behind our Senate colleagues that put together the JUST Act. From their standpoint, from their vantage point, the JUST Act is a simple reporting requirement to assess the progress of signatories to the 2009 Terezin Declaration on Holocaust era assets and related issues. The goal there, of course, was to fulfill the principles in that declaration. A lot of time and effort went into trying to leverage that agreement out of 46 countries that agreed to these principles. Now, here is the point; here is where we have a difference of opinion: of those 46 countries, some of them are falling woefully short of their commitments. Here are the conflict divisions. Some are saying, many are saying: Look, we need to put pressure on them. The Senate unanimously came to the conclusion that a way to do that is with this bill, because what the legislation does is to ensure that there is an accountability mechanism of checking adherence to the declaration principles and to making sure that it doesn’t fall by the wayside by bringing accountability to those countries that don’t. The injustices of the Holocaust, frankly, here today, those injustices are too many to name. Many are unaddressed in that declaration, and I concur from that standpoint. But, at the same time, we need to continue pushing to right the full spectrum of these wrongs. Before us we have a bill which will bring much leverage. We cannot lose the headway that we have made toward compensating survivors and families for what was rightfully theirs. Our partners have already agreed to the restitution principles in the declaration. A formal report that shows who has fallen short and how, it is argued by our colleagues in the Senate, would be a powerful instrument for the U.S. Government to push for changes. From my standpoint, I understand the arguments being made by the Senate. It does not mean that we should not go forward to make other points. But the argument they make to us is let’s give the State Department the tools it needs to ensure accountability. This is an argument that, on both sides of the aisle, the preponderance of Members here, I think, concur with. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, earlier I spoke about survivors being unable to sue the insurance companies in Federal court, how unjust that is. What a travesty. First, they were forced to suffer the inhumanity of the Nazis during the Holocaust, treated as outsiders. Worse than that, there really are just no words to adequately describe how Jews were treated during the Nazi time. And now, for so many, they continue to face injustices on a daily basis. One would think, Mr. Speaker, that those who endured and managed to make it here to America—home of freedom, democracy, respect for human rights, where everyone is meant to have equal rights—would not have to face the harsh truth that they are still being treated no better than second class citizens. Imagine how survivors feel when they are told that, in America, almost anyone can have their rightful day in court—unless you are a Holocaust survivor with a claim against one of the big, rich, powerful insurance companies. In that case, you have no right to your justice. You have no day in court. You are prohibited from bringing justice to the courts. Countless survivors had valid insurance policies with insurance companies in Europe before the Holocaust, but when so many tried to make a claim on the policies of their loved ones, can you imagine what these companies told them? The insurance companies have asked Holocaust survivors to show their policies, because, as we all know, Mr. Speaker, the Nazis just let the Jews of Europe take all of their important documentation and their most cherished possessions with them before they were hauled off for extermination—of course that did not happen. Even worse, these big, rich, powerful insurance companies didn’t just reject these claims due to the absence of policy documents. Many claims were rejected due to the absence of a death certificate—another paper that the insurance companies knew were not readily available. They did not pass them out in extermination camps. The relatives did not get a death certificate. But yet that is what insurance companies are asking of survivors. Of course, we all know that policyholders aren’t the only ones with the proper documentation. Allianz or any of those big, rich, powerful insurance companies aren’t just going to take my word for it that I have a policy with them. Insurance companies are going to have their own documentation to validate the claim. They have that documentation. But do insurance companies do this for survivors? Do they show them the claims? Of course not. And, unfortunately, there is nothing to compel these huge, rich, and powerful insurance companies to provide it and to pay off those claims. These claims, by the way, Mr. Speaker, now run into the billions of dollars, so you can imagine why the insurance companies would fight so hard against allowing survivors to receive their claims. This is not justice. This is just as immoral and as reprehensible as you can get. These rich and powerful insurance companies should be held liable, and they should be held accountable for these sins against morality and humanity. That is the bill that we should be debating today, and that is why, for years, I have authored the Holocaust Insurance Accountability Act, H.R. 762, in this Congress and I have worked side by side with so many survivors over the years who feel as if they are continuing to be victimized. They ask me: Why can everyone else get their day in court like we are all entitled to, but not Holocaust survivors? My bill is simple, Mr. Speaker. It will finally allow survivors the ability to bring their cases before the U.S. court system, and it allows them to have their day in court. 
b1600 It does not prejudge the outcome of any case. It simply says survivors can face the insurance companies in court and seek redress. It will make the insurance companies open up their books and let the world know the truth. If it is decided by the U.S. court system that these insurance companies have in fact been shirking their moral and legal responsibilities, then the appropriate course of action should be taken. But this cannot happen and these survivors cannot have their day in court unless we take steps to ensure that it can. If we are here today to talk about justice for survivors, as this bill is called, let’s talk about real action. Let’s talk about doing something more than a simple reporting requirement with a fancy name. Let’s talk about ending seven decades of injustice. Let’s talk about ending impunity for these big, powerful, rich insurance companies. Let’s talk about accountability. Let’s take up the JUST Act with the Holocaust Insurance Accountability Act. Let’s not allow ourselves to pass a reporting requirement and then pat ourselves on the back thinking the job is over. Let’s get real justice for survivors. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. CROWLEY ), the chair of the Democratic Caucus. He is also the sponsor of the House version of this bill. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague from the Bronx, New York (Mr. ENGEL ). He has been a true friend for many, many, many years. I thank him for yielding me this time. Mr. Speaker, I rise in full support today of S. 447, the Justice for Uncompensated Survivors Today Act. This important measure has already unanimously passed the Senate. Senator TAMMY BALDWIN had worked hard on this issue, on a bipartisan basis, and I am proud to have introduced the House version, as has been mentioned, along with my colleague from New Jersey (Mr. SMITH). I appreciate the efforts of the chairman and the ranking member here in bringing the bill to the floor. I was first approached about the lack of justice still facing Holocaust survivors by a gentleman from Queens, New York, Jehuda Evron. I am sorry that he cannot be here today to watch this debate, as he has spent a lifetime helping those who endured and escaped horrific atrocities during the Holocaust. Jehuda has been an incredible campaigner for Holocaust survivors, along with his wife, Leah, who lived in the ghetto under a false identity and joined others in hiding with resistance fighters. It was Jehuda and the World Jewish Restitution Organization who shared with me an ongoing indignity Holocaust survivors still face to this very day: the inability to reclaim property unlawfully seized during the Holocaust. This is property that, if restored, could have a significant impact for the far too many Holocaust survivors living in poverty today. It may shock some to hear that, here in the United States, onethird of the Holocaust survivors live at or under the poverty line. That is despicable. Some survivors are so poor, they sometimes have to choose between food and medicine. Their stories put in stark relief the lifelong impact the Holocaust had on an entire generation of families and survivors. That is why it is so important that in 2009, the United States, Israel, and 45 other countries signed the Terezin Declaration on Holocaust Era Assets and Related Issues. In that important measure, countries pledged to take steps to return assets looted by the Nazi government and others. Nine years later, there is still work to be done. The JUST Act urges countries to keep their commitments to restitute wrongly taken Holocaust Era Assets, and it will continue to shine a light on the ongoing struggle of survivors to reclaim the property that is rightfully theirs. If you walk out the front door of this building and head down the street, you will find yourself at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. It is a powerful institution and one that reminds us of not only the heroic role played by the United States in World War II, but the tremendous suffering faced by the Jewish people and all victims of the Holocaust. For me, it is also a reminder that if we can take steps to right more of the wrongs committed during the Holocaust, we should take the opportunity to do so. I believe that this bill is an opportunity to do that. Mr. Speaker, I have the utmost respect for the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN ). She knows my affection for her. We have been friends for over 20 years. I respect her opposition to this because I know that she does want justice for the victims. That is her goal. But I just want to say, for the record, that this bill is supported by the World Jewish Restitution Organization, the American Jewish Committee, the Anti Defamation League, Jewish Federations of North America, B’nai B’rith International, HIAS Refugee Assistance Organization, the National Coalition Supporting Eurasian Jewry, Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, and the Orthodox Union. I think, Mr. Speaker, it is important to recognize those organizations that are in full support of this legislation, with all due respect to a woman I have tremendous respect for. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, in order to close my part of this debate on the bill, I want to reiterate that, though I strongly oppose the JUST Act—it is smoke and mirrors and it gives you the feelgood moment and provides no justice for survivors, in spite of its fancy name— I do believe that my colleagues do have good intentions and they want to see Holocaust survivors finally get the justice that has for so long evaded them. Their words and their remarks are heartfelt. They just don’t apply to this bill. They would more rightly apply to the bill that I have and that I hope this body will soon take up. In fact, this body took action last Congress when the Holocaust Expropriated Art Recovery Act of 2016, or the HEAR Act, was passed and signed into law. This was an important bill. It actually helped. That bill allowed for civil claims or causes of action for the recovery of artwork stolen from Jews by the Nazis during the Holocaust. In other words, we have acted to ensure that Holocaust victims can bring claims in U.S. courts to recover their looted artwork and other possessions. They can have their day in court, and I am glad for it. If you lost a famous painting and there have been movies and books written about it, you can have your day in court. That is wonderful. But since HEAR was passed, or the Holocaust Expropriated Art Recovery Act, it has already been cited in several cases and has been applied by the Ninth Circuit Court to revive a previously dismissed Naziera art case. That is great. So why not take action to allow the same process to take place for survivors to hold insurance companies accountable? If you had your artwork looted by the Nazis, you can have your day in court. But if the Nazis have destroyed your life, and you had an insurance company policy, you do not have the right to take that case to court. It doesn’t make sense. So, Mr. Speaker, we are here today to debate justice for uncompensated survivors of the Holocaust. A simple reporting requirement isn’t going to do that. We shouldn’t have to be taking such action. Unfortunately, because certain governments haven’t lived up to their obligations and because these insurance companies and others complicit in Naziera crimes still manage to evade accountability, we have a moral obligation to step into action. That is the message that I am giving to my colleagues. If we want to pass the JUST Act, so be it. But let’s also vow here and now to take more concrete action to really get justice for Holocaust survivors. Let’s take that next big step. Time is running out. Time is running out for all of these survivors and we need action yesterday—not today, but today will do. I am asking my colleagues to do the right thing, and I am asking for this body, Mr. Speaker, to bring the Holocaust Insurance Accountability Act to the floor as soon as possible so that we 
can take a meaningful step, a concrete step, an action item toward justice for survivors. And then, all of those lofty words that are laid upon the table on this bill that don’t really apply, would really apply to this bill, the Holocaust Insurance Accountability Act. We owe it to the survivors. We owe it to their families. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
1⁄2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DEUTCH ), who is a very wellrespected member of our Foreign Affairs Committee. Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Ranking Member ENGEL , for his hard work on this bill and for yielding. I thank Chairman ROYCE as well. I want to thank the many Members of Congress who have shown their unyielding commitment to caring for Holocaust survivors and ensuring that their needs are met, including the cosponsors of this bill, and, of course, the House bill’s sponsors, Congressman CROWLEY and Congressman S MITH. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank my friend and colleague, ILEANA ROSLEHTINEN , for her tireless efforts throughout her career on behalf of Holocaust survivors in our community in south Florida and everywhere they live. Two weeks after we marked Yom HaShoah, it is fitting that Congress would consider this bill. I hope that the world is watching, because every year that we move away from the horrible atrocities of the Holocaust, we lose more and more survivors. They are the people who survived Auschwitz, Treblinka, Sobibor, and other Nazi death camps. They are the people who survived the attempted genocide against them. Six million Jews perished. We must remember that every single victim, those who perished and those who survived, had a story. They had homes, they had businesses, family heirlooms, and personal possessions. As the Nazis stormed through Europe to wipe out European Jewry, they stole everything they could as they sent Jews to their death. While no amount of money will ever erase these horrors, these survivors, their families, and their heirs deserve compensation for confiscated property, including Jewish communal, private, and heirless property. In 2009, the United States joined 46 other countries and agreed to the Terezin Declaration on Holocaust Era Assets. This was a commitment by these countries to provide for the restitution of confiscated property. But 9 years later, many European countries have still failed to meet their commitments in this agreement. Some countries still haven’t passed legislation to create for private property restitution, and we should call out their failures. As we speak, thousands of survivors are in need of immediate and urgent care and assistance. I am proud to represent a large community of survivors, and I see their critical needs going unmet day after day. This bill can be a tool to help us understand where the gaps lie in restitution programs, but it does not address, nor is it meant to address, the urgent need of survivors now. As they age, their needs grow. It is essential they receive the care they deserve. We must do everything to ensure that those needs are addressed. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. This legislation is critical to ensuring that Holocaust survivors and their heirs are compensated. Restitution and return will represent another step moving past this heinous chapter of human history. I want to thank my colleague and good friend, Chairman ROSLEHTINEN , for her powerful remarks this afternoon and for her leadership for so many years in fighting for Holocaust survivors. I have met many of her constituents and many of my own who remain engaged in this prolonged battle for justice. I am a cosponsor of Congresswoman ROSLEHTINEN ’s legislation, and I proudly support her in these efforts. I do hope that her bill will come to the floor as well. b1615 I also support Congressmen CROWLEY  and SMITH, as well as Senators B ALDWINand R UBIO, in the effort to ensure that property is restituted and returned through the JUST Act. This legislation has already passed the Senate; so when we pass it here, it will go right to the President’s desk for signing. With this vote, we can push it across the finish line. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, we have been contacted on behalf of the JUST Act by a number of organizations in support of the Senate bill. The major American Jewish organizations supporting this measure are the American Jewish Committee, the AntiDefamation League, the Jewish Federations of North America, the B’nai B’rith, the HIAS refugee assistance organization, Union for Reform Judaism, Orthodox Union, World Jewish Restitution Organization, and others; and they have argued that the Justice for Uncompensated Survivors Today Act, or JUST Act, as the Senate calls it, is a measure that will have an outsized impact in encouraging countries to continue working to make amends for the evils of the Holocaust. That is what drove the Senate to pass this bill. Now, just to go into the details again a little bit: it was in 2009 that representatives of this country and 40 other countries agreed to a set of principles to address the welfare of survivors, to address Holocaust education, and to address issues related to restitution for seized property, among other issues. Now, that is what these 40 nations committed to. So 10 years have passed, approximately, and it is time that we take stock of the work under way because, while a number of these partner countries have made great strides to uphold their commitments under the agreement, you and I know—everybody here knows—that some countries have fallen short. And this legislation, which charges the State Department with the responsibility for this important report—and let’s call it naming and shaming; that is basically what is intended here— gives the United States another tool to seek justice for Holocaust survivors, to seek justice for the families of Holocaust victims. And it is our hope that passing this bill will motivate improvements even before the report is penned. Already we have seen some of these countries overseas renew their engagement on this issue, and that is the leverage that we want to deploy. It is a devastating issue to even begin a discussion because we can never compensate Holocaust survivors truly for the unbelievable horror and devastation that they suffered. But from the perspective of most of the organizations that have talked to us about the bill, their point would be: We can try. We can try to restore what is rightfully theirs. And part of the trying, from their standpoint, is to shed light on the efforts, or lack thereof, that other countries are making. And this bill does that. It unanimously passed the Senate for that reason. Mr. Speaker, I thank all the Members here who participated today in the debate over this very difficult issue, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. POE) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 447. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
IRAN HUMAN RIGHTS AND HOSTAGETAKING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4744) to impose additional sanctions with respect to serious human rights abuses of the Government of Iran, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4744 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Iran Human Rights and HostageTaking Accountability Act’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. ENGEL ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. 
Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material on H.R. 4744, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, in January this body came together. It was a near unanimous vote to support the Iranian people, who were engaged in legitimate protests against a very oppressive regime. I want to thank Mr. MIKE MCCAUL here, chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security, and Mr. ELIOT ENGEL , the ranking member of our Committee on Foreign Affairs, for their engagement in this issue. At the time, we were witnessing tens of thousands of Iranians who had taken to the streets in the largest demonstration that we had seen since the Green Revolution of 2009. The protests, aimed at economic stagnation, aimed at widespread corruption—and people were talking about that all the time—aimed at the Revolutionary Guard Corps’ control over that economy because they had nationalized, seized, so much of that economy. And quickly we saw that spread across Iran, as Persians sought to exercise the fundamental right of freedom of expression, as people across that country, of every ethnicity and every religion, began to speak out. Many demonstrators shouted slogans aimed at Iran’s costly support for Syria’s Bashar alAssad, if you recall, from reading the press accounts. And they attacked, they argued about the cost, the support that went to the terrorist groups such as Hezbollah. Predictably, the Iranian regime moved swiftly to quash the demonstrations and throttle social media. More than 1,000 Iranians were jailed, dozens were killed. H. Res. 676 condemned this brutal violence back in January, called for targeted sanctions to hold the regime to account. But today we act to make good on that call, because the bill before us today, Chairman MCCAUL’s H.R. 4744, requires the administration to determine whether senior Iranian officials should be sanctioned for human rights abuses. And it also requires determinations on whether Iranian businesses should be sanctioned for public corruption with respect to those who are involved in corruption. And it mandates sanctions on those officials responsible for Iran’s wrongful, politically motivated jailing of U.S. citizens. Mr. Speaker, for years the regime in Tehran has systematically beat down all opposition inside Iran. It regularly uses brutal tactics back in Iran, including torture and mass executions, as it seeks to export violence and radical ideology abroad as well. I think all of us can think back to that 1979 revolution and contemplate how much better Iran would have been had it not went off onto a path of becoming a rogue state. As this legislation details, today the regime flagrantly disregards commitments it has made to respect the fundamental rights of the Iranian people. Many of us recall the barbaric mass executions carried out over a 4month period in 1988. And I dare say, if you know any Persians, if you know people who escaped from Iran, you know that, during that period of time leading up to 1988, there were over 30,000 students and young professionals who lost their lives as a consequence. We know that the political prisoners there went through a grueling experience, in Evin Prison and other prisons. Many were executed by hanging, many by firing squad. They refused to renounce their political affiliations, and that was the fate that was handed out to them. 
And today the regime still persecutes ethnic and religious minority groups; such as, the Baha’i; Christians, of course; Sufi; Sunni; dissenting Shia Muslims. And we all remember the way the ayatollah brutally suppressed the peaceful political dissent during the Green Revolution, during which the previous administration remained embarrassingly silent, in my view. And many of us here on this floor today spoke up often at that time about that dissent during the Green Revolution, because I think this was a real opportunity missed by the United States. So again, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman MCCAULand I want to thank Ranking Member ENGEL for their leadership on this legislation. I am glad we have strong bipartisan support for this measure. Regardless of how one views the Iran nuclear agreement, it is critical that the United States and our allies continue to press Iran for its dangerous and threatening acts that fall outside of the JCPOA. This is an area where officials from both the Trump and Obama administrations agree, and they agree for good reason here. Remember, this is the same regime that is holding American citizens, including one who is in very poor health, on sham charges in one of the largest ransom schemes, from my standpoint, that was ever devised. This regime, of course, held its first American hostages in 1979, when it overran our U.S. Embassy. The regime’s MO remains the same. It is far past time the regime faced consequences for its attacks on Iranians and Americans alike. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

R OYCE , Chairman. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this measure. Let me start by thanking Congressmen DEUTCH and MCCAUL, both valued members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, for their hard work on this bill. I want to also thank Chairman EDROYCE , who has been a strong bipartisan voice in things that are so important to our country and to the world. We always say that we take pride in having the Committee on Foreign Affairs being the most bipartisan committee in the entire Congress. Iran has isolated itself on the global stage because it refuses to abandon a range of aggressive activities that pose a threat to the region and a threat to the entire international community. On that list is the regime’s terrible mistreatment of its own people and its heinous practice of prolonged and politically motivated detentions of American citizens. The bill before us now seeks to put an end to these intolerable practices. It would place sanctions on anyone responsible for politically motivated harassment, abuse, extortion, extended detention, or trial of Americans or Iranians. Earlier this year, we stood on this floor in solidarity with protestors in Iran who sought a better future for their country and for the next generation. They wanted to see their government abandon its support for Iranian proxy forces and terrorist groups, like Hezbollah, in favor of funding healthcare and employment opportunities for average Iranians. This is a country that has suffered so much under the ayatollahs and the economic mismanagement of its leaders. The protests in December and January were a stark reminder of the regime’s tight grip on power, as many protesters were killed in the streets and blocked from communicating with the outside world. Today, as we pass this legislation, we think about the Americans who currently sit in Iranian prisons. We think about Robert Levinson, Mr. DEUTCH ’s constituent, who has been missing for over 11 years, who has missed the weddings of his children and the births of his grandchildren. b1630 The Iranian regime had promised to cooperate with the investigation to locate Mr. Levinson, but to this date, that cooperation has been virtually nonexistent. There is no real clarity in U.S. policy toward Iran. The United States faces a looming deadline on the nuclear deal, and the future remains uncertain. But there is one thing we can all agree on: we cannot let up the pressure on Iran for its human rights violations, particularly against American citizens. So, again, I want to thank Mr. MCCAUL and Mr. D EUTCH for doing a great job with this. This is a bipartisan piece of legislation. If you care about the injustices going on in Iran, then it is important to support this bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL), chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security and the author of this bill. Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge support for my bill to hold the Iranian regime accountable for its continued human rights violations. I introduced the Iran Human Rights and HostageTaking Accountability Act with Congressman DEUTCH , and I am grateful for Chairman ROYCE and Ranking Member ENGEL ’s support in this effort. The Iranian regime continues to perpetrate gross human rights abuses against its own people. They continue to suppress and censor their people’s calls for democratic reform. They recklessly use their nation’s resources to expand their destabilizing influence and support of terrorism. They continue to engage in corrupt practices, and they continue to illegally detain and imprison our citizens without just cause. This is simply unacceptable. Mr. Speaker, this bill serves as a clear signal to the people of Iran that we support their quest for freedom. It shines a light on the regime’s human rights violations and targets Iranian officials guilty of corruption, censorship, and the diversion of goods intended for the Iranian people. It requires the President to work with our international partners to develop a strategy to end this inhumane behavior and sanctions those officials complicit in those crimes. Finally, it sanctions those individuals who take Americans hostage. Mr. Speaker, today, there are more than six American citizens and permanent U.S. residents held by the Iranian regime in a shameful attempt to use innocent human lives as political bargaining chips. These hostages include: Bob Levinson, Congressman DEUTCH ’s constituent, who has been missing since 2007 and remains America’s longest held hostage; Siamak Namazi and his 81yearold father, Baquer, held since 2015 and 2016, respectively; Ph.D. student, Xiyue Wang, held since 2017; internet freedom activist, Nizar Zakka, held since 2016; and others. The United States has a moral responsibility to devote resources to these hostages and make their return a priority. I sent a letter with Congressman LIEUand 46 other Members of Congress requesting that the administration keep Congress informed as to what steps they are taking to guarantee this happens. So, again, I thank the chairman and ranking member, Congressman DEUTCH , for their leadership on this bipartisan effort to hold Iran accountable. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  the letter dated April 23, 2018. 
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES , Washington, DC, April 23, 2018. Hon. JOHNJ. S ULLIVAN , Acting Secretary of State, U.S. Department of State, Washington, DC. DEAR ACTING SECRETARY SULLIVAN : We write to request information regarding the Administration’s efforts to secure the release of American citizens and permanent U.S. residents held hostage by the government of Iran. As you know, Iran has a long history of unjustly holding hostages in violation of international law dating back to 1979. Over the years, the Iranian regime has arrested dozens of foreigners on spurious charges and convicted them in sham trials held in secretive courts. Many of the detained American citizens and permanent residents are also held in deplorable conditions, where they experience severe health and psychological issues. Today, there are more than six American citizens and permanent U.S. residents held by the Iranian regime in a shameful attempt to use innocent human lives as political bargaining chips. These hostages include Bob Levinson, who has been missing since 2007 and remains America’s longestheld hostage; Siamak Namazi and his 81yearold father Baquer, held since 2015 and 2016, respectively; PhD student Xiyue Wang, held since 2016; internet freedom activist Nizar Zakka, held since 2016; and others. The United States has a moral responsibility to devote resources to these hostages and make their return a priority. This past month, the House Foreign Affairs Committee passed H.R. 4744, the Iran Human Rights and HostageTaking Accountability Act, to increase U.S. leverage by levying new sanctions on those responsible for detaining U.S. citizens or legal permanent respondents in Iran. But more sticks must be complemented with a coordinated diplomatic effort with our allies. According to media reports, the State Department has increased efforts in recent months to secure the release of these hostages, including outreach to the Iranian regime in December 2017 that has gone unanswered. On April 6, 2018, the Department outlined efforts that have been undertaken in a report to Congress pursuant to Section 110 of the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act. We request that the Department provide some additional details to Congress. Specifically, please provide answers to the following questions in either written responses or a briefing: 1. How has Iran responded to the various lines of effort made by the U.S., as detailed in the April 6 report to Congress, to raise the detention cases? 2. According to a June 20, 2017, article from the Washington Post, two senior officials from the Trump administration stated a range of options were being considered, which included ‘‘sticks more than carrots.’’ What specific tools are being considered to secure the release of detained Americans and permanent U.S. residents? 3. Does the Administration require any new authorities from Congress to utilize these tools? 4. What is the Administration’s strategy for disincentivizing and deterring foreign 
governments, particularly Iran, from taking Americans and permanent U.S. residents hostage in the future? Thank you for your attention to this important issue. Sincerely, Ted W. Lieu, Member of Congress; Michael McCaul, Member of Congress; Ileana Ros Lehtinen, Member of Congress; Ted Deutch, Member of Congress; James P. McGovern, Member of Congress; Brian Fitzpatrick, Member of Congress; Donald M.

Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DEUTCH ), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa of the Foreign Affairs Committee. Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member ENGEL and Chairman ROYCE for their support of this legislation, and I give special thanks to my colleague, Chairman MCCAUL, for his leadership in recognizing the need to take action. We must work together to stop the brutal Iranian regime’s human rights abuses and demand the release of American hostages that Iran is using as pawns for political leverage. I am proud to partner with Mr. MCCAUL in this effort The Iran Human Rights and Hostage Taking Accountability Act sends a clear message to the Iranian regime and to the rest of the world: this Congress, this country will not tolerate the flagrant disregard of the most basic of human rights. My colleagues have explained the merits of this bill, and I know it is difficult for many Americans to imagine, but we are here today to show our resolve in the face of really unbelievable circumstances. For my constituents, the family of Robert Levinson, this is a nightmare that they have lived for 11 years. Bob Levinson is the longest held American hostage in history. He disappeared in Iran on March 9, 2007. Imagine 11 years without your husband or your father. Imagine having grandchildren who have never had the chance to meet their grandfather. Imagine 11 anniversaries, dozens of family birthdays, and holidays that pass by without Bob, just an empty place where Bob should be sitting. Bob’s wife, Christine, and his seven children—Susan, Stephanie, Sarah, Dan, David, Samantha, and Doug— have been tireless advocates for their father. They have traveled to Iran themselves looking for answers. They have made the trip to Washington, D.C., countless times to meet with government officials and Members of Congress. They have fought for action all the way to the Oval Office, directly appealing to President Bush, President Obama, and President Trump. They have watched as others have returned home to their families. They have listened with hope as Iran’s leaders have promised cooperation. They have been disappointed more times than they can count as promises go unfulfilled year after year after year. Iran has become adept at this cruel game, because that is what it is to this rogue Iranian regime. They say that hostages are not hostages, but these people are not detained under a legal order. They have lost their freedom; they have been separated from their families; and they have been held under shamelessly trumpedup and false charges. Any attempt to show due process or trials has been a sham. To the Levinsons, to the Namazi family, the Zakka family, the Wang family, and the other families whose loved ones are being held, we stand with you. Today, we speak clearly and loudly with one bipartisan voice to send a message that no country, no rogue regime will use American lives as leverage to further a dangerous agenda. This bill isn’t about the nuclear deal. Nothing in this deal precludes our continued participation in the JCPOA. But this bill makes clear the importance of closely coordinating with our allies and partners whose citizens have also been held hostage by Iran to apply pressure on the regime. If we are going to counter Iran’s abuses, Iran’s terrorism, Iran’s threats to our troops and our national security interests, we must work in tandem with our partners around the globe. We will stand together against repression and the violation of human rights. We will stand together against religious persecution. We will stand together for the rule of law and democratic values. Taking hostages and violating the most fundamental values that cut to the core of our dignity as human beings is unacceptable to this Congress and to members of the international community. I urge all of my colleagues to stand up to Iran’s rogue regime, to stand up for human rights and for the people of Iran, to stand with the Levinsons and the other families whose loved ones are missing from their lives, and to fight for their return home by supporting this bill. Please support H.R. 4744, and together we will stand for basic human rights. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. ROS LEHTINEN ), who chairs the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman ROYCE for his kindness and his leadership, and Ranking Member ELIOT ENGEL , my favorite mensch, for bringing this bill to the floor today. I also want to thank and congratulate MICHAEL MCCAULand my south Florida colleague and dear friend TEDDEUTCH for their work in offering this important bill. The regime in Iran, as we have heard from my colleagues, is responsible for some of the most despicable human rights abuses imaginable. The regime is also notorious for its hostagetaking tactics, hoping to get financial or political concessions from the United States and other Western countries for their hostage taking. Mr. DEUTCH and I have been highlighting these abuses in our subcommittee through multiple hearings and many pieces of legislation, including a resolution that the House passed last year, H. Res. 317, that urged the President to make the release of Americans held hostage in Iran the highest of priorities. We also held a hearing on some of the hostages named in the resolution where we heard from family members of Mr. DEUTCH ’s constituent Bob Levinson, who is America’s longest held hostage ever; Baquer and Siamak Namazi, father and son, who have been unjustly detained in Iran for far too long; Nizar Zakka. All of these families have had to endure so much, Mr. Speaker. Almost 1 year later after our resolution, all of these men as well as at least four other Americans, additional Americans, continue to be unjustly detained in Iran, suffering under horrific conditions with little to no contact with their families. Iran must be held accountable, Mr. Speaker. We need to be applying maximum pressure against the regime. This bill gives the administration more tools to sanction the regime for this practice of taking hostages, and I offer my full support. I thank the esteemed chairman of our committee, as well as my friend, the ranking member. I thank the chairman for the time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. POE), chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade. 
Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the Iranian regime is the number one state sponsor of terror in the whole world, and they commit terrorist acts even against their own people. I am proud to support H.R. 4744, the Iran Human Rights and HostageTaking Accountability Act, introduced by my friend, Chairman MCCAUL. The mullahs in Tehran are among the world’s worst human rights abusers. This year, we have witnessed their brutality again on display as they continue to mercilessly crush dissent from their own people. International attention has faded, but the Iranian people are still in the streets demanding their rights, whether they be economic opportunity, access to water, religious freedom, or gender equality. In response, the regime has murdered dozens and locked up thousands, as it has done so many times before, without punishment from the outside world. This is nothing new for the Islamic Republic. Look no further than the 1988 massacre, where 30,000 of Iran’s political prisoners were systematically murdered by the regime. This barbaric mass execution occurred by public hangings, firing squads, and included teenagers and pregnant women who refused to announce their political affiliations, including many from the MEK, today’s leading Iranian dissident group. So horrific was the act that deputy to Iran’s ruler at the time, Ayatollah Khomeini, called it: ‘‘The greatest crime committed during the Islamic Republic for which history will condemn us.’’ And, yes, history now condemns the regime for these acts of murder. This bill will provide for that condemnation and call for investigation into this crime against humanity. It also urges our government to work with international partners and investigate other major human rights abuses, such as the dozens more killed during protests in 1999, 2009, and 2017, and sanction those responsible. In all cases, the families of those murdered by the regime were never told what happened to their loved ones’ remains. This important bill will pressure the Iranian Government to disclose the final resting place of the missing so their families may have a small bit of peace. Mr. Speaker, now is the day of reckoning for the Iranian regime. And that is just the way it is. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume for the purpose of closing. Mr. Speaker, it is no secret that the United States and Iran’s leaders are at odds on a host of issues. Iran has killed Americans in Iraq. Its proxies seek to harm our citizens and our interests around the world. But let me be clear: the United States has no quarrel with the Iranian people. b1645 This legislation seeks to protect the human rights of the Iranian people and Americans who are unfairly detained in Iran. This bill signals our solidarity with the protestors and demonstrators to Iran’s rulers that any action that violates the human rights of an American will be met with severe consequences. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. POE) just mentioned the 1988 massacre that was horrendous, and there were many, many more. This brutal regime has blood on its hands, and it is important for the United States to call them out. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. In closing, I would again like to thank my colleagues, Chairman MCCAUL and Ranking Member E NGEL , for their bipartisan leadership to hold Iran accountable, to hold them accountable for their brutality: their brutality in the 1988 massacres, and their brutality in terms of the way they are treating their religious minorities today. We know that Americans formerly imprisoned by Iran describe being subjected to electric shock and whippings. We have heard that before our committee. We have heard them say that they were denied medical care. Today, U.S. citizens, such as Siamak and Baqer Namazi, Xiyue Wang, and U.S. permanent resident Nazar Zaka, are all sitting in Iranian jails on bogus accusations of collaborating with a hostile government for espionage. And U.S. citizen Robert Levinson is still missing, and that is more than 10 years after he disappeared in Iran. Our hearts go out to these victims and our hearts go out to their families as we renew our call for the immediate release of all U.S. citizens and permanent residents held in Iran. With this legislation, we will impose tough sanctions on the regime. And we do that for its corruption, for its attacks on innocent Americans, and for its attacks on Iranians alike. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support for H.R. 4744, the Iran Human Rights and Hostage—Taking Accountability Act, introduced by my fellow Texas delegate Congressman Michael McCall and fellow House Judiciary colleague Congressman Ted Deutch. H.R. 4744 states that Congress stands with the people of Iran, and it provides the Trump administration with the tools necessary to hold Iranian government officials responsible for human rights violations, corruption, and censorship. Moreover, this legislation holds the Iranian regime accountable for taking hostage American citizens and permanent residents by ensuring that those responsible pay an extreme but just price for the violations committed. I applaud the House Foreign Affairs Committee for their support in passing this critical piece of legislation. And I sincerely hope that this bill passes the Senate and arrives at the President’s desk to be promptly signed into law so we can begin to hold the Iranian regime accountable for their gross human rights violations. The Iranian regime continues to perpetuate gross human rights abuses against its own people. The regime continues to suppress the country’s voices for reform through censorship of the media. The regime continues to recklessly use the nation’s resources to expand its regional influence through its support for terrorist groups. The regime continues to engage in corrupt practices. And the regime continues to illegally detain and imprison our citizens without just cause or reason. These practices are unacceptable. H.R. 4744 serves as a clear signal to the people of Iran that we support them in their quest for freedom, it shines a light on the regime’s human rights violations and sanctions those who are complicit in such crimes. The same goes for Iranian officials guilty of corruption, censorship, and the diversion of goods intended for the Iranian people. Lastly, this bill sanctions individuals complicit in taking Americans and other nation’s citizens hostage and requires the President to work with our international partners to develop a strategy to put an end to this practice. We have five Americans currently detained in Iran—an intolerable circumstance that calls for action. We must do all we can, and apply as much pressure on Iran as necessary to ensure the American detainees’ safe release, and prevent future Americans from being held hostage by this brutal regime. I thank Congressman MCCAULand D EUTCH  for their leadership on this legislation to hold Iran’s corrupt officials accountable. I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill’s passage, and the passage of all the important measure before us today. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. WEBSTER of Florida). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4744, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
NO ASSISTANCE FOR ASSAD ACT Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4681) to limit assistance for areas of Syria controlled by the Government of Syria or associated forces, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4681 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘No Assistance for Assad Act’’. 
It is the policy of the United States that United States foreign assistance made available for early recovery, reconstruction, or stabilization in Syria should be used only in a democratic Syria or in areas of Syria not controlled by a government led by Bashar al Assad or associated forces. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. ENGEL ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. 
Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material in the RECORD . The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, this bill comes at a very critical time. After 7 years of devastating civil war, the destruction inflicted on the Syrian people by the Assad regime and its allies is catastrophic. By catastrophic, we mean a half million dead and we mean 14 million souls pushed out of their homes in that civil war. Even now, Iranianbacked militias are engaged in sectarian cleansing. Ethnic cleansing was supposed to be something of the past. They are forcing people from their homes, and Russian warplanes continue to drop bombs on hospitals. Just 2 weeks ago, the regime again used chemical weapons outside of Damascus as part of an operation that has displaced 55,000 people in this latest operation. Mr. Speaker, I want to commend the ranking member of our committee, Mr. ELIOT ENGEL , because during this period of time—and we have assisted in this effort—but during this period of time, he has tried to lead in getting a solution to the problem of that civil unrest in Syria, which began with people on the streets in Damascus marching, saying: ‘‘Peaceful, peaceful.’’ From day one, he has led an effort to try to focus us on trying to resolve this crisis. Unfortunately, as the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum noted in a recent report, the situation on the ground is getting even worse in Syria, and the worst, they say, is probably yet to come. At the same time as this carnage is going on, representatives of Syria, Iran, and Russia have spread out across the international community trying to gin up reconstruction money. They will not find it here. It would be unconscionable for U.S. Government function to be used for stabilization or reconstruction in the areas under control of the illegitimate Assad regime and its proxies, and I will tell you why: because the people in those areas that they have taken over are being pushed out. And the militia that are being brought in are militia— whether it is Hezbollah or other militia—that are not indigenous to those communities. We are not going to support the building of infrastructure that is going to benefit Hezbollah, Iran’s revolutionary guards, or foreign militias recruited and paid for by the Iranian regime. If or when the day comes that the Government of Syria is no longer led by Bashar alAssad and his proxies, then the U.S. can once again look at the prospect for assistance, if the day comes when people are allowed to return to their homes. We do have an interest in seeing a stable and secure— and not hostile—Syria one day. But until then, murder, industrial level torture, starvation, deliberate targeting of schools, hospitals, and markets, and the shameless use of chemical weapons cannot be in the remotest way possible supported by U.S. funding. Mr. Speaker, I ask that Members join with us to ensure no U.S. funding makes it into the hands of the Assad regime and his proxies. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS , Washington, DC, April 17, 2018. Hon. JEBHENSARLING , Chairman, Committee on Financial Services, Washington, DC. DEAR CHAIRMAN HENSARLING : Thank you for consulting with the Foreign Affairs Committee and agreeing to be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 4681, the No Assistance for Assad Act, so that the bill may proceed expeditiously to the House floor. I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of your committee, or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives on this resolution or similar legislation in the future. I would support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate number of conferees from your committee to any HouseSenate conference on this legislation. I will seek to place our letters on H.R. 4681 into the Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill. I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward to continuing to work together as this measure moves through the legislative process. Sincerely, EDWARD R. R OYCE , Chairman. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of the No Assistance for Assad Act. This act, H.R. 4681, was written by me. I am proud to be the lead sponsor in this bill. And I am proud of the bipartisan support that we have gotten from Chairman ROYCE and others on both sides of the aisle. Mr. Speaker, every time we think that the crisis in Syria could not get any worse, the Assad regime manages to plunge the country into even deeper depths. Children living in besieged Madaya could not get food, so they resort to eating leaves. A 7yearold and her mother tweeted goodbye messages from Aleppo under siege. What has happened recently in eastern Ghouta is just unfathomable. The White Helmets—first responders—rushing to the scene of an aerial attack, have been targeted themselves once they arrived to render aid. And the regime has continued using chemical weapons, which the world swore we would never use again. But no matter how Assad’s victims have met their ends—from nerve gas or barrel bombs or at the hands of Assad’s Russian or Iranian patrons—the loss of innocent life is staggering. My heart really bleeds for the people of Syria. What they have had to endure should not be endured by anyone. The United States needs to be vocal and we need to take action. As we continue to find some way to end the bloodshed, we also need to start thinking about what will come down the road. 
This bill says that American assistance for reconstruction in Syria should be available in areas controlled by Assad only if the regime stops indiscriminate use of weapons, ends attacks on civilians and civilian facilities, releases political prisoners, allows human rights organizations access to the prisons, and removes senior officials complicit in human rights abuses. If Bashar alAssad—the butcher of Syria—wants to destroy his own country and then expects the United States to pick up the pieces, he is sorely mistaken. That simply won’t happen. He and Russia and Iran broke Syria, and now they have to buy it. We were careful in crafting this legislation to ensure that these limitations won’t affect locally administered projects. And the bill permits humanitarian assistance to all in need. Recovery in Syria will be a slow and painful process. But we cannot allow those responsible for hundreds of thousands of murders to control American dollars meant to help the country rebuild. Who in the Foreign Affairs Committee can forget those horrendous pictures taken of all these dead corpses lying one by one right next to each other? Who could ever forget those atrocities that are being put up with by the people of Syria each and every day? I am grateful for the bipartisan support this bill has already received. I particularly want to thank Congressman KINZINGER , Congressman B OYLE , and Chairman ROYCE for their partnership in crafting this legislation. This legislation sends a message— particularly after the Assad regime again used chemical weapons—that we are closely watching the developments in Syria and that the United States will not assist those who are party to such heinous war crimes. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. KINZINGER ), the primary Republican cosponsor of this bill. Mr. KINZINGER. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman ROYCE , Ranking Member ENGEL , and the cochair of the Friends of a Free, Stable, and Democratic Syria Caucus with me, Representative BOYLE , for their work on this bill. In the start of the Syrian civil war in 2011, we thought it was going to be peaceful. Since then, 500,000 Syrians are dead—50,000 of which are children— at the hands of the brutal Assad regime. Assad, his regime, Russia, and Iran have committed genocide across Syria. They have targeted hospitals and schools, and they have destroyed critical infrastructure with indiscriminate barrel bombs and airstrikes. They reduced much of the country to rubble. As long as Assad is in power, they should be fully responsible for rebuilding. The No Assistance for Assad Act would place conditions on American nonhumanitarian assistance in Syrian territories controlled by the Assad regime or their allies. By limiting our reconstruction assistance to Assad, we send a strong message that the American people will not support any efforts to legitimize or bolster the barbaric Assad regime—a regime that uses chemical weapons on its own innocent civilians, as we saw especially recently. We have seen far too many horrifying images of the bloody and besieged children across Syria, suffering at the hands of an evil war criminal. As of January 2018, the United States has provided more than $7.7 billion in humanitarian assistance to the people of Syria. We will continue to support the innocent victims with emergency food, safe drinking water, shelter, and other vital resources that they desperately need. Separately, this legislation places strict conditions on the nonhumanitarian assistance for things like early recovery, stabilization, and reconstruction in the Assadcontrolled Syrian territories. The release of all political prisoners and providing full access to Syrian prisoners for human rights investigations and removing those human rights abusers from positions of authority are just two of the conditions included in this bill. The Syrian Government must also end all attacks against civilians and halt the development and deployment of ballistic and cruise missiles. For our own national security and that of our allies, we must do all we can now to prevent the next generation of terrorists down the road. b1700 Without hope and opportunity, the people of Syria and those across the Middle East will become prime recruits for groups like ISIS, Hezbollah, and others. The United States of America must take a stand against the genocide in Syria, the inhumane war crimes against the innocent people of Syria, and the oppressive strongmen, those like Assad. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 4681, the No Assistance for Assad Act. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. POE), the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I also want to thank and express my support for Ranking Member ENGEL ’s bill, H.R. 4681, the No Assistance for Assad Act. As he said, Assad is a butcher, a butcher of his own people. Syrian dictator Bashar alAssad continues to murder the Syrians en masse and destroy what was once a great ancient land. Because of the world’s inaction, he is close to victory. He has proven that evil triumphs when good men and women do nothing. Now Syria is in ruins and it must be rebuilt, but in the lands that Assad and his thugs control, we should play no part in helping his regime look like the saviors of the country. He and his Russian and Iranian backers must foot the bill for the destruction they brought upon Syria. Assad and his murderous supporters will try to use any reconstruction to cover up for their crimes. That is why it is important we pass H.R. 4681, to restrict any U.S.funded reconstruction assistance to areas the Syrian regime controls. The American people are kind; they are generous and will always help those in need. We always have—history proves it—but we will not pay for a propaganda win for brutal dictators like Assad. Let Assad and his buddies, the Iranians and the Russians, rebuild Assad’s territory. His regime has weaponized humanitarian aid throughout the war, and we can only expect him to continue to do so as he tries to retake territory. So, for now, let Assad rule over the ruins of the old Syria, the Syria he destroyed, and no U.S. money should ever go to Assad. One day, the Assads will be gone, but until then, we should not provide a dime of American money to strengthen his rule and grip over that land. And that is just the way it is. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, in closing, reconstruction and stabilization of a postISIS Syria is estimated to cost in the neighborhood of $300 billion. And, by the way, I wish I could say a postAssad Syria, because he is the one who really should go. The Syrian regime has spent the last 6 years destroying civilian infrastructure and driving people from their homes. It is simply not the role of the United States to support reconstruction in Syria, especially if the Assad regime continues to suppress the Syrian people and there is no accountability for his war crimes. For those who are considering investing in Syrian reconstruction in Assad controlled territories, just know that Syria is one of the most corrupt countries in the world. Therefore, it should be expected that reconstruction money would be syphoned off to those who have perpetrated war crimes and those who facilitate terrorism. We must prevent this. Again, we must not forget the plight of the Syrian people. We must continue to stand with the Syrian people. We must demand that there is an end to all chemical weapons and all weapons killing civilians with barrel bombs, with people trying to get out of the way, little children dying with their mothers, in their mother’s hands. This cannot continue. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. In closing, I would like to thank Ranking Member ENGEL and Representative KINZINGER for their exceptional work on this important bill. This bill will keep taxpayer dollars out of the hands of a murderous regime and its proxies. Time and again, Mr. ELIOT ENGEL has been this body’s conscience on the issue of Syria. We have acted many times, passing the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act twice; adopting H. Con. Res. 121, which expressed the sense of the Congress supporting the establishment of a tribunal in Syria to try Assad’s war crimes, another measure we had passed. While we have made important progress in the military campaign against ISIS, there is no end in sight to the misery inflicted on the people of Syria by Assad and his proxies. Now is not the time to turn away. As we engage, we cannot allow U.S. taxpayer money to reward war crimes. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4681, the No Assistance for Assad Act, introduced by my good friend Rep. ENGEL , the Ranking Member of our committee. I commend Rep. ENGEL and Rep. KINZINGER for advancing this important measure in a bipartisan manner to demonstrate the broad agreement in this House that Syrian President Bashar alAssad has no future as the legitimate leader of the Syrian people. Mr. Speaker, this bill would effectively block most categories of U.S. assistance to areas of Syria controlled by the Assad regime unless it is delivered through trusted local partners or serves basic humanitarian needs. In creating strict conditions for the provisions of U.S. assistance to regimecontrolled areas, this bill ensures that the United States will not help those responsible for destroying Syria to profit from rebuilding it. Mr. Speaker, the Syrian regime, Russia, and Iran have played both arsonist and firefighter in Syria’s devastating civil war—and now they want to play the role of predatory developer, sopping up reconstruction contracts to pad their pockets and further determine Syria’s future in line with their narrow political agendas. Mr. Speaker, Assad long ago surrendered his last shred of legitimacy as president of Syria. His regime’s horrific chemical attack this month in Douma placed this fact once again in high relief. The Trump Administration was right to respond decisively to this barbaric attack with targeted strikes to punish and deter such atrocities perpetrated with chemical weapons. Mr. Speaker, I have long advocated concrete steps that would ensure the Assad regime, jihadi groups, and others responsible for mass atrocities in Syria face justice for their crimes. This bill rightly insists on the removal of war criminals from the Syrian government as one condition among many for releasing U.S. aid to the regime. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this timely and important measure. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4681, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
SUPPORTING EFFORTS TO BRING THE 2026 FIFA WORLD CUP COMPETITION TO CANADA, MEXICO, AND THE UNITED STATES Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 111) recognizing and supporting the efforts of the United Bid Committee to bring the 2026 Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) World Cup competition to Canada, Mexico, and the United States, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution. The text of the concurrent resolution is as follows: 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. ENGEL ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. 
Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on this measure. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LAHOOD). 
I thank him for introducing a resolution which expresses the broad bipartisan agreement that the United States supports the United Bid Committee’s effort to jointly host the 2026 FIFA World Cup competition. Soccer is one of the most popular sports in the world, and the World Cup is its most important competition. Hosting the tournament would be a win for the United States and for our neighbors in Canada and Mexico as well. The United States has not hosted a FIFA World Cup since 1994, but 24 years later, we still hold the alltime attendance record. Over 3
1⁄2million people attended those matches. I remember. I was there in the stands for the games in L.A. The economic revenue generated by the 1994 tournament generated more than double what was expected. The 2026 tournament is expected to break revenue and attendance records. FIFA has already announced that it will be the first time in tournament history that 48 teams, instead of 32, are going to compete in the World Cup. The addition of more teams will mean more economic opportunities for American cities such as Los Angeles and San Francisco to host and entertain visitors from around the country and around the world. The FIFA World Cup, much like the Olympics, has a long tradition of bringing countries together in a competitive but peaceful environment. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure. First, let me thank Congressman LAHOOD for authoring this bipartisan resolution and Chairman ROYCE for bringing it to the floor. With this resolution, we send a strong message of support for the efforts of the United Bid Committee to bring the FIFA World Cup competition to the United States, Mexico, and Canada. We share critical relationships with our neighbors to the north and south, and it is important that we keep those good relationships. So I am pleased that Congress continues to push back on anything that would hurt the relationship. Last year, the House passed my resolution with Congressman MCCAUL reaffirming the importance of the U.S. Mexico partnership, as well as a resolution from Congressman JEFF DUNCAN  on the U.S.Canada alliance. The 2026 FIFA World Cup provides another key opportunity for us to reinforce our strong alliances with both Mexico and Canada. The United States has hosted the World Cup three times: the men’s tournament in 1994, and the women’s World Cup in both 1999 and 2003. We have the infrastructure. We know how to prepare. We have 25 American cities eligible to host. Bringing the world’s most popular tournament back to North America would generate increased tourist revenue for host sites as fans arrive from all over the world. Congress should not only pass this resolution, but Congress should also continue to provide support for the United Bid Committee and its efforts in our own conversations with foreign leaders and other stakeholders. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LAHOOD), the author of this resolution. Mr. LAHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman ROYCE for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Con. Res. 111, recognizing and supporting the efforts of the United Bid Committee to bring the 2026 FIFA World Cup soccer competition to the United States, Canada, and Mexico. This bipartisan resolution, introduced by the cochairs of the Congressional Soccer Caucus—myself, Congresswoman CASTOR , Congressman BACON , Congressman K IHUEN —conveys our strong support for this united North American bid to host the 2026 World Cup as well as voicing our overall support for soccer at the global level. When the U.S. last hosted the 1994 FIFA World Cup competition, it served as a catalyst for the increased popularity and development of soccer across America and the introduction of Major League Soccer, which is thriving today. Since the games in 1994, soccer has become one of the fastest growing sports in the United States, promoting a competitive and a healthy and active lifestyle, teamwork, and sportsmanship to over 24 million Americans of all ages in every State. This includes the 20 percent of American children under the age of 12 who currently play soccer. As the father to three young soccer players and the Representative of a district which includes eight college soccer programs, I recognize the value that soccer has for families and communities. Additionally, in my home State of Illinois, we are proud to be the home of the U.S. Soccer Federation and the Chicago Fire, one of Major League Soccer’s original soccer clubs. By uniting players and fans from different nations under one banner of friendship and fair competition, it is our hope that hosting the 2026 competition would promote and further the positive impact of soccer here and abroad. As the consideration of the 2026 location by FIFA continues, support from Congress will help demonstrate that our government is equally enthusiastic for North America’s three largest nations to host one of the world’s preeminent sporting events, which is soccer. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues who have supported this effort, including Chairman ROYCE , who has been a strong advocate for this resolution, and also my colleagues on the U.S. Congressional Soccer Caucus. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H. Con. Res. 111. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. CASTOR ), an original cosponsor of this resolution, but even more importantly, cochair of the Congressional Soccer Caucus. Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, the United States of America and our North American neighbors of Canada and Mexico have a wonderful opportunity to host the 2026 FIFA World Cup soccer tournament. This is a combined North American bid. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague, Representative LAHOOD, and Chairman ROYCE and Ranking Member ENGEL for their support of this resolution, and I also commend my colleagues, Congressman BACON and Congressman KIHUEN , who also cochair the Congressional Soccer Caucus. The United States last hosted the World Cup in 1994. We had nine cities. The attendance was over 3
1⁄2million. We think now for 2026 it is going to be bigger and better than ever because we are going to combine efforts with our North American neighbors of Canada and Mexico, where they will also host many of the tournament matches. b1715 Mr. Speaker, I noticed that Mr. WEBSTER was on the floor, along with Ms. ROSLEHTINEN and Mr. D EUTCH , and they should be proud to know that Orlando and Miami, from our home State of Florida, will be participating, and we love soccer in the Sunshine State. But I also offer my strong support for this resolution because of the inspiration that the World Cup soccer tournament provides to young people all across this country. It is like the Olympics. It encourages them to be healthy and well, to participate in team supports and athletics. It exposes and encourages children and young people to be good sports and understand what a world competition means in a friendly way. Studies show that team sports lead to healthier lifestyles, increased knowledge about exercise and nutrition, positive gains in reading and math; and that is why the Congressional Soccer Caucus works with the U.S. Soccer Foundation because they really provide the national model for programs about ‘‘the beautiful game,’’ and they make so many helpful investments in communities across the country to encourage kids to get out, be active, and learn about great sportsmanship. So here is this resolution. We are coming together in a bipartisan way, to recognize the effort, to support it, to make sure that Americans everywhere know that we expect the men’s team to live up to their expectations. The women’s team, national team, of course, 
has been champion after champion after champion. It is time, also, for the men’s team and this generation to try to meet their goals. We would like to encourage everyone to pay attention, support the effort. Again, I thank my colleague, Mr. LAHOOD, Chairman R OYCE , Ranking Member ENGEL ; and I urge the House to kick this resolution towards passage so that we can meet our goals. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. The ties between the United States, Mexico, and Canada are longstanding and deep; and I am pleased that the United States can continue to come together in partnership with our friends from both of those countries on the United Bid Committee to try to bring the 2026 World Cup to North America. I stand ready to support the North American bid in any way that I can. It would really be terrific to get it, and I know we all feel the same way. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. In closing, I would like to, once again, thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LAHOOD), and I also thank the 40 cosponsors who have been pushing this important, bipartisan resolution. By passing this resolution, we show our support for the efforts of the United Bid Committee to bring the excitement of the World Cup tournament to the United States once again, for the first time since 1994. Mr. Speaker, I urge unanimous support for this measure, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. POE of Texas). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution, H. Con. Res. 111, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
AMERICAN SPACE COMMERCE FREE ENTERPRISE ACT Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2809) to amend title 51, United States Code, to provide for the authorization and supervision of nongovernmental space activities, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 2809 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
the date of enactment of the American Space Commerce Free Enterprise Act. ‘‘§ 80209. Commercial Remote Sensing Regulatory Affairs Office ‘‘On the date that is 1 year after the date of enactment of the American Space Commerce Free Enterprise Act, the Commercial Remote Sensing Regulatory Affairs Office of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is abolished.’’. 
opinion shall be submitted directly from the Chair of the Advisory Committee to those Committees of Congress without any review or change by the Administration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. SMITH) and the gentleman from California (Mr. BERA) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. 
Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on H.R. 2809, the bill now under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, today, we give space exploration a booster rocket in the form of H.R. 2809, the bipartisan American Space Commerce Free Enterprise Act. The commercial space industry is poised to begin a major new vehicle for discoveries in space and national economic growth. It represents hundreds of billions of dollars in investments and the creation of thousands of jobs across the United States. For years, there has been uncertainty about which Federal agency has responsibility for approving nontraditional space activities and ensuring conformity with the Outer Space Treaty. This uncertainty has cramped capital formation and innovation and has driven American companies overseas. The American Space Commerce Free Enterprise Act remedies this situation by establishing a new, novel, legal, and policy framework that unleashes American free enterprise and businesses, assures conformity with Outer Space Treaty obligations, and guarantees that the U.S. will lead the world in commercial space activities throughout the 21st century. H.R. 2809 increases American competitiveness and attracts companies, talents, and money that would otherwise go to other countries. In short, the American Space Commerce Free Enterprise Act ensures that America and its workforce will benefit from the new space economy. The need for this legislation became evident during the previous administration when legal uncertainty arose after U.S. space exploration companies sought payload approval from the Department of Transportation for its nontraditional space activities. But the DOT payload approval process is not designed to satisfy the requirements of complying with the Outer Space Treaty, so the Federal Government has been unable to assure the private sector that new and innovative space activities would be approved for launch. The American Space Commerce Free Enterprise Act uses a commonsense approach to establish a sound legal foundation upon which U.S. industry can rely and flourish. It creates a selfcertification process for the nongovernmental space activities that provides regulatory certainty for the U.S. commercial space sector, it assures U.S. compliance with Outer Space Treaty obligations, and it addresses national security concerns in the least burdensome manner. Existing regulatory authority is currently spread across three Federal agencies, which has caused the review of commercial remote sensing applications to grind to a halt. H.R. 2809 consolidates this authority into one Federal agency, the Secretary of Commerce’s Office of Space Commerce. The result, America gets a onestopshop for authorizing outer space activities. Without H.R. 2809, America’s space industry would continue to face legal uncertainty. Innovation would be stifled by burdensome and openended regulatory processes. Other policies and interests of the United States are affected by private sector space activities, national security, in particular, but the American Space Commerce Free Enterprise Act improves national security by including remote sensing reform. By requiring a national security risk assessment during the remote sensing permitting process, this bill ensures that national security concerns are addressed. H.R. 2809 improves the permitting process by creating a single decision point, increasing transparency, avoiding unnecessary reviews of technologies that have already been approved, and preventing the interagency process from indefinitely delaying decisionmaking. These changes allow our remote sensing industry to continue to lead the world. The bill also goes farther than current law in providing for the physical safety of government assets in orbit. After operations are certified, the government can conduct an assessment of physical safety issues that will prevent disastrous collisions and help protect the safety of government and private assets. Cosponsors of the American Space Commerce Free Enterprise Act include Space Subcommittee Chairman BRIAN BABIN and recent Science, Space, and Technology Committee member and now NASA Administrator, JIM BRIDENSTINE . Both Chairman B ABIN and Administrator BRIDENSTINE have worked diligently to move this legislation forward. And Representatives PERLMUTTER , KILMER , and S OTO also helped develop this commonsense, bipartisan regulatory reform bill. Many thanks to all of them. This transformative and ground shaking legislation facilitates commercial liftoff and declares that America is fully open for business in space. American innovators, driven by ingenuity, competitive spirit, and bold vision are the future of space exploration. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support the American Space Commerce Free Enterprise Act.

The Space Commerce Act uses a common sense approach to establish a sound legal foundation upon which U.S. industry can rely and flourish. It creates a selfcertification process for nongovernmental space activities that provides regulatory certainty for the U.S. commercial space sector. And it assures U.S. compliance with Outer Space Treaty obligations and addresses national security concerns in the least burdensome manner. Existing regulatory authority is currently spread across three federal agencies, which has caused the review of commercial remote sensing applications to grind to a halt. Space based remote sensing is the use of satellites to detect and classify objects on Earth, including on the surface and in the atmosphere and oceans, based on electromagnetic radiation. H.R. 2809 consolidates this authority into one federal agency—the Secretary of Commerce’s Office of Space Commerce. The result: America gets a ‘‘onestop shop’’ for authorizing outer space activities. Without H.R. 2809, America’s space industry would continue to face legal uncertainty. Innovation would be stifled by burdensome and openended regulatory processes. Other policies and interests of the United States are affected by private sector space activities, national security in particular. But the Space Commerce Act improves national security by including remote sensing reform. By requiring a national security risk assessment 
during the remote sensing permitting process, this bill ensures that national security concerns are addressed. H.R. 2809 improves the permitting process by creating a single decision point, increasing transparency, avoiding unnecessary reviews of technologies that have already been approved, and preventing the interagency process from indefinitely delaying decision making. These changes allow our remote sensing industry to continue to lead the world. The bill also goes farther than current law in providing for the physical safety of government assets in orbit. After operations are certified, the government can conduct an assessment of physical safety issues that will prevent disastrous collisions and help protect the safety of government and private assets. Cosponsors of the Space Commerce Act include Space Subcommittee Chairman BRIAN BABIN and recent Science Committee member, and now NASA Administrator, Jim Bridenstine. Both Chairman BABIN and Administrator Bridenstine have worked diligently to move this legislation forward. And Representatives PERLMUTTER , KILMER , and SOTO also helped develop this common sense, bipartisan regulatory reform bill. Many thanks go to all of them. This transformative and groundshaking legislation facilitates commercial liftoff and declares that America is fully ‘‘open for business’’ in space. American innovators, driven by ingenuity, competitive spirit and bold vision, are the future of space exploration. I encourage my colleagues to support the American Space Commerce Free Enterprise Act. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Lastly, should a conference on the bill be necessary, I request your support for the appointment of conferees from the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure during any HouseSenate conference convened on this or related legislation. Thank you for placing a copy of this letter and your response acknowledging our jurisdictional interest into the Congressional Record during consideration of the measure on the House floor, to memorialize our understanding. I look forward to working with the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology as the bill moves through the legislative process. Sincerely, BILLSHUSTER , Chairman. 
Mr. BERA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2809, the American Space Commerce Free Enterprise Act of 2017. As the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Space, I support a robust and successful commercial space industry, and I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on policies that facilitate our Nation’s contained growth and leadership in space. The bill before us today, H.R. 2809, would provide a regulatory framework for U.S. innovative and emerging nongovernmental space activities. Commercial space launches, space based remote sensing, and space communications are currently authorized under existing frameworks in the FAA, the Department of Commerce, and the FCC. However, proposed activities such as commercial operations on the Moon, asteroid mining, satellite servicing, and privately owned space habitats are not covered. The bill establishes a certification process at Commerce for those emerging commercial space activities and, in so doing, provides important certainty for commercial companies and investors in these planned space activities. The bill also makes some updates to the licensing regime for commercial spacebased remote sensing systems. Further, the bill moves the regulatory oversight of commercial space based remote sensing systems to the Office of Space Commerce under the Secretary of Commerce. The Office of Space Commerce would also have authority for the certification of nontraditional commercial space activities. Mr. Speaker, I have often spoken about the importance of building a rulesoftheroad framework that does not stifle innovation and provides guardrails for proper government oversight. No bill is perfect, but I believe that this bill strikes a fair balance in achieving the goal of certifying these nontraditional commercial space activities that don’t fit within the current regulatory structure. That being said, while I support moving the bill forward, there are several aspects of H.R. 2809 that deserve further discussion, including ensuring that: Relevant Federal agencies can weigh in on whether proposed commercial space activities could affect the physical safety of U.S. Government space operations, including human space flight operations; Making sure that relevant government expertise and measures to perform harmful contamination of planetary surfaces are taken into account; Making sure that any remaining national security and intelligence agency concerns are addressed; And making sure additional information is provided on how the consolidated Office of Space Commerce will be properly funded and staffed so it can carry out the additional responsibilities for authorizing commercial space activities and commercial spacebased remote sensing under the bill. I am hopeful that these and other aspects of the bill will be addressed as the bill proceeds, both in the Senate and in any HouseSenate conference. Space is an area that should have bipartisan support from Congress. NASA and the commercial space industry can only benefit when we work together as Democrats and Republicans. As a result, I support passage of this bill, and I ask my colleagues to join me in helping to move this bill out of the House. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. b1730 Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California (Mr. BERA), the ranking member of the Space Subcommittee, for the comments that he just delivered, and also for cosponsoring this piece of legislation. Mr. Speaker, I yield 8 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BABIN), the chairman of the Space Subcommittee. Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD an oped that I wrote in January called ‘‘A onestopshop for private space exploration.’’ 
[Jan. 22, 2018] A ONESTOPSHOP FOR PRIVATE SPACE  EXPLORATION  (By U.S. Rep. Brian Babin) In the inaugural meeting of the reconstituted National Space Council, Vice President Mike Pence called for an overhaul of how the U.S. regulates commercial space activities. The potential of a robust economy in space will ‘‘unlock new opportunities, new technologies, and new sources of prosperity,’’ Pence said. The American Space Commerce Free Enterprise Act (H.R. 2809), recently passed by 
the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, accomplishes the vice president’s goals. This bill places authority over private sector space activities in the agency best equipped to foster economic growth, the Commerce Department. The bipartisan legislation streamlines regulatory processes, limits government intrusion, promotes American innovation and investment, protects national security and satisfies our Outer Space Treaty obligations. As chairman of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee’s space subcommittee, and as a member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, I have the unique perspective of overseeing both of these agencies. Because of this perspective, I believe placing this responsibility at the Commerce Department is a good long term decision for the United States and the space industry. The Obama administration proposed giving the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), housed within the Department of Transportation (DOT), responsibility for managing a broad interagency review of all private sector space activity proposals through an opaque process without defined approval timelines, regardless of how benign those activities may be. My committee held numerous hearings on this idea to hear directly from experts and stakeholders. We found that FAA accomplishes its current mission— managing launches and reentry—very well. However, the agency is challenged to meet its existing obligations to regulate launch and reentry, and should not be burdened with the additional responsibility of authorizing and supervising private activities in space. Moreover, current law actually prohibits DOT from regulating activities in space. It only has the ability to deny a launch if no other agency has licensed the activity. Congress did not intend or design this authority to create regulatory authority for onorbit activities, or authorization or supervision process for Outer Space Treaty compliance. In contrast, the Commerce Department’s mission is to ‘‘create the conditions for economic growth and opportunity,’’ and that mission runs deep through the culture. As the space economy develops, inspace activities will focus more on commerce, less on transportation logistics. Mining, habitation modules, and satellite servicing are only a few of the novel ideas that American innovators are proposing. These activities are not related to transportation, and DOT has no experience in this field. The Commerce Department, however, is familiar with the issues that future stakeholders will need to consider, including international trade and technology. The bill also streamlines the federal space bureaucracy within the Commerce Department itself. It merges the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) responsibilities over spacebased remote sensing into the alreadyexisting Office of Space Commerce within the Commerce Department. NOAA is itself housed within the Commerce Department, so having two separate offices handling the same responsibilities makes no sense. Reforming this splintered regulatory process minimizes the burden on other agencies and makes the Commerce Department a one stop shop for Outer Space Treaty compliance. Giving DOT authority, as proposed by the previous administration, would split the regulatory system, requiring remotesensing satellite operators to seek regulatory approval for their operations from both DOT and the Commerce Department. Indeed, placing this authority at the Commerce Department is a continuation of long standing law and national policy. Since 1984, Commerce has been the only federal agency with the legal authority to authorize and supervise space activities. While the Federal Communications Commission regulates spectrum and DOT regulates launch and re entry, neither has the authority to authorize and supervise space activities generally to assure compliance with the Outer Space Treaty. Some stakeholders have questioned whether the Office of Space Commerce can handle remotesensing licensing and supervising general space activities. The answer is yes. The Commerce Department already has expertise authorizing and supervising remote sensing systems, and the bill’s streamlined review process is more transparent, quicker, and less burdensome on staff. Importantly, Commerce also has expertise in balancing national security with commercial interests, working with American industry internationally and in regulating space dualuse technologies through the Export Administration Regulations. The American Space Commerce Free Enterprise Act declares that America is open for business in outer space. The only agency with the longstanding experience and culture to regulate and foster the budding space economy is the Commerce Department. With this innovative legislation, which builds on that culture of transparency and clarity, we position the American space industry as a leader in growing a robust and lawful economy in space. 
Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in favor of H.R. 2809, the American Space Commerce Free Enterprise Act. The American Space Commerce Free Enterprise Act is a commonsense bipartisan bill that streamlines the regulatory processes, limits burdensome government intrusion, promotes American innovation and investment, protects national security, and satisfies our international obligations. One of the fundamental drivers for this legislation has been that innovative American companies are pushing the boundaries. And when the Senate ratified the Outer Space Treaty 50 years ago, free enterprise in outer space was an idea but was not reality. Today, not only does U.S. free enterprise exist in outer space, but it is innovating at an unprecedented pace. From astroid mining to private Moon missions, to satellite servicing, to remote sensing constellations, there is great promise that American enterprise will soon unlock new wealth and scientific benefits. But this promise is threatened; threatened by expansive, unchecked regulatory authority, cumbersome nontransparent regulatory processes, and misperceptions about the United States’ Outer Space Treaty obligations. For several years, we have heard concerns from stakeholders that they need greater regulatory certainty to attract investment and to succeed. Stakeholders also reported that while they want to stay in America, due to regulatory burdens and uncertainty, they might need to go overseas. The American Space Commerce Free Enterprise Act addresses these concerns without compromising our cherished principles of liberty and freedom. It provides for presumptions of approval and requires the government to take affirmative steps before conditioning or denying proposed space or remote sensing operations. It places the burden of demonstrating inconsistency with Outer Space Treaty obligations and national security requirements of the United States with the government and not the applicant. It curtails vague, overreaching regulatory authority and prevents tolling of statutory adjudication timelines. It ensures U.S. industry receives a timely and transparent determination on applications. The bill recognizes legitimate national security equities and provides for the condition or denial of authorized space activities with remote sensing systems that are a significant threat to U.S. national security in certain circumstances. But it protects against abuses of interagency discretion by requiring an explanation and evidence of the threat before conditions or denial can be made. In order to ensure the Office of Space Commerce is empowered to represent the interests of our citizens and the private sector, the director of the office is elevated to be the new assistant secretary for Space Commerce. The act also advances important public policy interests. The bill establishes a mandatory safety consultation between private and Federal Government operators. The goal of this consultation is for the affected parties to reach a voluntary agreement to mitigate safety risks. For parties subject to U.S. jurisdiction, the act provides for Federal district court jurisdiction for any civil action resulting from certified or permitted space operations. To protect against foreign harmful interference, the act directs the President to protect against acts of foreign aggression and foreign harmful interference. The act also addresses concerns of harmful contamination of the Earth or celestial bodies. Pursuant to our international obligations under the Outer Space Treaty, operations may be conditioned or denied by the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with appropriate agencies such as NASA to address harmful contamination. The bill posits longstanding U.S. policy, confirmed by both Department of State and NASA, that COSPAR planetary protection guidelines are not international obligations of the United States. This was done to allow all stakeholders, including the scientific community and industry, to work together as activities expand beyond scientific exploration and to address mutual interests, not by proscribing COSPAR guidelines as binding international law, but by allowing the Outer Space Treaty to guide our activities. I am grateful to have worked with Chairman SMITH and Representative 
BRIDENSTINE , recently confirmed as NASA administrator, in the development of this bill. I am also very glad that this is a bipartisan bill, with the support of Representatives PERLMUTTER and K ILMER  and BERA. I strongly support this bill and urge my colleagues to do the same. Again, my oped is a very, very telltale reason and shows exactly why this is a great bill to put this under the Department of Commerce and take it out from under the Department of Transportation. For many reasons, I hope that this would be a source of debate and where we will get the reasons for what we are doing with this. Mr. BERA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. PERLMUTTER ), my good friend and allaround champion of human space travel to Mars by 2033. Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California (Mr. BERA), the ranking member, and Chairmen SMITH and B ABIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a supporter and cosponsor of H.R. 2809. The United States has the best aerospace industry in the world. In order to stay number one, we need to provide certainty to American industry so it can attract investment and continue innovating to push our country forward. We are at a time where we have the opportunity to set the standard of how to regulate space activities so there is a level playing field for our American industry. That is why we need a certification process, as provided in the bill, to ensure compliance with the Outer Space Treaty. This process will reduce uncertainty and create a clear path to certification and to the launch of new spacecraft. I have heard from stakeholders still discussing where to place this new authority. This legislation placed that authority in the Office of Space Commerce. Others have suggested the Office of Space Transportation at the FAA. I hope this discussion continues and we reach a consensus as we continue through the legislative process with the Senate. The second part of this bill makes important reforms for the remote sensing industry. Satellite imagery or space images are also known as the remote sensing industry, and it is changing the way we see the Earth and enabling businesses of all types to find new opportunities. A major remote sensing company named DigitalGlobe is headquartered in my district in Westminster, Colorado. I have heard stories about how long they have waited for a license determination under NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency—over 4 years in one case. This is well past the 120day deadline currently required in statute because of a broken interagency review process and no mechanism to enforce a timeline. This is why I believe the reforms in section 4 of the bill are overdue. Those companies in the remote sensing industry need certainty so that they can make sound plans and attract investors and customers. All of these regulatory delays mean lost revenue and significant expenses as they wait for approval. Section 4 of the bill helps fix that. During the markup of this bill last year, we made improvements to the bill to ensure the Office of Space Commerce has the time needed to get its decisions right and to strengthen the consultation language to require the Secretary of Commerce to consult with other relevant Federal agencies. Since the markup, I was pleased to see additions to the bill which ensure the proper balance with the defense community to ensure the Department of Defense has the proper input into remote sensing applications. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman SMITH, Chairman B ABIN, and now NASA Administrator Bridenstine for their work with me on this bill. I thank Ranking Member JOHNSON  and Ranking Member BERAfor raising a number of important issues which we still have to address as we go through this process. I believe the bill before the House today is a good bill, and I look forward to working with the Senate to pass these reforms into law. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. PERLMUTTER ) for his enthusiasm about space. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. ROHRABACHER ), who is a very active member of the Science, Space and Technology Committee and of the Space Subcommittee. Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2809. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman SMITH for the great job that he has been doing, and also to Subcommittee Chairman BABIN and Subcommittee Ranking Member BERA. This is truly a bipartisan piece of legislation, and I believe under Chairman SMITH’s leadership, we have had a bipartisan committee in the Science, Space and Technology Committee. H.R. 2809, the American Space Commerce Free Enterprise Act, clears up the doubt around commercial space activities. Which agency is responsible? Who will give me the answers? It is hard enough to create a new technology and develop new markets without having to get five different answers about which bureaucrat needs to sign off on what form. This uncertainty, this confusion, has forced companies overseas, much in the same way that companies were forced overseas before the Commercial Space Act of 2004, of which I was the author. Now, as then, it is the fault of Congress for not keeping up with the industry. Now, as then, we choose to enable American cuttingedge space companies by providing the framework in which they can build, test, and create. Now, as then, we choose to lead the world, and we are making this a better world through our space enterprise. Do you remember when longdistance telephone calls cost a fortune? Ordinary people could not make phone calls to their loved ones. So in a way, by bringing down the cost and enhancing the quality of that type of communication through spacebased enterprise, we have expanded the goodwill of people towards each other and their families throughout the world. We have made sure, for example, that with spacebased assets, even farmers know when to plant, thus we have more food production at a cheaper price, and spacebased assets have made America safer. Mr. Speaker, it has been an honor to work with the gentleman from Texas (Mr. SMITH) on these spacerelated issues, and I would hope that we continue to work together in cooperation, showing America’s young people that we believe in the future, and whether it is Republican or Democrat, we are going to work together to make sure they have that future they deserve. Mr. BERA. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I think you have seen the genuine enthusiasm that Democrats and Republicans and all Americans have about space. It is in that spirit of national pride and American leadership that I urge all my colleagues to pass this bill, and, again, to continue to foster American leadership in space and meet that goal that my colleague Mr. PERLMUTTER often talks about, getting to Mars by 2033. Mr. Speaker, it has been a pleasure working with the chairman of the full committee and the subcommittee, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. b1745 Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I just want to thank, publicly, Majority Leader KEVIN MCCARTHY for cosponsoring this legislation as well. I encourage my colleagues to support it, and I appreciate the remarks by the gentleman from California (Mr. BERA). I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2809, the American Space Commerce Free Enterprise Act. I believe that this bill strikes the right balance between supporting American innovation in space while addressing the potential national security concerns related to emerging spacebased remote sensing capabilities. It is not in our interest to overregulate emerging innovative space companies and drive them overseas to be licensed. We saw this happen with the synthetic aperture radar market, which fled to Europe in the 1990’s, and our domestic market for that technology is still suffering the consequences. 
But we also cannot allow the physical security and operational success of our warfighters to be jeopardized by new commercial technologies. Technologies such as commercial signals intelligence and spacebased radio frequency mapping may contribute to the ability of our adversaries to more accurately track our forces as they execute their missions abroad. We need to acknowledge the risks posed by these emerging technologies and allow the Department of Defense to have a role in addressing any national security threat posed by commercial remote sensing, spacebased radio frequency mapping, and commercial signals intelligence. This bill strikes a good balance in two core principles of American free enterprise—promoting innovation and protecting our national security. As it moves through the process, it may be that additional concerns may rise or be dispelled. The full range of national security concerns must be taken into account when making certification or licensing decisions for commercial remote sensing satellites. It is important that all relevant committees, including the House Armed Services Committee, be involved at each step to ensure that the totality of American national interest is promoted. I would like to particularly thank Chairman LAMAR SMITH for his vision and for his patience in working through the variety of issues related to this legislation. The Congress will miss his leadership and good nature in the years to come. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on H.R. 2809, the ‘‘American Space Commerce Free Enterprise Act of 2017’’. Before turning to my substantive concerns with the bill, I must note my disappointment with the process followed by the Majority—a process that led to the Majority’s putting this bill on today’s suspension calendar without any attempt to engage with the Minority to address our concerns in the ten months since the bill was marked up in the Science Committee. That is not the way we should be legislating in this House. However, here we are. I would anticipate that very few Members have had any opportunity to review this legislation or to examine the issues it raises. So in my remaining time, I will attempt to identify a few of the concerns I have with this bill. First, H.R. 2809 proposes a significant realignment of governmental space organizations, and a very significant increase in the responsibilities and authorities to be given the Department of Commerce’s Office of Space Commerce—an office that currently has only a handful of employees. These would include the authorization and supervision of nongovernmental space activities. At the same time, the FAA’s Office of Commercial Space Transportation (FAA AST), which has built up significant expertise and staff over the years in the areas of licensing commercial space launches and reentries and which has coordinated authorization of a nontraditional space mission, would have no significant role in any of the commercial space activities covered in this bill beyond launch and reentry licenses. As a result, DoC will have to build a new bureaucracy to carry out its new duties, and in the process have to duplicate the skills that already reside in FAA’s AST. All of this would be set in motion without a single House hearing on the proposal or any other substantive review of it. At the same time that the Department of Commerce is given those significant new responsibilities, including ensuring compliance with the Outer Space Treaty, something that has been and is a core responsibility of the State Department, the bill would significantly limit DoC’s ability to disapprove a certification application as long as the paperwork is complete, regardless of any nonOuter Space Treatyrelated concerns involving U.S. international obligations that the application might raise. Again, all of these measures are included in the bill without any substantive prior congressional review of the proposals. I could go on and cite other examples, but in the interests of time I will just note that the bill also would significantly weaken the enforcement of the international standards and guidelines covering ‘‘planetary protection’’, i.e., the prevention of contamination of scientifically important sites on planetary surfaces or moons that might accrue from commercial space activities. These standards and guidelines were largely shaped by NASA through years of engagement in relevant international bodies, but the bill would replace them with a largely laissez faire approach to the problem of potential contamination by commercial space activities. Mr. Speaker, I will stop with that example. I could cite concerns raised by a number of agencies, including NASA, but the reality is that none of them are going to be resolved by today’s House debate on the suspension bill H.R. 2809. The potential for unintended negative consequences from provisions that have not been thoroughly vetted should give all of us pause, as should the pages and pages of comments from agencies such as NASA that warrant attention before the Congress finalizes legislation. For example, NASA’s has raised a concern about the bill’s ambiguity as to whether its activities will be subject to the oversight of another federal agency, especially those that involve the use of commercial services as part of a NASA mission, which could adversely impact its ability to carry out its challenging initiatives. In closing, the bill before us attempts to address important issues that need our attention if we are to appropriately balance the needs of the emerging commercial space industry and the government’s responsibility to protect the interests of America’s citizens and honor our international obligations. It makes a positive contribution to the debate on how best to proceed in undertaking future commercial and governmental space endeavors. However, for the reasons I have already discussed, I think the bill is only partially successful in that attempt. In any event, many of these complex issues are not going to be resolved by a single piece of legislation and will likely require legislative efforts over multiple Congresses. That said, the bill before us does represent a useful starting point for discussion and debate. As a result, I do not intend to oppose this bill moving out of the House today. Instead, if after this bill leaves the House, the Senate decides to engage on this legislation or its own legislative approach, I hope and expect that the issues I have flagged today—along with others—will receive the bicameral scrutiny that they deserve. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland Security Committee and a former member of the Science Committee I am in strong support of H.R. 2809, the ‘‘American Space Commerce Free Enterprise Act of 2017.’’ Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman SMITH and Ranking Member E DDIE BERNICE  JOHNSON for their work to bring H.R. 2809 before the House for consideration. There is historic congressional support for NASA in Congress, and I am proud to have played a leading role in this effort. Now that space exploration has attracted strong private sector investments, space exploration has entered a new era. I served on the House Science Committee for 12 years; and one of the goals was to see private sector investments in space exploration. This legislation grants the Office of Space Commerce (OSC) of the Department of Commerce the authority to issue certifications to U.S. nationals and nongovernmental entities for the operation of: 1. specified humanmade objects manufactured or assembled in outer space, including on the Moon and other celestial bodies, with or without human occupants, that were launched from Earth; and 2. all items carried on such objects that are intended for use in outer space. To be eligible for certification, each entity’s application must include a space debris mitigation plan for the space objects. H.R. 2809 also directs that the Office of Space Commerce (OSC) establish a Private Space Activity Advisory Committee to: 1. analyze the status and recent developments of nongovernmental space activities, and 2. advise on matters relating to U.S. private sector activities in outer space. The bill authorizes the OSC to issue permits to persons for the operation of spacebased remote sensing systems. The OSC will also establish an Advisory Committee on Commercial Remote Sensing to provide advice on matters relating to the U.S. commercial spacebased remote sensing industry. The bill also abolishes the Commercial Remote Sensing Regulatory Affairs Office of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It is our job as members of Congress to make sure that NASA continues to push the boundaries of what is possible, keeping our Nation on the forefront of innovation and exploration. However, when the impossible becomes routine, and private sector interest in the area of space exploration attracts investment and further innovation in the area of commercialization it is fitting to support private sector efforts. We should not forget the role that private and public sector efforts have made in developing and promoting advancements in aviation from its earliest beginnings. The Wright Brothers were private citizens who devoted themselves to solving the problems associated with human flight. Their success led others inside and outside of government to pursue innovations that led to the development of technology that ultimately led us into space. 
NASA continues to be the world’s premier space organization but as innovation and private interest in space continues we must make room for private sector interests. We must provide for safe and responsible space innovations, while assuring that the United States remains a leader in this area. H.R. 2809 maintains sustainability of purpose for the government’s support of commercial space activities. The bill lays the ground work for an expansion in commercial space activity and emphasizes the importance of maintaining a steady cadence of science missions that lead the way into deeper exploration of our planet, solar system and beyond. This authorization addresses an issue of great importance to a sustained and healthy space program. The bill provides a place in the Department of Commerce for remote sensing commercial space activity. It is the responsibility of this Congress to ensure that the future of NASA is one of continued progress and that space exploration remains a part of our national destiny. NASA inspires our children to look to the stars and dream of what they too may achieve one day. Space exploration allows us to push the bounds of our scientific knowledge, as we carry out research projects not possible within the constraints of planet Earth. I ask my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of H.R. 2809. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. SMITH) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2089, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
INNOVATORS TO ENTREPRENEURS ACT OF 2018 Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 5086) to require the Director of the National Science Foundation to develop an ICorps course to support commercializationready innovation companies, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 5086 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Innovators to Entrepreneurs Act of 2018’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. WEBSTER ) and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LIPINSKI ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. 
Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on H.R. 5086, the bill now under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, today I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting the Innovators to Entrepreneurs Act, H.R. 5086. I thank my friend DANIEL LIPINSKI  for introducing the legislation with me. He is a champion of the timeproven Innovation Corps program, better known as ICorps. This bipartisan piece of legislation is a result of the committee hearings on the ICorps program. The Innovation Corps program was created by the National Science Foundation in 2011 to teach scientists and engineers how to 
turn their laboratory innovations into successful commercial products and services. This program assists scientists and engineers in the development of their academic research and equips them to bring that research into the private market. We have witnessed the wonderful successes of this program in my home State of Florida and across the Nation. H.R. 5086 expands the ICorps program by creating a new course for commercializationready companies. Following the completion of an I Corps team course, individuals are eligible for this new course which will help them create, market, and eventually expand their private sector company. Through marketing, hiring, organizing, and attracting investors, these participants’ success increases dramatically. The bill breaks down the barriers experienced by current scientists when attempting to bring their product to market. Additionally, this bill expands the groups allowed to apply for the I Corps program and offers new options for how to initially pay for the course. Mr. Speaker, I would appreciate my colleagues’ support in passing this commonsense piece of legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5086, the Innovators to Entrepreneurs Act of 2018, a bill that I introduced to spur entrepreneurship and turn American innovation into jobs. I want to thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. WEBSTER ) for being a lead cosponsor of this legislation. This bill expands the National Science Foundation’s highly successful Innovation Corps, or ICorps, program, which, as my Science, Space, and Technology Committee colleagues know, I have been a major champion of since it was first created by NSF in 2011. In 2016, I led the effort that officially authorized ICorps. ICorps teaches scientists and engineers how to turn their federally funded laboratory research into successful products and services. The program has educated more than 1,100 teams, including many women and underrepresented minorities, and has been linked to over 400 startup companies. Since it was authorized in the last Congress, NSF has helped spread I Corps to other agencies, including the National Institutes of Health, NASA, and the Department of Energy. The Federal Government invests billions of dollars in research and development annually, both at government facilities like National Labs and at universities and research institutions. I Corps is a modest investment that leads to a much higher return on our federally funded research by significantly increasing rates of commercialization and job creation. Our economy is driven by the ingenuity of our scientists and engineers, developing innovations today that become tomorrow’s great products; and yet, still only a minority of federally funded research with commercial potential ever makes it to the marketplace. The ICorps program helps change that. But we can do even more, and this bill helps to do that. First, it helps more people participate in the program. Right now, unless you are a grantee of the NSF or another agency with an ICorps program, the training can be difficult to access. This bill will give recipients of small business grants from any Federal agency the flexibility to pay for ICorps with their grant funds. It will also let private citizens apply and pay out of pocket to participate. Second, the bill directs NSF to establish a new course as part of the ICorps program to teach scientist entrepreneurs how to start and grow a company. While the current ICorps course does a great job of helping scientists develop innovation and determine whether or not it is suitable for commercialization, it offers only limited guidance for what to do after the decision is made to become an entrepreneur. Skills such as how to write a business plan, hire a team, and attract investment are taught in business schools, but not in Ph.D. programs. NSF recognizes that need and has already begun a pilot program to test curricula for this new course. This bill will make sure the new course is fully developed and made available around the country. Finally, this bill requires a GAO assessment of the ICorps program, its first comprehensive, independent evaluation since it was created. Although the program’s success to date speaks for itself, it is important to continuously improve it by developing metrics to measure its performance and to ensure that Federal funds are well spent. This bill has been endorsed by a wide range of stakeholders, including the former NSF program officer who founded the program, Dr. Errol Arkilic; Silicon Valley serial entrepreneur who developed the curriculum that ICorps is based on, Steve Blank; and directors of ICorps Nodes around the country. The bill is also endorsed by the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, the National Venture Capital Association, the Council on Governmental Relations, and the Association of Public and Landgrant Universities. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman SMITH and Ranking Member J OHNSON for their support of this legislation, and again I want to thank the lead cosponsor, Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. I also want to thank Senator COONS , who is leading the Senate companion bill. I ask my colleagues to support this commonsense legislation which will help spur greater American innovation and create more jobs, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. SMITH), the chairman of the Space, Science, and Technology Committee. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. WEBSTER ), a valued member of the Space, Science, and Technology Committee for yielding me time. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5086, the Innovators to Entrepreneurs Act. The bill extends the reach of the National Science Foundation’s Innovative Corps, or ICorps, program, which trains and prepares scientists and engineers to advance their research results into entrepreneurial opportunities. H.R. 5086 expands who is eligible to participate in ICorps courses, allowing a portion of small business innovation research grants and small business technology transfer grants to be used to cover ICorps training expenses. The bill also allows any private citizen to apply to participate and pay outof pocket. H.R. 5086 authorizes a new ICorps course for commercialready research ventures that teaches skills involving company organization, attracting investors, and hiring. In research labs today lie the seeds for breakthroughs in new fields like quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and bioengineering. These breakthroughs will continue to transform our lives and the world we live in. Many scientists and engineers are not trained for commercializing those ideas and did not go to business school or take any business development classes. ICorps gives researchers tools to maximize the taxpayer investment in basic research and to spur innovation. H.R. 5086 builds on the success of the ICorps program in building connections between academia and the private sector to create more startups and more jobs. We thank the Research and Technology Subcommittee Ranking Member DANLIPINSKI and Representative DANIEL WEBSTER for taking the lead on this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill. Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman SMITH again for his support of this legislation. We all know that helping our scientists, engineers, and academics not only advances our knowledge and understanding of the world, but it also creates jobs and products that fuel our economy, which is a goal that all of us can agree upon. As a former university professor, I know that it is not something that we teach in Ph.D. programs. We have the greatest researchers in the world here in the United States. We invest so much in Federal dollars for research. This is a simple program, low cost, that helps get the biggest bang for our buck, helps create jobs, and keeps 
America on the leading edge of innovation in the world. It is something that we need for today and for our future. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. LIPINSKI , Chairman S MITH, and the entire House Science, Space, and Technology Committee for their support of this legislation. It is a good bill, and it will spur the creation of new businesses and new jobs. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. LIPINSKI for his leadership on this issue and for introducing this legislation. Scientific research conducted at our nation’s universities and national laboratories has had an undeniable impact on our daily lives. The societal impacts of research have been varied. Scientific advances have improved public health and safety, increased our national security, enhanced our quality of life, and advanced our economic competitiveness. The societal benefit of research is only realized if the science successfully makes it out of the laboratory. This does not always happen, and in fact, the successful commercialization of scientific advances is largely the exception, rather than the rule. The path from the laboratory to the market is difficult to navigate. Many promising ideas are never considered for commercialization, while some researchers invest significant time and money into launching a startup only to realize that there is no market for their innovation. The commercialization of scientific research is an important driver of economic growth. Now, more than ever, global competition is pushing companies to innovate and incorporate new technologies into their business models. At the same time, researchers are generating innovative products, processes, and services with the potential to transform entire industries. To maintain our position as the global leader in technological innovation, we must ensure that we are realizing the full economic potential of federal investment in research. Other countries have caught on to research as one of the secrets to our success, and they are nipping at our heels. To accelerate and streamline the process of maximizing the impact of research beyond the laboratory, the National Science Foundation launched its Innovation Corps, or ICorps, program in 2011. The NSF ICorps program leverages existing curriculum, tools, and educational resources to prepare grantees to identify and pursue commercial opportunities with their NSFfunded research. Since it was established, the ICorps program has successfully provided entrepreneurship training to nearly 3,000 individuals at over 200 universities. Combined, ICorps grantees have raised over $100 million, with $30 million coming from private investors. Grantees have used the skills and networks they gained from their ICorps training to start over 360 companies. The success of ICorps has generated significant interest from individuals outside of academia. The Innovators to Entrepreneurs Act of 2018 expands the reach of ICorps by extending eligibility to SBIR grantees and other outside entities. The bill also builds upon the existing ICorps curriculum by adding a course to help research ventures that are ready to be brought to market. I encourage my colleagues to join me in support of this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. WEBSTER ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5086, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
RESIGNATION AS MEMBER OF COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION AND THE WORKFORCE The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following resignation as a member of the Committee on Education and the Workforce:

HONORING THE LIFE OF FIRST LADY BARBARA BUSH Mr. HURD. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform be discharged from further consideration of House Resolution 838, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House. The Clerk read the title of the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. The text of the resolution is as follows: 
MOMENT OF SILENCE HONORING THE LIFE OF FORMER FIRST LADY BARBARA BUSH (Mr. WILLIAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this time to speak about and reflect on the wonderful life of our former First Lady Barbara Bush. To those who knew her, they knew the amount of love and kindness she exemplified every single day on this Earth. She was a caring and compassionate wife, mother, and grandmother who displayed true devotion to her country in all phases of her life. I had the great honor of knowing Mrs. Bush and her family. I have many fond memories of summertime with her and President Bush that my family and I will cherish forever. On April 21, the day she was laid to rest in Houston, Texas, the congregation in that church and people all around the Nation remembered her with great fondness and admiration. Our country is better because of Mrs. Bush. She will always be missed, but she will never be forgotten. I hope all of you in this Chamber will join me for a moment of silence to remember the life and legacy of former First Lady Barbara Bush. May God bless the Bush family and may God bless this great Nation that is better because of her. 
b1915 ELIMINATE OBSTACLES TO STUDENT VOTERS (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, young Americans vote at the lowest rates of any age group, and this is rooted in the unique obstacles faced by college students. When students move to a new campus, often in a new State, having never voted or even registered to vote, they lack the institutional support to help them navigate the voting process. That is why Senator BOOKER and I have introduced the Help Students Vote Act. Our legislation will take 
three major steps in eliminating the obstacles students face in voting. First, it requires every college and university to send voter registration information to all its students twice a year, at least 30 days before registration deadlines. Second, it requires every school to designate a campus vote coordinator to answer students’ questions about voting and to promote voting. And third, it encourages civic engagement by authorizing grants to colleges and universities that take exemplary action to promote political participation. The Help Students Vote Act is essential and will help our country better engage the next generations of American citizens. 
TEXAS LAWMAN CHRISTOPHER GAINES (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, it is remarkable that Harris County, Texas, Precinct 4 Deputy Constable Christopher Gaines is alive. On April 17, Deputy Gaines and three other officers responded to a domestic violence call in Atascocita, Texas, where we both live. Approaching the house, the officers were cautious, and rightfully so. After all, Mr. Speaker, 22 percent of police officers that are shot occur during domestic violence calls. Suddenly, the outlaw dashed out of the house with his guns blazing. The deputies returned fire, but with little or no area to take cover, 2year veteran of the force Deputy Constable Gaines was shot in the abdomen at point blank range with a shotgun. Gaines’ wife even heard the shots from their nearby home. Gaines’ fellow officers rushed him to the hospital and put him directly into surgery. Gaines’ only thoughts were of his wife and his 4yearold daughter, Zoey. Thanks to the good Lord, and the medical professionals at Memorial Hermann, Zoey’s dad is alive. After speaking with him, he told me he is in high spirits and expected to recover. He is already talking about returning to work. Mr. Speaker, Deputy Christopher Gaines is one of the rare breed of American lawmen that always stand ready to protect and defend the rest of us from evildoers. And that is just the way it is. 
AMERICANS DESERVE A BETTER DEAL (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, New Jersey’s 10th Congressional District is the home of the Port NewarkElizabeth Marine Terminal, the largest port on the East Coast; Newark Liberty International Airport; Amtrak’s Bostonto D.C. line, the center of that line; I–95; and Route 78 going west in this great Nation. Transportation infrastructure drives my district’s economic growth and the economy of States throughout the Northeast. The White House and congressional Republicans have spent the past year promising to rebuild America’s infrastructure, but all the American people have gotten is a raw deal that would sell off America’s infrastructure to Wall Street and leave Main Street to fill in all the potholes. The people who live in my district deserve a better deal than they are getting under this majority and this administration. My Democratic colleagues and I have a real plan to rebuild America. It is five times as big as the puny proposal by the White House. Democrats want to create 16 million new goodpaying jobs, build bridges, clear roads, broadband, schools, water infrastructure, energy grids, and transit. That is what my constituents and the American people deserve. f 
TERM LIMITS ARE NEEDED IN CONGRESS (Mr. FRANCIS ROONEY of Florida asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. FRANCIS ROONEY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise to discuss the dire need we have for term limits in the Congress. Eightysix percent of Americans agree, but it is possible that Congress doesn’t. I have introduced the Thomas Jefferson Public Service Act of 2018 to create a limit of 12 years without amending the Constitution, something which we all know will never happen. It is time for Congress to ‘‘fish or cut bait.’’ To the argument about the value of seniority, I would humbly suggest that we ask the 18 to 25year old millennials in our country, these folks here, who will be voting and taking over the workforce. As you can see here, they voted massively for Democrats in 2016—that is the blue—and would have left an electoral college of 504 Democrats and 23 Republicans. Across the business world where I come from, employers are responding to the millennials’ lack of concern for seniority, refusal to wait their turn, and questioning deference to authority. I am not making a value judgment. I am telling you, that is the way they are; and if you want employees and good people, you have got to deal with their concerns. The digital age is different. We Republicans have a chance of convincing them that we are nimble, flexible, and responsive by adopting this law. If we stay in our rut, like Hamlet, we deserve our fate. AMERICA DESERVES A BETTER DEAL (Mr. TONKO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, last year, this Chamber rammed through a tax cut for billionaires and wealthy corporations, paid for on the backs of America’s middle class. You don’t hear them talk about it much anymore though because it was a very bad deal. This year, the President’s budget includes $1.5 trillion in cuts to Medicare, and Republicans want to eliminate Medicare and turn it into a voucher. That is a bad deal. The President’s budget includes a $1.4 trillion cut to Medicaid. My Republican colleagues have tried to cut Medicaid time and time again with ACA repeals. Those are a bad deal. Today, more than half of our seniors would live in poverty without Social Security. They rely on Medicare and Medicaid to care for them in their golden years—from doctors’ visits to prescription drugs to nursing homes. After all, seniors pay toward these programs through their entire working life. Democrats have plans to strengthen Social Security, strengthen Medicare, and strengthen Medicaid. That is a better deal, and America and her people deserve a better deal. 
HONORING BEN QUINN, SR. (Mr. GUTHRIE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Ben Quinn, Sr., from Glasgow, Kentucky, for his induction into the University of Kentucky College of Engineering Hall of Distinction. Ben graduated from the College of Engineering in 1966, and has over 50 years of experience in civil engineering. Thirtyfive years ago, he started his own company, American Engineers, Inc., with only two employees, in Glasgow. Now, American Engineers has over 100 employees in Kentucky and Georgia. American Engineers has worked on several projects in Kentucky’s Second District, including the William H. Natcher Parkway, the Owensboro Health Regional Hospital, and the Western Kentucky University baseball field. Next week is Small Business Week, and I cannot think of a better example of building a small business from the ground up than Ben, his wife, Dianne, and his family. Ben is an outstanding member of our community, and I am proud to recognize his achievements. 
COMMEMORATING THE 103RD ANNIVERSARY OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE (Mr. COSTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join with the Armenian community to commemorate the 103rd anniversary of the Armenian Genocide with my colleague, Congressman DAVID VALADAO . We both represent a large constituency of Armenians in the San Joaquin Valley. On April 24, 1915, the Ottoman Empire began to systematically deport and kill 1.5 million Armenians, sending them to their death. It was systematic, it was planned. But as history has shown, the Armenian people are stronger than any attack, even genocide; the first genocide in the 20th century, by the way. Many Armenians settled in California’s San Joaquin Valley, where I was raised, and now I have the honor to represent. I heard their stories of their losses with their families, but I also saw their determination, their joy, and their strength, and their contributions to our community and to our Nation. The Armenian people show us that we must move forward, but we must never forget where we are from and who we are; therefore, the Congress and the President must, sooner than later, officially go on record recognizing the Armenian Genocide. Tonight, I stand with the Armenian people and commemorate their spirit. As we move forward, we must never forget. 
REMEMBERING LIVES LOST IN THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE (Mr. VALADAO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember those lives lost in the Armenian Genocide more than 100 years ago. From 1915 to 1923, the Ottoman Empire engaged in the systematic and organized deportation and extermination of over 2 million men, women, and children from Armenia. Today, these horrific events have become known as the Armenian Genocide. Many of those able to flee immigrated to the United States and settled in the Central Valley of California. Today, their families continue to grow, thrive, and pass along their cultural heritage into their adopted communities. The sense of loss as a result of these horrific acts runs deep, as many Armenian Americans personally know a friend or family member who was unable to escape the genocide. As a result, the Armenians throughout the United States have been steadfast in their efforts to continue to ensure the memory of those lost never fades. Despite the horrors of this time and broad international consensus that these events are rightfully identified as ‘‘genocide,’’ the foreign policy of the United States refuses to acknowledge what so many already know to be true. As cochair of the Congressional Armenian Caucus, I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to stand with me in recognizing and remembering the 2 million lives who were lost or forever changed by these tragic events. f 
AMERICA’S RETIREES HAVE EARNED A BETTER DEAL ON PENSION SECURITY (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, for more than 30 years, greedy corporate chieftains, enabled by the Republican Party, have chip, chip, chipped away at workers’ rights, decent wages, and secure pension benefits. In fact, they have even moved corporations to pennywage environments, all in the name of preventing workers from improving their lives here and the lives of their families. Our latest fight is to ensure pension security for retirees who have already paid into their earned benefits. Since 2014, we have fought to protect millions of multiemployer pensioners at risk of insolvency. Pensioners should yield what they were guaranteed. Democrats have proposed solutions to ensure these retirees get a better deal. We have rallied behind the Butch Lewis Act, which has 156 cosponsors, including Republicans. But where is the House Republican leadership? Instead of helping retirees across this Nation with pension security, they forced passage of a $1 trillion tax cut for the rich. This should tell you all you need to know about the Republicans’ raw deal. Our 2018 recent funding bill vote secured a Committee on Pension Solvency that is tasked to find a solution by the end of this year. America’s retirees shouldn’t be let down. They have earned a better deal. 
HONORING JENNIFER O’BRIEN, 2018 NEW YORK MOTHER OF THE YEAR (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a dear friend, Jennifer O’Brien, of Binghamton, New York. She was recently designated as the 2018 New York Mother of the Year. Jennifer has dedicated her life to helping others and especially those who have been less fortunate. Jennifer is the mother of two beautiful children, both of whom have cerebral palsy. Along with her fulltime job at Health Processes, Jennifer serves as the executive director of Life Is Washable and as the executive director of the American Special Hockey Association. Through Life is Washable, Jennifer has implemented innovative programs which have allowed children with special needs to play sports and participate in community events with their families. In addition to serving over 50,000 people with these programs, Jennifer serves over 3,000 members of the American Special Hockey Association. She is also responsible for the construction of the largest accessible playground in New York State, known as OurSpace at Rec Park in Binghamton, New York. Mr. Speaker, please join me in recognizing Jennifer O’Brien’s outstanding accomplishments as a wife, a mother, and an advocate. Jennifer is one of those rare individuals who possesses endless energy, integrity, courage, tenacity, and compassion. f 
b1930 HONORING THE VICTIMS OF THE WAFFLE HOUSE SHOOTING IN TENNESSEE (Mr. COOPER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. COOPER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the victims of a deadly mass shooting at a Waffle House in Antioch, Tennessee, early on the morning of Sunday, April 22. Four young, promising lives were lost: Joe R. Perez, DeEbony Groves, Taurean C. Sanderlin, and Akilah DaSilva. They crossed paths at the restaurant expecting nothing more than good food. Now four young lives are lost, and we mourn with their families and friends. I would also like to recognize Mr. James Shaw, Jr., a native Nashvillian and an American hero. Mr. Shaw bravely stopped this attack from being even worse. His courageous and decisive action saved many lives. Now, Mr. Shaw doesn’t consider himself a hero, but his actions clearly prove that he is a hero. He gave us hope on one of our darkest days. We are heartbroken for the tragic loss of life, but we are heartened and proud of our hometown hero. May we remember Mr. Shaw’s words: 
I hope that we can bring violence to an end in all facets, not just gun violence, but all violence. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the victims of a deadly mass shooting at a Waffle House in Antioch, Tennessee, on the morning of Sunday, April 22. Four young, promising lives were lost, and two other people were injured. Today we mourn Joe R. Perez, 20 years old, who moved to Nashville to live with his grandmother and work at his brother’s business; DeEbony Groves, 21, a senior at Belmont University who was weeks from earning a degree in social work; Taurean C. Sanderlin, 29, a Waffle House employee who was outside on a break; and Akilah DaSilva, 23, a student and aspiring musician. They crossed paths at the Waffle House, expecting nothing more than good food. Now, four young lives are lost. We mourn with their families, friends, and the Antioch community. 
I would also like to recognize Mr. James Shaw, Jr. a native Nashvillian and an American hero. Mr. Shaw bravely stopped this attack from being even worse. His courageous and decisive actions saved many lives. In Mr. Shaw’s own words, he ‘‘saw an opportunity and took it.’’ Later Sunday morning, after receiving treatment for his own injuries, Mr. Shaw went home to see his family. He is a loving father to his 4yearold daughter, Brooklyn. He then went to the church he has attended since he was a baby. Mr. Shaw’s greatest concern is for the other victims, and he has organized a fund to support them. Mr. Shaw doesn’t consider himself a hero, but his actions clearly prove otherwise. Mr. Shaw gave us hope on one of Nashville’s darkest days, and he embodies the very best of our community. We are forever grateful for his bravery and his willingness to put his own life at risk in order to save others. We are both heartbroken for the tragic loss of lives but proud of our hometown hero. This tragedy will not define our city. We are grateful to people all across America who have supported our community with prayers and financial support. May we all remember Mr. Shaw’s words: ‘‘I hope we can bring violence in all facets—not just gun violence, but all facets of violence— to an end.’’ 
CELEBRATING NATIONAL SMALL BUSINESS WEEK (Mr. MARSHALL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, April 29 through May 5 is National Small Business Week. Recent studies and surveys have shown that small business optimism is at an alltime high, and I have seen that firsthand with the businesses I have met throughout the big First District in Kansas. Today, I rise to recognize the hard work and perseverance our smallbusiness owners have and acknowledge their critical role in our local communities. In the United States, small businesses create about two out of every three jobs per year, and more than half of Americans either own or work for a small business. Over the past year and a half, I have had the opportunity to have meaningful conversations with many of the small businesses across my district. From Superior Boilerworks in Hutchinson to Midwest Energy in Hays, I have listened and learned about the issues they face and the ways that Congress can better support small businesses in Kansas. Due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, I am proud that small businesses will now work with lower tax rates and a fairer Tax Code. From big cities to small towns, entrepreneurs and small business owners across the country are creating jobs and contributing to the growth of local economies. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to join me in celebrating our smallbusiness leaders. HONORING THE LIFE OF PATRICIA ‘‘PATI’’ MESTAS (Mr. KIHUEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Patricia ‘‘Pati’’ Mestas. Pati was a good mother to her three children, eight grandchildren, and one greatgrandchild. Patricia was a retired gas station and convenience store worker who loved country music and traveling. Patricia would go to almost every country show within driving distance of her house. One of her favorite artists was Jason Aldean, and she was excited to see him perform at the Route 91 festival on October 1 in Las Vegas. Patricia loved to laugh and smile. She had a funloving spirit and was young at heart. Patricia is remembered for being outgoing, likable, and being sensitive to other people’s concerns and problems. I would like to extend my condolences to Patricia Mestas’ family and friends. Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada, and the whole country grieve with you. f 
HONORING MOLLY SALMI (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a member of the Committee on Education and the Workforce staff who is retiring after more than 29 years of public service. Molly McLaughlin Salmi began her congressional career as a staff assistant on the committee in the 100th Congress. She rose through the ranks and has served as Deputy Director of Workforce Policy for the last 16 years. Eight committee chairs, Republicans and Democrats, have had the benefit of Molly’s guidance, direction, and honest feedback. Molly may be the longest serving member of the committee’s workforce staff, but she has the heart of an educator. Long ago, she established herself as a trustworthy, wise, and encouraging mentor to members of the committee staff. As an educator myself, I know it sometimes isn’t easy to share what you know with someone oneonone, to watch them try, sometimes fail, and get back up again. Molly has not only made mentoring look easy, but she has set a standard for paying it forward that we should all strive to reach. Mr. Speaker, we wish Molly all the best, and we will miss her more than she will ever know. 
BETTER DEAL VERSUS RAW DEAL (Mrs. BUSTOS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, for too many hardworking families, job opportunities are down, medical bills are up, and wages are flat—and people are sick and tired of getting a raw deal from Washington. Let me tell you what a raw deal looks like. I met a homecare nurse who lives near me. She works full time. Her husband works full time, too. All they want to do is give their two kids the best childhood they possibly can. But they can’t even afford to take their kids to the movies because tickets and popcorn and soda are just a little too much. When I asked what they do for fun, she said they have cable television. So how are we supposed to explain to a family like this, who can only give their kids the Disney Channel instead of Disney World, that the majority in Congress just gave $3.5 billion in taxpayer funds to the six largest banks on Wall Street? That is a raw deal, and it is wrong. Instead, we should fight every single day to give a better deal, built on a foundation of better jobs, better pay, and a better future for all Americans. f 
CELEBRATING THE ARMY RESERVE’S 110TH BIRTHDAY (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, April 23, the Army Reserve marked 110 years in service to the Army and the United States of America, evolving from the Medical Reserve Corps in 1908 to the most capable, combatready, and lethal Federal Reserve force in our Nation’s history. I rise to say thank you to our soldiers, both past and present, and their families for serving all these years. In today’s fullspectrum environment, America’s Armed Forces must be prepared to respond quickly to capable and sophisticated highend threats. They must conduct sustained counterterrorist operations, and they must deter aggression in multiple regions of the world while simultaneously defending the homeland. The Army Reserve has a congressionally authorized strength of 199,000 soldiers, more than 11,000 civilians, and 2,075 units. The Army Reserve accounts for 20 percent of the Army’s organized units and provides nearly half the Army’s total maneuver support. Mr. Speaker, I wholeheartedly thank the Army Reserve for defending our Nation with honor and distinction for the past 110 years. 
REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF JOE BILL DICKERSON (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life of 
Mr. Joe Bill Dickerson, who passed away on March 24 at the age of 88. Mr. Dickerson was raised in Homerville, Georgia, in Georgia’s First Congressional District, and truly worked hard throughout his life to make this world a better place. After graduating from college with an agriculture degree, Mr. Dickerson enlisted in the Air Force, training in chemical, biological, and radiological warfare. He served in the Air Force until 1953, when he went on to pharmacy school at the University of Georgia. Mr. Dickerson served in many levels of pharmacy. He worked in pharmaceutical sales, at a hospital, a local pharmacy, and even became a pharmacy professor at the University of Georgia. Today, pharmacists like myself work throughout the State of Georgia who learned their craft under the watchful eye of an experienced Mr. Joe Bill Dickerson. His expertise, colorful personality, and dedication to the betterment of others will truly be missed. 
A GOOD DEAL, A BETTER DEAL, AND A RAW DEAL The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from California (Mr. GARAMENDI ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, it is good to be back here on the floor to talk about a good deal, a better deal, and a raw deal. But before I get into a discussion about how we can move this Nation forward and how our colleagues on the other side are really taking us in the wrong direction, I want to put this up for us to take a look at. I suspect I caught your attention having it upside down. I did that on purpose. I often start these discussions with this. It is from FDR, one of his great speeches. He said: ‘‘The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little.’’ I keep coming to this because it is a statement of values. It is a statement of direction. It is a statement of what I believe we should be doing as Members of Congress and as leaders of this Nation. ‘‘The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little.’’ My Democratic colleagues and I take this to heart, and we try to structure our policies, our programs, and the direction in which we want our country to go along this line, to make sure that those in our Nation, those in our community, those in our States, and even within our families, that they have enough—enough of the wealth of this Nation so that they can enjoy the fruits of their work, so that as they labor that 8 hours or 10 hours or 12 hours a day that they put in, it provides them with enough income so that they can have what we learned from our Founding Fathers: happiness. That is not where we are today. That is not what is happening today. Yes, the economy is moving. Yes, the unemployment rate is down. But this Congress has just passed a monumental tax scam back in December, presumably to grow the economy, and when you look at that, it is not a better deal, which is what we Democrats want for America. We want a better deal, one in which healthcare costs come under control, where prescription drugs can be available, where we have a real infrastructure program that actually will build the sanitation systems, the water systems, dealing with those communities like those in Michigan that have contaminated water and those in my State of California where the wells go dry— and if they are not dry, those wells are contaminated. b1945 We want a better deal for America so that the minimum wage actually provides sufficient income so that a family cannot only survive, but be able to pay the rent, be able to educate their kids, be able to put food on the table, and maybe even have a vacation. We want a better deal for America. We want a country that is internationally competitive. We want a better deal for America’s mariners, not where the maritime industry continues to decline as it has for the last 20, 30 years, but rather where it is built up. Legislation such as I proposed that would require that a certain percentage, a small percentage, of the natural gas, one of our vital natural resources; and our oil, another vital natural resource, that it be shipped overseas on American ships with American sailors, who can continue to provide the necessary support for our military so that our shipyards can build those LNG container ships as well as the oil ships. We want a better deal for America. That is what we are here for. There are so many things. How about an education? Why should it be that here in America the Federal Government provides student loans, not at the lowest possible interest rate, which would be the borrowing rate for the Federal Government plus maybe onehalf of a percent for administrative purposes, but oh, no, our Federal Government charges maybe twice as much as what the Federal Government could actually borrow money for. So the markup is like 100 percent. That is a raw deal for America. And we tried to change that with policy changes that would allow for the refinancing of student loans. We want a better deal for those students as they come out of school, not burdened by heavy debt, but, rather, able to start a family, buy a car, buy a home, start a small business. But oh, no, somehow our Republican colleagues won’t consider refinancing student loans. Americans are able to refinance their homes, but not their student loans. Something is wrong here. We want a better deal for America. There are so many policies. We want a strong, capable military, but we also want a smart military. We want a government that will protect us from cyber hacking. Look what has happened to America. We basically have allowed the Russians to hack into our energy systems, into our power grids. That is not a good deal for America. So where is the Federal Government stopping that? What action has the President taken to protect our electorate, to protect our policies? There is one raw deal after another— when we offer a better deal, an active Federal Government that will protect us in cybersecurity. That is what we want. We can’t get it. We can’t do that now because our Republican colleagues are controlling the House. What they offered us was a tax scam that is leading to one raw deal after another raw deal. Let’s understand exactly what has happened here with this tax policy. Perhaps we could see it best here. In the tax scam, the GOP gives to the rich and makes every other American pay for it. They do it in just three easy steps. First of all, they cut taxes for the rich. I don’t know what you have heard about this tax deal that passed with great fanfare just before Christmas and the President went down to Mara Lago just after he signed it. He talked to all of his rich buddies and said: I have made you so much more wealthy. Indeed, he did—$1.5 trillionplus, plus more than that. Tax cuts, who got them? Eightythree percent of all of that money went to American corporations and to the top 1 percent—$1 trillion and more. It is a raw deal for Americans—a tax scam of unprecedented proportions, foisted upon the American public as though somehow it would be good for them. That is step one. They said this tax bill will pay for itself. The essence of trickledown economics is what it was. And so what is the next thing that happens? Well, when they passed this bill, there wasn’t a deficit hawk to be found on the Republican side of this House. Not one word did I hear from the deficit hawks as they ramped through this tax scam without one public hearing here in the House of Representatives. No accountant came in, no tax lawyer came in on a public hearing. Slam, bang, done. It was done—done in for Americans. Oh, the deficit hawks weren’t exterminated. They are not an endangered species. They just simply migrated out of town. Guess what? They are back. The deficit hawks are back, and they are back with a vengeance. They are back with a plan that will rip the guts out of programs that Americans depend upon: Social Security, 
Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps. Oh, yes, they are back, because they exploded the deficit. They exploded the deficit. We will have close to a $1 trillion deficit this year. It started at $440 billion before the great tax scam and now added on to it. Next year—let’s just take a look. People say: Oh, you are just a politician. You are just up here talking. Here is some real news, not fake news. Real news. And this comes from—well, let’s see, ‘‘Republican tax cuts to fuel historic deficits: CBO,’’ reported by Reuters, April, 2018. ‘‘Deficit to top $1 trillion per year by 2020, CBO says,’’ reported in The Washington Post, April 9, 2018. ‘‘CBO: GOP policies add nearly $1.6 trillion to deficit,’’ Axios, April 9, 2018. Here is one in The Wall Street Journal: ‘‘. . . wider than previously expected budget deficits and a mostly temporary spurt in economic growth.’’ Real news, not fake news. So the deficit has exploded and so the deficit hawks return to town, and what do they want? Well, now they demand big cuts—big, beautiful cuts to: Medicare, nearly $1 trillion; Social Security, half a trillion; education; Medicaid. That is what the deficit hawks want because they have come to understand that their big, beautiful tax scam really is sending this country into a huge deficit for years to come. So here is what they propose to do: Republicans will cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid to pay for their tax scam. Says who? Says the Speaker of the House. ‘‘Ryan says Republicans to target welfare, Medicare, Medicaid spending in 2018,’’ his words reported in The Washington Post, December 6, 2017. ‘‘Top Republicans are already talking about cutting Medicare and Social Security next,’’ reported by Vox news, December 20, 2017. ‘‘House GOP Budget Plan Cuts Medicare and Social Security,’’ The Atlantic. ‘‘Trump Proposes to Cut Medicare and Spend Big on Wall, Defense’’—his budget. You heard some of my colleagues talk about this earlier. So what did the tax scam bring us? A raw deal—a raw deal for millions upon millions of Americans. We want to do it better. We want a better deal for Americans. We can control prescription drugs if we had the votes. We could allow the Federal Government to negotiate prices for drugs given to or provided for Medicare recipients, Medicaid recipients, and others. We could do it. It is a simple law. We can do an expansion. We can maintain the expansion of the Affordable Care Act so that some 16 million, 18 million Americans could stay on Medicaid around the country. In California, 3.5 million Americans are potentially going to lose their healthcare insurance if the Republicans have their way with Medicaid cuts. That is a lot of people. That is a lot of families that are not going to have insurance. The majority of children now born in California and in many other States are on Medicaid. We call it MediCal in California. So what of them? What of those children? What kind of a healthy start will they have? Speaking of Healthy Start, it was one of the programs that the President proposed be cut. What sense does that make? All so that the tax scam can give $1.5 trillion to American corporations and to the 1 percent. Trickle down economics—oh, they said it works. Really? They say it works. Does it really work? Well, let’s take an example. I talked a moment ago about drugs. The most expensive illnesses in this Nation are dementia and Alzheimer’s. One dollar out of every $5 spent by Medicare today is spent for that. And as the baby boomer population grows and a percentage of our population grows into their later years, Alzheimer’s is going to bust the bank. One of the great American drug companies, Pfizer, had a major Alzheimer’s research program underway to look for that miracle drug to understand what Alzheimer’s is all about, how the brain works or doesn’t work. So they received a $3 billion or $4 billion tax reduction in the GOP tax scam. They immediately turned around, terminated the Alzheimer’s research program that they were conducting, and spent the money on stock buybacks and increased dividends. Do you know what that does? A stock buyback will increase the price per share because there are fewer shares outstanding. Do you know who benefits? You got it: the corporation executives, because their pay is based upon an increase in the value of the stock— not in more and better drugs, not in hiring more people, not in more research, but only by manipulating the price of the stock earnings per share. That is what the tax scam did, and it is repeated all across this country. Oh, I know, they promised a onetime bonus, not an increase over the years in the salaries and the wages paid to workers, but a onetime bonus. Less than 13 percent of the reduced tax benefit to corporations has gone to pay for salaries and wages. b2000 That is what the tax scam did. It is the ultimate trickle down. The Democrats want a better deal for America. We have had enough raw deals. We know that there is a possibility should our proposals on infrastructure be taken seriously by our Republican majority: programs such as PETER DEFAZIO’s A Penny for Progress, with serious infrastructure, over time putting 16 million people to work; programs such as I proposed dealing with the export of natural gas and oil and that it be on American ships—not all of it, just a small percentage of it. We could build 50 to 100 ships and put mariners to work and, at the same time, provide the necessary ocean transport for our military. We need real Make It In America policies, not something soft and fluffy, but real, strong Make It In America policies, so if we are going to spend your taxpayer dollars, those taxpayer dollars would be spent on goods and services made in America. How many years have I been talking about Make It In America policies? Through our efforts, we were able to increase, a little bit, the percentage of made in America for the highway dollars. We are not where we ought to be. We ought to bump that up to 80, 90, 100 percent so that we can really manufacture once again in America. All the talk of the President doesn’t deal with this unless you write a law that says your tax dollars will be spent on Americanmade equipment and services, not on stuff imported from China. No. We are going to continue to push the Make It In America policy as one of the elements of a better deal, a real deal, and not a raw deal. You are going to hear a lot about this in the days to come. You will hear a lot about this in the days to come because we believe Franklin Delano Roosevelt when he said the test of our progress is not when we add more to the abundance of those who have much. The test of progress is an F grade given to the President and to the GOP, to my Republican colleagues, when they passed the great tax scam of 2017 and gave a trillion dollarsplus to the superwealthy, to the Wall Street bankers, and to America’s big, wealthy corporations that had so much gas they didn’t know what to do with it before there was a tax cut. So they give it back to Wall Street. The test of our progress is not when we add more to the abundance of those who have much—and here is where we are as Democrats—it is whether we provide enough. It is for those young mothers out there who need maternity care and who will deliver a baby on the Medicaid programs across this Nation. Those are the people we care about. We want young men and women to have a good education. I am sure the superwealthy can take care of themselves. They don’t need a Pell grant. They don’t need more. But I will tell you that a child who, let’s say, is 16, 17, ready to go to college and his father is earning a minimum wage, there is no way that family can support that kid in college. He will take out a loan and the Federal Government will rip him off with an interest rate twice what the Federal Government can borrow money for. The test of our progress is what we do for those who have too little. That is our mantra. That is how we see a better deal for Americans. FDR was right. We will work to see that it happens in America. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
WELCOMING FRENCH PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. FRANCIS ROONEY of Florida). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. WILSON ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, as we begin this evening, I want to begin in my service as cochair of the French Caucus to welcome Emmanuel Macron, President of France, to Washington. South Carolina is especially appreciative of France, with our shared heritage, particularly as we are very grateful for the Marquis de Lafayette, who was so vital in the American Revolution and who actually began his service landing in Georgetown, South Carolina. It is very significant. I have colleagues from South Carolina, North Carolina, and even Florida. We are very grateful to point out that, here in the House Chamber, is an indication of the affection the American people have for France. There are only two portraits here in the House Chamber: President George Washington and the Marquis de Lafayette. So it is quite revealing that, indeed, there is great love and affection for America’s first ally, and how exciting it is that he has arrived here in Washington. We are looking forward to the joint session as he speaks to Congress and the American people tomorrow morning. 
Local success of the law was first heralded in the Second Congressional District of South Carolina, the central part of South Carolina, by Lou and Bill Kennedy of Nephron Pharmaceuticals in Cayce, announcing 125 new jobs and a 5 percent pay increase. They said that they made this decision as a direct result of the tax bill. In fact, I am really grateful that Lou put together a barbecue where I was present with Governor Henry McMaster and Attorney General Alan Wilson. She made the announcement right there at the barbecue to the extraordinary employees of Nephron Pharmaceuticals. They may have been the first; they were certainly not the last. I was so grateful. I was going through Walgreen’s to pick up some pictures that I was having developed and I ran into Bill Mooneyhan. Bill is the president of the local CayceWest Columbia Chamber of Commerce. He announced: Hey, Joe, because of the tax savings, our business, our auto repair shop, is going to add a new bay and create new jobs. I said: Hey, Bill, because you announced this to me, you have just volunteered for a press conference, which I am really grateful that we were able to have with the National Federation of Independent Business, NFIB, led by Ben Homeyer in South Carolina. b2015 NFIB is the largest small business organization in America, and it is bottom’s up. The leadership really follows the directions of their local members. So all of us truly appreciate NFIB. In February, I visited with Norman Dunagan, owner of Whiskey Alley restaurant and Dumpster Depot, which is a recycling facility in Aiken, South Carolina. I took this opportunity to congratulate him on his expansion resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. He opened a third business last year due to the confidence in President Donald Trump and the House Republican leadership. All three of his small businesses are thriving and providing muchneeded new jobs. That day I also met with Clancy Cipkala, president and CEO of Solara Hospitality of West Columbia. Solara Hospitality is providing bonuses for their hotel hourly associates due to the tax cuts passed by the Republicans. In Orangeburg, South Carolina, South State Bank provided a $1,000 bonus to their employees. In a rural area like Orangeburg, a $1,000 bonus can make a huge difference for families. It can provide an opportunity for families to buy extra school supplies, pay down debt, make an investment in the future, start or add to an emergency fund, or take a muchneeded family vacation. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the distinguished congressman from North Carolina (Mr. PITTENGER ), who represents the beautiful Ninth District of North Carolina, which includes substantially the extraordinary city of Charlotte, which is such a center for job creation of the Carolinas. Mr. PITTENGER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his leadership and for providing this opportunity tonight for us to highlight the significance and the importance of this tax bill for the American people. Mr. Speaker, when I lived in Washington, D.C., in 1980, it came out of the malaise of an economy that wasn’t growing. No jobs, no opportunity. And Ronald Reagan had a vision for a different America, and I worked hard on his campaign. He changed the whole structure of our Tax Code and reduced the regulations that moved this economy forward. Unprecedented growth in jobs. Eighteen million jobs came out of that economy. And that is what this vision of President Trump and this Congress is about today. Who would have thought a year ago—just a year ago—that America would be experiencing what it is today: companies like Apple reinvesting $350 billion; ExxonMobil, $50 billion. You have unemployment that has plummeted to a 49year low. U.S. manufacturing is expanding at the fastest rate in 14 years. Consumer confidence is at a 17year high. Wages are up. Opportunities are up. I had a gentleman come to me just this last week who owns two restaurants in Charlotte. He said: Thank you for your tax cut. I am now going to expand and build another restaurant out at the lake, and I can do that because I have got the capital to go reinvest. You know, we have constrained this economy and the American people by these burdensome tax rates that are not competitive. Companies have been going to the rest of the world—Ireland, U.K., Germany—and leaving America because we weren’t competitive with our Tax Code. Now they are coming back. Now companies in America are expanding. You take just an individual. I had a lady at a gas station the other day. I was getting my gas, and she was pumping her gas. She looked at me, and she said: Are you Congressman PITTENGER ? I said: Yes, ma’am. She said: Thank you. I am a single mom. I have got that little baby in the back seat, and what you have done for me is give me another $150 a month, and I really can’t tell you how much I appreciate what you are doing. Eightytwo percent of American people are going to get a pay raise. They are getting it right now. And that is the difference. The proof is in the paycheck. Americans know that. Regardless of what the left says, the media says, or anyone else, the reality is jobs are expanding, paychecks are going up, people are getting bonuses. In Charlotte alone, we have Bank of America giving out bonuses; we have Charlotte Pipe and Foundry, SteelFab, American Airlines, so many. Five hundred companies in this country have given out bonuses to their folks, and probably so many more we don’t know about. So I want to commend Chairman WILSON for his leadership. I thank him for making sure that the American people know what is yet to come. We have just scratched the surface on the opportunity and the growth and the jobs that will be there for the American people. Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the points he makes of where people can look at their paycheck and see they are keeping more of their own money. This is not from the government. This is their own money. How important this is, and how it enables families to have a better life. And for the young people of our country, how positive this is. I thank the gentleman for reiterating that point. The Business Roundtable, an association of America’s largest employers, is reporting that tax reform has already produced wage increases, bonuses, increased matches for retirement savings, lower prices for consumers, investment in facilities, and tens of thousands of new American jobs as a direct result of tax reform. As I indicated, we have the lowest unemployment among African Americans ever. We have the lowest unemployment among Hispanics since it has ever been determined. It is so exciting. Fourteen States have the lowest level of unemployment in recorded history. Among women, we have the lowest level of unemployment in 20 years. Everybody benefits from the tax cuts. This is so positive. The Business Roundtable members alone have provided over $545 million in bonuses to their employees, with bonuses, wage increases, and a range of other employee benefits to 1.6 million workers, along with $1.2 billion in charitable contributions. According to the Tax Foundation, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will significantly lower marginal tax rates and the cost of capital, which would lead to a 1.7 percent increase in the gross domestic product over the long term, 1.5 percent higher wages, and an additional 339,000 fulltime equivalent jobs. They also say it will spur an additional $1 trillion in Federal revenue from economic growth, with approximately $600 billion coming from the bill’s permanent provisions and approximately $400 billion from the bill’s temporary provisions over the budget window. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the congresswoman from the Fifth District of North Carolina (Ms. FOXX). Congresswoman FOXXis secretary of the Republican Conference, she is a remarkably determined former community college president, and she also is very much appreciated as the chairman of the Committee on Education and the Workforce. Then she is particularly fortunate; she lives and has a beautiful home in Grandfather Mountain, North Carolina, some of the most beautiful mountains in the world of western North Carolina. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman WILSON for leading the Special Order on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. I will agree with him; the Lord has blessed me with living in one of the most beautiful places in the world, the Fifth District of North Carolina. I am very, very grateful for it. Last week, tax day was, for once, an occasion to celebrate because this was the last time Americans filed under the broken 32yearold Tax Code. Next tax season, they will file under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed by this Congress last December. Across the Fifth District of North Carolina, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has already relieved North Carolinians who are cashing bigger paychecks and benefiting from the country’s lowest unemployment rate since 2000. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, North Carolina added 9,000 jobs this February alone. And thanks to lower rates for individuals and small businesses under the new code, North Carolinians are keeping more of their hard earned money. And as Congressman WILSON points out, it is their money, not the government’s money. This year, married couples in the Fifth District who take the new standard deduction could receive a tax cut to the tune of $1,834. For the over 52,000 taxpayers of the Fifth District who have small business income, these tax savings are not crumbs, as my colleagues on the other side of the aisle falsely assert. A restaurant owner in Mount Airy recently told me that allowing immediate capital expensing under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act empowered her to purchase a new $20,000 piece of equipment for her business. You spoke of the Business Roundtable. The Business Roundtable reports that 68 percent of business leaders similarly expect their capital spending in the next 6 months to be at its highest in 15 years. This increased purchasing power for the backbone of our economy is evidence that progrowth tax cuts work. Continued growth is also expected by the Congressional Budget Office. The CBO estimates, for every onetenth percent increase in GDP, nearly $270 billion is added to revenue over 10 years. After years of malaise under the Obama administration, even modest increases in GDP growth caused by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will substantially contribute to a leveling off of the deficit. And for the first time since 2008, the CBO’s budget and economic outlook revised its upward economic potential for 2018. Under current conditions, it notes that 3.5 percent growth is possible. In further good news, Fifth District businesses share this optimism and are investing more in their employees and communities. Just last week, as part of its initiative to invest in community health with its tax savings, BlueCross and BlueShield of North Carolina gave $1 million to WinstonSalem State University’s nursing school. North Carolina is projected to have the second largest nurse shortage in the Nation. This investment will develop the Fifth District’s medical workforce and increase access to highquality healthcare, especially in rural areas. This is just one of the many examples that illustrates how philanthropy has fostered and communities are developed when the government scales back. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that House Republicans kept our promise to bring about more jobs, fairer taxes, and bigger paychecks for hardworking Americans; but I am more proud of the hardworking men and women in the Fifth District who are seizing the opportunities unleashed by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to create wealth and serve their communities. Again, I thank Congressman WILSON  for his leadership on this Special Order and for allowing us to correct the record that has been distorted about this bill and bring to the American people the facts about this wonderful Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman VIRGINIA  FOXX for her comments. And I thank her, as an educator, for educating the American people and bringing to the attention of the American people the real facts of the benefits of the tax cuts. Congress today appreciates that Americans should keep their hard earned tax dollars, and it is shocking to hear the other side of the aisle say that they would repeal the tax cuts if they get a majority in the House come November, resulting in tax increases on American families, destroying jobs. Sadly, I suspect a lot of families and businesses being highlighted today will be shocked—but maybe not so shocked—to hear that Democrats are campaigning on raising taxes, destroying jobs. I sincerely hope that Americans across the country know that Republicans will continue to do all that we can to our ability to increase take home pay to families, reduce the tax burdens on seniors, and create more efficient and effective government that works for you and provides opportunities for the young people of America. 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the topic of this Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from South Carolina? There was no objection. Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. REFORMING U.S. CANNABIS POLICY The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida (Mr. CURBELO ) for 30 minutes. Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I am here this evening to emphasize the importance of reforming our Nation’s policies concerning cannabis. This issue has grown to be increasingly bipartisan over the years, yet some in this administration have largely ignored the rising public support for legal, Stateregulated cannabis. b2030 Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. GAETZ ), a distinguished colleague from the panhandle. Mr. GAETZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from the Sunshine State of Florida for yielding, and I am so grateful that we have been able to find some areas of common ground in this Congress on the issue of cannabis reform. I am very proud, Mr. Speaker, to announce that, in the coming days, I will be joining the Judiciary chairman, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOODLATTE ), in introducing legislation that enjoys support from across the ideological spectrum, and it will do several important things: First, it will increase the number of people who are growing medicalgrade cannabis for research purposes. Second, it will end the gag rule at the VA that precludes physicians from being able to consult and speak with their patients about the laws in their particular States. Third, it will create a safe harbor so that some of the finest medical institutions and universities in this great country will be able to research and partner with private sector entities to determine the potential that medical cannabis can have to improve people’s quality of life. And finally, this legislation will end the prohibition from having commercial, forprofit entities working in concert, in collaboration with some of those very universities and medical institutions. So my hope is that by focussing first on the issues that bring us together, we will be able to advance legislation to democratize medical cannabis research, and that, ultimately, can unlock cures and unlock potential for a generation of Americans that shouldn’t be lied to by their government about the potential health benefits of cannabis. Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his leadership, his honesty, and his sincerity on this issue, and I am proud to say that I have cosponsored this legislation. Now I will yield to one of the original cosponsors of Mr. GAETZ ’s legislation and one of the great leaders in this institution on this issue for many years, the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER ), who has been educating colleagues and the American public on 
cannabis. Tonight, I am pleased to be joined by him here on the floor and to yield to him. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from Florida’s courtesy in permitting me to join him on this Special Order this evening. I appreciate the partnership that we have had on the Ways and Means committee and dealing with these issues publicly. It is true, I cosponsored the legislation that our aforementioned friend, Mr. GAETZ , referenced. I have been cosponsoring and introducing legislation like this for years. In fact, my Veterans Access Amendment actually passed both the House and the Senate last Congress, only to fall victim behind the scenes of, I think, misguided action on the part of leadership. I am pleased that we have been able to retain the RohrabacherBlumenauer amendment that protects State legal medical marijuana, and I look forward to working with my colleague, as I know he wants to extend those protections to all State legal efforts. I want to say, as somebody who has spent a lot of time moving around the country working on these State campaigns, working with the industry, working with advocates, that I appreciate Mr. CURBELO ’s advocacy, that he is moving out of his district being involved with this conversation nationally and looking for opportunities to strengthen the position on the floor of the House. We are in a situation now, Mr. Speaker, where we have virtually every Democrat who now supports these simple, commonsense reforms, and, in no small measure due to my friend from Florida’s persuasive efforts, there are several dozen Republicans, and that number is sure to grow either before or after the next election. This is an issue that we have watched slowly take shape. I was in the Oregon Legislature when we were the first State to decriminalize back in the 1970s, but there was sort of a hiatus for about 20 years. There was Richard Nixon’s illadvised and, I think, unfortunate and unfair war on drugs, the Schedule I categorization of marijuana. If we were doing it over again, probably it wouldn’t be scheduled at all, but tobacco would be Schedule I because it is deadly and addictive. In the course of the last 6 years, we have watched what has happened at the State level accelerate. It has been medical marijuana since 1996. But starting in 2012 with Colorado, Washington, and, more recently, we had initiatives in Oregon, in Alaska, in the District of Columbia, we had nine States vote in 2016, and eight of them approved reforms. I am excited to watch this accelerated progress. In fact, I think what we have seen over the last 6 weeks is unprecedented. We are watching people in both parties be able to identify things they can get behind and move forward. We see survey research demonstrating that this is no longer a highly divisive partisan issue. The majority of Americans support legalizing adult use. Increasingly, there is evidence that a majority of Trump voters support adult use. Medical marijuana is like the Fourth of July. It is almost universally accepted, and I think the gentleman’s district, in voting on medical marijuana in 2016 in Florida, was overwhelmingly supported. So now is the time for us to move forward. We have a bipartisan Cannabis Caucus, and I appreciate the gentleman participating in leading this. We have almost three dozen pieces of legislation. We had, this last week, a couple of things that I think were rather noteworthy. The former Speaker of the House, John Boehner, who opposed our efforts for years, has now evolved on this issue, and he now has actually joined the advisory board of a firm in Massachusetts. Both of us are familiar with them, looking at the leadership in the industry. We have watched Donald Trump, in the last 10 days, sort of clarify what he said on the campaign trail in 2016, that the States ought to be free to do this. He is reaffirming that and undercutting the attempt by his Attorney General Sessions to cast a pall over the State legal efforts. We have watched the minority leader in the Senate, Mr. SCHUMER , come out supporting comprehensive legislation. I would note, for the record, it was very similar to what my colleague in the Senate, on the Senate Finance Committee, RONWYDEN and I introduced last year in a comprehensive fashion, but that is great. The more, the merrier. What we want to do this Congress is to be able to do some simple things. The legislation that we have worked on together to allow State legal marijuana enterprises to get rid of the pernicious 280E so they can deduct their business expenses, I appreciate the gentleman’s leadership and focus on that. We ought to eliminate the restrictions that prevent robust medical research on cannabis. The Federal Government interferes with the research. There is no longer any reason for that. And in working on this, literally, for decades, I have never met a single human being who thinks there is anything to be served by forcing State legal marijuana enterprises to be conducted on an allcash basis. These are things that we can change, regardless of whether or not people favor full legalization. These are simple, commonsense steps that have bipartisan support, and I look forward to working with the gentleman on that and then as we take this to the people. We will be voting on it in Michigan, probably in Missouri. Looks like there will be a ballot measure in Utah. Other States are looking. I think the momentum is building. I can’t say enough about how much I have enjoyed working with the gentleman on these issues. I look forward to continuing that partnership so these simple, commonsense provisions that are actually supported by a majority of the people in the House and the Senate are allowed to be voted on. I hope that he can work his persuasive ways with the Republican leadership to eliminate those roadblocks and allow the House to work its will. America will be better for it. Americans will be freer, and there will be economic opportunity, health opportunities, and less destruction of lives with illconceived efforts to criminalize behavior of otherwise lawabiding adults. I thank the gentleman for his sponsorship of this conversation this evening, permitting me to be a part of it, and our partnership. I look forward to accelerating those efforts in the months ahead so that we can mark significant progress yet in this Congress, and next Congress, get it all taken care of. Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I truly admire and appreciate my colleague. He is a man of principle, but he is also someone who is always at the table trying to find common ground, trying to see how this institution can work better, how we can all work together for commonsense solutions, for what, in this case, so many Americans are asking of this institution: to allow each State to come up with its own laws, its own regulations for this industry. So I thank my colleague very much for spending a little time with us here this evening and also for all of his work over many years, because, as he said, many in this institution are coming around on both sides of the aisle. But it is Mr. BLUMENAUER who, for a long time, led these efforts, and it was always an issue of consensus, the way it is today. So thank you very much to my distinguished colleague. Mr. Speaker, nine States and the District of Columbia have legalized the recreational use of marijuana, and medical marijuana is legal in an additional 29 States, including my home State of Florida. Over 70 percent of Florida voters supported legalizing the use of medical marijuana in the 2016 elections, including 80.3 percent and 68.3 percent in the two counties I represent, Monroe and MiamiDade, respectively. As a matter of fact, the President was in Monroe County Thursday, and many people greeted him in the streets. Many of those were supporters, considering 80 percent support in that district of this issue. On Friday of last week, a report published by the Florida Department of Health indicated the State’s medical marijuana patient registry has risen to 100,576 people, a dramatic increase from the 23,350 patients registered in June of 2017. This milestone also happens to coincide with the opening of Miami Beach’s first medical marijuana dispensary, Surterra Wellness. 
Despite overwhelming support from the public and medical community, however, legitimate businesses such as Surterra face financial and legal uncertainty because of a witch hunt opened up by Attorney General Sessions last year. To make matters worse, he is now hamstringing scientific research to analyze the medical applications of cannabis. I, along with my colleagues from both sides of the aisle, have taken a multipronged approach to improving our country’s irresponsible and illadvised laws on cannabis. Congressman BLUMENAUER and I are addressing the industry’s significantly disproportionate tax burden through the Small Business Tax Equity Act, legislation which provides tax parity to marijuana businesses operating in compliance with State law. I am also working with the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GARRETT ) to urge the Department of Justice to order the Drug Enforcement Administration to immediately approve additional registrations for the bulk manufacture of cannabis for exclusively federallyapproved research purposes. Compliant manufacturers are attempting to provide State and Federal Governments and medical professionals with factbased research on cannabis’ effects, both adverse and therapeutic, but their applications to do so aren’t being assessed. It is difficult for me to comprehend the logic behind blocking scientific research to analyze the medical applications of cannabis because I believe it is critical for policymakers to possess objective data on the effectiveness of cannabis as an alternative treatment for anxiety, depression, pain, psychosis, posttraumatic stress disorder, opioid addiction, and epilepsy. We owe it to American patients to open up the field of research on this. Now, the only logical explanation I can think of is that the Attorney General knows the facts of this field of research won’t support his policies or the witch hunt he and his Department have been conducting on legal Stateregulated operators across the country. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, drug overdoses claimed nearly 68,000 lives throughout the United States in 2017 alone, with over 45,000 of those as a result of opioids, legal drugs. An aptly timed article was published this morning by CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Sanjay Gupta in which he details the results of his investigation into the benefits of cannabis over the course of a 5year study. b2045 Though admittedly skeptical at first, after dedicating countless hours with both patients and scientists scattered throughout the globe, Dr. Gupta began to view the plant in a different light: as a source for healing instead of a gateway for substance abuse. At the conclusion of Dr. Gupta’s in depth examination, he came to the deduction that ‘‘not only can cannabis work for a variety of conditions such as epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, and pain; sometimes, it is the only thing that works.’’ Referenced in this article is an analysis conducted by researchers from the RAND Corporation, and supported by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, which showed an approximated 20 percent decline in opioid overdose deaths between 1999 and 2010 in States with legalized medical marijuana and functioning dispensaries. Mr. Speaker, this analysis is similar to countless others I have heard that prove cannabis can quell both the disease of addiction and the pains associated with it. Now, some may view this investigation and others as if they are anecdotal, and to them I say, ‘‘Let’s find out.’’ Let’s stop hamstringing Federal research of the issue and let’s let the facts speak for themselves. As I have said before in this Chamber, Mr. Speaker, the best ally that illegal operators like drug cartels and drug traffickers—who do not pay taxes, who target children, who have no safety standards for their products—the best ally they have are the policies that the Attorney General has embraced. Because by continuing to hamstring Federal research, over tax, and stoke uncertainty, legally operating businesses that are State regulated, that pay taxes, that are helping patients who are suffering, can no longer compete. And when these businesses can no longer compete, people turn to the black market. So inadvertently, I hope, the Attorney General is actually doing a great favor to the criminals operating outside the law by punishing lawabiding Americans trying to control the substance and make it safer. So I am here today to, once again, call upon this administration to not just allow, but encourage, meaningful reform on our Nation’s cannabis policies. On this issue, we have an opportunity to reinforce the 10th Amendment and ensure the Federal Government does not overstep its boundaries and supersede the will of the States. On this issue, we have an opportunity to afford businesses selling legal products the chance to contribute to our economy and create jobs, while simultaneously crippling the criminal enterprises empowered by and prospering under the Attorney General’s policies. And perhaps most importantly, we have an opportunity to change—and possibly even save—the lives of Americans suffering from opioid addiction and other diseases and conditions. Mr. Speaker, there are a lot of colleagues in this Chamber who say people should be able to buy whatever health insurance or get whatever kind of health coverage they want, and the government should interfere as little as possible, and I agree. But on this issue, there seems to be a hypocrisy, and many colleagues want to impose a Federal view or a Federal perspective on States, on the people of States like Florida, who have already decided explicitly and clearly and overwhelmingly. So I thank my colleagues who joined me here tonight, and I truly look forward to the day where this institution can legislate in a way that respects the people of Florida, respects the people of Oregon, respects the people of Colorado, and American citizens in 36 States in the union, who have spoken loud and clear. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. f
