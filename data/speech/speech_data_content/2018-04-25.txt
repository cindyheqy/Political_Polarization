Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to welcome our guest chaplain, Rabbi Shlomo Segal of Kehilat Moshe synagogue from Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn. Rabbi Segal and his wife, Adina, founded the synagogue 5 years ago, and they have since created a vibrant community not only for the diverse group of Jews who attend their services, but for people of all faiths throughout Brooklyn. Rabbi Segal is a leader in our community who works hard to build bridges of understanding and tolerance. He serves on the board of governors of the New York Board of Rabbis and is a rabbinical consultant to the Kings Bay Y, a Jewish community center in the Eighth Congressional District that I proudly represent. Through his work, he celebrates the diversity of Brooklyn, bringing together different religious and ethnic groups to emphasize what we all have in common—as New Yorkers and as Americans and, most importantly, as human beings. Rabbi Segal has brought together Jews, Christians, and Muslims to break fast for Ramadan and worked hard to bring together and strengthen ties between the Black and Jewish communities of central Brooklyn. Rabbi Segal’s efforts are geared toward making religion the greatest possible force that it can be in our community and in our Nation. He is here today with his wonderful wife, Adina, and two tremendous children, Shira and Rayna. It is my honor to welcome them to the people’s House and to our Nation’s Capital. ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the proceedings had during the recess be printed in the RECORD . The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia? There was no objection. 
ELECTING A MEMBER TO A CERTAIN STANDING COMMITTEE OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Republican Conference, I offer a privileged resolution and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: 
H. R ES. 844 Resolved, That the following named Member be, and is hereby, elected to the following standing committee of the House of Representatives: COMMITTEE ON ARMED SERVICES : Mr. Mitch ell. 
The resolution was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 4, FAA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2018; PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3144, PROVIDING FOR THE OPERATIONS OF THE FEDERAL COLUMBIA RIVER POWER SYSTEM; AND PROVIDING FOR PROCEEDINGS DURING THE PERIOD FROM APRIL 30, 2018, THROUGH MAY 4, 2018 Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 839 and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: 
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia? There was no objection. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, today’s rule provides for the consideration of two bills: H.R. 4, which is the FAA Reauthorization Act, and a closed rule for H.R. 3144, which would adjust operations at the Federal Columbia River Power System. We are lucky today, Mr. Speaker, in that we will have Mr. NEWHOUSE , who is an expert from Washington State on H.R. 3144, come down to the floor and talk extensively about that measure and why it is important for Washington State. But before we talk about Washington State, I want to talk about the FAA reauthorization bill as well. I would point out, Mr. Speaker, it is not every rule in every case we are able to make every Rules Committee member’s amendment in order, but we are fortunate today that, during Mrs. TORRES ’ very first rule on the House floor, we are making her amendment in order, which, again, Mr. Speaker, is one of those prerogatives of Rules Committee members. I know that in the first few moments of the FAA bill, Mr. Speaker, we are going to want to talk about the good work that went on in the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. It has really been my pleasure as not just a Rules Committee member, but as a Transportation and Infrastructure Committee member to be able to work on this bill now in two committees. You may recall, Mr. Speaker, that we went not only through our initial hearings in the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee; we went through a summer markup last year. We have gone through five shortterm extensions on FAA, and we are now here prepared to consider a full 5year reauthorization on the floor. It has not been the easiest process. There have been a lot of folks who haven’t gotten everything they have wanted in this process, but it has been a collaborative process, Mr. Speaker, and I am glad that we have it here today. I would be remiss if I didn’t thank our committee chairman on the authorizing committee, Mr. Speaker, Chairman SHUSTER , for all the work that he has done. As you know, he has been a long champion of reforming the FAA, believing that we could get even more value for the American taxpayer dollars out of the FAA. While he did not achieve everything that he wanted to achieve in this bill either, Mr. Speaker, we have a dramatic step forward in H.R. 4 today. These things never happen by accident, Mr. Speaker, as you well know, and I want to thank all the folks who have been toiling behind the scenes in the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee day in and day out. I am thinking of folks, Mr. Speaker, like Chris Vieson. I am thinking about folks like Naveen Rao. I am thinking about Hunter Presti and Brittany Smith. Mr. Speaker, even though he has left us to go, now, serve in the article II Federal Railroad Administration, I want to thank Matt Sturges, who was the former staff director there at the committee, for all he has done over 2 years to get us to this place. Mr. Speaker, as you know, getting this work done requires a collaborative working relationship, Members and staff across the aisle, from committee office staff to personal office staff, and it has really been a rewarding process. I am very proud of the product that we have on the floor today, but it wouldn’t have been possible without all of the staff working and the collaboration that went on. I am grateful to folks for that. That is the authorizing committee side, Mr. Speaker. On the Rules Committee side, we had an equal amount of work going on. These past few days, moving this bill through the Rules Committee, the staff has had to work tirelessly, in large part, because of all the amendments that were offered to the bill. We now, in this rule, today, Mr. Speaker, made in order 116 different revisions to this bill. Let me say that again. We went through a complete, full, and open markup in the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, as you know, Mr. Speaker; but then, in the Rules Committee, we made in order an additional 116 amendments through this rule today: 56 of those are amendments sponsored by my Democratic colleagues; 36 of those are amendments sponsored by my Republican colleagues; and 24 of those are amendments that have bipartisan support here in this Chamber. That is just over 50 percent of all the ideas that were brought to the Rules Committee last night, Mr. Speaker. I hope that my colleagues are as proud of that as I am. It reflects the commitment that Speaker RYANmade to having a more open and transparent process. Here, again: 56 Democratic amendments, 36 Republican amendments, and 24 bipartisan amendments. Mr. Speaker, this FAA bill is a good step towards bringing more value to the American taxpayer from the FAA, and this rule is a good step to making 
that possible. With the passage of this rule today, we will be able to move directly to that debate. Mr. Speaker, don’t believe the headlines that say Congress has packed up its bags and gone home. I hear that day in and day out that folks think this 2018 is not going to be a particularly productive legislative session. I reject that. I reject that with no reservations whatsoever. I see the passion my friends on the Democratic side have for continuing to make improvements for the American people. I see that same passion on our side. Now, I am not saying we are not going to have some challenges keeping people focused on the process at hand, but this FAA bill is a good example of the fact that we are still hard at work, and there is still much work that we can do together. This bill, Mr. Speaker, finally delivers on the regulatory reform to the FAA certification process. Now, if you have any companies in your district that are involved in FAA regulations in any way, shape, or form, you know exactly what I am talking about. This certification process is going to allow companies all over the country, including many in my district, Mr. Speaker, like Meggitt in Suwanee, like Universal Avionics in Duluth, like Siemens in Cumming, Gulfstream in Savannah, and many others, to get safer, more innovative aviation products to market faster. Let me say that again, Mr. Speaker: safer products, more innovative products, more value to the American taxpayer to market faster. This bill also provides a pathway to regulatory certainty for unmanned aircraft systems. That allows companies like L3 Technologies and Colonial Pipeline in Alpharetta, like UPS in Sandy Springs, like our electric utilities in Gwinnett and Forsyth Counties, Mr. Speaker, and many other companies in my home State of Georgia to get their technologies out faster, to make environments safer for their employees and for my constituents. b1245 We all know that the transformative power of unmanned aviation is upon us. We have got to regulate that in a safe and responsible way to make sure that the rules are in place for certainty, for safety, and for opportunity for innovation. I believe we have that in this bill. We have a choice, Mr. Speaker. We are either going to lead the world in unmanned aviation or we are going to cede leadership to countries like China. I say we seize leadership, and we are seizing it here in this bill. The bill also commits that our airports—from the busiest airport in the world, Mr. Speaker, my hometown airport of HartsfieldJackson, the fourth busiest airport in the State; and also in my district, Mr. Speaker, is Briscoe Field in Lawrenceville—that these airports have access to longterm funding sustainability. We all know that yanking the pendulum back and forth on Federal funding does not serve any of our constituents’ cause. Funding stability—knowing that they can count on the Federal Government to be their partner in providing innovation and improving the overall experience of those men and women who travel through these airports—is of vital importance. And finally, Mr. Speaker, this bill ensures that our American airlines—like my hometown airline of Delta—can compete and win against anyone on the planet in terms of the service, reliability, safety, and customer service that we have come to expect. Again, aviation is a partnership in this country, Mr. Speaker, between private sector actors and public actors. We need to do all that we can, from our end of Pennsylvania Avenue, to be the very best partners that we can. Of course, we can always do more, and I hope that we will continue to do more. I am expecting a very robust Transportation Committee cycle here over the next 9 months. But this bill today is a significant downpayment on our commitment to the American people to make our aviation infrastructure continue to be the very finest on the planet. Mr. Speaker, this rule that, again, will govern debate of both H.R. 4 and H.R. 3144 is a fair rule. These are both commonsense measures that will benefit the American people. I hope my colleagues will see that, I hope my colleagues will come to the floor and support this rule, and I hope my colleagues will also support the two underlying measures. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30 minutes. I am proud to be the newest member of the House Rules Committee. When I expressed my desire to join the committee to the minority leader, I shared my hope that I could do my part to ensure the committee would allow the House to work its will in an open way. Unfortunately, the rule that we are bringing to the floor does not meet that standard. For that reason, I rise in opposition. The rule we consider this afternoon is a combined rule for H.R. 3144, legislation to delay and derail management practices at the Federal Columbia River Power System in the Pacific Northwest, and H.R. 4, the Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization Act. There is no reason for the House to take up these items in a combined rule. We have plenty of time to give each bill a full, robust debate, and plenty of time to allow the House an opportunity to vote on some of the 138 amendments filed to these bills that were not made in order under this rule. Mr. Speaker, the House appears to be in a rush to leave here every single week. Last week, we only had three voting days, and with this combined rule, who knows how long we will be here this week. Perhaps we could use some of this extra time to take up a number of issues which Americans have been asking for. Instead of making this yet another short week, how about we give Americans a vote on addressing gun violence by giving us a vote on background checks, bump stocks, assault weapons, gun trafficking reform; or ensuring that we don’t find ourselves in a constitutional crisis by protecting the special counsel, and making sure that we address Russian interference in our elections; or allowing the House to actually take a vote on so many outstanding immigration issues by protecting DACA and TPS recipients? There are 244 cosponsors of Representative DENHAM ’s ‘‘Queen of the Hill’’ resolution, including over 40 members of the majority party. Nearly 8 months since President Trump terminated the DACA program, Congress has continually failed to protect the thousands of American Dreamers who lose their protections every single day. Dreamers are the educators, doctors, and smallbusiness owners who make our communities better and help make our country stronger and safer. There are very real consequences for the lack of a permanent solution to this crisis. The American people want us to act. We can respect their will by taking up the ‘‘Queen of the Hill’’ resolution on one of the many days where we find ourselves with nothing to do. We could work together to at least provide the House with a path forward where the best idea wins. Mr. Speaker, instead of doing what we did last week by canceling voting days, let’s take this time to act on behalf of our constituents. Why don’t we put a stop to the administration’s attack on the Affordable Care Act and work on bipartisan improvements to control the cost of healthcare, prescription drugs, and increase access to services? Finally, why don’t we take some time to do what I have been calling for since my first day in Congress and pass a largescale infrastructure package? There are roads and bridges crumbling around our country, transit systems in need of significant repair, and a power grid waiting to enter the 21st century. We need robust investments in our transportation and energy infrastructure. In its 2017 report card, the American Society of Civil Engineers gave us our infrastructure a nearly failing grade of a Dplus. But based on my experiences driving around my hometown, that might be a bit too generous. These are all the things that have bipartisan agreement. It is up to us to address the real problems before us with leadership, security, and stability that the Nation demands. That said, as I mentioned before, we have two bills included in this rule. The first is the FAA Authorization 
Act, the first longterm FAA reauthorization since 2012. This legislation was developed over 3 years of bipartisan and stakeholder negotiations. It will provide longterm stability for our Nation’s aviation community, continue investments in research and innovation, and make necessary reforms to improve American competitiveness and safety in aviation. I appreciate Chairman SHUSTER  working with Ranking Member DEFAZIOto ensure that this bill is as bipartisan as possible. I would have preferred that we did more to assist our Nation’s airports, but this bill reflects the committee’s will. Airline safety is on all of our minds, especially after the tragedy of Southwest Flight 1380. Moving this bill forward, without the poison bill language we had seen in previous versions, will go a long way in improving passenger safety, passenger comfort, and the entire experience on our Nation’s airlines. Following my work to return the Ontario International Airport to local control, we have seen my hometown airport go through a renaissance with new flights being added constantly. It is my hope that this bill continues that growth and allows for more improvements at the airport. While I am pleased this rule does make in order an amendment I offered to assist Ontario International Airport and airports like it, there are many amendments which were not made in order. One such amendment I want to mention is Representative CARTWRIGHT ’s amendment No. 152 on singlepilot operations. I am extremely concerned with section 744 of the underlying legislation, which establishes an FAA research and development program in support of singlepilot allcargo operations utilizing remote piloting or computer piloting technology. Unfortunately, I believe moving in this direction—singlepiloted aircraft— will result in excessive workload for pilots and safety risks for everyone. I think it would have been fair for the House to give the Cartwright amendment a floor debate and a simple upordown vote. In addition, I am disappointed that Representative GRACE MENG’s amendment No. 28 was not made in order. This amendment would have standardized the treatment of animals aboard airlines. I know we were all horrified when we read the reports last month of a pet who died after being forced into a luggage compartment, or being flushed down a toilet, or being forced to leave the plane. According to a U.S. Department of Transportation report issued in February, 24 animals died in the care of U.S. carriers last year. I don’t think it is too much to ask for a vote on the House floor to establish standards for the safety of our constituents’ pets. In addition to the FAA authorization bill, this rule will also bring H.R. 3144 to the floor. This bill is intended to provide for operations of the Federal Columbia River Power System and delay multiple court decisions which are intended to protect the local environment. This legislation would derail the ongoing comprehensive efforts to improve dam management practices on the Columbia River basin, creating problematic conservation and management policies. The impact on salmon and steelhead trout, in particular, would harm not just the environment, but also tribes and businesses of the Pacific Northwest. I joined the Rules Committee from my previous role as ranking member on the Indian, Insular, and Alaska Native Affairs Subcommittee. I was proud of the work I did to protect Tribal communities, and while serving in that role, I opposed this legislation due to the negative impact on local tribes. The 2014 operation plan, which this bill attempts to reimplement, was developed by the Department of Commerce National Marine Fisheries Services. That plan was found to violate the Endangered Species Act and the National Environmental Policy Act, and failed to live up to the agreement we made with local tribes. Native peoples of the Pacific Northwest ceded most of their ancestral homeland to the U.S. in exchange for the right to catch salmon and steelhead at their accustomed places. This tradition carries great cultural and religious significance, but the current operation plan would further harm Tribal fisheries. Mr. Speaker, I oppose this rule and the underlying legislation because it fails to include the appropriate input from local tribes. I urge my colleagues to reconsider bringing this bill forward, and go back to the drawing board where an agreement can be reached that brings all affected parties on board. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose the rule we have before us, and I reserve the balance of my time. b1300 Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I say with no levity that we are absolutely thrilled to have Mrs. TORRES on the Rules Committee, as she has already made a contribution. She is going to continue to make a wonderful contribution. I would say, Mr. Speaker, to my friend from California, that sometimes setting expectations is the right way to find success in the things that we pursue in our lives. This FAA bill, I recognize her concerns that not every amendment was made in order. She is absolutely right. However, this bill did go through the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, where all of our transportation subject matter experts are supposed to be, and absolutely every amendment was considered in that transportation committee. Now it leaves the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, where the subject matter experts are, and we have now made in order over 100 additional amendments brought from all across this House, more Democratic amendments made in order than Republican amendments made in order, but over 100 additional amendments made in order to try to perfect this bill. It may not be everything that folks would like to see, but I would share with the gentlewoman, Mr. Speaker, that from my brief Rules Committee experience, we are getting close to a highwater mark here, and I am going to try to take credit and share enthusiasm when we have an opportunity to do it. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Montana (Mr. GIANFORTE ), for his insights on this legislation. Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3144, which will bring certainty to the management of the Federal Columbia River Power System. For generations, the system has provided thousands of Montanans with clean, lowcost energy. Compliance with environmental mandates and litigation, however, threaten our way of life. The Bonneville Power Administration spent over $700 million to comply with environmental red tape in 1 year alone. Thirty percent of those costs were passed on to taxpayers. A recent courtordered spill released nearly $40 million of potential hydropower. Approximately 130,000 Montana taxpayers will pay a portion of the costs for this courtmandated spill. This increase is on top of rate hikes of up to 50 percent that western Montana electric coops have faced since 2011. It is time to bring certainty to the operations of the Columbia River System. Mr. Speaker, as a cosponsor of this bipartisan bill, I urge my colleagues to bring some relief to Montana taxpayers and pass H.R. 3144. Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DOGGETT ), the distinguished ranking member of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Tax Policy. Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. Recently, our attention was rightly focused on one passenger who was killed after jet engine failure. Two years ago, July 30, 2016, 16 people were killed near Lockhart, Texas, in the deadliest commercial balloon crash in our Nation’s history and the worst aviation disaster of any type in the last decade. After that crash, this photo shows all that was left. Rightly, the head of the National Transportation Safety Board expressed his disappointment that the Federal Aviation Administration appears to be shirking its responsibility for the many people who go out to enjoy a commercial balloon flight. 
Since 2016, I have repeatedly urged the FAA to adopt a safety measure, long recommended by the NTSB, to help avert tragedies like this. The NTSB found that the FAA’s refusal to require commercial balloon operators to obtain a medical certificate that they are suitable for flying contributed to this crash where so many were harmed. My bipartisan amendment, that has been approved by the Rules Committee, would end this exemption for commercial balloon operations to ensure that there is not another family in America that is at risk of injury or death from an impaired pilot. Continued inaction is inexcusable and risks condemning more to death. Uniting in Caldwell County around the courthouse in morning prayer to remember the victims, a bell rang 16 times for each person who was lost; families, coming together in their hurt, lovingly embraced by that community. You cannot unring a bell, and we cannot bring the precious lives back that were lost in this crash. But from their loss, we can pass an amendment that will help ensure that no other family needlessly suffers. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the amendment in the course of the debate. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 10 minutes to the gentleman from Washington State (Mr. NEWHOUSE ), a member of the Rules Committee and a subject matter expert on the Columbia River bill before us. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, Mr. WOODALL , my good friend from the Rules Committee, for yielding me such time. Mr. Speaker, I also welcome Mrs. TORRES to her first management of a rule on the floor. It is a pleasure to have her as part of the Rules Committee. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule, including the underlying legislation, H.R. 3144, of which I am a proud original cosponsor. H.R. 3144, Mr. Speaker, is a vital piece of legislation for my constituents as well as for the greater Pacific Northwest region. The legislation keeps in place a groundbreaking, comprehensive plan which governs the operations and salmon protection management plan for the Federal Columbia River Power System. This plan was the product of painstaking negotiations conducted by the Bush and the Obama administrations, scientists, engineering experts at Federal agencies, affected States, sovereign Northwest Tribes, and local stakeholders. In fact, every Tribe in the region was consulted in the development of the 2014 biological opinion, and all but one supported it. H.R. 3144 ensures that Tribal consultations provided for under the BiOp continue unaffected. These experts collaborated to develop this comprehensive plan to both protect Endangered Species Actlisted salmon and to provide certainty for our region’s ability to continue providing clean, renewable, and affordable power derived from hydroelectric dams. Now, unfortunately, a Federal judge in Portland, Oregon, has decided to throw out this comprehensive plan and negate years of serious concerted efforts by a diverse set of Federal, State, and local stakeholders. He has anointed himself the sole expert of this river system and has begun dictating scientific and engineering decisions. As my friend Jack Heffling says: ‘‘One judge in Portland does not know how to manage this river system better than the experts and professional workforce who keep the lights on for the entire Pacific Northwest.’’ Jack is president of the United Power Trades Organization, a labor union representing more than 600 men and women who maintain and operate the equipment at hydroelectric projects throughout the Pacific Northwest. Mr. Speaker, I stand with Jack today and all of the men and women of the power trades. I believe the experts, scientists and biologists, engineers, and professional workers at Federal agencies and on the ground working at our dams should be deciding how to best manage this system, not a judge sitting behind a bench. Unfortunately, this judge thinks otherwise and now has mandated an ongoing forced spill order over eight of our dams in the region. This order could have devastating impacts on transportation and barging systems, on our flood control capabilities, and irrigation systems; it could impair our agricultural economy, both by limiting modes of transportation for our commodities and by hobbling our irrigation resources. While there are no cost estimates of the effects this decision will have on transportation and barging, flood control, or irrigation, Federal agencies have estimated that the forced spill will cost ratepayers, utility ratepayers, $40 million per year in increased electrical rates starting in the very near future. The judge’s order could also harm the very fish he is claiming to protect. The Bonneville Power Administration, or the BPA, notes that the risks of exposing fish to the maximum total dissolved gas levels have not been evaluated, nor has it been recommended by the National Marine Fisheries Service or the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. They warn that the potential for adverse effects from exposure to these gases in the river is a concern recognized by experts in the region and also creates risk of adverse consequences for other aquatic species. The judge’s decision to recklessly dictate a water management plan could, in fact, harm or even kill these ESAlisted salmon. This order also threatens the reliability of the Federal power and transmission system. BPA has also warned of blackouts, stating: 
When the Lower Columbia and Lower Snake generators are operating at minimum generation levels, however . . . there is far less generation available for use. . . . Under the right conditions, local blackouts may occur if there is inadequate transfer capability in the transmission system to move the necessary electric power to loads. I am already hearing from our local cooperatives and public utility districts that this threat is not far off. Our communities could be facing the risk of rolling blackouts in the coming months due to this order. Mr. Speaker, it is because of this reckless antiscience order that constituents and stakeholders from a great variety of backgrounds and viewpoints have joined with me and my colleagues from the Pacific Northwest over these past several months to stand against this decision and support a rational, sciencebased resolution. I have been overwhelmed and invigorated by these supporters, whether it is the barge captains on our rivers, who move commodities like wheat for export; or smallbusiness owners, who depend on our affordable electricity throughout the Pacific Northwest; it is the union workers at our hydropower dams and the irrigators, who provide the incredibly vital resource of water for our region; it is the local cooperative managers and public utility district leaders across Washington State and throughout the Northwest who have rallied to bring this legislation to the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives today, and I could not be more proud to stand with all of them in support of H.R. 3144. Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, not every aspect of this matter has been as inspiring. I have been disappointed to see radical and ideological groups use hyperbolic language to insinuate that my colleagues and I are actively advocating for the extinction of our native salmon species. Let me tell you, Mr. Speaker, nothing could be further from the truth, and, frankly, I have been appalled that some of my colleagues in this very body have decided to use these same scare tactics to fearmonger other Members of this House. They claim we advocate for an illegal or an unlawful plan that does not do enough to help fish, yet they fail to mention that it was President Obama’s administration who formally approved of this plan after years of work with scientists, with experts, with affected States, and, like I said, with sovereign Northwest Indian Tribes. Mr. Speaker, I take offense to these fringe voices and proudly stand with the reasoned, serious contributors who have been a part of these collaborative and unprecedented negotiations. I challenge these detractors, let this plan actually come to fruition, let us actually have a plan that has the intent of continuing our salmon restoration efforts, rather than constantly bogging down our Federal action agencies and experts running the system in decades of litigation after litigation. 
Honor the work of these diverse stakeholders who, in a good faith effort, worked to build a plan to both save our salmon and save our dams. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues, support the rule and support H.R. 3144. Join me to save our salmon and save our dams. Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, President Trump campaigned on the promise of draining the swamp, but has instead allowed corruption to run rampant in the executive office. Several Cabinet officials are being investigated for ethics violations and the misuse of Federal funds. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Carson spent over $31,000 on a new dining room set for his office. Interior Secretary Zinke spent $139,000 of taxpayer money to remodel three sets of office doors. One of the most outrageous practices by President Trump’s Cabinet is the hundreds of thousands of dollars spent on luxury air travel. Just a couple of examples: Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Pruitt spent over $14,000 on a private jet traveling just 300 miles within Oklahoma. b1315 Interior Secretary Zinke cost the taxpayers $12,000 chartering a plane belonging to an oil and gas exploration firm. President Trump recently said: ‘‘Sometimes it may not look like it, but believe me, we are draining the swamp.’’ Well, with a Cabinet like this, I have to agree with President Trump in part. It does not look like he is draining the swamp, but that is because he is not. For this reason, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up Representative LIEU’s H.R. 3876, the SWAMP FLYERS Act. This legislation will ensure that senior political appointees are not using Federal funds for official travel on private aircraft. Unlike the restrictive rules we are considering today, this bill would be brought to the floor under an open rule so that all Members have the opportunity to amend the bill on the floor. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the RECORD , along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. FLEISCHMANN ). Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from California? There was no objection. Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. TEDLIEU) to discuss this proposal. Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, whether you are a Republican or a Democrat or an Independent, you don’t want corruption in your government. Unfortunately, multiple members of Donald Trump’s Cabinet have engaged in massive fraud, waste, and abuse, largely by using taxpayer funds on luxury private air travel. Democrats have been calling repeatedly for investigations into Trump’s ‘‘Cabinet of Corruption.’’ Unfortunately, the Republicancontrolled House has largely protected these officials at every turn. So I am going to highlight to you some of the more egregious examples, and we have added up the numbers. Representative TORRES gave very specific examples, but we are going to give you the big numbers so you understand how much corruption there is. It all started with former Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, who spent half a million dollars of taxpayer funds on private and military jet travel for no good reason. He could have taken commercial. He chose not to. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin looked at that and must have said ‘‘what a great idea,’’ because he doubled that spending. He spent nearly $1 million of taxpayer funds on at least seven military jets, for no good reason, because he could have flown commercial, just like his predecessors. And then we have Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, who took multiple trips that added up to thousands of dollars on expensive private jets, as well as about $139,000 to renovate his office doors. Then we have former Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin, who spent $122,000 of taxpayer funds on a trip to Europe with his wife, largely to do sightseeing. But EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, he takes this to a whole new level. He is so creative in his corruption. You will be very impressed to hear how ingenious he is. First of all, he spent over $40,000 on a private phone booth of your hard earned taxpayer funds. For most Americans, we know there is a very simple way to make private phone calls from your office; it is called closing the office door. But no, he didn’t do that. He spent your hardearned money to have this private phone booth for him to make his phone calls. Then he managed to find a way to live here in Washington, D.C., cheaply, by getting a belowmarket rate condo deal, $50 a night; and then he structured the lease so that the landlord had to keep the condo open for the entire time for 6 months, but he only had to pay for the days that he stayed there. No ordinary citizens could have gotten that lease. Then he spent over $200,000 of your hardearned taxpayers’ money, on, again, first class travel and chartered flights. The Trump administration’s ‘‘Cabinet of Corruption’’ is sticking Americans with a raw deal. Democrats believe that hardworking Americans deserve a better deal, and my bill, the SWAMP FLYERS Act is very simple. It will prevent administration officials from using taxpayer funds for private air travel, ensuring that government officials are not using your hardearned taxpayer dollars to fund their lavish lifestyles. If my colleagues care about protecting our tax dollars and preventing these obvious abuses, they will vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous question and call up H.R. 3876, the SWAMP FLYERS Act, for a vote. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, with great optimism that we will return to the bill at hand, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. TITUS), the distinguished ranking member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings and Emergency Management. Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, after testifying before the Rules Committee last night on my amendment to this bill, H.R. 4, a worthy amendment that, by the way, was not made in order and will not be debated or voted on by this body, I felt compelled to speak about the broken process that dominates this Congress. The Speaker promised us an open and inclusive process but, in reality, it has never been more closed. Members play very little role in legislating today. Instead, the agenda is dictated and the process is controlled by a failed leadership cabal. Let me remind my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that majorities can switch and, when they do, previous mistreatment, unfairness, and disregard for the democratic process will be hard to forget. In the meantime, we can reverse this destructive trend and better serve the American people by rejecting the rule before us, so I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the rule. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I would advise my friend from California I do not have any speakers remaining, and so I am prepared to close when she is. I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose the previous question and the rule, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I had a wonderful closing statement but, against that backdrop of collegiality, I will say only this. I did mention earlier that subject matter experts were assigned to the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. My friend, Ms. TITUS, is on that committee; I am on that committee. As a subject matter expert, my mom and dad come to me regularly to help them with their airline reservations, Delta Airlines, of course, being an Atlantan. But just recently, they were heading out to California; demanded that I make those reservations going into Ontario instead of LAX because, why in the world would anyone want to 
battle LAX when they could be in the Torres district there in Ontario? They were treated wonderfully and had a wonderful visit, so I recognize the gentlewoman’s passion for her airport. Mr. Speaker, if you have an airport in your district, if you have aviation travelers in your district, you want the FAA to be reauthorized. This bill, this rule makes that possible. This bill gets that job done in an open, collaborative, and bipartisan way. I urge my colleagues to support this rule, support the underlying bills. The material previously referred to by Mrs. TORRES is as follows: 
THEVOTE ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION : WHAT ITREALLY MEANS  This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the House of Representatives (VI, 308–311), describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.’’ To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition’’ in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R–Illinois) said: ‘‘The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.’’ The Republican majority may say ‘‘the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.’’ But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here’s how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ‘‘Although it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by voting down the previous question on the rule....  When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.’’ In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled ‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ‘‘Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon.’’ Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Republican majority’s agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous question. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered.

SMITHSONIAN NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK CENTRAL PARKING FACILITY AUTHORIZATION ACT Mr. HARPER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on House Administration and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure be discharged from further consideration of the bill (H.R. 4009) to authorize the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution to plan, design, and construct a central parking facility on National Zoological Park property in the District of Columbia, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. HOLLINGSWORTH ). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Mississippi? There was no objection. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4009 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Smithsonian National Zoological Park Central Parking Facility Authorization Act’’. 
Mr. HARPER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4009, which authorizes the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution to plan, design, and construct a central parking facility on National Zoological Park property in the District of Columbia using non appropriated funds. Established by Congress in 1889, the National Zoo was incorporated as a unit of the Smithsonian Institution in 1890. Today, the National Zoo consists of two components: the 3,200acre Conservation Biology Institute in Front Royal, Virginia and the public National Zoological Park (Zoo) located at the 163acre Rock Creek campus in Washington, D.C. Admission is free of charge and with more than two million people visiting the Rock Creek facility in 2017, the Zoo remains a favorite tourist and local destination in the nation’s Capital. While public transit is an option for some visitors, many others rely on private vehicles to reach the Zoo. Currently, parking at the Zoo includes several paved surface lots spread across the campus, which often fill up early in the day during peak season. To better serve these visitors, the proposed new parking facility consolidates public parking into a multi level parking garage located at the midpoint of the Zoo. Included in the Zoo’s 2008 Comprehensive Facilities Master Plan, the parking facility will provide a number of benefits that both further the Zoo’s mission and improve the visitor experience. These benefits include expanding animal habitat space through repurposing existing surface lots; improving visitor access with a centralized and accessible arrival point; increasing security through consolidation of access points; improved pedestrian safety; and expanding the number of onsite visitor parking spaces which reduces the number of days the Zoo must turn away visitors due to lack of parking. The additional parking spaces will help accommodate a projected increase in the number of visitors to the Zoo. No appropriated funds will be expended for the project. The Smithsonian intends to enter into a publicprivatepartnership for the construction and operation of the parking facility. The developer would be responsible for design, construction, maintenance, and operations for a fixed term of 35 years after which ownership is retained by the Zoo. Financing is the sole responsibility of the developer, with construction cost estimated at $70–75 million and annual operating costs at $1.5 million. As part of the agreement, the Zoo receives an initial annual payment of $7 million and a recurring annual payment based on revenues with a guaranteed minimum of $1 million. Design, construction, operations and maintenance will be conducted in accordance with the contract and plans approved by the Smithsonian. The Committee on House Administration held a markup on this bill on December 13, 2017 and ordered the bill reported favorably to the House, by voice vote, with no amendments. In its December 21, 2017 cost estimate, the Congressional Budget Office states that enacting H.R. 4009 would not affect the federal budget and would not affect direct spending or revenues. Additionally, the Committee on House Administration exchanged jurisdiction letters with the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4009. U.S. C ONGRESS , CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE , Washington, DC, December 21, 2017. Hon. GREGG HARPER , Chairman, Committee on House Administration, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN : The Congressional Budget Office has prepared the enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 4009, the Smithsonian National Zoological Park Central Parking Facility Authorization Act. If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Meredith Decker. Sincerely, KEITH HALL, Director. Enclosure. H.R. 4009—SMITHSONIAN NATIONAL ZOOLOG ICAL PARKCENTRAL PARKING FACILITY AUTHORIZATION ACT As ordered reported by the House Committee on House Administration on December 13, 2017 H.R. 4009 would authorize the Smithsonian Institution to plan, design, and construct a central parking facility on the National Zoological Park’s property in the District of Columbia. Construction would be financed with nonappropriated funds. CBO estimates that implementing H.R. 4009 would not affect the federal budget. Because enacting the legislation would not affect direct spending or revenues, payasyou go procedures do not apply. CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 4009 would not increase net direct spending or on budget deficits in any of the four consecutive 10year periods beginning in 2028. H.R. 4009 contains no intergovernmental or privatesector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Meredith Decker. The estimate was approved by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Assistant Director for Budget Analysis. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON HOUSE ADMINISTRATION , Washington, DC, April 24, 2018. Hon. BILLSHUSTER , Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Washington, DC. DEARCHAIRMAN SHUSTER : I am writing in regard to H.R. 4009, Smithsonian National Zoological Park Central Parking Facility Authorization Act. As you know, the bill was introduced on October 11, 2017, and referred to the Committee on House Administration, with an additional referral to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill authorizes the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution to plan, design, and construct a central parking facility on National Zoological Park property in the District of Columbia using nonappropriated funds. On December 13, 2017 the Committee on House Administration reported H.R. 4009 favorably out of Committee by voice vote without amendment. The Committee on House Administration recognizes that the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure has an additional referral of H.R. 4009. We ask that the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure be discharged from consideration of H.R. 4009 to expedite the bill. It is the understanding of the Committee on House Administration that forgoing action on H.R. 4009 will not prejudice the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure with respect to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject matters contained in the bill that fall under your Committee’s Rule X jurisdiction. Sincerely, GREGG HARPER , Chairman. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION AND  INFRASTRUCTURE , Washington, DC, April 24, 2018. Hon. GREGG HARPER , Chairman, Committee on House Administration, Washington, DC. DEAR CHAIRMAN HARPER : Thank you for your letter concerning H.R. 4009, the Smithsonian National Zoological Park Central Parking Facility Authorization Act. As noted, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure received an additional referral on this legislation. In order to expedite floor consideration of H.R. 4009, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure agrees to forgo action on this bill. However, as you noted, this is conditional on our mutual understanding that forgoing consideration of the bill would not prejudice the Committee with respect to the appointment of conferees or to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject matters contained in the bill or similar legislation that fall within the Committee’s Rule X jurisdiction. Should a conference on the bill be necessary, I appreciate your agreement to support my request to have the Committee represented on the conference committee. Thank you for your cooperation on this matter and for agreeing to place a copy of this letter and your response acknowledging our jurisdictional interest into the Congressional Record during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Sincerely, BILLSHUSTER , Chairman. 
The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, was read the third time, and passed, and a motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
GENERAL LEAVE Mr. HARPER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous material on H.R. 4009. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Mississippi? There was no objection. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 5447) to modernize copyright law, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 5447 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
Of the unobligated balances available under the Department of Justice Assets Forfeiture Fund, $47,000,000 is hereby permanently rescinded. TITLE I—MUSIC LICENSING MODERNIZATION 
This title may be cited as the ‘‘Musical Works Modernization Act’’. 
DELIVERIES .—For every digital phonorecord delivery of a musical work made under a 
This title may be cited as the ‘‘Compensating Legacy Artists for their Songs, Service, and Important Contributions to Society Act’’ or the ‘‘CLASSICS Act’’. 
This title and the amendments made by this title shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act. TITLE III—ALLOCATION FOR MUSIC PRODUCERS 
This title may be cited as the ‘‘Allocation for Music Producers Act’’ or the ‘‘AMP Act’’. 
LAWS .—The holding and distribution of receipts under section 112 and this section by a nonprofit collective designated by the Copyright Royalty Judges in accordance with this subsection and regulations adopted by the Copyright Royalty Judges shall supersede and preempt any State law (including common law) concerning escheatment or abandoned property, or any analogous provision, that might otherwise apply.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOODLATTE ) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. NADLER ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia. 
Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 5447, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Virginia? There was no objection. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, today, the House brings early 20th century music laws for the analog era into the 21st century digital era. These changes are a culmination of years of effort by interested parties as well as by many members of the Judiciary Committee. The problems and failures in our Nation’s music laws have imposed real financial costs upon artists and creators. Music is no longer written on piano rolls and our laws shouldn’t be based on that technology any longer either. Several years ago, the Judiciary Committee began a comprehensive review of our Nation’s copyright laws. We held dozens of hearings, heard from over 100 witnesses, and traveled to multiple cities across the country to hear directly from stakeholders who use these laws. This review provided the foundation upon which several bills to reform our copyright laws were constructed. During the course of this review, we learned that our music licensing laws were no longer working as intended for songwriters, artists, and creators, or for the companies that deliver the music in innovative ways for consumers. Specifically, we have heard about several key problems, including a dysfunctional mechanical licensing system that seems to generate more paperwork and attorneys’ fees than royalties; a need to provide protection for pre1972 performances; a lack of recognition in the law for the creative input of producers, sound engineers, and mixers; and a lack of a unified rate standard for music royalties. The Judiciary Committee regularly hears from a variety of groups interested in copyright law, and it will not surprise anyone to know that, typically, not everyone agrees regarding what changes to title 17 are necessary. One person’s problem may be another’s benefit, and some have preferred a broken system over an unknown change. However, in a reflection of how bad our music statutes are, the opposite is true with respect to the bill before us today. Every party that has spoken about music recognizes the problems caused by our current licensing framework and wants real solutions. The existing music provisions of title 17 are simply that bad. I tasked the industry to come together with a unified reform bill and, to their credit, they delivered, albeit with an occasional bump along the way. Today, the major players in the music industry are unified in supporting comprehensive music licensing reform to bring the state of our Nation’s copyright laws into the digital age that the industry itself has already transitioned to. While no bill is perfect, by all accounts, this is a bill with overwhelming consensus behind it. Groups that represent songwriters, musical works copyright owners, digital music providers, individual artists, sound recording copyright owners, artist guilds, and performing rights organizations all support the bill. The reasons for such widespread support are clear: The Music Modernization Act boosts payments for copyright owners and artists by shifting the reasonable costs of a new mechanical licensing collective onto digital music services that, themselves, benefit from reduced litigation costs as a result of other provisions in the bill. Songwriters gain a seat at the table in seeing how their royalties are collected and then allocated. Pre1972 artists who currently go unpaid will finally see royalties for their creations, as will sound engineers, mixers, and producers. The public benefits, too, by having immediate access to all music on their favorite services. Furthermore, libraries and archives gain educational and fair use access to pre 1972 works currently governed under State law. This bill is the work product of many stakeholders and many Members. I want to highlight the work of several of my colleagues, including the ranking member, who were leaders in working on the underlying components of this bill. I want to especially thank Mr. COLLINS and Mr. J EFFRIES for their leadership on section 115 reform. I would like to thank Mr. ISSAand Mr. N ADLER for their leadership on behalf of pre1972 performers. I would also like to thank Mr. CROWLEY and Mr. R OONEY for their efforts on behalf of producers, mixers, and sound engineers. And last but not least, I would like to thank Ranking Member NADLER for his leadership on these issues and for his willingness to partner with me in putting these pieces together into a comprehensive and consensus music licensing reform package. Sometimes big pieces of legislation can come together only through the efforts of a large number of people who invest their time in making change happen, as so many Members and so many stakeholders in the music and digital delivery communities have done. It also has to happen at the right time. I would note that only 1 week ago, GRAMMYs on the Hill brought hundreds of artists to D.C. to explain to their own Members of Congress how important an updated licensing system is to them. This bill delivers that for them just 1 day before World Intellectual Property Day, when we recognize the value of intellectual property and those who create it. So I am on safe ground when I say that this bill fits right into the perfect sweet spot on both timing and substance. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Music Modernization Act. I am proud to partner with Chairman GOODLATTE  on this comprehensive bill intended to resolve some longstanding inequities and inefficiencies in the music marketplace. We have achieved consensus on this bill, which passed out of the Judiciary Committee by a remarkable vote of 32–0. The package includes the original Music Modernization Act, H.R. 4706, introduced by Mr. COLLINS and Mr. JEFFRIES , which significantly reforms the process for licensing mechanical reproduction royalties under section 115 of the Copyright Act. It also includes a number of provisions to ensure that songwriters and other music creators receive fair market value for their work. The package includes the CLASSICS Act, H.R. 3301, introduced by Chairman 
ISSA and me, to resolve the dispute over payment to legacy artists for pre 1972 works played on digital radio platforms. For too long, many of our Nation’s great cultural icons have been unfairly denied compensation. That is why this measure is supported by the NAACP and more than 300 major artists. The bill includes the AMP Act, H.R. 831, introduced by Mr. CROWLEY and Mr. ROONEY , to simplify the payment of royalties to producers, mixers, and engineers, recognizing in Federal copyright their important contributions to the creation of music. Several of these measures were included in the Fair Play Fair Pay Act, H.R. 1836, a bipartisan bill I introduced with Representative MARSHA BLACK BURN , Chairman I SSA, and Mr. D EUTCH , to create a uniform system for sound recordings. They, along with Mr. COLLINS and Mr. J EFFRIES , deserve a tremendous amount of credit for getting us to this point. We are at a unique moment in time where virtually all the industry stakeholders have come together in support of a common music policy agenda. The bill is supported by a broad coalition that includes songwriters and artists, publishers and labels, and internet and digital media companies such as Pandora, Spotify, Google, and Amazon. I want to thank the members of my staff who worked for years to resolve some very complex and sensitive issues to move this legislation forward: Lisette Morton, Jason Everett, and David Greengrass. This is an historic opportunity to accomplish a great deal that hasn’t been done in decades. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support the Music Modernization Act, and I reserve the balance of my time. b1415 Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. COLLINS ), a member of the Judiciary Committee and a key legislator in making sure that this legislation moves forward. He has worked very, very hard on it. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5447, the Music Modernization Act. It has already been said that this bill combines critical pieces of legislation to update our laws, including legislation that I authored, the Music Modernization Act, but it also represents the CLASSICS Act, the AMP Act, and rate standardization, things that have been negotiated for a long period of time. As we have looked at this and we have talked about it, this is a bill today that comes to the floor with overwhelming support, not just on this floor, not just in the committee where it passed 32–0. It comes to this floor with an industry that many times couldn’t even decide that they wanted to talk to each other about things in their industry, but who came together with overwhelming support and said this is where we need to be. I can remember when the chairman first laid out a vision that would deal with copyright. Most thought it was a dream that would never happen. In fact, some thought we would never even get text that people could agree on. They were wrong, because we did. I want to thank the leadership of Chairman GOODLATTE and Ranking Member NADLER for their tireless commitment to getting something done on copyright, which ultimately got us here. I thank their staffs: Joe Keeley, Lisette Morton, and Jason Everett. Also in this, Mr. Speaker, there is someone whom I also want to thank who, not only in this bill but in many others, epitomizes to me what is good about this institution. The Music Modernization Act has put my friend HAKEEM JEFFRIES and I in, again, a leading role and is living proof that a rural Member from northeast Georgia and a Democrat from Brooklyn can find common ground. With HAKEEM and I, we know that we can come together with good product when we have the right intentions in mind. Senators HATCH and A LEXANDER have been champions in the Senate, where they have introduced companion legislation. Congressmen ISSA, ROONEY , and CROWLEY have all been key players, and many from different States have all taken part in this. As I have said earlier, they come from many places: David Israelite with NMPA; Bart Herbison from Nashville Songwriters Association International; Dina LaPolt, Michelle Lewis, and Kay Hanley from SONA; Beth Mathews from ASCAP; Mike O’Neill from BMI; Chris Harrison from Digital Media; Michael Beckerman from Internet Association; Mitch Glazier from Recording Industry Association of America; Todd Dupler and Darryl Friedman from Recording Academy; and others, such as Rick Carnes, Mike Huppe, Curtis LeGeyt, and many others; also my friends, one sitting behind me, MARSHA BLACKBURN  as well, who has been at the forefront of this. Mr. Speaker, before I finish up in just a little bit, I do need to thank two more, and that is my staff, who have lived with me, who have worked with me for a long time: Brendan Belair, my chief of staff, who has kept us on target; and Sally Rose Larson. You couldn’t meet a better steel magnolia, who has shown herself to be such an invaluable asset during this process. Mr. Speaker, I want to end not with the bill. We will talk about it. But what brought me to this point and what brought me to this area and why this is so important today as we move forward for generations of others: I want to take you back in time almost 40plus years to a state trooper’s kid in north Georgia whose friends were books, whose friends were music, a radio, and songs that came true. It was in there that those songs that would come out, the music and lyrics, would take me to places far away from northeast Georgia and let me travel the world long before I could even drive a car. When we talk about copyright and we talk about the creator’s spirit, it is about the creator’s spirit, what comes out of their heart, that comes out of their mind, that comes through their hands and out of their mouths and into the lives that touch everyone of whom we become a part. This is about something bigger than ourselves. And my friend HAKEEM and all the rest who have worked on this show that this place, when put properly forward, can touch the very soul of America. We have new ways of hearing that music nowadays, long past a radio. And the digital companies needed a place where they could give music to others, but songwriters needed to be fairly compensated. When I think of my friends who write music—HAKEEM , we have talked to so many—it is about hopes, it is about dreams, it is about everything in this place. Any one of us in here would think of a song that could make us think of the first time we fell in love, the first time we had our heart broken, the first time we laid someone to rest, the first time we got that joyful noise of a new job or a new hope. Today, Mr. Speaker, we come carrying the dreams of those who have not even yet understood a song, of those who have not yet understood a melody. We carry those dreams into the future. And I want to thank everybody who has been a part of this, because today the song lives on, because it all begins with that emotion, with that heart, and with that melody. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. JEFFRIES ), the Democratic lead sponsor of the original Music Modernization Act. Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, the distinguished ranking member, for yielding, for his leadership, and, of course, to the chairman of the committee and to so many other Members: Representative ISSA, Representative ROONEY , and Representative CROWLEY and many, many others who have worked hard on this particular piece of legislation. Of course, above all else, I want to thank my good friend and colleague, Congressman DOUG COLLINS , who has been a phenomenal leader in bringing stakeholders together from across the music ecosystem, bringing folks together from the digital industry, bringing the National Association of Broadcasters together to help us reach this moment where we have a consensus product that can ensure that the people of America and the Nation can continue to enjoy the music we have come to know and love. Article 1, section 8, clause 8 of the United States Constitution gives Congress the power to promote and create a robust intellectual property system in order to, in the words of the Founding Fathers, promote the progress of 
science and useful arts. The Founding Fathers of this great Nation understood that we should incentivize creative brilliance and incentivize innovation and, in that context, that the creator should be able to benefit from the fruits of their labor and, in doing so, will continue to share their creative brilliance with the world. In the context of music, we know that the manner in which we have consumed music has changed over time: from vinyl to 8track, from 8track to cassette, from cassette to CD, from CD to downloads, from downloading to streaming. The manner in which we consume music has changed, but the underlying brilliance and beauty and creativity of that music remains the same. Consistent with what the Founding Fathers have suggested, we need a modernday music licensing system, and that is what the MMA will accomplish. I am thankful that it has brought together not just stakeholders and industry, but it has brought together a JERRY NADLER and a Chairman GOODLATTE , a D ARRELL ISSAand a JOECROWLEY . It has brought together a conservative Republican from Georgia and a progressive Democrat from the people’s republic of Brooklyn. Music is a unifying force. It has the power to bring us together. We should have the power to modernize our system on behalf of these brilliant creators. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. RUTHERFORD ), a member of the Judiciary Committee. Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, music has been an integral part of the fabric of our culture for hundreds of years because it can capture a moment in time and space like nothing else. You remember where you were the first time you heard that special song, and time after time, it takes you back to a moment and a place of significance in your life. For me, Mr. Speaker, one of the most meaningful songs in my life is ‘‘More Today Than Yesterday’’ by The Spiral Starecase. It just so happens that that song signifies the bond between my wife, Pat, and I that we have shared now for over 45 years. And I can tell you, it is a priceless reminder of our lives and so many special moments together. And while we may not be able to put a price on a song’s ability to transport us to a memory, we can all agree that the creators of the music we hold so dear should be fairly compensated for their craft. That is why I am so pleased to support the Music Modernization Act, which offers a longoverdue update to our copyright laws to account for the changing ways we consume music. Songwriters, musicians, producers, engineers, and artists should all have the opportunity to receive their fair due. And I thank Chairman GOODLATTE , Ranking Member NADLER , and Representatives COLLINS and J EFFRIES for all their hard work to ensure that our copyright laws are all singing from the same sheet of music. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DEUTCH ), one of the Democratic lead sponsors of this bill as well as of the Fair Play Fair Pay Act and the CLASSICS Act. Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member and the chairman for their leadership. I thank Congressman JEFFRIES and Congressman C OLLINS for helping to shepherd the bill to this point. It is a pleasure to vote on these muchneeded consensus reforms. Consensus on copyright has been difficult. It has been difficult to forge between the various interests represented in the content and the tech communities but, fortunately, we now have consensus. Much of that has been borne out of true necessity, the technological demands of licensing tens of millions of songs and streaming services, and much of it has been borne out of basic fairness. Recording artists, songwriters, producers, and engineers deserve to be paid for their creativity and genius; and digital services deserve more certainty in their operations. The current system is broken. As someone who cares deeply about music and the incredible people who are a part of making it and who understands the importance of the intersection of technology and creative works that benefit all American music fans, I really feel privileged to be part of this process of modernizing our copyright laws. The Music Modernization Act does not include everything that I have supported to bring fairness and 21st century sophistication to the copyright laws, but it takes big steps forward toward those goals. I am hopeful that, with this bill, it will help to ensure that we all continue to benefit from the amazing artists of yesterday and today and the innovative technologies that bring them into our lives. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the Music Modernization Act. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, at this time I yield 2
1⁄2minutes to the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. BLACKBURN ), who is from musicloving Tennessee and a great champion for the music industry and people who love music around our country. Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, what an honor it is to stand here today and to celebrate the bipartisan work that has been done on this legislation and to bring it to this point. Indeed, this is something on which we can all agree: that the creative community, these wonderful creators, have that constitutional protection to what they create, the right to be compensated for their creation. And I am so appreciative that that has already been mentioned in this debate. Chairman GOODLATTE said I come from musicloving Tennessee, and indeed I do. And we are so pleased that we are known as Music City and that, whether it is classical music or country or gospel, that you are going to hear music from every hill and every valley. And we treasure that creative community and protecting that product that they do create. Now, one of the things that has happened through time: With the change of delivery systems, it has become more difficult for these artists and these creators and the support network around them, the engineers, those who work on producing this product, to be appropriately compensated. This bill, as DOUG COLLINS mentioned, has been in the works for years; and the CLASSICS Act, to take care of those who are now no longer able to tour and to make certain that they and their heirs are able to be compensated for that music that they have created. One thing to bear in mind: Songwriters and musicians are truly small business people. They work for themselves. Their stock and trade is their idea. And they have the right to commercialize that idea and to be compensated. The Music Modernization Act and the different bills that it brings together to update this system, to protect those copyrights, and to make certain that the creators are compensated, has been a collaborative effort. b1430 Chairman GOODLATTE and Congressman COLLINS have been to Nashville several times to meet with stakeholders and to hear their stories firsthand. We are grateful for that, we are grateful for the bipartisanship, and we are very grateful for the passage of this legislation. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. JOHNSON ), the ranking member of the Committee on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual Property, and the Internet. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Music Modernization Act, and I am also proud to be a cosponsor. This comprehensive music bill will help create an efficient and fair music licensing system. Currently, streaming services have to obtain licenses on a songbysong basis. The Music Modernization Act would reform section 115 of the Copyright Act by establishing a collective to offer blanket licenses to streaming services for mechanical rights. Under current law, only sound recordings made after 1972 receive payments from digital radio services under Federal law. This bill would benefit legacy artists and music creators who recorded music before 1972 by establishing royalty payments whenever their music is played on digital radio. That is why this section of the bill is supported by Dionne Warwick, Duke Fakir of the Four Tops, Tina Turner, and the estates of Miles Davis and Otis Redding, among many others. The bill provides producers a right to collect 
digital royalties and provides a process for studio professionals to receive royalties for their contributions to the creation of music. This bill would, for the first time, add producers and engineers who play an important role in the creation of sound recordings to the U.S. copyright law. Music organizations representing U.S. music publishers, record labels, songwriters, composers, artists, and performance rights organizations support this bill. The reforms made by this bill are critical because the royalty system has not kept pace with the digital age. These changes will benefit consumers, creators, and the entire music marketplace. I urge my colleagues to vote for this bill. I commend the efforts of DOUG COLLINS , HAKEEM JEFFRIES , and Chairman GOODLATTE , as well as Ranking Member NADLER for shepherding this legislation to this point. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time I have left? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Virginia has 5
1⁄2minutes remaining. The gentleman from New York has 12 minutes remaining. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE ). Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Music Modernization Act. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bill. I am proud to come from the great State of Rhode Island, the State that sent the great Senator Claiborne Pell to Washington. It was Senator Pell who authored the bill that established the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. Senator Pell knew that the greatness of our Nation is not only defined by the strength of our military or the value of our GDP, but by our ability to promote and protect our culture and history through the arts and humanities. In keeping with that tradition today, Congress moves to make sure that artists and their creations are protected under the Music Modernization Act. Music has always been a part of our culture and history. The power of music has brought people together in moments of celebration and soothed people in difficult times. Music transcends political, ethnic, and religious boundaries. The Music Modernization Act is the culmination of years of debate and negotiation with various stakeholders. We held dozens of hearings and heard from artists, producers, and industry experts to develop a solution that reflects the changing landscape of how people consume music and ensures creators are fairly compensated. From the start, we were committed to making sure this bill was bipartisan and a compromise that everyone could support. Within the music community, this legislation brought together an unprecedented coalition of music publishers, record labels, songwriters, composers, artists, and performance rights organizations. The result was a bill that is meant for the digital age and recognizes the contributions that many people are involved in during the creation of a song. For the first time, this bill will set up a collective that can give out blanket mechanical licenses to streaming services and ensure proper payments to songwriters and publishers. Importantly, this bill also ensures compensation for pre1972 artists who have been left out of the Federal copyright system for far too long. It also provides a clearer process for engineers, mixers, and producers to collect royalties. It has been a privilege to be a part of this historic moment. I urge all of my colleagues to support the Music Modernization Act, and I want to thank Mr. JEFFRIES , Mr. C OLLINS , Mr. DEUTCH , Chairman G OODLATTE , and Ranking Member NADLER for their extraordinary leadership in accomplishing what is not only significant for our committee but significant for our ability to hear and appreciate and continue to nurture our souls with the beauty of music. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE), another Member from musicloving Tennessee and the chairman of the Veterans’ Affairs Committee. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5447, the Music Modernization Act, a bipartisan bill that will finally update our Nation’s copyright laws and correct a terrible injustice that threatens the future of quality music. Music has changed, perhaps, more than any other industry over the past 50 years. When the Copyright Act of 1976 was signed into law, most people got their music on a vinyl record. I still like vinyl, I might add. Today, you can instantly stream music to your phone from any number of services at the touch of a button. That Copyright Act might have been what was needed at the time, but it never could have anticipated the radical shift in how music was consumed over the past, even in the last 10 years. For far too long, hardworking songwriters have been penalized under the old system and have been paid only pennies on the dollar for their creative works, even though their songs may have been streamed millions of times every second around the world. Garth Brooks’ iconic song, ‘‘The Dance,’’ has been streamed tens of millions of times; and the songwriter, Tony Arata, who wrote that beautiful song, was paid a few hundred dollars. That is ridiculous, and it is wrong. Under the current system, the creative geniuses that write this music won’t be able to make a living doing what they love doing, which is writing great songs. The Music Modernization Act seeks to fix this discrepancy and properly recognize the hard work these songwriters put into their craft before they simply stop writing music because they can no longer earn enough money to survive. As a musician myself, I understand what songwriters and performers go through when getting a song out for the world to hear, and it is time we recognize the contributions the songwriters make to the creative process. This bill was supported by the entire music industry: songwriters, record labels, music publishers, streaming services, just to name a few. It isn’t often that we have a truly bipartisan and widely supported piece of legislation to consider, but with this bill, we have the opportunity and can change the lives of some of our Nation’s most talented people for the better. I strongly support H.R. 5447 and encourage all of my colleagues to listen to their favorite song one more time before coming to the floor and think of the person who wrote it, think about what it means, then support this bill and truly make a difference in someone’s life. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE), a senior member of the Judiciary Committee. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman very much for yielding, and I make the very point that there are three Members on this floor today from the Judiciary Committee who have an enormous amount of seniority, who have seen the long journey that our talented geniusbased musical icons in our Nation have traveled to come to this point, and so I say congratulations. In the markup, I indicated that there was a harmonious sound coming from the Judiciary Committee and that it was evident that we could work together in a bipartisan manner. I thank the chairman, Mr. GOODLATTE , and the ranking member, Mr. NADLER , who have been intimately involved; and I am reminded of all of those who have come in and out of my office through the years as I served on the Courts, Intellectual Property, and the Internet Committee some years back and that they were still traveling even in this year, 2018. So I applaud Mr. COLLINS and Mr. JEFFRIES for providing that musical tone. This is a very important bill. It is an important bill because it was an inconsistent patchwork that governed the industry that was in dire need of reframing, and the MMA 2018 addresses that patchwork. And specifically, under title II, it finally gives a just compensation to those artists who recorded works prior to 1972. First and foremost, the MMA is a proposition that is supported by both the majority of songwriters and publishers and the digital service providers. Secondly, it modernizes the process and brings music licensing into the 21st century—long overdue. 
Third, it puts unclaimed royalties in the hands of the content community, rather than sitting with digital services. It streamlines the streamline. Fourth, it finally creates a comprehensive database, and confidence grows in the market. And for all of those individuals who provided us the joy that was earlier mentioned, it creates a formalized body run by publishers that administer the law, the mechanical licensing and compositions streamed on services like Spotify and Apple Music, and others; it changes the procedure by which millions of songs are made available; and it funds the creation of a comprehensive database, but, more importantly, it helps those who prerecord it. My tribute to Aretha Franklin, Dionne Warwick, the late Jackie Wilson, Duke Fakir, The Shirelles, French Family in Houston, Bun B, Trae tha Truth, and the late Crickets, the Ebony singers in Houston, the Houston Grand Opera, Mrs. Barbara Tucker, End Jazz, Jason Moran, Kirk Whalum, Howard Harris, Imani children’s band, Kashmere jazz band; and, of course, gospel, Kirk Clark, Kathy Taylor, Michael McCain, and Georgia Adams. Houston is a hub, Mr. Speaker, and we are celebrating because of this bill. I congratulate everyone. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Music Modernization Act of 2018 (MMA) of which I am an original cosponsor. This bill has arrived at its current state through the diligent work of various stakeholders involved, including the music industry, congressional staff, and Members of Congress. Hours of debate, negotiation, and deliberation have yielded a product of cooperation and compromise. I commend the industry and the parties involved in drafting this bipartisan solution—it is rare that this committee reaches such agreements when considering major legislation. Houston, being a music hub with its Grammy Award winning orchestra and Grammy nominated rappers including my dear friend Bun B from Underground Kingz, will certainly benefit from this legislation becoming law. The exemplary efforts exhibited by the music industry in this instance, with the goal of solving problems and addressing a wide variety of stakeholder concerns, are a model that this committee and this Congress should use as inspiration to best serve the American people. The need for this legislation is clear; much of the current licensing system was established in an analog era, with nondigital physical recordings done songbysong, using compulsory licenses first established in 1909. In addition, artists who recorded works prior to 1972 do not receive any digital performance royalties under federal law, and current statute does not ensure that nonrecording artists such as producers, sound engineers, and mixers receive revenue from webcasts of their work. The inconsistent patchwork that governs the industry is in dire need of reframing and the MMA 2018 addresses that patchwork and specifically under Title II, finally gives just compensation to those artists who recorded works prior to 1972. With the MMA, Congress is fulfilling its duty to provide order and guidance to the faulty program currently in place. The United States has the most innovative and influential music culture in the world, but its legal framework for music licensing dates back to the age of the Victrola. There is a widespread perception from across the industry that this complex framework is under strain and needs updating. The last general revision of the Copyright Act took place in 1976 following a lengthy and comprehensive review process carried out by Congress, the Copyright Office, and interested parties. Congress significantly amended the Act in 1995, with the Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act (‘‘DPRSRA’’), and 1998, with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (‘‘DMCA’’), to address emerging issues of the digital age. While the current Copyright Act reflects many sound and enduring principles, and has enabled the internet to flourish, it could not have foreseen all of today’s technologies and the myriad ways consumers and others engage with music in the digital environment. First and foremost, the MMA is a proposition that is supported by both a majority of songwriters and publishers and the (Digital Service Providers)—two groups who rarely agree. Secondly, it ‘‘modernizes’’ the process and brings music licensing into the 21st century. Instead of bulk Notices of Intention—the environmentally unfriendly process of sending actual physical letters of intent to each publisher for each share of each song—the licensing will be done electronically. Third, it puts unclaimed royalties in the hands of the content community, rather than sitting with the Digital Service Providers. Fourth, it finally creates a comprehensive database. While various companies and services have a version of a database, U.S. publishers have not agreed on one that is both comprehensive and accurate. As part of the MMA, the digital service providers will pay for the creation and maintenance of a database that will finally put all mechanical licensing information in one place that is accessible to all. Finally, it provides streaming services with confidence that, if they follow the process, they can accurately and comprehensively license all the musical works on their service without fear of billion dollar lawsuits against them. And confidence grows markets and boosts economy. A number of interested music industry groups have come together to create a consensus bill that makes several major changes including: Title I—Music Modernization Act. The Music Modernization act creates a formalized body, run by publishers, that administers the ‘‘mechanical licensing’’ of compositions streamed on services like Spotify and Apple Music (these companies are referred as Digital Service Providers or DSPs). The bill reflects how modern digital music services operate by creating a blanket licensing system to quickly license and pay for musical work copyrights. It changes the procedure by which millions of songs are made available for streaming on these services and limits the liability a service can incur if it adheres to the new process. Discusses music litigation that generates legal settlements in favor of simply ensuring that artists and copyright owners are paid in the first place without such litigation. The MMA funds the creation of a comprehensive database with buy in from all the major publishers and digital service providers. Ends the flawed U.S. Copyright Office bulk notice of intent system that allows royalties to go unpaid. The bill also creates a new evidentiary standard by which the performance rights organizations American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP) and Broadcast Music Incorporated (BMI) can argue better rates for the performance of musical works on DSPs. It implements uniform rate setting standards to be used by the Copyright Royalty Board for all music services. The bill shifts the costs of the new licensing collective created by the bill to those who benefit from the collective—the licensees. The MMA updates how certain rate court cases are assigned in the Southern District of New York. Title II—Compensating Legacy Artists for their Songs, Service, and Important Contributions to Society (CLASSICS) Act provides a public performance right for pre–1972 recordings. Title III—The Allocation for Music Producers (AMP) Act ensures that record producers, sound engineers, and other creative professionals receive compensation for their work I urge my colleagues to join me in support of the MMA. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. BASS). Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Music Modernization Act. I also come from one of those districts that is a hub. After meeting with songwriters and producers in my district and listening to their testimony before the House Judiciary Committee, it is clear we risk losing the next generation of songwriters if we do not address the rate standards for digital streaming. Recently, I met with worldrenown songwriter, Paul Williams, and I have had open discussions with hundreds of songwriters from around the country. Songwriters from my district have voiced that it is nearly impossible to earn a fair income via digital streaming. They are usually not the famous performers and cannot go on tour to earn a living. Over 50 percent of their income is derived from licensing performance rights to their music. One of my constituents, Michelle Lewis, shared that she made just $3.78 for 1.3 million streams of her work on one streaming service. As the Grammy Award winning artist and songwriter NeYo stated: ‘‘Even if you write a hit song that’s streamed millions of times, you’re still not going to earn enough to pay the rent from streaming. And that’s where the entire industry is moving,’’ which 
is why I support the Songwriters Equity Act, AMP, the CLASSICS Act, and MMA. MMA also closes a loophole, which has negatively impacted early music icons of Motown, jazz, blues, and rock and roll. According to Grammy Award winning artist Dionne Warwick: ‘‘How could it be that 1979’s ‘I’ll Never Love This Way Again’ receive compensation, but 1969’s ‘I’ll Never Fall in Love Again’ . . . does not?’’ Recently, legacy songwriter and performer Darlene Love visited my office to express her support for closing the legacy loophole. Born in Los Angeles, she was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2011. She sang backup for Elvis, Aretha Franklin, and Frank Sinatra. After decades of listening to her hard work being streamed without being compensated, with the passage of MMA, she and other songwriters will finally have access to the fair compensation they deserve. If we are serious about supporting a next generation of songwriters, then we must continue to address antiquated, though wellintentioned, laws. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT ), a member of the Judiciary Committee and chairman of the Small Business Committee. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my continued support for this legislation. A lot of hard work has gone into this legislation over the years, and the result is an unprecedented level of consensus from a broad coalition of stakeholders in the music industry who don’t always agree. b1445 This legislation, I think, will prove to be a great benefit to music consumers, creators, and producers alike. The way we listen to and experience music is much different today than it was when the Copyright Act was enacted back in 1976. As a result, our copyright laws have become outdated and are, in many ways, insufficient for the music industry in the 21st century. This legislation provides muchneeded updates to bring music licensing into the digital age, particularly improving market efficiencies and transparency to reflect the modern music marketplace. So again, I thank the chairman, ranking member, and various sponsors of the underlying pieces of legislation included in this bill. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. TEDLIEU). Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, as has been said, music is the lifeblood of culture that can transform world views, transport listeners, and inspire social movements. Ensuring that the law keeps up with music and its changing forms is crucial. With the support of music publishers, artists, songwriters, streaming services, and other stakeholders, the Music Modernization Act will propel the music industry into the 21st century and beyond. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the act. I want to thank Chairman GOODLATTE , Ranking Member N ADLER , as well as Representatives COLLINS , JEFFRIES , and others for their hard work on this bill. As the Representative for California’s 33rd Congressional District, these issues hit close to home. My district sits at the heart of California’s music industry. It is home to thousands of brilliant songwriters, publishers, engineers, record producers, recording artists, and musicians. I am proud to have worked with such a unique and engaged community. They make up different threads of the industry’s fabric, but share a common goal of developing solutions to some of the most complex and longstanding copyright issues facing our country. Today, we honor that legacy by moving Federal music copyright forward. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining, please? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New York has 5 minutes remaining. The gentleman from Virginia has 2 minutes remaining. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. JUDYCHU). Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Music Modernization Act. As cochair of the Congressional Creative Rights Caucus, I am proud to stand with my colleagues to support this consensus bill that aims to modernize our copyright law. Music is at the heart of how we experience life. We count on the right song to help us express a moment better than we could ourselves. For music creators, their works help them support their families, keep a roof over their head, and food on the table. But, for far too long, I have heard from songwriters whose compensation was less than pennies in digital play for number one hits, and I have heard from music legends who are touring well into their seventies because their works created before 1972 are not eligible for royalties on digital broadcasts. This bill will help bring our copyright law into the digital era and address the gaps that prevent creators from receiving fair compensation for their work. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for this bill. The lives of our most treasured creators depend on it. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. CROWLEY ), the distinguished Democratic Caucus chair and the lead sponsor of the AMP Act, which is included in this package. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague from New York (Mr. NADLER ) for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman GOODLATTE , Ranking Member N ADLER , Congressman DOUGCOLLINS , Congressman HAKEEM JEFFRIES , and all of my friends on the Judiciary Committee for working in such a bipartisan fashion to get this important bill to the floor. We all remember the iconic tune from the 1970s, ‘‘I Write the Songs.’’ First performed by Captain and Tennille and made popular by David Cassidy and, of course, Barry Manilow, the song encapsulates the universality of music. While we rightly celebrate the artists and singers behind these hits and these great songs, there often are a number of individuals who work just as hard to make that song a hit. Because to make a great song, you need not just the writers and the singers, but also engineers, technicians, and producers, people like my friend Mike Clink, as well as Darrell Brown. They may not be as famous as Guns N’ Roses or LeAnn Rimes, the folks they helped produce, but they are equally important when it comes to the process of making that music. But they are not often given the credit or compensation they so rightly deserve. With this bill, that will finally change. We are making important updates to music copyright law to make sure that everyone with a role in making hits that get stuck in our heads gets paid for their fair share. I am especially glad that my bill, the Allocation for Music Producers, or AMP Act, is included in this package. I thank my colleague across the aisle, TOMROONEY , for working with me to help the many people who work so hard to make perfect the iconic recordings we hear every day. This bill will, for the first time, make mention of engineers and producers in copyright law and provide a system for them to be directly paid for the hard work that they do. As a musician and songwriter myself, I am so glad to see bipartisan agreement around these important issues. I am proud to see all of the various folks in the recording industry coalesce around these critical fixes, and I am proud to vote today in support of fair compensation for creators in the music industry. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. COHEN ). Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. NADLER for yielding. I appreciate the work of Mr. GOODLATTE and the other sponsors, Mr. NADLER and everybody else. This was really an issue where we showed that Congress can be productive, can get something done, working 
with all of the different groups and bringing them together. It is a successful effort. Music is very important to my hometown of Memphis, which, of course, is the hometown of Elvis Presley, where Sam Phillips put Elvis in the studio at Sun Records and produced the rock and roll that Chuck Berry and Little Richard had been playing but had not really reached a lot of people’s ears. It did, and it set the world on fire. It brought a change in music and an appreciation for it. In Memphis, we have had Isaac Hayes, who did so much; Sam and Dave; David Porter; and many, many Memphians who participated. But I have personal friends in Warren Zevon, Jackson Browne, and J.D. Souther, who were great songwriters and performers and have not received, necessarily, their financial due as they should, and fairness, and this will get them done. As Mr. CROWLEY mentioned, it will get engineers and producers payment for their work to help create these musical creations that people love. Mr. Speaker, I thank all of the sponsors and appreciate the fact that I was able to participate and support it and be a cosponsor. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DOGGETT ). Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, my hometown of Austin, Texas, is modestly known as the ‘‘Live Music Capital of the World.’’ The title is well justified, from the South by Southwest music festival in the spring, to Austin City Limits on a couple of weekends in October. It is a wonderful place for live music. It is the musicians and those who support them in technical ways—weekday, weekend, and in between—that make this industry so vital and who contribute so much to our local economy. This piece of legislation is a step in the right direction. There is much more that needs to be done to ensure that our musicians and all who are involved in the creative economy get their fair compensation. I am pleased this step is taken because these are really not only talented and creative people, but small business people, and they deserve to have the property that they generate— their talent, their music, that adds so much joy to our lives—fairly compensated. This is a good step forward, and I certainly support the legislation. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. LAMBORN ). The gentleman from Virginia has 2 minutes remaining. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to close. Mr. Speaker, this is landmark legislation that has been decades in coming. We have not had a significant review of our music licensing and copyright laws in many, many, many years. There are many people to be thanked, including the staff of the Judiciary Committee on both sides of the aisle. I particularly want to recognize Joe Keeley, who is the chief counsel of the Courts, Intellectual Property, and the Internet Subcommittee. I also want to thank the leadership of the committee who have worked for many, many years on intellectual property issues: Shelley Husband, the chief of staff and general counsel; and Branden Ritchie, the chief counsel of the committee. Time doesn’t allow me to recognize everyone, but I especially want to recognize the Courts, Intellectual Property, and the Internet Subcommittee vice chairman, DOUG COLLINS . He and his staff have put literally hundreds and hundreds of hours into aspects of this legislation, and I want to personally thank him for that work as well. This legislation has very strong, bipartisan support. It is supported by groups that look at intellectual property issues across the ideological spectrum, and it is nearly universally supported by the music industry, the technology companies, and others that provide the platforms on which that music is performed. It is going to more fairly treat so many sectors of the music industry that it would be a shame not to see this legislation pass the House with a very strong, bipartisan vote, go to the Senate, pass there, and then on to the President’s desk, where I have every confidence it will be signed into law. During the course of many years of review of our copyright laws, we learned that our music licensing laws were no longer working as intended for songwriters, artists, and creators, people behind the scenes for the companies that deliver the music in innovative ways to our consumers. The Music Modernization Act, a product of the Judiciary Committee’s comprehensive copyright review, is a bipartisan bill. I urge my colleagues to join together and pass it and send it to the Senate. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5447, The Music Modernization Act. Mr. Speaker, there is broad, bipartisan agreement that current music licensing laws no longer meet the needs of creators and music providers in the digital age. Southern California has established itself as a leader in the entertainment industry, and supporting our artists and music industry is a job creator for my constituents. This bill would address the inefficiencies in the music industry’s licensing system by establishing uniformity in the licensing process. Licenses will now be managed by one entity which in turn would be paid for by the licensees. In addition to an increase in efficiency, the Music Modernization Act would foster a more transparent relationship between creators and music platforms. Information regarding music owed royalties would be easily accessible through the database created by the Music Modernization Act. This transparency will surely improve the working relationship between creators and music platforms and aid the music industry’s innovation process. Most importantly, this bill would establish a uniformed rate that would allow song writers and artists to receive fair market pay for their ideas and creations. As a society, we value the work and products of artists, creators, and the music industry. For years now, creators, and music providers have spoken out about the outdated music licensing process and the issues they repeatedly face because of its flawed system. It is only fair that we address these inefficiencies and bring the music industries’ processes in accordance with the digital age. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOODLATTE ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5447, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
b1500 PROVIDING FOR THE OPERATIONS OF THE FEDERAL COLUMBIA RIVER POWER SYSTEM Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 839, I call up the bill (H.R. 3144) to provide for operations of the Federal Columbia River Power System pursuant to a certain operation plan for a specified period of time, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. BYRNE ). Pursuant to House Resolution 839, the amendment printed in part B of House Report 115–650 is adopted, and the bill, as amended, is considered read. The text of the bill, as amended, is as follows: 
H.R. 3144 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
No structural modification, action, study, or engineering plan that restricts electrical generation at any FCRPS hydroelectric dam, or that limits navigation on the Snake River in the State of Washington, Oregon, or Idaho, shall proceed unless such proposal is specifically and expressly authorized by an Act of Congress enacted after the date of enactment of this Act. Nothing in this section affects or interferes with the authority of the Secretaries to conduct operation and maintenance activities or make capital improvements necessary to meet authorized project purposes of FCRPS facilities. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill, as amended, shall be debatable for 1 hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Natural Resources. The gentleman from Utah (Mr. BISHOP ) and the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GRIJALVA ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah. 
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 3144. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Utah? There was no objection. Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I yield 8 minutes to the gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs. MCMORRIS RODGERS ), the sponsor, to introduce this piece of legislation. Mrs. MCMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman BISHOP for yielding. Mr. Speaker, Congress created the Bonneville Power Administration, or BPA, in 1937 on the heels of the Great Depression to distribute power generated from the development of two federally authorized dams: Bonneville and Grand Coulee Dam. Our dams transformed Washington State from what was a barren, dry land into one of the most productive agriculture regions in the world. These marvels of engineering also provided the Pacific Northwest with the Nation’s cheapest and most reliable energy supply. During World War II, it was the Federal power supplied by BPA that was instrumental in the rampup of the aluminum industry that went into Boeing’s B–17s and B–29s, and powered the production of nearly 750 large ships before the end of the war. In the words of President Harry Truman: ‘‘Without Grand Coulee and Bonneville, it would have been almost impossible to win this war.’’ In 1945, Congress authorized the construction of four large dams along the Snake River, Ice Harbor, Lower Monumental, Little Goose, and Lower Granite, to grow what we call today the Federal Columbia River Power System. These four dams can power up to nearly 2 million homes, or a city the size of Seattle, and are crucial to meet BPA’s peak loads during those hottest days in the summer when the wind doesn’t blow or the coldest days in the winter when we do not have sunlight. This year, eastern Washington had a harsh winter with many days below freezing. During the coldest days, BPA relied on the ability of these four dams to ramp up production and meet the demand. Without a reliable base load source, I feared, and BPA confirmed, many in eastern Washington would have lost power. It is important to look back at history when we think about BPA, the Columbia River system, and the future of energy in our region. Last week, BPA made its 34th consecutive payment of $1.3 billion to the U.S. Treasury. They were able to do this because of the value of our region’s lowcost, carbonfree energy, as a result of selling the hydropower production along the Columbia River. In fact, in Washington State, nearly 70 percent of our energy comes from hydropower. Some argue that these dams in particular have negatively impacted migratory fish, yet these dams average fish survival rates of nearly 97 percent. And while recent ocean impacts, which scientists call a ‘‘blob,’’ have slowed salmon just the last couple of years, more total salmon have returned this year than before the dams were actually put in place. More than 600,000 fall Chinook are forecasted this year, many times higher than when they were first listed under the Endangered Species Act. These recordsetting fish passage rates are a result of significant Federal investments in new technologies, like fishfriendly turbines, habitat restoration, and local collaboration. I mention the local collaboration because I want to quote the Columbia River system Adaptive Management Implementation Plan that was produced by the Department of Interior, BPA, the U.S. Army Corps, and NOAA: ‘‘The Obama administration undertook an extensive effort to review the 2008 Biological Opinion’’ and found ‘‘the 2008 BiOp is biologically and legally sound, based on the best available scientific information, and satisfies the ESA jeopardy standard.’’ Our river system also functions as a superhighway for agriculture goods. My home State of Washington is the most tradedependent State in the country, and because of the river system, last year alone, it saved having 160,000 trucks on the roads. This BiOp is supported by the States, by Tribes, by utilities, ports, irrigation districts, and other Pacific Northwest water users. The need for this legislation became clear when an unelected judge rejected the collaborative work, claiming that he knows better how to manage the Columbia River than all of the scientists, Tribes, elected officials, and others that are using the river every day. This Oregon Federal district judge invalidated the BiOp and set a course that will likely put BPA’s future and the yearly investments of hundreds of millions of dollars in jeopardy. He wants us to start at the beginning and put breaching the dams back on the table. Electricity rates have gone up nearly 30 percent the last few years, with an average increase of 5.4 percent for 2018 and 2019. Adding unnecessary litigation and additional spill requirements only add to these costs. For example, Judge Simon granted a spill order on April 3 that will cost an estimated $40 million to ratepayers in the Pacific Northwest. Mandating spill means that huge amounts of water will go over the dam 24 hours a day 7 days a week, instead of actually producing electricity. This spill order is experimental science that will likely increase power costs, decrease the grid’s reliability, hurt habitat, and actually kill fish. In 2028, utilities will be renegotiating their contracts, and they are making decisions now. This uncertainty is plaguing the Pacific Northwest and the Columbia River system. As a result, I am proud of the work that we have done, coming together in 
a bipartisan way to support this legislation to provide certainty. This bill will codify the current BiOp until 2022, and prevent unnecessary costs to people and ratepayers all around the Pacific Northwest. It also reasserts Congress’ authority over the dams. A hearing was held in the Natural Resources Committee last fall, and the bill recently passed out of committee with bipartisan support. Technical changes were made to ensure necessary maintenance, and improvements to the Army Corps dams would continue without interruption. We hear the other side talk about being against the status quo, calling it illegal and an unprecedented assault on the Endangered Species Act. Unfortunately, this narrative is misleading and it doesn’t take into account the whole picture nor the success of the dams. For example, the Port of Clarkston has seen new business from the American Queen Steamboat Company, tourism that is coming to our communities that is bringing jobs and bringing people. This bill is a fiscally responsible alternative to the current judicial overreach that doesn’t take into account all of the river users. If enacted, the certainty provided will reduce costs on the people of eastern Washington by stopping this $40 million spill experiment, encourage clean energy, lower carbon emissions, and save taxpayers $16 million, while saving fish. Bottom line, dams and fish can coexist. After more than two decades in the courtroom, let’s let the scientists, not one judge, manage our river system, and get to work to further improve fish recovery efforts. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the bill we are debating today, I am sorry to say, is yet another attempt by my Republican colleagues to accelerate the extinction of our Nation’s fisheries. H.R. 3144 weakens protections for several runs of wild salmon and steelhead in the Pacific Northwest, which are extremely important to commercial, recreational, and tribal fishing interests. This is the worst possible time for such an extreme approach. Last year, for the first time, Federal scientists surveying the Pacific Northwest salmon population came up with empty nets, and yet here we are moving a bill that will only worsen the salmon crisis. While disappointing, I can’t say today’s bill is entirely surprising. In fact, this bill is just the latest attack by my Republican colleagues in their broader war on salmon and the salmon fishing industry. We saw these same attacks on salmon when House Republicans jammed H.R. 23, also known as the GROW Act, through the House recently. This bill sought to eliminate protection for California salmon and put California’s native fisheries on the path to extinction, meaning thousands of job losses across California, Oregon, and Washington State. House Republicans pushed the bill through even though estimates show that 78 percent of California’s native salmon will be extinct this century under current trends. Instead of trying to counter these trends, House Republicans decided it was more important to help some of their big business buddies who would rather drain our public rivers even further for private profit. Now we are here today with another bill that harms our wild salmon and the businesses that depend on their existence. It is no surprise that our committee received numerous letters from businesses and fishing industry groups opposed to H.R. 3144. The committee also received several letters from guiding and outdoor retail businesses, the food industry, and from many other businesses that depend on functioning ecosystems and the Columbia Basin salmon. Aside from being bad for many businesses, this bill also represents a troubling attack on our Nation’s bedrock environmental laws and the legal process. Since the early 1990s, Federal courts have found the Federal dam operations at the Federal Columbia River Power System endanger the existence of the Pacific Northwest salmon runs and violate our Nation’s laws, including the Endangered Species Act. As a result, Federal agents have been ordered several times to develop a new dam operation plan to recover the region’s dwindling salmon populations. Instead of requiring Federal dam operations to finally come into compliance with the law and develop a salmon recovery plan that works, H.R. 3144 locks in an outdated, illegal plan until at least 2022 that will cause great harm to wild salmon and struggling fishing communities. Furthermore, this bill blocks recent court orders requiring additional salmon protection measures at Federal dams. It also bans Federal agencies from even studying the possible changes to dam operations that can improve salmon survival, such as increased spill. In short, this bill causes great harm to wild salmon and many businesses, Tribes, and communities that depend on it. Mr. Speaker, for these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no,’’ and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Washington State (Ms. HERRERA  BEUTLER ), who lives in this area and knows firsthand what is taking place there. Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman BISHOP for yielding time for me to speak on this important legislation, and for the work his committee has been doing to support vibrant salmon runs, as well as protect lowcost, renewable, clean energy. Leading scientists and Federal agencies, Northwest States, sovereign Tribes, and notably, the Obama administration, crafted what is known as the 2014 Biological Opinion on how the Columbia River Federal hydropower system should operate. The BiOp, as it is called, was developed with the utmost standards of integrity and transparency, and importantly, collaboration. Conservative Republicans and the Obama administration got together and used the best available science. Under this plan’s implementation, we have seen several years of record or near record returns of adult salmon. The plan is working, so why are we here today? Unfortunately, in 2016, a U.S. district judge rejected the 2014 BiOp and ordered the Federal agencies start the process over, with a requirement that they look at breaching the four Snake River dams. Here is the reality. I can’t express how important this hydro system is for the entire Northwest. I have heard you couldn’t match the energy produced by these dams with six or more coalfired power plants. None of us want to return to that. More recently, that same judge who issued the order issued a mandated spill over the Columbia and Snake River dams. Now, spill occurs when water and young migrating salmon are shot over the dams. b1515 Spill is like medicine. The right dosage can help you, but too much can harm or even kill you. The same is true for salmon. The judge’s ruling lacked scientific backing, as Federal fisheries scientists believe these spill mandates will provide little or no benefits to juvenile salmon or returning adult salmon. And as we have seen, these actions are not only in blatant contradiction to the best available science, they are also a direct attack on ratepayers, the families and small businesses, and the local economies who depend on affordable, clean, reliable energy. Ratepayers in our region spend almost up to $1 billion a year, when all is said and done, on protecting these wild runs through sciencebacked spill that already takes place in other mitigation efforts. But abusive litigation robs hundreds of millions of dollars per year of hardearned tax money from the pockets of my constituents. The price tag on the judge’s spill mandates are estimated to be an additional $40 million taken from ratepayers this year. So now we find ourselves here today needing to pass H.R. 3144 for the sake of salmon runs, for the sake of our ratepayers, and for the sake of the environment. Again, this is not a partisan bill; in fact, it is bipartisan, and 
it represents restoring the Obama administrationled collaborative plan to responsibly manage our salmon populations and hydroelectric infrastructure. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Washington an additional 30 seconds. Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. The exact same opponents of this bill who claim it would ‘‘gut’’ protections—I repeat, the exact same groups—asked the court to keep the 2014 BiOp in place. So, basically, before they opposed it, the bill’s opponents asked to do exactly what our bill does. So scientists, Federal agencies of jurisdiction, and, yes, at one time, even the bill’s opponents have said that the agencies should operate under the 2014 BiOp while a new plan is developed. This is a vote for listed salmon because it keeps current measures in place, and we know that they are working. This is a vote for the region’s economy, and it avoids wasting millions of dollars. And this is a vote for the environment because we cannot match the clean, renewable energy produced by our hydro system. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. TSONGAS ), a member of the Natural Resources Committee. Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Speaker, I join Ranking Member GRIJALVA in opposing this legislation and urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’ For 45 years, the Endangered Species Act has served as one of our Nation’s bedrock environmental statutes. The bald eagle, the American alligator, and the gray whale are just a few examples of iconic species that have recovered from the brink of extinction thanks to the Endangered Species Act. Despite its widely recognized success and broad support across State and party lines, today, the House is seeking to pass yet another bill that undermines this bedrock environmental law and causes irreparable harm to salmon and steelhead species, species that are already at great risk of extinction, species that play an irreplaceable role in the Pacific Northwest’s ecosystem. Their presence benefits more than 130 other species, including the critically endangered Southern Resident killer whales, whose existence depends upon healthy salmon runs. This is not just about the Pacific Northwest. Any effort to undermine the Endangered Species Act and, thereby, its protections for the species and landscapes that make our country uniquely American impacts us all. Several Federal agencies and courts have determined that dam operations in the Columbia and Snake Rivers cause significant harm to 13 species or populations of salmon and steelhead listed under the Endangered Species Act. Instead of allowing sciencebased management practices that protect both endangered species and the many users of these rivers, including hydropower generators, this legislation locks in a failing operation plan that has already been found in violation of the Endangered Species Act. Knowingly endangering the existence of salmon is in direct violation of the law and betrays the long bipartisan tradition of the Endangered Species Act. Instead of rolling back critical safeguards and recovery efforts, we should reject this legislation and support a transparent stakeholderdriven process that protects endangered species and the many fishermen, businesses, communities, and Tribes who depend on a sustainable Columbia River. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on H.R. 3144. Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. SCHRADER ), another person who lives in this area and realizes that this judicial decision is not necessarily based on science and can actually do harm to the endangered species. Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD the following letters from the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, United Power Trades Organization, and the National Electrical Contractors Association. 
NRECA, Arlington, VA, March 14, 2018. Hon. ROBBISHOP , Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. RAU´LGRIJALVA , Ranking Member, Committee on Natural Resources, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARCHAIRMAN BISHOP AND RANKING MEMBERGRIJALVA : On behalf of America’s electric cooperatives, I write to express strong support for H.R. 3144 to require federal agencies responsible for the management of the Federal Columbia River Power System (FCRPS) to operate the hydropower system in a manner consistent with the current operations plan. Fiftyfour rural electric cooperatives in seven Western states receive reliable federal hydropower from the FCRPS. For this reason, NRECA opposes actions that bring continued uncertainty to the FCRPS and the Bonneville Power Administration’s (BPA) future hydropower operations. For decades, there has been uncertainty over the operations of existing hydropower in the Pacific Northwest due to federal regulations, court orders and other administrative decisions. This continued uncertainty to the FCRPS continues to affect BPA’s future power generation, rates and reliability in the region, and in turn the cooperative systems that depend upon it for reliable and affordable electric service to their communities. The FCRPS is paramount to power generation in the Pacific Northwest, and to California, Nevada, Wyoming and Montana. The FCRPS is the largest source of clean, renewable electricity in the Pacific Northwest. It encompasses 31 multipurpose federally owned dams along the Columbia and Snake Rivers and accounts for nearly 40 percent of total U.S. hydroelectric generation. Its hydropower not only provides energy for baseload needs and peak times, but also serves as a backup generation source for intermittent wind and solar power. This gives the Pacific Northwest and our cooperatives an environmental edge unmatched elsewhere in the country—as a nonCO2emitting resource. But due to the longstanding litigation surrounding the FCRPS for Endangered Species Actlisted salmon and steelhead, there continues to be uncertainty over BPA’s future hydropower operations. Specifically, BPA’s fish and wildlife mitigation program continues to be a significant cost driver which adversely affects our cooperatives’ abilities to provide affordable electricity. Since 1978, BPA has committed nearly $15.9 billion to support Northwest fish and wildlife recovery. BPA’s fish and wildlife mitigation program is the largest in the nation, and quite possibly the world. Each year, cooperatives and ratepayers fund BPA’s habitat restoration efforts to open valuable habitat in the Columbia River estuary and tributaries, add water to streams, and support cool water temperatures. In 2012, BPA directly invested more than $450 million to address the impacts of federal dams. These activities included protecting land and water habitat, implementing projects across the Columbia River Basin, and supporting better fish passage. Specifically, BPA has made huge long term investments in largescale structural and operational changes to further improve existing fish passage routes as well as to provide new, safe passage structures to these dams. Therefore, by upholding the 2014 Supplemental Biological Opinion, H.R. 3144 appropriately balances environmental and economic demands while also protecting existing hydropower resources in the Pacific Northwest. For these and other reasons, NRECA urges support for H.R. 3144 in committee and swift advancement to the House floor. Sincerely, JIMMATHESON , National Rural Electric Cooperative Association. 
UNITED POWER  TRADES ORGANIZATION , West Richland, WA, March 22, 2018. Hon. ROBBISHOP , Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. RAU´LGRIJALVA , Ranking Member, Committee on Natural Resources, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARCHAIRMAN BISHOP AND RANKING MEMBERGRIJALVA , I am writing on behalf of the United Power Trades Organization (UPTO) to express our support for H.R. 3144 which requires federal agencies to manage the Federal Columbia River Power System (FCRPS) in accordance with the 2014 Supplemental Biological Opinion (BiOp). UPTO represents over 600 blue collar employees that work at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers dams on the ColumbiaSnake River system. Our organization is made up of not only maintenance personnel, but power plant operators who are responsible for operating the lock and dam facilities in accordance with the BiOp. I have been one of those operators for over 30 years and have personally seen the improvements made at our facilities that have greatly improved fish survival. It is very frustrating when outside interests persuade judicial orders that change the way we operate to the detriment of fish survival. Contrary to misinformation that has been widely reported, spilling water over the dams has not been the primary reason for increases in fish survival through the ColumbiaSnake River system. There have been many reasons that fish survival has improved including habitat restoration, better oceanic conditions and summer flow augmentation. But a major reason for improved 
fish survival is the transportation program. Fish entering the generating turbine intakes are directed by rotating screens into bypass channels to fish collection facilities where they are loaded on to barges and given a free ride to below Bonneville dam where they are released back in to the river. Fish transported by barge are five times more likely to survive than those that traverse the river. Spilling water over the dams not only costs the taxpayers millions in lost power generation, but is actually detrimental to fish survival. Fish that pass through the spillgates are not collected for transport by barge, thus less likely to survive than those that are collected. In addition, the more water that is spilled over the dams, the more supersaturation of nitrogen in the water occurs resulting in gas bubble trauma to juvenile fish. More spill just doesn’t make sense in that it is costly economically, doesn’t help the fish, and can even be detrimental to fish survival. H.R. 3144 is important in that it continues programs and operating procedures that have been proven extremely successful in migrating fish survival. The BiOp is working and making changes make absolutely no sense. Fish returns are higher than what they were prior to the first dam built on the ColumbiaSnake river system and, although hatchery fish are returning in large numbers, natural fish returns are up as well too. Fish survival through the ColumbiaSnake River dams are at levels that meet or exceed those on rivers that don’t have dams. The current BiOp is the most sciencebased, comprehensive and expensive effort to restore an endangered species in the nation. $1.6 billion have been invested in new technologies and, when operated according to the BiOp, have proven that the dams and fish can coexist. Continuing to operate the dams according to the BiOp is imperative for continued high rate of survival for migrating fish. H.R. 3144 requires that continuity and is therefore imperative to the continued high survival rate of migrating fish. UPTO urges support for H.R. 3144 in committee and swift advancement to the House floor. Sincerely, JACKW. H EFFLING , President, United Power Trades Organization. 
NATIONAL ELECTRICAL  CONTRACTORS ASSOCIATION , Bethesda, MD, April 21, 2018. House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARSPEAKER RYAN: On behalf of the National Electrical Contractors Association (NECA), I am writing in strong support of pending energy legislation being considering by the House. NECA urges Members to vote yes on H.R. 3144—To provide for operations of the Federal Columbia River Power System pursuant to a certain operation plan for a specified period of time, and for other purposes, introduced by Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers. NECA is the nationally recognized voice of the $160 billion electrical construction industry that brings power, light, and communication technology to buildings and communities across the U.S. NECA’s national office and its 119 local chapters are dedicated to enhancing the industry through continuing education, labor relations, safety codes, standards development, and government relations. NECA is committed to advocating for a comprehensive energy policy that addresses all available opportunities for energy exploration and independence. The benefits of this legislation are clear: job creation, energy independence, and economic growth. NECA greatly appreciates the hard work that Representative McMorris Rodgers put into writing this important legislation. This will be included in the NECA Legislative Report Card for the 115th Congress. We urge all members to vote yes. Thank you for your consideration of our views. Sincerely, MARCO A. G IAMBERARDINO , MPA, Executive Director, Government Affairs. 
Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Speaker, it is time to put science back in the decisionmaking process for Oregon and Pacific Northwest salmon recovery strategy. Rather than having the courts dictate the best way to balance Northwest fish recovery and the region’s power needs, we should let the experts in U.S. Fish and Wildlife, Bonneville Power, NOAA, and NMFS lead the way. H.R. 3144 allows that to occur. Rather than having fish policy decided by lawsuit, it simply lets the experts do their job. Quite simply, it will allow the Federal Columbia River Power System to be managed according to the 2014 Obama administration approved biological opinion until a new BiOp can be completed in 2020. U.S. Fish and Wildlife, BPA, NOAA, and NMFS have spent years developing recovery plans to restore habitat, encourage fish passage, and manage this fishery. Their hard work was summarily thrown out by the court in favor of continued litigation. In fact, a third—yes, a third—of our power bills in the Northwest is dedicated to fish recovery. We have been diligent. Bonneville ratepayers have stepped up time and again. We have made strides, despite battling the effects of climate change, ocean acidification, and overfishing by foreign nations. Some things we can control, some things we cannot—like sea lion depredation, we can. Despite the scientific evidence and warnings from Washington and Oregon Fish and Wildlife biologists that say sea lions likely account for at least 20 percent or more of adult salmon loss in the Columbia River system, we are not doing anything about it. Even our Governors agree we need to address this, and these are Democratic Governors. Let’s deal with that instead of one injunction after another demanding more spill over the tops of the dams, which, as we have heard, is not based in good science. This latest order will cost $40 million to $50 million, with the jury out on its effectiveness as to juvenile survival and subsequent adult return. Let’s at least get some scientific data to see if this is a good idea. H.R. 3144 would allow that to happen. BPA is at a crossroads. Natural gas is abundant, very inexpensive, the primary reason a lot of our coal plants are being phased out. But its low cost, coupled with more and more demands for fish mitigation, now threaten to eliminate our clean, renewable hydropower system that accounts for 50 percent of the electricity in the Northwest. BPA simply cannot absorb more spill requirements with subsequent loss of power generation and revenue without having to curtail the very fish mitigation recovery programs the litigants want that have been helping to recover our endangered salmon. BPA is becoming quickly uncompetitive due to these escalating costs. If they go away, what happens? It means more natural gas, more fossil fuels. It makes no sense, if your goal is balancing smart, scientificbased fish recovery with clean renewable energy, to put BPA out of business and eliminate local control that the Pacific Northwest has had on determining its own future. The entire Northwest delegation, Republican and Democrat, worked together on this. We would like to continue to do so. We need to stop this constant litigation. Let the scientific experts steeped in fish recovery do their job. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 3144. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD a letter of opposition from Governor Kate Brown of Oregon, a letter of opposition to the legislation from Governor Inslee of Washington, 140 undersigned businesses from the region in opposition, the Nez Perce Tribal Executive Committee in opposition to the legislation, and over 22 environmental and outdoor organizations in opposition to the legislation. 
JANUARY 22, 2018. As Governor of the State of Oregon, I write expressing deep concerns with H.R. 3144. I am concerned this legislation would thwart federal court direction to provide additional spill at dams on the lower Columbia and Snake rivers and the collaborative state, tribal and federal process that has worked effectively to develop spill provisions for 2018. These courtordered collaborative efforts resulted in consensus recommendations from all sovereigns, representing a positive, and unprecedented, step forward in building stronger consensus for recovery actions. H.R. 3144 would negate this progress and our ability to implement and learn from these consensus recommendations. H.R. 3144 would also derail ongoing collaborative efforts to examine a range of potential future dam operations and salmon management options required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The State of Oregon has engaged in good faith as cooperating agencies with federal agency leads for this Columbia Snake River Operations study. This process is vital to secure a sustainable path forward optimizing power, commerce, agriculture and fish recovery within a changing social and environmental landscape. Through NEPA and the Endangered Species Act, Congress established processes for federal decisionmaking that are grounded in a robust analysis of alternatives in a systematic and sciencebased manner. H.R. 3144 contravenes these important principles and would disrupt the regional efforts to engage in a full, accurate and transparent analysis of salmon and dam management. Washington Governor Inslee has expressed similar opposition to H.R. 3144. Oregonians and Washingtonians share decades of investment in recovering Columbia River salmon, and I join my colleague in asking you to oppose H.R. 3144. Sincerely, KATEBROWN , Governor. 
STATE OF WASHINGTON , OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR , Olympia, WA, December 5, 2017. Hon. ROBBISHOP , Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. DOUGLAMBORN , Chairman, Subcommittee on Water, Power and Oceans, Committee on Natural Resources, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. RAU´LGRIJALVA , Ranking Member, Committee on Natural Resources, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. JARED HUFFMAN , Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Water, Power and Oceans, Committee on Natural Resources, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARCHAIRMEN BISHOP AND LAMBORN AND  RANKING MEMBERS GRIJALVA AND HUFFMAN : As Governor of the State of Washington, I write to express my deep concerns with H.R. 3144, legislation which would freeze in place a 2014 biological opinion (BiOp), or salmon management plan, for the dams composing the Federal Columbia River Power System. While the State of Washington believes the 2014 BiOp represented a step forward for efforts to protect and recover 13 stocks of threatened or endangered Columbia and Snake river salmon and steelhead, H.R. 3144 would thwart constructive ongoing efforts to improve future salmon and dam management. This would not only hurt salmon but also the recreational and commercial fisheries, tribes, and other species (such as Puget Sound’s southern resident killer whales) that benefit from healthy salmon runs. I am committed to preserving the benefits of our hydropower dams in a manner that is in balance with protecting and restoring salmon. While our dams and dam operations have been modified to reduce their impact to salmon and steelhead over the last 20 years, there is evidence that salmon may further benefit from additional modifications to dam operations that would help restore salmon populations. The State of Washington is participating in productive regional discussions about the best way to test the potential benefits of additional ‘‘spill,’’ in 2018 and potentially beyond. This discussion and learning opportunity would be blocked by H.R. 3144’s prohibition on any studies or actions that restrict electricity generation at any dams in the Federal Columbia River Power System, even by a small amount. Similarly, several Washington State agencies are engaged as cooperating agencies in the Columbia Snake River Operations study process currently being conducted, pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). This process promises to provide valuable information on a range of potential future dam operations and salmon management strategies. As with the discussion regarding increased spill over the dams, H.R. 3144 would halt this learning process in its tracks, preventing a constructive dialog among federal and state agencies, tribes, and the public about how best to manage Columbia and Snake river dams in a region that must continually adapt to ongoing changes to its climate, salmon habitat, and energy system. For these reasons, I encourage the Subcommittee on Water, Power and Oceans, the full Natural Resources Committee, and the full House of Representatives to oppose H.R. 3144. Thank you for your consideration of my input regarding federal legislation that could have significant impacts on my state. Very truly yours, JAYINSLEE , Governor. APRIL 20, 2018. MEMBERS OF CONGRESS , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR MEMBERS OF CONGRESS : The 140 undersigned businesses and business associations represent commercial and recreational salmon fishermen and related businesses, guiding and outdoor retail businesses and restaurants and food industries based in the Pacific Northwest. Our businesses and the thousands of jobs that they support regionally are highly dependent on Columbia Basin salmon and steelhead. For this reason we are very concerned about salmon conservation and recovery efforts in the Columbia Basin. We are writing to inform you of our strong opposition to HR 3144. This bill intentionally circumvents the public processes guiding operations of the Federal Columbia River Power System, application of the Endangered Species Act and recovery of salmon and steelhead resources. HR 3144 would also block recent court orders from the U.S. District Court in Portland (OR) that require additional salmon protection measures at federal dams and reservoirs on the Columbia and Snake rivers. HR 3144 requires Congressional authorization before any additional changes or further study of changing dam operations could be taken to reduce impacts on migrating salmon. This removes the best scientific judgment of regional biologists and engineers and replaces it with a political process taking place in Washington D.C. If passed into law, HR 3144 would prevent federal managers from operating the dams with additional fishsaving spill. Eliminating the additional spill would have negative impacts on all Columbia Basin salmon, but would put wild Snake River Brun steelhead at immediate risk of extinction; only 362 B run fish have passed the highest dam so far this year. The additional spill recently ordered by the court is strongly supported by regional salmon biologists. It has been shown to be highly effective in increasing juvenile survival to the Pacific Ocean and the number of adults returning. One can look at the excellent returning runs of fall chinook in 2014 and 2015 and the resulting economic benefits to see why increased spill is critical in the Columbia Basin. We support the use of spill to increase salmon runs. HR 3144 caps spill at levels already determined to be inadequate and detrimental to the recovery salmon in the Columbia Basin. We close by urging you to oppose HR 3144. Columbia Basin salmon are critical to the health of the coastal and inland economies and communities of the Pacific Northwest— including California and Alaska. Our businesses are committed to participating in processes that affect salmon and eager to work with Northwest sovereigns and stakeholders to craft lawful, sciencebased salmon strategies that meet the needs of imperiled salmon populations and the communities of our great region. Thank you for your consideration of our perspective and the effect of your policies on the culture and economy of the Northwest.

NEZPERCE TRIBAL  EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE , Lapwai, ID, October 11, 2017. Nez Perce Tribe’s Statement in Opposition to H.R. 3144. (‘‘A Bill to Provide for operations of the Federal Columbia River Power System pursuant to a certain operation plan for a specified period of time, and for other purposes.’’) The Nez Perce Tribe is committed to restoring salmon and steelhead in the mainstem Columbia and lower Snake rivers to healthy, harvestable populations for all citizens of the Northwest and to fairly sharing the conservation burden, consistent with the United States’ 1855 Treaty with the Nez Perce. The Nez Perce Tribe opposes H.R. 3144 because it attempts to shortcircuit the federal judiciary and federal appellate process with respect to providing additional spill to protect fish. The Tribe also opposes H.R. 3144 because it attempts to shortcircuit the full consideration of all alternatives to redress the impacts of the Federal Columbia River Power System (FCRPS) dams on salmon and steelhead—including breaching the four lower Snake River dams. Congress, in the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and in the Endangered Species Act (ESA), established federal decisionmaking that is grounded in a full and complete analysis of all alternatives in an orderly, methodical and sciencebased process. Both NEPA and the ESA ensure that all the citizens of this Nation will have a full, accurate, and transparent analysis of the importance of salmon and steelhead to the Pacific Northwest and the Nation, the impact the FCRPS dams have on these iconic species, and the legacy we want to leave our future generations. And, both NEPA and the ESA contain mechanisms so that tradeoffs can be considered, investments in local communities impacted by decisions can be planned, and truly informed decisions can be made. H.R. 3144 runs counter to these foundational principles of sound, consistent and sustainable governance. 
AUGUST 23, 2017. DEAR POLICYMAKER : The undersigned conservation, salmon, orca, and clean energy advocacy organizations and business associations extend our deep gratitude for your decision not to cosponsor H.R. 3144—recently introduced by several Northwest representatives. In contrast to sponsor claims, this bill, if passed, would thwart efforts to deliver critical nearterm protections for endangered wild salmon, derail the courtordered NEPA environmental review and increase uncertainty for Northwest citizens and businesses. We ask you to actively oppose this harmful legislation to ensure that it does not become law. Wild salmon and steelhead are a Northwest birthright. They are essential to the culture and economy of our region’s Native American Tribes and support tens of thousands of nontribal fishing jobs in urban and rural communities on the West Coast and in Idaho. Salmon also play an irreplaceable ecological role as an indicator species reflecting the health of our rivers and watersheds. Their presence benefits more than 130 other species, including criticallyendangered, prey deficient Southern Resident Orcas. H.R. 3144 is based on misinformation, fails to recognize the important role wild salmon and steelhead play for Northwest communities and ecosystems, and would severely undermine ongoing and muchneeded protection efforts. If passed into law, H.R. 3144 would reverse the May 2016 U.S. District court decision that found the federal agencies’ most recent plan for managing federal dams on the Columbia and Snake Rivers violated the Endangered Species Act and the National Environmental Policy Act and would not protect wild salmon and steelhead from extinction. Three different federal judges have now rejected five consecutive Columbia Basin salmon plans over the past two decades. This failure has cost regional energy consumers and federal taxpayers more than $10 billion without recovering a single endangered salmon population. H.R. 3144 would lock in the inadequate and illegal 2014 Columbia Basin Biological Opinion, fatally stifle the court order to complete a full, fair NEPA environmental review, and prevent an increase in spring ‘‘spill’’ (water releases over the tops of dams to improve survival of outmigrating juvenile salmon) beginning in 2018. Ordered by the court earlier this year and being collaboratively planned by the parties to the litigation this summer, spill is widely recognized by experts as our most effective immediate tool to help endangered salmon while our region develops a new, legally valid, scientificallycredible plan. Salmon and fishing advocates share the frustration of many stakeholders with this history of costly and ineffective plans to revive culturally and economically important salmon populations in the ColumbiaSnake Basin. We are ready to work with others in the region to develop a plan that protects and recovers endangered salmon and steelhead while also meeting the needs of affected interests. H.R. 3144, however, will not move our region in that direction; rather it will move us away from a real opportunity to craft a durable, responsible solution. Thank you again for your decision not to sponsor H.R. 3144. We hope that you will actively oppose it and do everything you can to prevent this bill from becoming law.

Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER ). Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman’s courtesy in permitting me to speak on this and the elements that he just put into the RECORD . These are tough issues. The Bonneville Dam, one of the elements here, is in my district. I have been involved with these issues, literally, for decades. I have watched the giveandtake. Part of what we are facing today is the legacy of our moving in to create the Bonneville system without really knowing what we were doing when we started. There was a rich fisheries existence. Rumor had it that you could actually—people claimed you could walk across the backs of the salmon when they were spawning. The dams implemented, good for producing energy, not good for the fishery system, both in terms of the river and the marine ecosystem that depends on it. And it is not just the commitment to the Endangered Species Act and the environment. We are dealing here with commitments to Native Americans who have been illserved with their treaty rights. That is one of the reasons why we have litigated this for years, because they had valid treaty rights as a sovereign people, and the United States violated them; and only recently, under the pressure of litigation, were we responsive to their needs and some changes were made. Now, it is not just the current Federal judge. We have had objections through the Judiciary looking at some of the compromises that people have made. I understand the political pressures. I watch it in terms of the economy, in terms of transportation, in terms of Native Americans, in terms of fish and wildlife, in terms of agricultural interests. These are difficult and troublesome efforts, and there is no good response because we have made more commitments than the mighty Columbia River can deliver on. We treat it like a machine, and we have difficulty reconciling it. The judge in the case has found that the plan was wanting and has put in place a system for the new BiOp. This legislation is not going to stop litigation. If it passes, I will guarantee you, we will be back in court, and I think there is a very strong likelihood that, rather than moving it forward, it will delay it. Look at the record in terms of the opponents to approaches like this on how they have fared in court. It is not a good record. Now, I would suggest strongly that we are better served by allowing this process to go forward. Respect NEPA; respect the Endangered Species Act; respect the process that is put in place; and look at all the options. Now, I am not saying tomorrow we are going to tear down Snake River dams, but there are lots of options short of dam removal. When we start taking things off the table, we limit our ability to meet our responsibilities under the law and under our treaty obligations and, candidly, in what is going to be in the best interest of solving a very complex issue. I would hope that we would reject this legislation not only because I think it is illadvised—I think it undercuts the environment, our obligations to the Native Americans, that it will delay it rather than accelerate it—but I think it provides a precedent that we don’t want to have. I don’t think we want to have Congress intervening in the midst of these processes. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. GRIJALVA. I yield the gentleman from Oregon an additional 1 minute. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, when I look at what this Congress— particularly, under Republican rule— has done trying to intervene to supersede science, to have political decisions on things that really deserve balance with the environment, with treaty rights, dealing with the longterm perspective, it is not a very encouraging record. I strongly urge that we side with environmentalist groups, with our two Governors, with a number of us in the delegation to allow this process to work and not undercut it and put us back in court. If so, I will guarantee that we will be back here next year and the year after that with things worse rather than better. b1530 Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, as one of the eight Tribes that endorse this bill said: The BiOp exceeds requirements established by the courts and by the ESA, and yet plaintiffs want more. The court should uphold the 2008 BiOp. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. NEWHOUSE ), speaking on behalf of the eight Tribes that endorse this in his area. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the Natural Resources Committee for yielding time to me. Mr. Speaker, earlier this afternoon, I had the opportunity during debate on the rule to rise and speak about this bill, as well as the great coalition of constituents and stakeholders who have collaborated to support H.R. 3144. Some of the strongest voices are that of our local public utility districts and rural electric cooperatives across the Pacific Northwest, who have been immensely helpful in their advocacy and engagement of this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  a stack of letters and resolutions of support from these groups in Oregon, Idaho, and also my home State of Washington. I would like to express my sincere gratitude for their support as well. 
BLACHLY LANEELECTRIC COOP, Eugene, OR, March 1, 2018. Re Support H.R. 3144 to Protect the Northwest’s Economy, Environment, and ESA Listed Salmon. DEAR MEMBERS OF THE NORTHWEST CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION : BlachlyLane Electric Cooperative joins Northwest RiverPartners and our fellow northwest electric cooperatives in thanking you for your bipartisan opposition to misguided components of the President’s FY19 budget proposal related to the Bonneville Power Administration’s transmission assets and rates. We value that the delegation recognizes BPA’s transmission and power generation assets as a pillar of the Northwest economy and critical to our region’s carbonfree electric energy production, and your united concern for constituents in the region. 
Your bipartisan commitment to protecting BPA’s statutory mission and the longevity of the Federal Columbia River Power System allows us to ask you for support of H.R. 3144. The bill will protect the region’s access to renewable, carbon free, and reliable federal hydropower while mitigating hydropower impacts and protecting Endangered Species Act listed salmon. H.R. 3144 would allow the NEPA process to continue as the Court has ordered, with a comprehensive and transparent review of federal hydrosystem operations, while postponing costly and potentially harmful experimental spill and hydro operations in the interim. BPA faces uncertainty as escalating fish and wildlife costs and related litigation negatively impact its power rates. Keeping BPA sound and competitive serves to shield the agency from political attacks coming from outside the region. H.R. 3144 provides vital nearterm certainty by temporarily retaining the federal hydrosystem operations plan supported by both the Bush and Obama Administrations that was extensively vetted by independent scientists, only until an ongoing NEPA review process concludes in 2021. BPA estimates the Courtordered spill experiment could cost its power customers an estimated $40 million this year. NOAA Fisheries’ Science Center modeling shows this additional spill would provide little or no added benefits to protected juvenile salmon or returning adults. The costs of this experiment to our electric cooperative members are far too great, and the outcome to fish far too negative. If that isn’t enough, the spill operations will add 840,000 metric tons of carbon emissions by removing 815 megawatts of carbon free federal hydrosystem generation and replacing it with fossil fuels. This large loss of hydroelectric generation simply can’t be replaced by increasing efficiency, intermittent wind or solar resources. The Courtordered spill undermines Oregon and Washington’s progress toward our carbonreduction goals. Your support of H.R. 3144 will keep scientifically recognized ESAlisted salmon protection measures in place while allowing a rational, deliberative NEPA process to generate credible data for future potential dam operations and salmonmanagement strategies. H.R. 3144, contrary to critics’ statements, will simply allow for a muchneeded ‘‘time out’’ from over 20 years of litigation and allow the federal agencies to focus their limited resources on conducting the best NEPA process possible to comply with the court’s order. Also know that the region is not in agreement on the Courtordered 2018 spill operations. The federal Action Agencies (BPA, Army Corps, and Bureau of Reclamation), RiverPartners, Idaho, Montana, Confederated Tribes of the Colville, the Kootenai Tribe of Idaho, and the SalishKootenai tribe, have appealed the ruling to the Ninth Circuit. The Courtordered spill would abandon federal agencies’ best science and expertise in favor of dictating from the bench an operational ‘‘experiment’’ for the complex and crucial federal hydrosystem. That is not a proper role for any Court. We urge members of the delegation to support this commonsense bill with a continued bipartisin spirit. Your leadership is imperative to keep BPA’s hydropower generation assets affordable and to improve the agency’s competitiveness as quickly as possible. Without a competitive product to transmit over the wires, BPA will be challenged to meet its important statutory obligations of providing power and protecting fish and wildlife. Passage of H.R. 3144 is critical to help avoid BPA’s current perilous trajectory and further harm to the fisheries. Modest, practical action now will help BPA avoid the economic cliff it faces. To wait and later bail out the agency could impose enormous costs on regional ratepayers and taxpayers. Thank you for your time and thoughtful consideration of one of the most crucial issues facing the Northwest in years. Sincerely, JOEJARVIS , General Manager. 
NORTHERN LIGHTS , INC., Sagle, ID, March 9, 2018. DEAR SENATOR RISCH: Northern Lights, Inc. strongly supports H.R. 3144, bipartisan legislation that protects the Northwest’s access to renewable, clean and reliable federal hydropower while mitigating hydropower impacts and protecting ESA listed salmon. We urge you to advance H.R. 3144 as part of the Fiscal Year 2018 appropriations bill or any other legislation considered this Congress. BPA is in a precarious financial situation with a rate trajectory that is unsustainable. If this unsettling trend continues, BPA will not be competitive with alternative power supply choices in the region when it seeks customer contract renewal in 2028. While we greatly value the carbon free, flexible hydropower resources that BPA provides, as an electric cooperative, we have a responsibility to deliver power to our members at an affordable rate whether that comes from BPA or elsewhere. Although BPA’s power rates are influenced by a variety of costdrivers, one of the largest variables is fish and wildlife program costs. Along these lines, we are particularly concerned about ESAdriven litigation over federal hydro system operations that has plagued our region for almost 20 years. Most recently, as a result of legal proceedings in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon, a federal judge has ordered a spill experiment that could cost BPA power customers an estimated $40 million just this year. Yet federal modeling shows that this additional spill would provide little or no added benefit to protected juvenile salmon or returning adults. This is particularly troubling to a consumerowned power community that remains committed to funding the largest mitigation for threatened species in the nation. As stewards of the Columbia River, it is our collective responsibility to get off the sidelines and identify practical solutions to tough problems. H.R. 3144 is just that, it would provide much needed relief from the endless litigation by temporarily keeping in place a 2014 biological opinion built on the best available science from two consecutive Administrations (Bush and Obama). We are pleased that this biological opinion has resulted in improved salmon survival at dams due to changes in operations and the installation of new fish passage technologies. Retaining the 2014 biological opinion also allows the federal agencies to focus on the courtordered NEPA environmental review process without being distracted by litigation. Let’s take a time out from the courtroom and rally around a practical solution. On behalf of Northern Lights, Inc. we urge you to support H.R. 3144. Sincerely, ANNIE TERRACCIANO , General Manager, Northern Lights, Inc. 
SALMON RIVER ELECTRIC COOPERATIVE , INC., Challis, ID, August 25, 2015. DEAR MEMBERS OF THE NORTHWEST CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION : This letter is submitted by Salmon River Electric Cooperative, Inc. We are a small rural electric cooperative located in central Idaho. We distribute electricity to 2700 electric accounts over eight hundred miles of distribution lines. Our economy is made up of ranching and agriculture, mining, recreation and tourism, and public land management. Ninety eight percent of the lands around us are public lands. This leaves very little tax base to operate our local economies. Low cost, clean, environmentally safe and carbon free, and reliable electricity has been and will remain critical to the lives of our member owners. We were pleased to see the congressional delegation recently join together in a bipartisan manner to oppose illadvised components of the President’s FY19 budget proposal related to the Bonneville Power Administration’s (‘‘BPA’’) transmission assets and rates. At a time defined by partisan rancor, it is refreshing that our elected officials are able to unite to protect constituents in the region and recognize that BPA’s transmission and power generation assets are the backbone of the Northwest economy and the mainstay of our region’s carbonfree electric energy production. This ongoing bipartisan commitment to protecting BPA’s statutory mission and the longevity of the Federal Columbia River Power System (‘‘FCRPS’’) is why we are asking you to support legislation introduced in the House (H.R. 3144) that would protect the region’s access to renewable, carbon free, and reliable federal hydropower while mitigating hydropower impacts and protecting Endangered Species Act (‘‘ESA’’) listed salmon. This commonsense legislation temporarily keeps in place a federal hydrosystem operations plan supported by both the Bush and Obama Administrations. and was extensively vetted by independent scientists, only until an ongoing NEPA review process is concluded in 2021. H.R. 3144 would allow the NEPA process to continue as the Court has ordered, with a comprehensive and transparent review of federal hydrosystem operations, while postponing costly and potentially harmful experimental spill and hydro operations in the interim. Sincerely, KENDIZES. 
BENTON PUD, March 13, 2018. Re Support H.R. 3144. DEARMEMBERS OF THE WASHINGTON STATE  CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION : On behalf of Benton PUD customers, we urge you to support H.R. 3144 that protects the hydro system and the benefits it brings to the region through clean, renewable and affordable power. H.R. 3144 provides relief in the endless litigation of federal hydro system operations by directing the federal agencies to implement the current Biological Opinion that has been vetted and supported by previous presidential administration’s top scientists and resulted in wild salmon numbers trending significantly upward due to changes in operations and the installation of new passage technologies. Over the years of the operation of the Federal Columbia River Power System (FCRPS), Northwest electric ratepayers have invested over $16 billion on infrastructure and fish enhancement efforts. We are appreciative of the countless efforts that have already been made within the FCRPS operations to improve juvenile fish passage survival. H.R. 3144 allows the court ordered NEPA process to continue with a comprehensive and transparent review of federal hydrosystem operations, while postponing costly and potentially harmful experimental spill operations in the interim. 
As Commissioners of public utilities located in the heart of the Northwest, we strongly believe that we can achieve our goal to balance the needs of healthy salmon and steelhead populations with the imperative to preserve a valuable hydropower system that is integral to our region’s quality of life. To do so, we must provide stability and certainty to management of the FCRPS and fish recovery efforts. The legislation is needed to protect the Snake River dams and the renewable, carbonfree, affordable and reliable hydropower provided to our customers and the customers across the region. Sincerely, COMMISSIONER BARRY  BUSH. COMMISSIONER LORI SANDERS . COMMISSIONER JEFFHALL.

POWER SYSTEM BIOLOGICAL OPINION  Whereas, Customers of Public Utility District No. 1 of Benton County, Washington, hereinafter referred to as ‘‘the District’’, receive 77 percent of their electricity from the Federal Columbia River Power System (FCRPS); and Whereas, Hydropower provides 70 percent of Washington State’s renewable, affordable and reliable electricity and 60 percent of the Pacific Northwest’s electricity with the majority of the power produced by the FCRPS; and Whereas, Hydroelectric dams also provide many benefits to the region, including flood control, navigation, irrigation, and recreation; and Whereas, Federal legislation requires the federal agencies responsible for the management of the FCRPS (Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), Army Corps of Engineers, Bureau of Reclamation) to operate the hydro system in compliance with the Biological Opinion (BiOp) approved by NOAA Fisheries in 2008/2010 and supplemented in 2014; and Whereas, The FCRPS BiOp has successfully improved fish runs including 97 percent of young salmon successfully making it past the dams proving that both dams and fish can coexist; and Whereas, BPA has spent $15.28 billion in total spending on infrastructure and fish mitigation projects since 1978; and Whereas, Despite the success of the current FCRPS BiOp, in March 2017, the United States District Court for the District of Oregon (Court) directed the federal agencies to undertake a comprehensive review of hydro operations under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and strongly urged the federal agencies to include analysis of the removal, bypass or breaching one or more of the four lower Snake River dams; and Whereas, H.R. 3144, ‘‘To provide for operations of the Federal Columbia River Power System pursuant to a certain operation plan for a specified period of time’’, was introduced in the United States House of Representatives to ensure the FCRPS BiOp remains in effect until 2022; Whereas, The federal legislation would continue federal hydro operations through September 30, 2022, or until the courtordered, comprehensive environmental NEPA process concludes, a new BiOp is in place, and judicial review is complete; and Whereas, The federal legislation would prohibit studies, plans or structural modifications at the dams which would impair hydroelectric power generation or navigation on the Columbia River. Now, therefore be it hereby resolved That the Commission of Public Utility District No. 1 of Benton County, Washington, (‘‘District’’) supports federal legislation H.R. 3144 introduced to ‘‘provide for operations of the Federal Columbia River Power System pursuant to a certain operation plan for a specified period of time’’; Be it further resolved that the District supports this legislation as it: 1. Offers a creative solution that is good for both listed salmon and the economy of the Northwest and Benton County. 2. Provides relief in the endless litigation of federal hydro system operations by directing the federal agencies to implement the current federal salmon plan, known as the 2014 Supplemental BiOp. This BiOp was vetted and supported by the previous presidential administrations’ top scientists and has resulted in wild salmon numbers trending significantly upward due to changes in operations and the installation of new passage technologies. 3. Provides time for the federal agencies to complete the courtordered NEPA environmental review process analyzing federal hydro system operations and focuses the general agencies limited resources on getting that process right. Without the legislation, the agencies would be compelled to author a new 2018 BiOp without the benefit of the new science and public input provided by the comprehensive NEPA review. 4. Avoids experiments or spill tests at the eight Columbia and Snake River dams, and studies and modifications at the dams which would restrict electrical generation, which would create uncertainties in BPA’s power costs and supply and raise Northwest electric customers’ rates. Adopted at an open meeting as required by law this 25th day of July, 2017. 
UNITED ELECTRIC CO OP INC ., Washington, DC, February 27, 2018. Re H.R. 3144 To provide for operations of the Federal Columbia Power System pursuant to a certain operation plan for a specified period of time, and for other purposes. DEAR SENATOR RISCH: On behalf of the membership of United Electric Coop, Inc. (United Electric), I am once again writing to seek your support to help proactively preserve the economic value of the Federal Columbia River Power System and its multiple uses: flood control, power generation, irrigation, navigation and commerce and recreation. United Electric serves 6,400 meters in portions of Minidoka and Cassia counties in Southern Idaho and purchases its wholesale power supply from the Bonneville Power Administration. As you know, the Bonneville Power Administration has been plagued by litigation over the biological opinion which has been vetted through three administrations and was updated in 2014 by the Obama Administration, referred to as the 2014 Supplemental Biological Opinion. Judges in Oregon have ignored science, the experts in the industry, and NOAA’s top scientists in what appears to be agenda driven rulings. This common sense legislation temporarily keeps in place the 2014 Biological Opinion’s hydro system operations and allows the court ordered NEPA process to continue with a comprehensive and transparent review, while postponing costly and potentially harmful experimental spill operations in the interim. Please see the attached Resolution adopted by the Board of Directors of United Electric in support of H.R. 3144. United Electric supports the proposed legislation and encourages you to join the bipartisan effort. H.R. 3144 is very important legislation to the Pacific Northwest’s public power, agriculture, inland port and business communities. Thank you, JOELG, General Manager.

Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, many advocates for the environmental lobby claim to be proscience, but it is clear that far too often they only rely on that science when it is convenient. The spill order mandated by this judge could have harmful effects on the very fish species the BiOp was created to protect, and yet my colleagues in opposition to this bill say that we are the ones trying to hurt the fish. Federal agencies and scientific experts warn of the risks these spill mandates can place on the fish. We should listen to these experts. We should support science. Now is not the time to be pushing ideology. Now is the time to be pushing proscience pragmatism to both save our salmon and save our dams. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. LOWENTHAL ), the ranking member of the Natural Resources Committee. Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, endangered salmon are not the only species that H.R. 3144 puts at risk. By removing critical protections for salmon runs, this bill would also push one of our most treasured whale species closer to extinction. As pointed out by Congresswoman TSONGAS , the Southern Resident killer whales are critically endangered. In fact, there are only 76 of them that are left. These whales depend upon healthy and abundant salmon populations for survival. More than 50 percent of their diet comes from Chinook salmon in the Columbia River basin. Without access to these wild salmon populations, Southern Resident killer whales are literally starving to death. In order to save both of these iconic species, we cannot undermine important habitat restoration efforts or improvements in dam operations, both of which are essential to promoting survival in the river systems where these salmon spawn. Unfortunately, H.R. 3144 would do just the opposite. In addition, the Southern Resident killer whales provide immense economic benefits to the Pacific Northwest. Whale watching is a major tourist attraction in Washington and has contributed an additional $65 million to the State’s economy each year. Losing these killer whales would not only have an irreversible effect on the marine ecosystem, it would be a huge blow to the tourism industry and to the local businesses that rely on their survival. H.R. 3144 may be known as the Salmon Extinction Act, but, frankly, we should tack on Southern Resident killer whales to that name. Without access to waters beyond the Snake River dams, salmon populations will continue to plummet, and without salmon, the Southern Resident killer whales will die. The fate of both these species rests in our hands. I urge my colleagues to stand with me and stand with the whales and vote against H.R. 3144. Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, NOAA did a study which simply said that the hatchery production of salmon in this area more than offsets any loss that comes from the dams. So even though we have this issue of an endangered species trying to eat another endangered species, which one are we going to support. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. LAMBORN ), who is a member of our committee who understands this particular issue. Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Utah for his leadership. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3144, introduced by Mrs. MCMORRIS RODGERS of Washington, was considered by the subcommittee I chair, Water, Power, and Oceans. It looks to provide certainty and reliability to the Federal Columbia River Power System in the Pacific Northwest. This system includes four large dams in the lower Snake River in Washington State that provide the region with a number of benefits, including renewable emissionfree hydropower. Despite all of these benefits, the power system has been mired in third party litigation for decades. Some litigious groups have focused their efforts on removing the four dams in the Lower Snake under the false assumption that it will improve endangered species. In reality, however, these dams already have survival rates for salmon in the upper 90th percentile. Most recently, a Federal court ordered roundtheclock spillover of the Columbia and Snake River dams that went into effect last week. These additional spills will do little to help the fish species, and in reality, do nothing more than leave the region’s ratepayers to foot a spill surcharge estimated to cost up to $40 million per year. This bill ensures that the power system is operated in accordance with the current operations plans until certain reasonable targets are met. It was found to be legally and scientifically sound by the Obama administration, and has resounding support among stakeholders in the region. We need to ensure that science is guiding the operations of the power system and not judicial orders and special interest ideologies. We need a consensus approach by local stakeholders, not a mandate imposed by judicial fiat. This bipartisan bill is supported by trade unions, the Farm Bureau, regional stakeholders, and a number of public utility districts. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this good piece of legislation. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from California (Mr. HUFFMAN ), vice ranking member of the Natural Resources Committee. Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arizona for yielding me time. Mr. Speaker, today we are being asked to pass yet another bill that undermines the Endangered Species Act and accelerates the extinction of our Nation’s fish and wildlife. Specifically, H.R. 3144, the Salmon Extinction Act, undermines protections for several runs of wild salmon and steelhead in the Pacific Northwest. The Northwest’s iconic salmon runs are extremely important to commercial, recreational, and Tribal fishing interests across the country. My Republican colleagues are pushing this bill even though the region’s salmon runs are currently at crisis levels. Recently, we have even seen reporting that, for the first time, Federal scientists who were surveying Northwest salmon populations came up with empty nets. And yet, here we are today, advancing a bill that will do nothing but accelerate our Nation’s existing salmon declines. The bill also represents a troubling attack on the legal process. If enacted, it would overturn legally sound court decisions simply because the bill’s sponsors don’t like them. Instead of following the law, this bill forcibly mandates the use of an outdated illegal salmon recovery plan for the Federal Columbia River Power System. The recovery plan in question has clearly been found by the courts to violate the law and the Endangered Species Act. It is illegal, and Congress, through this bill, would be saying: Do it anyway. I should note that this bill also undermines one of our Nation’s other bedrock environmental laws, the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, by barring a host of actions that could potentially recover this region’s salmon runs, which are currently, again, on the brink of extinction. The sponsor of this bill and I do agree on one thing, however. When talking about this bill, Representative MCMORRISRODGERS recently said that dams and fish can coexist, and I too think that is possible. 
The debate here is not about dams versus no dams. The debate is about striking the appropriate balance between responsible hydropower development and sound fisheries protection. For too long, there has been an imbalance when we consider these issues. Our country built thousands of dams in the 20th century before we even realized the harm that can be caused to our Nation’s fisheries. So today, we are left with many legacy, lowvalue dams that don’t justify their cost and their impacts to our Nation’s fishery and natural resources. So as we consider what to do about these older, lowvalue dams, our decision making must be guided by the best available science and a consideration of all available options, not what politicians in Congress want. Unfortunately, this bill takes us in the wrong direction by blocking responsive sciencebased fisheries management. It would actually lock in a disastrous status quo until at least the year 2022; a status quo that is expensive, illegal, and inadequate; an approach that causes great harm to wild salmon, struggling fishing communities, Tribes, and energy consumers. The status quo is not working. This bill says: Keep doing it anyway. It is time for Federal agencies to pursue new, innovative solutions that are better for both fisheries and hydropower generation. This bill pushes a onesided divisive approach that will only cause further harm. That is why it is opposed by the Governors of both Washington and Oregon, by Tribal interests, by hundreds of businesses that depend on healthy salmon runs, and also by numerous conservation organizations. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’ Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GOSAR ). Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bill offered by Congresswoman MCMORRIS RODGERS . This is a great piece of legislation that supports smart hydroelectric operation, a stable and integrated energy grid, and above all, reinforces that the United States Congress has a vested interest in ensuring it, Congress, rather than the judiciary, promulgates Federal policy. H.R. 3144 keeps in place the operational plan, developed by consensus through multiple agency processes and based in the best available science, for four dams in Washington State which have wrongfully come under siege recently due to an arbitrary court order by a judge in Oregon. In general, continuing to lean on hydropower as a longterm component of our Nation’s electrical grid is an absolute nobrainer. Hydropower is a clean source of energy, and its reliability and cost effectiveness are just a few of the reasons it enjoys the stature it has today. It needs to maintain that stature, including the requirement of careful sciencebased policy crafting when changes to hydroelectric policy are in question if we are to guarantee a reliable energy future for our country. But if overzealous special interest groups have their way, we would immediately begin deconstructing and destroying all our dams across the country. To their mindset, dams are not natural parts of the landscape and, therefore, represent a most serious threat to the planet. To them, changes to the natural landscape are anathema, despite the fact that the only real constant on our planet and in the environment is change itself. The judges’s order in this case in question is, unfortunately, in keeping with this very same mindset. This is not a stretch to say because he, in fact, fails to rely on the only available and complete science that informed past decisions concerning the Federal Columbia River Power System. These past decisions, keep in mind, included the Obama administration’s greenlighting of the current operation plan in 2014 that the judge seeks to overturn with his spill order. What the judge did in this case was to take it upon himself to depart from agency consensus based on sound science and ordered changes to the operation plan of the power system just because he wanted to. He ordered this major policy change first, which will cost electricity customers in the region $40 million annually, by the way, and pegged future changes to the outcome of a NEPA review which is just getting underway. But the only grounds for so radical a policy change would be if the NEPA review in question called for those changes when it is finally finished. The judge doesn’t know what the outcome of the NEPA review will be, obviously, because it is still being conducted. b1545 He made his decision without basis, and now the country is supposed to pay for it. Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle constantly rail about how they oppose bills and proposals and prevent the National Environmental Policy Act review process from being carried out. H.R. 3144 also allows continuation of a courtordered national NEPA review process. If my colleagues practice what they preach, then they would support this bill as it allows the NEPA review process to be carried out. Congress has an obligation to remind everyone involved that we are the constitutionally authorized policymakers and that we choose to make policy and require agency decisionmaking on the basis of sound science. This bill will keep the current operation plan in place until 2022, unless the NEPA process review finishes first, at which point the NEPAsupported plan would commence. This bill abides by the proper statutory NEPA process, even though the judge’s order fails to do that. As stated by the Public Power Council, H.R. 3144 allows a courtordered NEPA process to continue without avoiding a costly and potentially harmful spill experiment. The fear is that without this legislation, a spill regime will be put in place that increases regional power costs while providing no apparent benefit to the fish it purports to help. What is perhaps most crucial to keep in mind during this whole debate is the broader significance of this bill to any Member who has a major public works infrastructure operating in their district. Without this bill, it is possible that this judge’s terrible precedent could stand. At that point, nothing stands in the way of an activist judge across the country waking up one day and deciding to put a halt to a whole slew of public works infrastructures which makes this country tick. H.R. 3144 is absolutely necessary to establish congressional intent. Sound process must win the day over the capriciousness of any given activist judge or his political leanings. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  letters of support from the local public utility districts on behalf of H.R. 3144. 
PENDOREILLE COUNTY  PUBLIC UTILITY DISTRICT , Newport, WA, April 24, 2018. Hon. CATHY MCMORRIS RODGERS , Hon. DANNEWHOUSE , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR REPRESENTATIVES MCMORRIS RODGERS AND NEWHOUSE : On behalf of the Public Utility District No. 1 of Pend Oreille County we greatly appreciate the support you have shown for hydropower and, more specifically, the Federal Columbia River Power System (FCRPS) with the recent introduction of H.R. 3144. This bill supports the hydro system and the many benefits it brings to the region through renewable, reliable and affordable power. Despite the success of the current FCRPS Biological Opinion (BiOp), the plan has been rejected with a ruling that all options need to be reviewed including breaching or removing one or more of the four Snake River dams. Your bill provides relief to the endless litigation of federal hydro system operations by directing the federal agencies to implement the current BiOp as adopted in 2014. The current BiOp is based on the best available science, has been vetted by stakeholders and was formally approved by the Obama administration. Implementation of the BiOp has successfully increased salmon runs due to operational requirements within, and the installation of new fish passage technologies. The Bonneville Power Administration has spent over $15 billion on infrastructure and fish mitigation projects since 1978. These improvements and mitigation measures are paid for by our customers through their electric bills. Their bills are already higher by at least 15 percent for fish mitigation programs. The ‘‘spill test’’ ordered by the judge will be an additional cost that will result in higher electric bills for Northwest families and businesses and likely to be more detrimental to the fish runs than helpful. Your legislation will bring an end to the wasteful activities. This is particularly important for Pend Oreille PUD as our largest industrial customer Ponderay Newsprint is a large consumer of BPA power for its operations. The 
unnecessary spending and additional mitigation costs continue to put jobs at stake in our rural communities. We appreciate your leadership on this issue with the introduction of H.R. 3144 and urge other legislators to follow your lead. Sincerely, F. COLIN WILLENBROCK , General Manager.

This bill supports the hydro system and the many benefits it brings to the region through renewable, reliable and affordable power. Despite the success of the current FCRPS Biological Opinion (BiOp), Judge Simon, U.S. Western District, Court of Oregon, rejected the plan and ruled all options need to be reviewed including breaching or removing one or more of the four Snake River dams.

Sincerely, DAVID R. T RAMBLIE , General Manager. 
DOUGLAS COUNTY PUBLIC  UTILITY DISTRICT , East Wenatchee, WA, April 24, 2018. Hon. DANNEWHOUSE , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR REPRESENTATIVE NEWHOUSE : On be half of Douglas County PUD we greatly appreciate the support you have shown for hydropower and, more specifically, the Federal Columbia River Power System (FCRPS) with the recent introduction of H.R. 3144. This bill supports the hydro system and the many benefits it brings to the region through renewable, reliable and affordable power. Despite the success of the current FCRPS Biological Opinion (BiOp), Judge Simon, U.S. Western District, Court of Oregon, rejected the plan and ruled all options need to be reviewed including breaching or removing one or more of the four Snake River dams. Your bill provides relief to the endless litigation of federal hydro system operations by directing the federal agencies to implement the current BiOp as adopted in 2014. The current BiOp is based on the best available science, has been vetted by stakeholders and was formally approved by the Obama administration. Implementation of the BiOp has successfully increased salmon runs due to operational requirements within, and the installation of new fish passage technologies. The Bonneville Power Administration has spent over $15 billion on infrastructure and fish mitigation projects since 1978. These improvements and mitigation measures are paid for by our customers through their electric bills. Their bills are already higher by at least 15 percent for fish mitigation programs. The ‘‘spill test’’ ordered by the judge will be an additional cost that will result in higher electric bills for Northwest families and businesses and likely to be more detrimental to the fish runs than helpful. Your legislation will bring an end to the wasteful activities. We appreciate your leadership on this issue with the introduction of H.R. 3144 and urge other legislators to follow your lead. Sincerely, GARYR. IVORY , General Manager. 
REPRESENTATIVE NEWHOUSE : I wanted to reiterate to you one more time how important the bill you cosponsored, H.R. 3144, is to Franklin PUD and our customers. We hope the bill gains positive traction this week and advances to the House Floor. Your bill provides relief to the endless litigation of federal hydro system operations by directing the federal agencies to implement the current BiOp as adopted in 2014. The current BiOp is based on the best available science, has been vetted by stakeholders and was formally approved by the Obama administration. Implementation of the BiOp has successfully increased salmon runs due to operational requirements within, and the installation of new fish passage technologies. The Bonneville Power Administration has spent over $15 billion on infrastructure and fish mitigation projects since 1978. These improvements and mitigation measures are paid for by our customers through their electric bills. For Franklin PUD customers, their bills are already higher by at least 15– 18 percent for fish mitigation programs. The ‘‘spill test’’ ordered by the judge will be an additional cost that will result in higher electric bills for Northwest families, businesses, and Franklin PUD customers, and is likely to be more detrimental to the fish runs than helpful. Your legislation will bring an end to the wasteful activities. We appreciate your leadership on this issue with the introduction of H.R. 3144 and urge other legislators to follow your lead. Thanks again for coming to the TriCities this month to hear our customers issues regarding ag, irrigation and fish, that are all impacted by the continuance of this spill that is not required. DEBBIE BONEHARRIS , Sr. Manager, Public Affairs, Franklin PUD. 
POWER SYSTEM BIOLOGICAL OPINION  Recitals 1. The state of Washington is the leading U.S. producer of hydropower, routinely contributing more than onefourth of the nation’s total net hydroelectric generation; 2. Hydropower accounts for between two thirds and fourfifths of Washington’s electricity generation, providing renewable and inexpensive electricity to the region’s farms, homes, businesses, schools and industries; 3. The Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation are responsible for the management of the Federal Columbia River Power System (FCRPS) in compliance with the Biological Opinion (BiOp) approved by NOAA Fisheries in 2008/2010 and supplemented in 2014; 4. The FCRPS BiOp has helped to improve fish runs, including 97% of young salmon successfully making it past the federal dams, demonstrating that both renewable hydropower and fish can coexist; 5. Despite the success of the current FCRPS BiOp, in March 2017, the United States Court for the District of Oregon directed the federal agencies to undertake a comprehensive review of hydro operations under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and strongly urged the federal agencies to include analysis of the removal, bypass or breaching one of more of the four lower Snake River hydropower dams; 6. Bipartisan legislation, H.R. 3144, provides a creative solution to the endless litigation over federal hydro system operations by directing the federal agencies to implement the current federal salmon plan, known as the 2014 Supplemental BiOp. That plan: a. Was vetted and supported by the Obama Administration’s top scientists; b. Has resulted in improved young salmon survival at the federal dams due to changes in operations and the installation of new fish passage technologies; c. Restored thousands of acres of habitat in rivers, the estuary and floodplains for salmon spawning and rearing; and d. Would allow federal hydropower operations to continue through September 30, 2022 or until the courtordered, comprehensive environmental NEPA process concludes, a new BiOp is in place and judicial review is complete. 7. Without the legislation, the federal agencies would be compelled to author a new 2018 BiOp without the benefit of the new science and public input provided by the comprehensive NEPA review; and 8. H.R. 3144 was introduced by Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R–WA) and cosponsored by Rep. Dan Newhouse (R–WA), Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler (R–WA), Rep. Kurt Schrader (D–OR) and Rep. Greg Walden (R–OR). Now therefore, be it resolved by the Commission of Public Utility District No. 2 of Grant County, Washington, that Grant PUP supports H.R. 3144, and applauds the cosponsors of this bipartisan legislation as it: Offers a creative solution that is good for both salmon, renewable hydropower and the economy of the Northwest. Provides relief in the endless litigation of the federal hydro system. Provides time for the federal agencies to complete the courtordered NEPA environmental review process. Avoids experiments, modifications or spill tests at the eight federal Columbia and Snake River dams, which could have the potential to unnecessarily restrict renewable electric generation, create uncertainties in BPAss power costs and supply, and raise Northwest customers’ electric rates. Passed and approved by the Commission of Public Utility District No. 2 of Grant County, Washington this 24 day of October 2017. RESOLUTION OF THE BENTON REA B OARD OF  TRUSTEES  
SUPPORTING H .R. 3144 FEDERAL LEGISLATION AD DRESSING THE FEDERAL COLUMBIA RIVER  
POWER SYSTEM BIOLOGICAL OPINION  Whereas, Members of Benton Rural Electric Association receive 86 percent of their electricity from the Federal Columbia River Power System (FCRPS); and Whereas, Hydropower provides 70 percent of Washington state’s clean affordable and reliable electricity and 60 percent of the Pacific Northwest’s electricity with the majority of the power produced by the FCRPS; and 
Whereas, Hydroelectric dams also provide many benefits to the region, including flood control, navigation, irrigation, and recreation: and Whereas, Federal legislation requires the federal agencies responsible for the management of the FCRPS to operate the hydro system in compliance with the Biological Opinion (BiOp) approved by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Fisheries in 2008/2010 and supplemented in 2014, and Whereas, This BiOp was vetted and supported by the previous presidential administrations’ top scientists and has resulted in wild salmon numbers trending significantly upward due to changes in operations and the installation of new passage technologies, and Whereas, The FCRPS BiOp has successfully improved fish runs including 97% of young salmon successfully making it past the dams proving that both dams and fish can coexist; and Whereas, Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) has spent $15.28 billion in total spending on infrastructure and fish mitigation projects since 1978; and Whereas, Despite the success of the current FCRPS BiOp, in March 2017, the United States District Court for the District of Oregon directed the federal agencies to undertake a comprehensive review of hydro operations under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and strongly urged the federal agencies to include analysis of the removal, bypass or breaching one or more of the four lower Snake River dams; and Whereas, H.R. 3144, ‘‘To provide for operations of the Federal Columbia River Power System pursuant to a certain operation plan for a specified period of time’’, was introduced in the United States House of Representatives, and Whereas, The federal legislation would continue federal hydro operations through September 30, 2022 or until the courtordered, comprehensive environmental NEPA process concludes, a new BiOp is in place, and judicial review is complete, and Whereas, The federal legislation would prohibit studies, plans or structural modifications at the dams which would impair hydroelectric power generation or navigation on the Columbia River; and Whereas, The federal legislation offers a creative solution that is good for both listed salmon and the economy of the communities served by Benton Rural Electric Association, and provides relief in the endless litigation of federal hydro system operations by directing the federal agencies to implement the current federal salmon plan, known as the 2014 Supplemental BiOp; and Whereas, The federal legislation provides time for the federal agencies to complete the courtordered NEPA environmental review process analyzing federal hydro system operations and focuses the general agencies limited resources on getting that process right. Whereas, without the legislation, the agencies would be compelled to author a new 2018 BiOp without the benefit of the new science and public input provided by the comprehensive NEPA review, and avoids experiments or spill tests at the eight Columbia and Snake dams, and studies and modifications at the dams which would restrict electrical generation, which would create uncertainties in BPA’s power costs and supply and raise Northwest electric customers’ rates. Now, therefore be it resolved that the Board of Trustees of Benton Rural Electric Association supports the passage of H.R. 3144 this July 26, 2017.

Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I want to speak to another problem and issue with this bill that one of my colleagues brought up in his statement, and that is the great harm it will cause to the Tribal interests in the Pacific Northwest. Native people of the Pacific Northwest ceded most of their ancestral homeland to the United States in exchange for the right to catch salmon and steelhead at accustomed places. The Federal Government has a long history of failing to protect these fishing rights. If enacted, H.R. 3144 would further harm Tribal fisheries which are a critically important source of food. They are of great cultural and religious significance to the Tribes. Just this week, the Nez Perce Tribe contacted our committee to urge us to reject H.R. 3144. I think Congress should heed this call and reject this piece of legislation. Mr. Speaker, the concerns have been laid out by the people who have spoken against this legislation. Essentially, this legislation, H.R. 3144, violates bedrock environmental laws. Those concerns have been stated by Members who have spoken against the legislation. It harms businesses. It hurts the Tribes in the Northwest. It is an attack on the legal process, and, in the long term, it will hurt ratepayers. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on H.R. 3144, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am very happy to be here to present this particular bill, or at least sum up on this, especially as our good friend Mr. Todd Ungerecht has done so much for this particular bill and it is going to be his last time on the floor with us. So I appreciate all of his help on this. He is returning back to his native State of Washington where he clearly realizes how important this bill is. Mr. Speaker, this bill has support via policy from Washington, total support for the bill from Idaho and Montana, as well as eight other Tribes that live in this area, as well as the National Association of Counties, the American Farm Bureau Federation, United Power Trades Organization, National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, National Electrical Contractors Association, Public Power Council, Washington Association of Wheat Growers, and scores of other individuals. I include in the RECORD a complete list of organizations that support this bill as well as letters that support this legislation.

PUBLIC POWER COUNCIL  March 16, 2018 Re Support for H.R. 3144—To provide for operations of the Federal Columbia River Power System pursuant to a certain operation plan for a specified time. DEAR MEMBERS OF THE NORTHWEST CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION : The Public Power Council (PPC) is a not for profit association that represents about 100 consumerowned electric utilities in the Pacific Northwest on issues regarding the Federal Columbia River Power System (FCRPS). As purchasers of power from the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), PPC members and their customers pay for a large share of the region’s fish and wildlife mitigation costs. I write today in support of H.R. 3144, a bill that would stabilize a portion of these costs while the administrative process proceeds in the region. BPA is on the precipice of a serious financial struggle created by consistent increases in its power rates over the past decade combined with a simultaneous drop in the market price of other power options in the West. As utilities begin to choose lessercost options elsewhere, BPA will not have the requisite customer base to fund all its statutory obligations, including regional fish and wildlife efforts. Without serious action to stabilize rates, BPA will struggle in the near future to recover its costs, putting all of its programs at risk. An important part of the challenge facing BPA is the volatility of the costs of meeting its fish and wildliferelated obligations. H.R. 3144 would offer important assistance in this respect by temporarily keeping in place a federal hydro operations plan (approved by multiple Administrations) through the 2021 completion of an ongoing review under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Upon completion of the NEPA process, it is expected that the legislation would effectively expire and the NEPAsupported plan for the federal hydro system would commence. H.R. 3144 allows the courtordered NEPA process to continue while avoiding a costly and potentially harmful spill experiment. In addition to its estimated $40 million annual cost to regional electricity customers, NOAA Fisheries’ Science Center modeling does not show appreciable benefits to salmon and steelhead from this operation. Higher levels of spill can harm fish from increased gas saturation in the water. The fear is that, without this legislation, a spill regime will be put in place that increases regional power costs while providing no apparent benefit to the fish it purports to help. Another threatening aspect to the proposed spill experiment is that it would further limit the operational flexibility of the hydropower system that is essential to reliably meet electricity demand in the region and integrate other renewable power resources. Further, it is expected that much of the carbonfree generation eliminated by this experiment will be replaced by fossil fuels, greatly increasing regional carbon emissions, running counter to carbonreduction goals. Your support for this bill can help keep the region’s hydropower affordable and can assist in stabilizing BPA during precarious times. Urgent action on H.R. 3144 will resonate for years in maintaining a renewable, flexible, and carbonfree energy resource that serves as the region’s economic backbone. Thank you for your consideration. Sincerely, SCOTT CORWIN , Executive Director. MASON COUNTY  PUBLIC UTILITY DISTRICT 3, Shelton, WA, April 23, 2018. Hon. DANNEWHOUSE , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARCONGRESSMAN NEWHOUSE : Thank you for your support of federal, state and local agencies that provide costbased, carbon free energy to customers throughout the Pacific Northwest. Specifically, we thank you for your strong defense of the Bonneville Power Administration and its partners in the Federal Base System. We at Mason PUD 3 applaud your efforts, and those of others, who introduced HR 3144 to protect the viability and value of the Columbia River hydropower system. We’re pleased that HR 3144 affirms the jurisdiction of the 2014 Federal Biological Opinion for a balanced approach to managing the Columbia for fish and hydropower. We are concerned, as are others who depend on the river for their livelihoods, about the increased role of the courts in controlling this mighty resource. Management of the river by appointed judges is precedentsetting. It bypasses science, the experts who collaboratively wrote the Biological Opinion, and is not in the best interests of our customers. PUD 3 is disappointed in a federal court ruling earlier this month that will result in an experimental water spill program at Columbia and Snake River dams. This costly experiment is aimed at determining if sending more water through dam spillways, instead of using it for power generation, will help the passage of salmon in the Columbia River Basin. The Northwest Power & Conservation Council notes in its ‘‘2016 Columbia River Basin Fish and Wildlife Program Costs Report’’ that public power customers in the Pacific Northwest paid $621.5 million for recovery and restoration efforts. Just over $7 million of that came from customers of Mason PUD 3 (based on our proportionate share of the Federal Base System). To further burden our customers, and other public power customers in the region, with the cost of an experimental spill which has uncertain results, is an unjust judicial abuse of those who we strive to protect. Your bill, HR 3144, will give much needed relief to public power customers in a region that, through its wholesale power rates, fully pays its way for the operation of the Federal Base System. Further, through the directed use of the 2014 Federal Biological Opinion, it places management of the river in the realm of science, not speculation. We thank you for your support and protection of the natural resources of the Pacific Northwest. If you wish to communicate with us on this matter, please contact us at any time. Sincerely, ANNETTE CREEKPAUM , Manager, Mason PUD 3. 
ASOTIN COUNTY  PUBLIC UTILITY DISTRICT , Clarkston, WA. Hon. DANNEWHOUSE , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR REPRESENTATIVE NEWHOUSE : We are writing to thank you for your support of hydropower and the Federal Columbia River Power System (FCRPS) with the recent introduction of—H.R. 3144. As an electric utility whose customers are dependent upon reliable and affordable power, this bill supports the hydro system and the many benefits it brings to the region as a renewable resource. Your bill provides relief to the endless litigation of federal hydro system operations by directing the federal agencies to implement the current BiOp as adopted in 2014. The current BiOp is based on the best available science and has been vetted by stakeholders. Implementation of the BiOp has successfully increased salmon runs due to operational requirements within, and the installation of new fish passage technologies. Despite the success of the current FCRPS BiOp, the judge’s ruling rejecting the plan will add costs to the over $15 billion the Bonneville Power Administration has spent on infrastructure and fish mitigation projects since 1978. These improvements and mitigation measures are paid for by our customers through their electric bills and the ‘‘spill test’’ ordered by the judge will be an additional cost that will result in higher electric bills for everyone. Your legislation will bring an end to the wasteful activities and we appreciate your leadership on this issue with the introduction of H.R. 3144. Sincerely, Asotin County PUD Board of Commissioners: DONNUXOLL , President. JUDYRIDGE, VicePresident. GREGMCCALL, Secretary. 
COWLITZ PUD, Longview, WA, April 23, 2018. Re: H.R. 3144. Hon. DANNEWHOUSE , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARREPRESENTATIVE NEWHOUSE : This let ter is submitted by Cowlitz PUD, serving roughly 50,000 electric customers located on or near the mighty Columbia River. The District purchases approximately 90% of its power supply from BPA, which is sourced primarily from the Federal Columbia River Power System (FCRPS). We believe the 2014 BiOp is the best solution and we believe H.R. 3144 puts that solution in place. We appreciate your leadership on H.R. 3144 and urge other legislators to follow your lead. Sincerely, STEVEN D. K ERN, General Manager, Cowlitz PUD. 
COWLITZ PUD, Longview, WA, April 23, 2018. Re: H.R. 3144. Hon. DANNEWHOUSE , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR REPRESENTATIVE NEWHOUSE : I write you this letter individually supporting H.R. 3144. The 50,000 customers I represent continue to be impacted by interests other than their own. The Federal Columbia River Power System (FCRPS) has been bought and paid for by electric customers but is now being run from the bench of our 9th District court rather than the labs and control rooms of scientists and system operators. Experimental spill operations and targeted political outcomes have no place in the river system that powers our homes, underpins our economy, and funds our fish recovery. I appreciate your leadership. Sincerely, DENADIAMOND OTT, Cowlitz PUD Commissioner—District #1.

Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, here is the bottom line for this particular piece of legislation: States agree to it. There are nine Tribes in this area. Eight of them totally support this particular bill. The Obama administration created a biological opinion which endorsed the ESA and was legal with the ESA. A judge decided to change all of that and ordered a spill with no apparent rationale to it. Mr. Speaker, there is no one over here who hates salmon. We are not trying to kill them all. Heaven knows, the only way I would like to kill salmon is if I am consuming them myself. However, in 2011, another spill took place on this particular river which had the process of actually killing this endangered species that was there. This judge’s order, without any kind of rationale to it, could indeed be one of the situations that actually sterilizes this river and the species rather than protecting the river and the species. Let’s allow river operators to operate the river. Let’s allow scientists to conduct the science and let judges go back to granting divorces. Allowing a judge with no background in these issues to dictate river operations and subvert the science is totally irresponsible on our part. This is a piece of legislation that clearly is a win for the ratepayers to a tune of $40 million that they would have to do if this decision by the judge stands. It is also a win for taxpayers to the tune of about $16 million. It is a win for the fish by preventing a potentially deadly environmental decision that has no basis in actual science. And, once again, it was the last administration that created the pattern in which we are going. Let’s go back to that and do it. Now, if another science or biological opinion needs to be done, let it happen, but don’t allow the judge to change what the river operators are saying is the wisest policy until you do that. That is the basis of this particular bill. It helps the power. It helps the fish. It helps all of us. And let’s face it, if you are not using that hydropower, you are going to have to pick up fossil fuel power to make up the difference—see which one actually is healthier for the environment. Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleagues for doing this, and I urge all in the House to support this legislation which is a bipartisan bill that has bipartisan support. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman SHUSTER for agreeing to help expedite consideration of this bill today. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON NATURAL RESOURCES , Washington, DC, April 12, 2018. Hon. BILLSHUSTER , Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Washington, DC DEARMR. CHAIRMAN : I write regarding H.R. 3144, to provide for operations of the Federal Columbia River Power System pursuant to a certain operation plan for a specified period of time, and for other purposes. The bill was referred primarily to the Committee on Natural Resources, with an additional referral to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. I ask that you allow the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure to be discharged from further consideration of the bill so that it may be scheduled by the Majority Leader. This discharge in no way affects your jurisdiction over the subject matter of the bill, and it will not serve as precedent for future referrals. In addition, should a conference on the bill be necessary, I would support your request to have the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure represented on the conference committee. Finally, I would be pleased to include this letter and any response in the bill report filed by the Committee on Natural Resources to memorialize our understanding. Thank you for your consideration of my request and for the extraordinary cooperation shown by you and your staff over matters of shared jurisdiction. I look forward to further opportunities to work with you this Congress. Sincerely, ROBBISHOP , Chairman. 
COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION AND  INFRASTRUCTURE , HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , Washington, DC, April 16, 2018. Hon. ROBBISHOP , Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources, Washington, DC. DEAR CHAIRMAN BISHOP : Thank you for your letter concerning H.R. 3144, to provide for operations of the Federal Columbia River Power System pursuant to a certain operation plan for a specified period of time, and for other purposes. As noted, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure received an additional referral on this legislation. In order to expedite floor consideration of H.R. 3144, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure agrees to forgo action on this bill. However, as you noted, this is conditional on our mutual understanding that forgoing consideration of the bill would not prejudice the Committee with respect to the appointment of conferees or to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject matters contained in the bill or similar legislation that fall within the Committee’s Rule X jurisdiction. Further, it is our understanding that mutually agreed upon changes to the legislation will be incorporated into the bill via an amendment. Should a conference on the bill be necessary, I appreciate your agreement to support my request to have the Committee represented on the conference committee. 
Thank you for your cooperation on this matter and for agreeing to place a copy of this letter and your response acknowledging our jurisdictional interest into the bill report and the Congressional Record during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Sincerely, BILLSHUSTER , Chairman. 
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 3144, a bill that would require the implementation of a specific Federal Columbia River Power System operation plan. I am committed to increasing consumer access to affordable and reliable electricity, but this must be done without jeopardizing our region’s ecosystem. I cannot support this bill because it would undermine longstanding environmental protections, including the Endangered Species Act, harm salmon and steelhead populations, and threaten the recreational and commercial fisheries, tribes, and species that benefit from healthy salmon runs. The Endangered Species Act and National Environmental Policy Act require the federal operators of the Federal Columbia River Power System to consult with the National Marine Fisheries Service on how the System’s hydroelectric dams could affect several salmon and steelhead stocks that are listed as threatened or endangered. Unfortunately, instead of responding in a systematic manner using the best available science, this bill would disrupt regional salmon and dam management efforts, jeopardize the existence of salmon and steelhead, and damage this vulnerable ecosystem. In addition to the troubling effects on the region’s ecosystem, implementation of this bill could also harm tribal fisheries. Native Americans have lived and fished along the banks of the Columbia River for centuries. Despite signing treaties with the tribes to preserve their rights to fish, hunt, and gather at their accustomed places, the federal government has a long history of failing to protect these tribal fishing rights. Tribes have a right and a deep cultural and historical connection to the fish populations threatened by this bill. Oregon’s economic vitality is dependent on the health of the Pacific Ocean and the Columbia River. We rely on the natural resources in our region to support a significant portion of our economy, and we are very vulnerable to changes to our ecosystem. This bill could harm the businesses that are dependent on healthy salmon and steelhead runs, including the commercial and recreational fishing industry, guiding and outdoor retail businesses, restaurants, and coastal communities that benefit from tourism. The Pacific Northwest’s social and environmental landscape is changing. We need to find a sustainable path forward that supports renewable power, commerce, and habitat conservation for salmon and steelhead populations. In addition to supporting the responsible use of hydropower that does not put salmon populations at risk, I also support investments in additional renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and wave energy. Through diversifying our investments in renewable resources, we can protect our environment and support new industries, jobs, and innovative businesses. In short, we can—and should—address the energy needs of our region without furthering policies that will harm our ecosystem. I urge my colleagues to work together to develop a more appropriate solution that will protect salmon and steelhead and provide affordable and reliable electricity to consumers in the Pacific Northwest. I note for the record that my husband, Judge Michael H. Simon, wrote the judicial opinion that was discussed in the debate about this bill. Before voting, I checked with the House Ethics office and was assured that there is no conflict of interest under the House Rules because the bill does not benefit my spouse’s or my personal interest or finances. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 839, the previous question is ordered on the bill, as amended. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentlewoman opposed to the bill? Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I am opposed. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to recommit. The Clerk read as follows: 
Ms. Jayapal moves to recommit the bill H.R. 3144 to the Committee on Natural Resources with instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith with the following amendment: At end of the bill, add the following: 
Nothing in this Act shall prohibit the sale of electric power generated by the Federal Columbia River Power System at the lowest possible rate consistent with sound business practices and other factors as required by current law. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from Washington is recognized for 5 minutes in support of her motion. Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended. Mr. Speaker, I make this motion today in order to ensure that the millions of Americans who rely on public power can continue receiving affordable power. President Trump, in his latest budget, has proposed charging millions of Americans more for their electricity. The President wants to charge Americans what he calls marketbased rates, which means that millions of Americans who rely on public power will pay more than what they pay now. This proposal has rightly provoked bipartisan opposition, and I hope my Republican colleagues will join me in rejecting this illadvised proposal which will result in higher bills for millions of our constituents. Mr. Speaker, I should also add that the underlying bill is based on a false premise that rates can be lowered by shirking our responsibilities to protect our environment, restore our salmon populations, and follow the law. After all, restoring our region’s salmon populations will reduce our costs in the long run. This underlying bill takes us in the wrong direction, and it is important to include some context on this complicated issue. Starting in the 1930s, the Federal Government began the construction of 31 hydroelectric dams on the Columbia River. These dams which make up the Federal Columbia River Power System, or the FCRPS, provide public power throughout the Pacific Northwest. However, it has become clear that they have operated in ways that pose serious threats to our region’s salmon runs and violate our environmental laws. Several courts, including the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and the Oregon U.S. District Court, have ruled as such. The courts ordered a new biological opinion, as well as a NEPA review, in order to bring the plans in alignment with Federal law. Rather than letting this critical process continue, H.R. 3144 aims to circumvent our court system and the law by blocking legally ordered salmon protection measures. Congress should not be in the business of closing the door on legal and regulatory review processes simply because some Members don’t like them. Some claim that the court process will make it more expensive for ratepayers due to decisions like the one to increase spill over the dams, which this bill would illegally block. This process, which is meant to release additional water over the tops of the dams to ensure that juvenile salmon can migrate out, is a critical step in increasing salmon recovery rates. It is currently up for debate whether or not ratepayers will see an increase of any sort in the costs in the short term, but the longterm benefits of changes like this one are indisputable. The 13 species of steelhead and salmon that are threatened by these dams are crucial to our region, and our fishing industry relies on them for its survival. In 2011, Mr. Speaker, 34,500 jobs were provided by a healthy sport fishing industry which contributed more than $3.8 billion to the economy in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. And according to a recent poll in Washington State, a strong majority of voters are actually willing to pay up to $7 a month in additional costs in order to save our wild salmon and improve water quality because they know how incredibly important it is to all of our economies and our communities. Whether or not the increase spill will raise costs, that is not clear, but what is clear is that conserving these critical populations is a priority for the people in the Pacific Northwest. The irony, Mr. Speaker, is that H.R. 3144 will ultimately cost our ratepayers 
even more money in the long term. Protecting our salmon populations is 100 percent necessary. It is our obligation under the Endangered Species Act. So simply closing our eyes and hoping this all goes away is not an option. Additionally, the Native peoples of the Pacific Northwest have the undeniable treaty rights to catch these salmon and steelhead at accustomed places, meaning that these populations have to be maintained. We can’t continue to fail to uphold our end of this deal, and this bill will move us further away from where we need to be. This issue has been addressed, and the review process mandated by the courts is doing just that. By denying the opportunity to implement the necessary sciencebased changes required to bring the FCRPS in line with Federal law, H.R. 3144 will cost ratepayers more down the line. Restoring the salmon population will be incredibly expensive, and gutting fisheries protections and kicking the can down the road does not serve our ratepayers well. We must move forward with the ongoing biological opinion review and the NEPA process, but we also have to ensure that we are continuing to be mindful of our ratepayers in the region. This bill will ultimately cost ratepayers more, not less. Mr. Speaker, it is possible to find a solution that works. I yield back the balance of my time. b1600 Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the motion. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I do appreciate the commitment of the gentlewoman from Washington, the effort to solve some problems, and many of the issues that were brought up. Unfortunately, many of the issues that were addressed simply are not covered in the motion to recommit at the same time—great speeches, but not necessarily really relating directly to the motion. If you actually look at what the motion will do, ultimately, it is very clear that it will ensure that rates actually do go up; carbon emissions will go up; and farmers, families, union members, and small businesses will all have to eventually pay for it. The underlying bipartisan legislation, though, and not some poorly worded gimmick that cedes more authority to courts and lawyers will protect ratepayers and endangered salmon and the whales and the taxpayers at the same time. In all due respect, I actually feel happy that I was here when we saw a display of the Senate actually passing something. So I would suggest, in all humility to the other side, if they actually want to do something which would encourage my commitment and my approval of an MTR, it would be to realize and recognize something that happened 107 years ago this Friday, in which the socialist Member from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 107 years ago, Friday, introduced a resolution to dissolve the Senate. Now, if that were a motion to recommit, that I would firmly endorse. That would actually help us move forward. Unfortunately, that is not the motion to recommit in front of us. The motion to recommit does not help us move forward. Mr. Speaker, I ask for a ‘‘no’’ vote on the motion to recommit, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to recommit. There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it. Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule XX, this 15minute vote on the motion to recommit will be followed by 5minute votes on: Passage of H.R. 3144, if ordered; and Suspending the rules and passing H.R. 5447. The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were—yeas 190, nays 226, not voting 12, as follows:

MOMENT OF SILENCE FOR FALLEN GILCHRIST LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS (Mr. DUNN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of two fallen heroes back home in Florida: Gilchrist County Sergeant Noel Ramirez and Deputy Taylor Lindsey. These two officers were tragically murdered in the line of duty during an ambush shooting on April 19. Mr. Speaker, these two young men were selfless heroes, patriots, and everything we aspire to be as people, as a Nation, and as Americans. Sergeant Ramirez had been in law enforcement for 7 years and leaves behind two young children and a wife. He had, as Sheriff Bobby Schultz described it, an infectious smile. Deputy Lindsey joined the Gilchrist County Sheriff’s Office in 2013, and dedicated his time and efforts towards getting illegal drugs off our streets. Please join me and the Florida delegation in honoring Gilchrist County Sergeant Noel Ramirez and Deputy Taylor Lindsey and all of our fallen heroes who have made the ultimate sacrifice to ensure our safety. At this time, Mr. Speaker, I ask that the House hold a moment of silence. f 
b1645 AUTISM AWARENESS MONTH (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Autism Awareness Month. Right now, the CDC estimates that 1 in 68 children has been identified with autism spectrum disorder, but a recent parent survey indicated that as many as 1 in 45 children may be affected. As a proud uncle of a young man with autism, I understand the challenges that families across the country are facing and the need for more resources to support this in this area. But I am also aware of the positive opportunities that we can create by working together to build a better future for our loved ones with autism and the families that care for them. Mr. Speaker, I have been a proud participant in the Rhode Island Autism Project’s annual Imagine Walk, which highlights the importance of research, screening, interventions, and education for the entire Ocean State community and also helps to raise resources. I look forward to continuing my work in Congress to support the Autism Project and other great organizations that help foster a more tolerant, inclusive society. 
OFFSHORE DRILLING (Mr. FRANCIS ROONEY of Florida asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. FRANCIS ROONEY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to continue to talk about how dangerous the offshore drilling business is for the eastern gulf and our environment in Florida. Blowouts reached an alltime high offshore in 2016. For every 1,000 new wells offshore, 20 blowouts occur. For 14 years, Taylor Energy has had a well off of south Louisiana that has leaked. It has leaked hundreds of thousands of gallons of oil every year. Leaks from LL&G’s pipeline leaked 392,700 barrels of oil in 2017, and in 2016 Shell Oil had a similar leak in one of their pipelines. That is really bad because Shell Oil is one of the best companies in the industry. It shows you that human error cannot be eliminated from offshore drilling, and we should ban it in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. 
FREE THE PANCHEN LAMA OF TIBET (Mr. MCGOVERN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, today, we celebrate the 29th birthday of Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, the 11th Panchen Lama of Tibetan Buddhism. He was chosen for his position on May 15, 1995, by His Holiness the Dalai Lama. Two days later, when he was only 6 years old, the Chinese Government detained him and his family. The Panchen Lama has not been heard from since. Twentythree years later, he is one of the world’s longest held prisoners of conscience. People from all over the world—representatives of governments, the United Nations, and civil society organizations—have repeatedly asked to see him, without success. What kind of government steals away a child? The Panchen Lama’s disappearance symbolizes the violations of religious freedom that take place in Tibetan areas of China on a daily basis. Mr. Speaker, in honor of his birthday, please join me in calling on the Chinese Government to free the true Panchen Lama. 
DEFERMENT FOR ACTIVE CANCER TREATMENT (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on the Deferment for Active Cancer Treatment Act. I introduced this bill with my friend, Congressman EDPERLMUTTER , with the support of Critical Mass: The Young Adult Cancer Alliance. This commonsense and bipartisan measure will enable cancer patients to defer payments on public student loans while actively receiving treatment, without interest accruing during the deferment period. Sadly, in 2018 alone, Mr. Speaker, more than 1.7 million Americans will be newly diagnosed with cancer. Beyond the terrible news of this cancer diagnosis, these individuals have to endure exhaustive treatment and staggering medical expenses, often leading to under or unemployment. This reality makes it incredibly difficult for many cancer patients to make payments on their student loans on time. By passing the Deferment for Active Cancer Treatment Act, we will help so many cancer patients and stimulate the economy. These patients will be prevented from defaulting on their student loans, which they so desperately need. Mr. Speaker, Ed and I encourage our colleagues to stand with cancer patients across our Nation and support and cosponsor the Deferment for Active Cancer Treatment Act. VALERIY ‘‘LARRY’’ SAVINKIN STREET CONAMING CEREMONY IN BROOKLYN, NEW YORK (Mr. JEFFRIES asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor that, on Tuesday, May 1, the communities of south Brooklyn, on the corner of Brighton Beach and Coney Island Avenues, will be conamed for Valeriy ‘‘Larry’’ Savinkin, a dedicated and wellrespected community leader, who passed away last year. Larry was my congressional field representative who served the residents of the Eighth Congressional District with great distinction. His success and impact on the neighborhoods of southern Brooklyn and Queens were not limited to his work in the Eighth Congressional District office. For over 20 years, he was involved in several prominent organizations, including the September 11 Family Group, the Holocaust Memorial Committee, and the Odessa Community of New York. Larry had a magnetic personality and cared about his community immensely. I had the privilege of knowing and working with him for several years. I look forward to standing on Valeriy ‘‘Larry’’ Savinkin Street with New York City Council Members Mark Treyger and Chaim Deutsch next Tuesday to commemorate and acknowledge this outstanding individual. f 
RECOGNIZING 125TH ANNIVERSARY OF MASONIC CARE COMMUNITY OF NEW YORK (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 125th anniversary of the incredible Masonic Care Community of New York, located in the city of Utica. The Masonic Care Community of New York opened its doors on May 1, 1893, as the Masonic Home, started by the Free and Accepted Masons of the State of New York. Their goal was to provide highquality care to elderly masons and families living in the Mohawk Valley region. Within 30 years, the location expanded to include a building for 360 adults, a hospital, several dormitories for children, and a 200acre working farm that supplied food for those living on the campus. Today, the Masonic Care Community of New York offers topoftheline healthcare options to all. It also offers highquality senior care, rehabilitation services, and child care, while also making house calls for those patients who are unable to leave their home. Masonic Care Community of New York has supported, nurtured, and educated the community by providing exceptional care and services with compassion and pride guided by the Masonic principles of brotherly love, relief, truth, and integrity. Currently, more than 500 seniors call the Masonic Care Community of New York and their independent living center home. I want to extend my congratulations to the staff at the Masonic Care Community of New York for their hard work in continuing to make the Masonic Care Community of New York a firstclass facility. I wish them 125 more years of exceptional service. f 
REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF AUSTIN MEYER (Mr. KIHUEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Austin Meyer. Austin moved to Reno, Nevada, to study transportation technology at Truckee Meadows Community College. He had a passion for cars and sports. He loved to watch basketball, especially the Boston Celtics. Austin was excited to watch his favorite band perform at the Route 91 festival on October 1 in Las Vegas. Austin went to the festival with his fiancee, Dana Getreu, to celebrate his birthday and their anniversary. Austin dreamed of opening up his own auto repair shop after graduation and was excited to get married to Dana and start a family. He always had a smile on his face and made people laugh. Austin’s friends and family remember him for being ambitious, smart, and hardworking. I would like to extend my condolences to Austin Meyer’s family and friends. Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada, and the whole country grieve with you. 
CELEBRATING 100TH BIRTHDAY OF DORA DUNCAN GILLENWATER BARTLEY (Mr. COMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in celebration of a lifelong friend and neighbor, Mrs. Dora Duncan Gillenwater Bartley of my hometown of Tompkinsville, in the First District of Kentucky, who is celebrating her 100th birthday today. Dora Bartley’s dedication to serving others rivals only her love for her husband, James Dale Bartley, and their seven children. Known throughout Monroe County for her abundant compassion and unwavering work ethic, she has not only cared for her family, but also welcomed abused and orphaned women and children into her home and treated them as her own. 
Throughout her life, she has been guided by her steadfast commitment to her faith and has worked tirelessly for the benefit of others, not only during her service as deputy jailer, but even after her retirement through her involvement in distributing commodities and serving her fellow senior citizens. I am deeply thankful for her friendship and guidance throughout my life, and I am honored to join with her friends and family, as well as all who have benefited from her generous spirit, in celebrating this milestone achievement. I wish Dora Bartley a happy 100th birthday and many more joyful years filled with blessings. 
b1700 CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF PETER G. PETERSON (Ms. PELOSI asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember a great American patriot, Pete Peterson, who passed away at the age of 91 last month. Born to Greek immigrant parents in America’s heartland of Nebraska, Pete rose from humble beginnings to contribute to our Nation as a public servant, statesman, business leader, and especially through his philanthropic and policy work. Pete was a clarion voice for fiscal responsibility and a strong moral conscience in Washington, working tirelessly and always reaching across party lines. For Pete, building a bright economic future for the next generation was his patriotic duty. He understood that he was so fortunate to have lived the American Dream, and he wanted that same opportunity available for every man, woman, and child in our Nation. Economic policy leadership was a defining thread running through his life, including in his roles as Secretary of Commerce, the head of major American corporations, and the founder of respected policy organizations, including the Peterson Institute for International Economics and the Peterson Foundation. Pete’s prophetic voice on the importance of fiscal sustainability brought together generations of policymakers, no matter their political background, to find common ground and effective solutions. His strong moral leadership to ensure our children and our grandchildren inherit a healthy fiscal future leaves a remarkable legacy. Mr. Speaker, anyone who knew Pete will attest to his wit, generous spirit, and personal warmth that made him a pleasure to be around. Pete signed The Giving Pledge and committed the bulk of his personal fortune to philanthropic causes. His legacy will endure in many ways, but especially through the work of the Peterson Foundation, which continues to focus on solutions to America’s fiscal and economic challenges, now under the leadership of his son Michael. The loss of Pete will be deeply felt in Washington, in the Nation, and around the world. May it bring some measure of comfort to his wife, Joan Ganz Cooney; his children, John, Jim, David, Holly, and Michael; and all his loved ones that so many grieve with them during this difficult time. I knew and loved Pete Peterson, and I know he loved his family above all. He was a great American, who loved our country as well. f 
THE REPUBLIC OF TEXAS—THE REPUBLIC OF FRANCE (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, just a stone’s throw away from the Champs Elysees and the Louvre in Paris stands the Hotel de Vendome, the former home of the official embassy of the Republic of Texas. In fact, France was the first nation to recognize Texas as an independent nation in 1836, when a treaty was signed between the two countries. Today, a marker denotes the building where the Texas embassy was in France. In turn, France had an embassy in Austin, Texas, not far from our current Texas Capitol Building. Notably, Texas also once belonged to France before Spain reclaimed Texas. Explorer La Salle planted the French flag in Texas in 1685 and established a settlement in Matagorda. Texas later became a sovereign republic and 9 years later joined the United States. So on this day when French President Macron addressed Congress, Texas remembers and appreciates that Texas was not only an independent country France first recognized, but was once a part of France. And that is just the way it is. 
BRINGING FUTURE FARMERS OF AMERICA INTO THE 21ST CENTURY (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, yesterday I introduced a bill with my colleagues, Congressman JIMLANGEVIN and Congressman D AVID YOUNG of Iowa, to modernize the charter of the National FFA Organization. FFA, formerly called the Future Farmers of America, was founded in 1928. Congress recognized the importance of FFA as an integral part of agriculture and, in 1950, granted it a Federal charter. The charter provides Federal authority to create an interagency working agreement that is focused on strengthening FFA and schoolbased agriculture education. It is important to note that only about 100 organizations have charters with Federal agencies, only six organizations require the respective government agency to select one member for the board of directors, and FFA is the only organization that requires a majority of its board of directors be chosen by its partner government agency. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5595, the National FFA Organization’s Charter Amendments Act, makes updates to allow the National FFA to be a selfgoverning organization while maintaining its long held relationship with the U.S. Department of Education. This amendment brings FFA, a great cornerstone of rural America, into the 21st century, and I encourage my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation. f 
NATIONAL SCIENCE BOWL (Mr. FLEISCHMANN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening on behalf of some of my greatest constituents, Oak Ridge High School, in the Third District of Tennessee. The Department of Energy created the National Science Bowl in 1991. This is one of the most prestigious competitions in math and science for our high school and middle school students. Oak Ridge High School is the only high school in the great State of Tennessee to participate in the finals this year that will take place this weekend. I would like to announce that Joseph Andress, Henry Shen, Steven Qu, Melody Guo, and Batu Odbadrakh are our outstanding students for Oak Ridge High School. Go Oak Ridge. Go National Science Bowl. Go America. 
RECOGNITION OF BARBARA JOHNS DAY The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. FITZPATRICK ). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GARRETT ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor, the likes of which I can’t think of a comparison, to stand here, in this week of April 2018, and commemorate a battle undertaken by a student that I would argue was a continuation of the American Revolution. The American Revolution began when a group of White male landowners cast off the tyrannical throne which lorded over them from across an ocean, but it moved forward 80 years later when a million Americans, through disease and starvation and battlefield death, gave their lives to rid this Nation of the horrific institution of slavery. Then 55 years later, I would argue that it continued when the franchise was extended through women’s suffrage to women. 
Then 30plus years after that, by a 16 yearold high school student at the R.R. Moton High School in Farmville, Virginia, who had heard about the foundational ideas espoused by a slave owner named Jefferson who wrote that all people are created equal, but couldn’t reconcile that with her life experience, because in the county where she lived, a brandnew high school had been built, but only some kids could attend it. So in extending this American Revolution that continues to this day, this 16yearold young woman, Barbara Rose Johns, led a school walkout that was the only studentinitiated case amalgamated into the decision in Brown v. Board of Education, which rid America of the ridiculous lie that was ‘‘separate but equal.’’ So her walkout was not to take rights from others, but to extend rights to all, and the idea of an American Nation founded on the idea that all people had fundamental rights, and that it was the role of government to protect those. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT), my colleague. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join my colleague from Virginia, Congressman GARRETT . I want to thank him for organizing this evening’s Special Order, but first I want to commend him for his work as a Virginia State senator for making April 23 Barbara Johns Day in the Commonwealth of Virginia. This April 23, Monday, marked the first official recognition of this important day in the Commonwealth. Almost 64 years ago, the Supreme Court struck down lawful school segregation in the case of Brown v. Board of Education. What few people know is that Virginia was one of the four cases decided that day. There were three other States, and Washington, D.C., had another case that was decided the same day. Virginia’s involvement in Brown v. Board of Education stood out because that effort was led by a student, namely Barbara Johns. She was only 16 years of age. This stalwart figure in the struggle for equal education stood up to challenge the notion that African Americans should receive separate and unequal education under the law. Barbara Johns grew up in Farmville, Virginia, and attended Robert Russa Moton High School, an allBlack school serving more than 450 students despite the fact that the facility was designed for only 180. She described the inadequacies of the school as having shabby equipment, no science laboratories, no separate gymnasium. Conditions were so bad at the high school that, in 1947, even in Jim Crow Virginia, the State offered money to improve the school, yet the all White Prince Edward County School Board refused to accept the State’s funding. Barbara took her concerns about the school to a teacher, who responded by asking her to do something about it. After months of contemplation and imagination, she began to formulate a plan. Seizing on the moment, on April 23, 1951, Barbara Johns, a 16yearold high school student, led her classmates on a strike to protest the substandard conditions at Robert Russa Moton High School. Her leadership and advocacy ultimately garnered the support of NAACP lawyers Spottswood Robinson and Oliver Hill to take up her cause and the cause of more equitable conditions at Moton High School. After meeting with the students and the community, they filed suit in Federal court in Richmond, Virginia. The Virginia case was called Davis v. County School Board of Prince Edward County, and, in 1954, Davis became one of the four cases decided in the Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education. There is a saying that ‘‘courage is not the absence of fear, but the assessment that something else is more important.’’ Her courage led to the powerful language in the Brown decision that still rings true today. In the case, the Court said: ‘‘Today, education is perhaps the most important function of State and local governments. Compulsory school attendance laws and the great expenditures for education both demonstrate our recognition of the importance of education to our democratic society. It is required in the performance of our most basic public responsibilities, even service in the Armed Forces. It is the very foundation of good citizenship. Today, it is a principal instrument in awakening the child to cultural values, in preparing him for later professional training, and in helping him to adjust normally to his environment. In these days, it is doubtful that any child may reasonably be expected to succeed in life if he is denied the opportunity of an education. Such an opportunity, where the State has undertaken to provide it, is a right which must be made available to all on equal terms. ‘‘We come, then, to the question presented: Does segregation of children in public schools solely on the basis of race, even though the physical facilities and other ‘tangible’ factors may be equal, deprive the children of the minority group of equal educational opportunities? We believe that it does.’’ And the Court concluded: ‘‘We conclude that, in the field of public education, the doctrine of ‘separate but equal’ has no place. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.’’ Those powerful words were provoked by the courage of Barbara Johns and others like her who led the charge to bring the cases to the Supreme Court. The example of Barbara Johns should serve as an example for all of us. She did not sit on the sidelines, and neither should we. We should speak out when we see injustice, we should act when we see inequity. The best way to honor her legacy is to act in the same spirit that she did. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Virginia (Mr. GARRETT ), for providing an opportunity to remind us of our obligation to do the right thing. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman SCOTT for his comments. I refer to myself as a nerd—which is okay, because the nerds usually win in the end—who loves history. My acquaintance with the story of Barbara Johns did not begin as a school student taking Virginia history in Virginia, it did not begin as a student at a top tier university studying history. It began when I became a candidate for the State Senate of Virginia. The district that I wished to represent and had the honor of representing included Farmville. So when I went to Farmville, I had the opportunity to attend a function at the Moton Museum, which stands where R.R. Moton High School stood and, in fact, encompasses the bulk of that facility. I heard about Barbara Johns, and I thought: Who is Barbara Johns? And the more I learned about Barbara Johns, the more I was amazed that I didn’t know the answer to that question. When we put in a bill to commemorate April 23, the day that this courageous, and I would stress without ceasing, 16yearold student—when I was 16 years old, I think I was more concerned with the zit on my nose and whether I could get a homecoming date than whether I was going to change the world. But when I learned more about her and we put in a bill to commemorate April 23 as a holiday in the Commonwealth of Virginia, it was my hope that one day someone would look at a calendar and see Barbara Johns Day and say: Who was Barbara Johns? Someone had the temerity to say to me: Well, Tom, this is Black history. I reject that on its face. This is not Black history or Brown history or White history. It is American history, and it is red, white, and blue. b1715 That this country is the worst nation in the world, except for all the others, to paraphrase Winston Churchill, is something that I am proud of. That we were founded by geniuses like Jefferson, who was a flawed and fallen man by virtue of his participation in an evil, evil enterprise that was the slave trade, does not diminish the brilliance of the idea expanded upon by Locke and Rousseau and Hume, of natural law that all people have certain fundamental rights. That is who we are as a country. The reason I postulated earlier that the American Revolution should never end is because in the preamble to the Constitution, our Founders gave us not a perfect union, but sought to establish 
a more perfect union. And the word more’s inclusion is important because it implies the perpetual need to act because, in any institution governed by flawed and fallen human beings, there will always inherently be imperfection, but that does not absolve us of our duty to do the best we can. You can judge a nation and its character by the people whose virtues it extols. And to suggest that Barbara Johns is an American hero is to understate it. Again, a revolution to cast off a tyrannical crown, followed decades and decades later by a civil war to abolish a horrific, horrific activity, followed by a fight for generations to ensure suffrage to an entire sex, followed 30some years later by a young girl with the courage to stand up and assert that justice should be equal for all, and that transcends even educational opportunity, inarguably. So I hold in high regard foundational heroes like Patrick Henry, and I have spoken from this spot on this floor before and talked about his speech: ‘‘I know not what course others may take, but as for me, give me liberty or give me death.’’ But my favorite ‘‘Patrick Henryism’’ was when, on speaking on separating from the crown, someone from the back of the room shouted ‘‘Treason,’’ and Henry said: ‘‘If this be treason, make the most of it,’’ a willingness to stand and fight and die because something was the right thing to do. Now, let’s skip forward to a 16year old girl in the segregated South. She undoubtedly had the fortune of a strong family. I have had the honor of speaking on multiple occasions with her sister and an amazing uncle in Vernon Johns, a pastor first educated at Virginia Theological Seminary and then at Oberlin and, I believe, at the University of Chicago. But Vernon Johns studied what? The classics and natural law, the Jeffersonian ideas that liberty was inherently a gift to humans, not from a government, but to be protected thereby. And so I like to imagine, and presume it is true because I asked Joan Johns, with whom I spoke last, if they ever discussed these sorts of things with their Uncle Vernon, and she said, of course; that someone had to stand up and assert these Godgiven rights in a land where they weren’t protected by the government in accordance to its responsibility. Who did that? A 16yearold young woman. Okay. What was the cost? Well, no different than Patrick Henry, who said: ‘‘If this be treason, then make the most of it,’’ quite literally, Barbara Johns had to move away for fear for her life. People think about the civil rights movement as many things. Many don’t realize that well over 1,000 people died, a lot in civil unrest, but also in things like horrific bombings of churches based on the color of the skin of the people who attended them. So the threat to Barbara Johns was existential and real but, in the face of that threat, she stood, and she led. And it wasn’t about selfaggrandizement. There was no future political career. Barbara John’s aspiration in life was to be a librarian. She became one. But when her moment came, she led. And she led, not to take from anyone, but to give to everyone what is inherently their right and should be cherished and protected by government. And so we have, with incredible humility, had the opportunity to serve in this hallowed institution, and this week, have filed for Barbara Johns to receive the Congressional Gold Medal. It is the highest award that can be bestowed by this Chamber. Tragically, Ms. Johns passed from this life in 1991, but I would submit that she is wellworthy of this honor. And then if bestowing this honor upon her posthumously will lead more American young people to read and learn about the leadership and courage demonstrated by this school student from Prince Edward County, Virginia, then it is well worth doing. I in no way, shape, or form mean to make light, but if Bob Hope and Roberto Clemente and John Wayne and Arnold Palmer and Dr. Muhammad Yunus and Louis L’Amour can receive the Congressional Gold Medal, then, by gosh, Barbara Rose Johns Powell deserves it. This is a story that should be told. And it is not a political story, it is an American story. It is not a black or white story, it is an American story. It is not a story about a powerful woman, it is a story about a powerful human being. We, collectively, are great because individuals have been allowed and encouraged and supported and uplifted and extolled for doing great things. And it is ridiculous that I should have studied Virginia history, American history, and then majored in history in college, grown up less than 100 miles away from where this young woman did this amazing thing, and have never heard her name. So today, I genuinely and sincerely thank my colleague, and I hope that somebody at home somewhere is Google searching Barbara Rose Johns, because hers is an amazing story, and we stand on the shoulder of such giants. It is overdue that she be recognized for her contribution to our American family. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
OPIOID ABUSE ACROSS THE NATION The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) is recognized for the remainder of the hour as the designee of the majority leader. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the topic of my Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from North Carolina? There was no objection. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMP SON). Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman and my chairman from the House Education and the Workforce Committee for hosting this Special Order tonight on an issue that is impacting every ZIP Code in America. The gentlewoman’s poster says it all. This is close to home: Life beyond opioids, and stability, health, and healing. The opioid epidemic is considered by many to be the worst public health crisis of our generation and, according to the National Institutes of Health, more than 115 people in the United States die every day from an opioid overdose. This epidemic is not an urban problem and it is not a rural problem. It is a national problem. No ZIP Code, as I said, in the country is immune from this crisis. This is an epidemic that transcends all socioeconomic classes, and all of America’s people, all of America’s diversity of families is at risk. Heroin and pain pill addiction doesn’t discriminate on age, race, gender, or socioeconomic status. Your neighbor could be using heroin and so could their high honors high school student. Unfortunately, the people of Pennsylvania have seen some of the worst. Last year, the crisis surged when Pennsylvania experienced a 44 percent increase in opioid overdoses. It is just tragic what this does to families and how it steals lives and futures. Addressing this unprecedented rate of opioidrelated death means that we must focus on nearly 2.2 million Americans who currently struggle with opioid addiction. No one person can beat addiction alone, and overcoming this epidemic will not only take a communitywide effort, but a nationwide effort. The breadth of this epidemic requires us to respond with a multifaceted approach. Congress has engaged many agencies, including the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control, and Customs and Border Protection, just to name a few, to help combat opioid abuse. This crisis has torn apart families. It has weakened our workforce and overextended our healthcare system. As a nation, we must act with a unified urgency to help those who have fallen victim to addiction in every corner of the country, and we must not forget their families who have seen firsthand the crippling effects of this disease day 
in and day out. I know we are not only prepared to do so, but we are prepared to win this fight. I have had the opportunity to convene opioid crisis community roundtables throughout my congressional districts to hear firsthand from families, from healthcare providers, from law enforcement, from emergency medical services, from those who are involved in the treatment community, and the impact is just so significant. After coming away from these, I have also come to the conclusion, what is important to focus on really is the substance abuse behaviors. In one community in Clarion County, the issue at one time was opioids, and then it went to heroin. But when the heroin started to be mixed with other really deadly drugs and components, and so many people died within the user community, they moved on to the new—they went actually back to—they want to Suboxone, which is what we use to treat opioid and heroin abuse. And when the Suboxone—those who were dispensing that as treatment tightened that, the community found that they now had a crisis, they went to meth. So it is so important, as we work on this, we keep a broader perspective of dealing with the substance abuse behaviors, because the drug of choice will change, based on economics, based on availability; but this, our goal should be to increase awareness. Our goal should be, acknowledge there is a problem, and I think we have done that. In my work in healthcare and, specifically, I worked in acute psychiatric services for a period of time, I know that until you acknowledge you have a problem, you can’t really deal with it. I think, across the board, in your communities, our States, at a local, a State, and national level, we acknowledge we have a problem, and that is an important first step. I am proud of what we have done here in Washington, legislatively and providing funding, but this is an allhands ondeck problem. It requires prevention. That is where education is so important. Prevention, education, treatment. We have to equip our youngest generation with decisionmaking skills, with discernment, so they have the filters to make better decisions when they are exposed to access, when they are approached by others, when they are preyed upon in terms of those who push drugs. We certainly need to equip our medical professionals to improve how they prescribe, how they dispense medications, and increase their utilization of alternative pain management. As a former rehabilitation professional, there are some great tools out there to help deal with managing pain. One of the things that, culturally, we have come to the point where we try to eliminate pain, and I think that is what has pushed us with the opioids into the situation that we are in today. And we need to equip our communities with evidencebased treatment, something closer to home. And so I do very, very much appreciate Chairwoman FOXX’s leadership on education and workforce issues, and really appreciate her putting this Special Order together this evening and leading us as we address what truly is the public health crisis of our generation. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania. We all know and appreciate his background and his experience in healthcare and the wonderful wisdom that he brings to us on the Education and the Workforce Committee, not only on this issue, but on so many issues facing Americans today. As the gentleman pointed out, the health and stability of our communities are in serious trouble because of opioid abuse across the Nation. Since 1999, the opioid death toll has quadrupled. There are many estimates of how many Americans die in a single day because of opioids, and we are so sorry to hear of any deaths from opioids. b1730 It is heartbreaking that all of those estimates are in the hundreds. These people were fathers and sons, mothers and daughters, neighbors, coworkers, and friends. They were real people in our communities. I have had families from the Fifth District come to see me to share their heartbreaking stories of family members, often adult children, who have died from opioids. My own heart breaks for them and the pain they are feeling for their tragic loss. There are newspaper stories and obituaries in newspapers reporting on opioid abuse and deaths and its devastating impact every day. As opioids continue to claim the lives of Americans in cities and towns across the Nation, it is our responsibility to work together to find solutions that will bring relief to American communities. The Committee on Education and the Workforce has recently held two hearings on opioids, and we have learned from employers, educators, local leaders, and addiction experts about how chronic and rising rates of opioid misuse and abuse are impacting families, schools, workplaces, and communities as a whole. We have heard about how the epidemic’s societal burden on households and the private sector exceeded $46 billion in 2016. In schools, many principals attribute a recent decline in attendance to parents not getting up and having their students attend school because the parents are using drugs and they are not able to either take the children to school or have them ready to ride a bus. I am pleased to share the floor tonight with my colleagues from the Education and the Workforce Committee, who have not only had hard conversations with their constituents about the toll opioid abuse has taken on their communities, but they have been having productive and helpful conversations with each other about possible solutions. There is no single answer to solving the opioid problem, but if we are to bring this deadly chapter to an early close, we will need collaboration across the aisle, ingenuity, and a uniting commitment to bringing peace and healing to our communities. I will once again yield to my colleague Mr. THOMPSON for any closing comments he would like to make. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman’s leadership on this. The fact that we had two great hearings, which were on top of a lot of the work that we have been doing as a Congress, this really is an allhandson deck public health crisis, and we know that because of the work that we are doing in Education and the Workforce. This transcends education. It impacts the workforce in a significant way at a time when we have an estimated somewhere between 5 and 6 million jobs available in this country; and we have increasing job growth, and we have an aging workforce which is retiring, a significant number each and every year. This is an issue that impacts our national security because it takes individuals out of the workforce not able to pass that drug test, not able to be able to qualify. This is obviously an allhandson deck because we see so many different committees and their members across both sides of the aisle who have been working on this, the amount of legislation going back. One of the more memorable ones is the CARA Act, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, that was like 16 individual bills—16 or 18, I don’t remember exactly how many—that we debated on this floor and we passed on this floor. We rolled it into one package, and it was actually passed by the Senate, and the President signed it. It dealt with things from little unborn babies who were born addicted, a terrible situation with the suffering of those new babies because they were born to moms who were active addicts, to veterans that VA physicians—and there are some really great VA physicians. I don’t want to paint them with a broad brush. But there were some that were referred to as the candy man because they dispensed the pills like Skittles is what it looked like, and their solution to everything was to medicate, and everything in between. Also, providing resources to our local communities so our local communities could engage in this, great programs that have been around for very long time like the DrugFree Communities moneys that are used by parents and kids and teachers and community leaders who come together to deal with and confront this epidemic in their communities. I have a community up in Erie County, Iroquois School District, and it is a 
school district that has been devastated with overdoses. Most of the children in that school, a middle school—and it was heartbreaking—either had a family member or knew someone who had died of an overdose. Some of the stories you hear, and one that really stands out with me because I have talked with this mom who was in my congressional district, her son, unfortunately, had a disease, Crohn’s disease, and had to go through some surgery as a small child and endured that rather well. It worked out well. But when this young man turned about 16, 17, 18 years old, he had to go back and do surgery as a result, and this time, the painkillers they gave him he used basically one time and his life spiraled out of control. This was an athlete. This was a kid who did so well in school, but his life just went into almost a death spiral, and he wound up being incarcerated— and all because he wasn’t wired to be able to handle these painkillers. That is a part of this battle. We need better science. We need better medicine so we can determine who can tolerate certain medications and who cannot, whose life would be transformed in such a negative way by using a painkiller one time. But that certainly is all a part of this battle. Mr. Speaker, once again, I thank the gentlewoman for her leadership on this and thank her for hosting this Special Order tonight. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman THOMPSON , and I know the people of his district are well served by him. I thank him for his service on our committee, on the Agriculture Committee, and all that he does to help us write good legislation and pass good legislation. As Congressman THOMPSON said, unfortunately, this problem with opioids affects people at all ages and in all walks of life, at every income level, every category of people—male, female, old, young—but we particularly grieve over the young people. We have heard about babies becoming addicted because their mothers were addicted and of the work that is done to help those babies become free from opioid addiction. We have heard about the veterans who become addicted because of the treatment that they have received. We know nobody is attempting to get anyone addicted to opioids or anything else, for that matter, but we realize that over the years, we have had stronger use of these drugs than we probably should have had used. There are many ways to approach pain relief and pain management, and, unfortunately, in the past, too often it has been the path of least resistance. We do hear over and over the stories about young people who suddenly get addicted because of surgery or an injury, and it happens sometimes very, very quickly. As Representative THOMPSON has said, it has a huge impact on jobs. We have, right now, 6 million unfilled jobs in this country, and the reasons are very many; but some of the reason is because we have so many people addicted to opioids and other drugs, and they are simply unable to pass drug tests. We hoped, by this graphic here, to illustrate that the problem with opioids is very close to all of us at home, very close to us; and what we are hoping for is to find ways at the Federal level to get beyond opioids, to help people who are addicted have some stability, regain their health, be healed of their addiction. But this cannot all be done at the Federal level, and we know that. In fact, too many people look first to the Federal Government for an answer. The Federal Government usually is the worst place to come for an answer. It usually has to be done at the local level, then at the State level, and, last, the Federal level. But I know, as Representative THOMPSON has pointed out, many Members—in fact, I believe all Members of Congress now—are concerned about this problem we are facing with opioids, and we will answer the call to do something. My only hope is that we put everything into perspective. As we have learned from our hearings and talking to other people, much of this work needs to be done in the family to start with, in the medical communities, and once people become addicted, then in the local communities as people collaborate, work together to help people not become addicted to opioids, and once they do get off of the addiction, to get back to a normal life. I know that all of us pray for those who are addicted and pray that they will find a suitable program to help them become free from opioid addiction, and for those who have never become addicted, to be in a great environment so they never seek out drugs as an answer, because they are not an answer. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for being here tonight, I thank the staff, and I yield back the balance of my time. 
RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE INVESTIGATION The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. PERLMUTTER ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend Representative FOXXfor bringing up a subject on opioids that is obviously plaguing so many places in America. It is a very topical and important discussion to have. I want to change the subject, Mr. Speaker, and talk about a number of things that really concern me and many Americans across the country. That concern is: Why has the President not released his tax returns? Why is he so concerned about the Mueller investigation into the interference by the Russians in our elections? What is it that is being hidden? What are people afraid of? And why continue to threaten the FBI, threaten Mr. Mueller, threaten Mr. Rosenstein, threaten the Department of Justice, and, really, the police that are trying to get to the bottom of the interference by Russia in our elections. b1745 And so I think we have got to take a look at exactly what has happened so far in that investigation. And that investigation with Special Counsel Mueller has resulted now in the guilty pleas of Michael Flynn, National Security Advisor; Rick Gates, former Trump campaign adviser; George Papadopoulos, former foreign affairs adviser to the Trump campaign; Richard Pinedo, a gentleman who committed identity fraud in the Russian probe; and an attorney named Alex van der Zwaan. Currently under indictment are Paul Manafort, former Trump campaign chairman, 13 Russian nationals, and three Russian entities. Now, why is this important? Congresswoman FOXX was talking about opioids. That clearly is important. Jobs and economic security of this Nation is something that I like to be talking about, or doing away with the opioid epidemic. But what is important about this comes down to the very pillars of America, the pillars of freedom, liberty, and independence. Because if another nation is directing the outcomes of our election, those key pieces of who we are are threatened. We broke away from England to become a sovereign nation and not to be affected and ruled by some other country. So at the heart of this, it is about who we are as Americans, who we are as a country, to get to the bottom of Russian interference in our elections. What they did was unprecedented and is something that is bigger than the election of 2016, maybe the election of 2018. It is about our ability to govern ourselves without interference of somebody else, some other nation. In Congress, we passed an act that provided for additional sanctions against Russia because it is becoming more and more apparent of their interference with our elections. But the administration was reluctant to impose those sanctions. The question is, why? The Ambassador to the U.N., Nikki Haley, just recently with respect to sanctions said: We are going to increase sanctions because Russia may have had some role in Syria with the different chemical weapons that were used. And she went out so far as to say, we are going to impose some additional sanctions, but then had the rug pulled out from underneath her by the White House saying: Oh, wait a second. Even 
though you are somebody I appointed and you are our U.N. Ambassador, we think you are way ahead of yourselves on the sanctions against Russia. My question is: Why? What is it that is holding the White House back? I think it comes back to something I said at the very beginning, and something we asked for a year ago, which were the President’s tax returns, which we have yet to see. I mean, what is it that is in there that is so worrisome? Every other candidate for President, every other President turned over their tax returns. There is so much smoke here with these convictions, with these indictments, with what we know in terms of the interference in many States across the Nation, that we have got to get to the bottom of this. The continued threats that have come from the White House to stall or limit the investigation, the ability of the law enforcement officers of this Nation, the FBI, for goodness’ sake, to do their job, is something none of us could have ever expected. And so even though most of us would much rather talk about jobs, we would rather talk about the environment. We would rather be dealing with subjects that affect daytoday Americans, everyday Americans. The problem is the values of this Nation are under attack, the freedom, liberty, and independence that we enjoy that is so key to everything we believe in that we are not going to let this go. We are going to stand up for the rule of law and for honesty, and for allowing law enforcement to finish its job without being constantly threatened. Mr. Speaker, I am joined by a number of my friends who also have similar concerns to the ones I have raised. I would like to yield to my friend Mr. BOYLE from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the Congressman for that city, and allow him some time to bring us his thoughts and raise his concerns. Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from Colorado who has done such a wonderful job of organizing us, month in and month out, to stand here on the House floor, really, more than anything, in a sincere and genuine effort to attempt to prevent a constitutional crisis from happening. It is vital—not as Democrats or as Republicans, but as Americans—it is vital that we allow this special counsel investigation to continue and to reach its natural conclusions, whatever the facts may show. I certainly hope, and I believe, that all of us should hope that it won’t show collusion; that it won’t show anything more than what has been reported about interference in our 2016 elections. But it is vital to the integrity of our democracy and our national security that we know that for sure. Now, one would think—given the record interference, really attack, from the Russian Federation upon the United States during the 2016 election, just as they have in other country’s elections, such as Germany, France, and of course repeatedly on the Ukraine—one would think that the President of the United States would say, yes, we must get to the bottom of this. Instead, this President has not once asked his staff—as far as we know, and as has been verified by folks like the Director of the DNI and the Director of the CIA—has not once made it the mission of the U.S. to combat this interference. That is worrying. We also know now that on two separate occasions, the President has seriously considered firing the special counsel. That is exactly what President Nixon did in October of 1973, what has been called the Saturday Night Massacre, that prompted a constitutional crisis then. It would prompt a constitutional crisis today. Now, the President keeps calling the Mueller investigation a witch hunt, which is interesting because that is the exact term that President Nixon used. And if you look at headlines from that day, it was exactly the same term Nixon used. But the President calls it a witch hunt and says it hasn’t produced anything. So far, the investigation of the special counsel has produced 17 indictments, including 5 guilty pleas—some witch hunt. I don’t think those 17 individuals under indictment consider that a witch hunt and, certainly, the 5 individuals who have already pled guilty, including one who worked in this White House. So I will pause there, because I know there are a number of our colleagues who want to speak on this important issue. This is something that should unite us all. I am appreciative to those Republican colleagues, especially in the Senate, who have spoken out publicly and say that they support the Mueller investigation and support the independence and integrity of it, but it is time that we don’t just say that we support it. I do think it is time that we have legislation that protects it so that we can ensure that this investigation will reach its natural conclusion. Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, and I say to my friend from Pennsylvania—we were talking about the indictments and the guilty pleas—the last time we really had a special counsel appointed was in 2003, and it took 2 years for one indictment. We are a year into this investigation, and we have got 5 guilty pleas and 17 additional indictments. So we ought to be all taking real stock of what is actually happening here. I now yield to my friend from Missouri, EMANUEL CLEAVER , one of my best buddies here in the House, former mayor of Kansas City, Missouri, for his thoughts on this subject. Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, I am thankful that we have this moment that we are using to make some expressions of concern, and I thank Mr. PERLMUTTER for organizing it. Let me preface my comments, Mr. Speaker, by saying that when President Trump was elected, against the advice and concern of my family, my many campaign workers, and supporters, I attended the swearing in because I believed—and still believe and will always believe—that my responsibility as a Member of Congress was to be at the inauguration as a Member of Congress. Then at the first joint session—not the State of the Union, but the joint session—many of my friends and family said: You know, do not go. The President is alien to our concept of decency and democracy. I came anyway. I sat not too far from where I am standing now. I also then went to the State of the Union. Some of our colleagues chose not to come. When there were Articles of Impeachment placed on the table for a vote, I voted to table it against a person I have known in Congress longer than I have known anybody else because I know he is a decent and thoughtful person, Congressman AL GREEN . He had brought it to the floor. I voted to table it, along with just about every Republican and a sizeable number of Democrats, and the reason was, I believed that it was important for Mr. Mueller to complete his investigation. I resent any discussion about trying to impeach the President. I am not in that group. I must say, however, how troubled I am by many of the things that I have seen. And when I grew up down in Texas in the 1950s and 1960s, in elementary school at the Booker T. Washington Elementary School, we had these tests. Back then, there was a great threat from Russia. And economically, Wichita Falls, where I attended high school, was completely dependent on Sheppard Air Force Base for its survival. My first job was at the SAC base, the Strategic Air Command. I cleaned up. I thought it was the biggest job any human being could get. I was 15 years old and, man, I was big time. I cleaned up the barracks for the SAC Command. And then at school, we had to get under our desks for a drill for an attack from Russia. And we would hear the horn. All over town, schoolkids were getting under their desks. The truth is, we all would have been burned up. I am not sure that a wooden desk was going to protect us. But I was a kid and I didn’t know any better, so all of us got under our desks. But it allowed me to understand one thing, and I have never forgotten it: At that time, Russia, the Soviet Union, was not our friend. And over that period, a lot of things have changed. That has not changed. And so let’s fast forward to our last Presidential election. It is indisputable. Every single intelligence agency in the United States, as well as intelligence agencies with our allies in 
Europe, say that the Russians interfered with our election—not attempted to do so, but interfered. b1800 Did they change the outcome of the election? There is no evidence to support that. However, there is plenty of evidence to support that Russia remains the enemy of the United States of America. I necessarily am going to become increasingly concerned when the President of the United States refuses to say even one bad thing about Vladimir Putin, who is—and I don’t like to call people names—I don’t call my colleagues bad names; that is not who I am—this man is a bully and a danger to the entire world. The most troubling moments I have are when I hear people say, as I did on TV the other night, they were interviewing a woman and she said: ‘‘I don’t care anything about Russian meddling. All I want them to do is just let Mr. Trump have his agenda approved.’’ And I am thinking: What is happening to this Republic? I have five grandchildren, the youngest of which just turned three last month. My work in Congress, my ministry in the United Methodist Church for 37 years, my time on the city council, my time as mayor, all was dedicated to what I wanted for my grandchildren. I want them to enjoy the same kind of freedoms that we enjoyed. Mr. Speaker, anybody who is watching this and who has even a semblance of objectivity would have to say something is dramatically wrong when the President will, by Twitter, attack anybody and everybody—horses, children, little animals—anybody he will criticize and call them names, except Vladimir Putin. Vladimir Putin is the only person he will not criticize. This man orchestrated an attempt to damage our democracy. What Putin did—and it was brilliant—I have to say he is a devilish man, but he created a beautiful way of doing it. He knew the weaknesses of the United States and so he tried to exploit it. And it is still going on. For example, just a few weeks ago, one of those Russian bots had a deal on the internet advising White Americans not to go and see the movie Black Panther. Inside this message online is that African Americans are attacking white moviegoers. Now, of course, that didn’t happen, it is not even remotely the truth, but Russia understands how to get to us. They look at our weaknesses and they attack. We cannot help in that process. Mr. Mueller needs to complete his investigation. I will never support doing anything legally in this body until Mr. Mueller completes his investigation. I thank Mr. PERLMUTTER for getting us together. I think that we have got to make the American public conscious of what is going on and maybe, more importantly, what is not going on. If we are able to do that, this Republic, the greatest Republic that God Almighty has ever blessed to exist, the greatest Republic in the history of this planet, is going to be in jeopardy. Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Missouri, and his words, as always, are powerful and right on the mark. We think this is serious business and it is nothing that we take lightly. My friend, Mr. HUFFMAN from California, is somebody who has given this a lot of thought, and he wonders why the President doesn’t speak out against Vladimir Putin, he wonders why the President hasn’t turned over his tax returns, he wonders why the President has attacked the FBI, he wonders why the President has attacked the Department of Justice, just as I do. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. HUFFMAN ), my friend. Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Colorado for his leadership and convening these conversations. It was really helpful to hear from our friend from Missouri, who reminds us that this is really a big deal, this Russian meddling, and that we have to keep pushing to get answers as to why our President behaves so strangely when it comes to Russia, and we have to hold anyone who may have been part of that Russian interference fully accountable. I will tell Congressman PERLMUTTER  that constituents in my district, and I think a growing number of people around this country, are extremely concerned and growing more and more concerned about this dark cloud of corruption over the Trump administration; about the possibility of collusion between the Trump team and a foreign government to affect the 2016 election; about the obstruction of justice, the pattern of lying about even the most basic facts; and just based on what has already come out through the special counsel investigation and through the media and, to some extent, through congressional investigations, their level of concern is really growing. This week, I want to focus on one aspect of these investigations that we have tried to push here in the House and in the Senate: the issue of privilege. I am not talking about the kind of privilege where a billionaire’s son inlaw gets a job inside the White House, even though he has no foreign policy experience and can’t get a security clearance. That is a different kind of privilege. I want to talk about the issue of executive privilege. This is an idea that Presidential communications need to be kept out of the public eye, even when Congress or the courts issue subpoenas and request that information. Presidents have always kind of tried to claim that this type of privilege is implied in the Constitution’s separation of powers. It is an argument that a President might not get as candid and fulsome advice from his Cabinet and others if all of it was going to be publicly disclosed. So I can appreciate that. But the Trump administration has taken this notion of executive privilege to extreme and absurd lengths. I think we need to talk about that. Just a little quick historical aside, though, on executive privilege. The concept and the limit of executive privilege has really only been tested at the Supreme Court in a pair of Watergaterelated lawsuits in the 1970s. This came about when the special prosecutor sought access to President Nixon’s secret Oval Office tapes. In that case, the court rejected President Nixon’s attempts to quash a judicial subpoena. The unanimous decision of that court was that the President had to hand over these taperecorded conversations with his closest advisers about the Watergate breakin. Of course, we know that was the beginning of the end of the Nixon Presidency. So back to the modern era. Over the past year, we have seen numerous Trump officials, and even some who never worked in the White House, refuse to answer questions from Congress, asserting some variation of this executive privilege. In the nowdefunct House Intelligence Committee investigation we have seen it. We have seen it in the Senate Intelligence Committee investigation. I think we need to take a look at how this is being used or misused. We have seen witnesses, literally on a break from their testimony, take phone calls from the White House, where they get instructions about what questions they can answer and which ones they can’t. Essentially, President Trump has treated the executive privilege as if it is a gag order he can invoke on those around him. It is sort of like the hush money nondisclosure agreements that he has entered into with porn stars and playmates and all sorts of others to keep embarrassing or damaging information out of the public eye. A few specific examples of this and why it doesn’t hold up. In June 2017, Attorney General Jeff Sessions was testifying before the Senate committee about the firing of James Comey. He refused to answer certain questions, but he did choose to answer others that he thought were helpful. He claimed that he was protecting the right of President Trump to assert the executive privilege. Well, first of all, Sessions can’t selectively choose when to invoke the privilege and when not to. There is this thing called waiver, and you don’t get to cherrypick the stuff that you think helps you and then invoke the privilege for the stuff that doesn’t. But the second point is that the Attorney General even admitted that he does not have the power to claim executive privilege. He said: ‘‘I am protecting the President’s constitutional right by not giving it away before he has had a chance to weigh in.’’ The President hasn’t done that. In fact, the President has yet to assert 
the executive privilege, but he has had all of these other folks on a short leash, counting on them to assert the privilege. So then we go to January of 2018. Steve Bannon was testifying in the House Intelligence Committee. He only agreed to answer 25 specific yes or no questions that had been drafted by the White House. So, on a bipartisan basis, the committee issued a subpoena to force Bannon to answer these questions, but he continued to stonewall and the committee never followed through. Again, why Bannon’s assertions of the privilege don’t pencil out. In the United States v. Nixon, the Supreme Court made very clear that public extrajudicial disclosure of a privilege like the executive privilege is a waiver. So right off the bat you have the problem that Steve Bannon spilled his guts in ‘‘Fire and Fury’’ for the whole world to see. He has made public extrajudicial disclosures of all manner of communications involving the Presidency on all of these subjects. But he has also played this pickandchoose game, much like Attorney General Sessions. Even if he had the privilege to assert for himself, which he doesn’t, it just doesn’t hold water. Now, some of the oversight that Bannon has been ducking has to do with the transition period before Donald Trump was even President. Obviously, there is no executive privilege if you are not yet the executive. So that is another problem. When he was asked whether he was being instructed by the President to invoke executive privilege, guess what? He refused to answer. Our friends in the House Intelligence Committee were in such a hurry to shut down their investigation that they did not move to hold him in contempt of Congress, and they never followed through on their subpoena. Another example. January 2018, Mr. Trump’s former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, appeared before the House Intel Committee and surprise, surprise, he refused to answer all sorts of important questions. Since Mr. Lewandowski never served in the Federal Government, it would be pretty preposterous to assert executive privilege as a way to evade Congress’ questions. But it is up to the majority in Congress to actually force him to answer these questions. Again, Mr. Trump is onto, apparently, a winning strategy in this Congress. He instructs others not to answer questions, suggests they should assert the privilege, or some variation of it, and then counts on a compliant majority in this House and in the Senate to simply not follow through. Something similar happened in February 2018. Hope Hicks, the White House communications director, was testifying before the House Intelligence Committee and would not discuss anything from the inauguration forward. The committee declined to issue a subpoena, despite the request to do so from our ranking member, ADAM SCHIFF . So you may ask in these various situations: Why wouldn’t President Trump himself simply assert the executive privilege? I think one reason for that is we can safely say that it makes him look even more guilty. That is hard to do, based on the way he has conducted himself so defensively with such a seemingly guilty state of mind in his tweets and other public statements, but the assertion of the privilege would be a very clear signal that he is trying to impede legitimate investigations. So he would rather have Bannon and Hicks and Lewandowski and Sessions stonewall for him, and then count on a compliant hyperpartisan Congress not to follow through. That is why we have so many unanswered questions and why it is so important that you continue to bring us together to talk about this to make sure the American people know that we are going to keep talking about it and we are going to keep asking what they are hiding and what they are afraid of. Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I will wrap up here, but I think there is one word we ought to change, because the word doesn’t justify or doesn’t really describe what occurred with these elections. What occurred with the elections by the Russians was not meddling. It was sabotage. That is really what we are talking about. It wasn’t just somebody saying to your motherinlaw: ‘‘Please don’t meddle in my business.’’ This is sabotage. This was an attack. This was interference and a violation of our sovereignty, of our independence, of our freedom. So we start with that, and then we ask these questions of my friends on the Republican side: Had the tables been turned and this was a Democratic administration, can you imagine what kinds of investigations would be underway today, what kinds of subpoenas would be issued, and not to allow the Intelligence Committee to shut down that investigation when none of the questions were answered because of this innovation of executive privilege that they don’t hold, because this is much bigger than all of us. b1815 Representative CLEAVER talked about the fact that Russia is interfering, all around the world. They are not our friends. I would love to see something develop where there really is some kind of an alliance, but we definitely don’t have that now. There are a lot of questions: Where are the tax returns? Why haven’t they been presented to the Congress? Why are we not fulfilling the law that we passed on sanctions? Why are we holding back even though Nikki Haley said we are going to issue more sanctions concerning Russia’s role in Syria? Why the continued attacks by the administration against our FBI, our chief and best law enforcement agency? Why continue to undermine the investigations? These are serious questions, and they can’t be swept under the rug. This is serious business. It goes to the heart of the values of this Nation, of freedom and independence. We have got a lot of work to do. I hope there is a bright light shone on all of this and that these investigations run their full course to see exactly what has happened. Mr. Speaker, if my friend from California would like to close, I would offer him that opportunity. Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I will close on my end but with a bit of a question for my colleague: We have talked about how big this is. I think ‘‘sabotage’’ is not too strong a word for what the Russians did in the 2016 election. I think anyone who was involved in a criminal conspiracy with them to pull that off, certainly there are criminal penalties, violations, possibly up to and including treason, that may apply. So we have to get to the bottom of this. We have to get to the truth. And if Congress won’t do its job because of partisan reasons and won’t follow through and hold folks in contempt when they ignore subpoenas and when they refuse to answer questions, we can at least protect the special counsel investigation so that that lifelong Republican leading this investigation can get the truth out for the American people. Mr. Speaker, I guess my question for Congressman PERLMUTTER is: Given how big this is—and we have never seen anything like this. We have never seen all of this evidence that a candidate for President—folks at the top of his campaign were involved in these illicit activities with a foreign power, this extensive sabotaging of our election, and all of the coverup and the obstruction and other problems that are coming to light. Given all of that, how will history judge those who refuse to let the special counsel get to the bottom of it all so we can all know the truth? Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I hold out hope for all of the Members of this body to want to have the truth and allow this investigation to run its course. And I hope and expect that the Members—Democrats and Republicans—will support and protect the special counsel, the Department of Justice, and the FBI so that the lawyers and the cops on the beat can finish this investigation. And that is what is key. So I hope that it turns out that there isn’t anything else, that it is 5 guilty pleas, it is 17 indictments, and that is it; we are done. But I don’t expect that to be the case either. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. TAYLOR ). Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. 
GENOCIDE AWARENESS AND PREVENTION MONTH The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. WAGNER) for 30 minutes. 
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Missouri? There was no objection. Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in honor of Genocide Awareness and Prevention Month. Today we remember the millions of victims of genocide throughout history, and we recommit to working toward the day when genocide and massatrocity crimes are not only inconceivable, Mr. Speaker, but they are nonexistent. April marks the commemorations of some of the worst genocides in history, including the Holocaust and Rwandan, Cambodian, and Armenian genocides. Time and again, senseless bloodshed has ended innocent lives and fractured families and livelihoods. My hometown, St. Louis, is home to the largest Bosnian community outside of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This community has shaped what the city looks and feels like. It has added great cultural diversity to the city, immense intellectual capital, thriving small businesses, and a strong religious presence. Two decades ago, members of our Bosnian community were refugees. In 1995, Orthodox Serbs, under the command of General Ratko Mladic, initiated a horrific ethnic cleansing campaign against majority Muslim Bosniaks. The escalating bloodshed forced 130,000 Bosnian refugees to seek new lives in the United States. Thousands were murdered in Srebrenica. Today I wish to honor these brave men and women. The resilience of our Bosnian neighbors has enriched our city, and their courage inspires me. It has inspired me to seek change. Tomorrow I am offering an amendment to the State Department Authorization Act of 2018 asking the administration to study countries at risk of genocide and massatrocity crimes and craft training regimens for U.S. Foreign Service officers. Should this bill become law, America’s diplomats will have the knowhow to respond to those conflicts on the ground and act before violence spirals out of control. Most importantly, this amendment establishes that the official policy of the United States of America is to regard the prevention of genocide and atrocity crimes as a core national security interest. However, this is just one step in the right direction. The U.S. Government must improve how it responds to conflicts. Last April, I introduced the Elie Wiesel Genocide and Atrocities Prevention Act to improve U.S. efforts to prevent massatrocity crimes, named after the courageous Auschwitz survivor. The legislation honors the legacy of Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel and his life work to fight evil around the world. Mr. Wiesel was just 15 years old when the Nazis deported him and his family to Auschwitz. He was the only member of his family to survive. Having witnessed the near total destruction of his people, he spent his life defending the persecuted. In his honor, we fight to rectify injustice and protect the most vulnerable in our society and across the globe. As Mr. Wiesel understood so well, the true horror of genocide is that it is preventable, and the U.S. Government has the tools to effect real change. The Elie Wiesel Act would affirm the mission of the United States Atrocities Prevention Board and its work to coordinate prevention and response efforts. It would also authorize the Complex Crisis Fund to support agile, efficient responses to unforeseen crises overseas. This time, when America says ‘‘never again,’’ our actions will reinforce our platitudes and our words. I thank the Chair, Mr. Speaker, and I thank all of my colleagues who share in this fight. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN ). Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague, the gentlewoman from Missouri, for her leadership. I am honored to join her and other distinguished colleagues this evening in recognition of Genocide Awareness and Prevention Month. Preventing genocide and mass atrocities is a moral imperative that deserves to be at the very top of our priority list. Mass atrocities are large scale, deliberate attacks against civilian populations. They include genocide but also crimes against humanity, war crimes, and ethnic cleansing. After the Holocaust—the systematic, bureaucratic, statesponsored persecution and murder of 6 million Jews and members of other persecuted groups by the Nazi regime and its collaborators between 1941 and 1945—people all around the world vowed to never again stand by in the face of genocide; but since then, mass atrocities, including genocide, have been committed in Indonesia, Cambodia, Guatemala, East Timor, the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda, Sudan, and South Sudan, among other places. Hundreds of thousands of people have been murdered, tortured, disappeared, or suffered sexual violence; and millions more have been forced to flee with profound humanitarian, political, and national security consequences. I don’t believe the world’s failure to prevent atrocities is because no one cares. In this era of instant communication powered by social media, most people I meet have seen and passionately condemn the ongoing atrocities in Syria and elsewhere. Nor is it because no one knows what is happening. Many, many people warned us for years about the potential for genocide against the Rohingya in Burma. The problem is that we have not been very good at turning knowledge and moral indignation into action to prevent a bad situation from worsening. We must do better. We must do more. This year, in the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission, which I cochair along with my colleague Congressman RANDY HULTGREN , we are looking at the tools we have as U.S. policymakers to prevent mass atrocities and asking how we can strengthen them. We are asking what it would mean to institutionalize an atrocity prevention’s lens so we don’t wait until it is so late and the problem is so big that all we can do is lament the immorality and the inhumanity and then provide humanitarian aid to the victims and survivors. As we undertake this effort, we know that there is a lot of good work already underway in both Chambers of Congress and on both sides of the aisle to find new ways forward. One example is H.R. 3030, the Elie Wiesel Genocide and Atrocities Prevention Act of 2017, led by Representative ANNWAGNER and cosponsored by both myself and Representative HULTGREN . We also recognize that government officials cannot do this work alone. We need civil society, in all its diversity, to help us. We need community associations, churches, synagogues, mosques, schools, and businesses to take a stand against hate speech, to teach and live tolerance, to document and denounce human rights violations, to open their hearts to reconciliation based on justice. We need to get to the point where our societies recognize and honor every person’s innate human dignity. And I want to take this opportunity to salute one of the many organizations that are doing just this kind of work. STAND is a studentled movement to end mass atrocities and genocide by organizing and educating their peers and communities. I first met student leaders of STAND in 2005 and 2006, when they were part of the national movement that brought the genocide happening in Darfur, Sudan, to public awareness. They were my teachers during that time. Tonight, representatives of STAND are here listening to this debate. They push us to do better, and I thank them for their commitment and their vision. Mr. Speaker, mass atrocities are human rights violations on a grand scale. We must find new strategies to prevent them from happening and more effective strategies to interrupt and stop them at the very earliest stages, should they begin to unfold. Mr. Speaker, all of us in this Chamber, all of us in this country, need to do more, because I believe, if the United States of America stands for anything, we stand for human rights. We need to be better. We need to be more effective in preventing these mass atrocities and these genocides. 
So I am very proud to stand with my colleagues in these efforts. I want to thank the gentlewoman from Missouri for her incredible leadership, and I am honored to participate in this Special Order with her. Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN ) for his outstanding words and his support, his support and that of Representative RANDY  HULTGREN on sponsoring and cosponsoring with me my piece of legislation, the Elie Wiesel Genocide and Atrocities Prevention Act. This truly is an issue that is not just about human rights and giving voice to the voiceless and speaking for the most vulnerable in our society; it is about human dignity across our globe. b1830 It is about the U.S. responding to these conflicts in the way that only we can and should do and provide the kind of moral authority and support to do so through both our Congress and through our foreign service officers and others who are working across the globe. So I thank the gentleman for his fine words. I now yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. TENNEY ). Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman ANNWAGNER for yielding. She is a wonderful inspiration to me as a new Member. I also want to thank Congressman MCGOVERN for his comments. This is really important that she is hosting tonight’s Special Order on genocide awareness and prevention. During the month of April, we joined together to honor victims and survivors to educate the public about genocide—it is hard to believe it is happening in our time—and to advocate for the prevention of future atrocities. In the past 150 years, tens of millions of men, women, and children have lost their lives during brutal genocides and mass atrocities. Millions have been tortured, raped, and forced from their homes. Some of the darkest moments in world history have occurred, oddly enough, in the month of April. In April 1933, the Nazi Party began its boycott of Jewishowned businesses. This marked the beginning of a campaign of hatred that led to the murder of 6 million Jews. My district is home to thousands of refugees from the former Yugoslavia. I have a long history with Yugoslavia. I began my study of the country of Yugoslavia in 1981 when I first participated as a student, a college student from Colgate University, in a semester abroad, and we traveled throughout the entire Yugoslavia and all the different principalities and republics. It was a spectacular and beautiful country, and it sparked a lifelong interest for me in this region. I completely fell in love with the country and was fascinated by the people who were there who survived conquests, whether it was from the Ottoman Empire to being part of so many other parts of human history. They were also victims during the Nazi invasion, as well, during World War II. I had the lucky opportunity to graduate from college and work as a foreign correspondent in the Press and Cultural Office of the former Yugoslav Consulate in New York. I also worked, at that time, alongside with ABC Sports during the Winter Olympics held in Sarajevo in 1984. The war in Yugoslavia was a tragic saga in the history of human experience, especially for me, with my long history and love of the country and the people who inhabited this part of world. I worked with people from the consulate, from all the republics and autonomous provinces from the former Yugoslavia. It just seemed unthinkable to me that this human genocide could occur in a region of the world which had experienced many occupying forces due to its very unique, very important geopolitical, strategic location in the world. Yugoslavia was always known as the gateway between East and West, the place where you could get from Europe through Yugoslavia to, eventually, the Middle East along the Mediterranean. This region had diverse culture, religion, and people from all parts of Europe and the Middle East, and the world all united together for centuries, actually, living alongside each other with different values. Certainly, they had their differences. But sadly, unfortunately, after all this history of unrest, the war in Yugoslavia eventually elicited the worst in humankind and was witness to one of the most horrific genocides in our generation against Bosnian citizens. To the Bosnian community, April, again, marks 26 years since the beginning of the siege in Sarajevo, Bosnia. The horrific period of violence lasted for over 3
1⁄2years and was the longest siege in modern warfare. All told, over 10,000 people, including 1,500 children, were killed in Sarajevo during the siege. In 1995, the worst massacre within Europe since World War II took place. The Srebrenica massacre killed more than 8,000 Bosnian boys and men during the Bosnian War. In addition to these horrific killings, more than 20,000 civilians were expelled from the area. Many of these Bosnian refugees immigrated to my region. We are thrilled to have them. It is just worth noting that my son was actually a student in the afterschool program at the Jewish Community Center in my area. The Jewish Community Center was actually instrumental in helping to find safe refuge in our community for these Bosnian Muslims who were suffering from this unconscionable genocide and atrocities against them. I think it was the solidarity and the sympathy and the understanding, the true understanding of genocide that our Jewish citizens recognized in our region, and we are grateful to them. And we are also grateful to the Bosnian community for the decision to have so many wonderful Bosnian families visit our city and now remain as citizens. They provided the same ingenuity and the entrepreneurship and the vibrancy and the creativity that I remembered during my days of studying this very special part of the world. I am especially grateful to them for enabling me to sustain the bond that developed between me, my family, who have all traveled to that part of the world, and this amazing group of people for the past 37 years of my life. It has become almost a vocation for me, just my study of SerboCroatian and my study of this region. As we mark these tragedies of the past, we must not overlook what is taking place in the present. I just want to mention a little bit about my city, Utica, New York. It has been recognized as one of the friendly cities to refugees. The Utica City School District now has over 42 languages spoken, and so we have a number of people coming from war torn areas where, very graciously and also very generously, our communities have accepted them and provided them a home. I want to just highlight one of the communities that is in our region as well, and those are the people from Myanmar, where over 700,000 Rohingya people have fled the Rakhine State in the face of expulsions and violent persecution at the hands of government forces. In Syria, Bashar alAssad’s military butchers its own citizens and uses chemical weapons without regard for international law. Under this dark cloud of atrocities and massive human rights violations, both present and past, I just want to join with my colleagues today in remembering these and remembering to ensure that these lessons are never forgotten, but more important, if we could only make sure they are never repeated. I sincerely thank my colleague, Congresswoman ANNWAGNER , for her great leadership on this issue, her tenacity and her courage and her continued fight to try to help these people who are the most needy, who have just been victimized in our society and across our country and our world. I thank her for including me tonight. It is very special for me to especially recognize the Bosnians. It has been such a long part of my history, and my heart and my sympathy go to these wonderful people who suffered unfairly. I just want to say thank you again to Mrs. WAGNER for her great leadership on this issue. Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her kind words. The gentlewoman from New York (Ms. TENNEY ) is also a leader in this cause and this effort that is really about, as we said, human dignity and human rights across this world. 
We want a day when no longer are these refugees suffering, whether it is in Syria. On the day that President Macron addressed a joint session here in this very Chamber, the President of the People’s Republic of France, that stood with the United States, along with the United Kingdom, in the bombings against Syria that were targeted against those who had been barrel bombed and victimized and murdered by the Assad regime in Syria. We share a common bond with the Bosnian community. We both have very large Bosnian communities, many of whom started out as refugees some 20 years ago. Now, as I said, the cultural diversity, the business, the religious presence has been just wonderful to see flourish in a district like Missouri’s Second Congressional District, so I recognize the common bond that we have there. I thank Ms. TENNEY for participating in this Special Order that goes to the heart of genocide and mass atrocities across our globe. I know that the people of Ms. TENNEY ’s district in New York are also appreciative of all she does there to represent them and those who are the most vulnerable in our society, so I thank the gentlewoman from New York. I now yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT ). Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Missouri for yielding. It is Genocide Awareness and Prevention Month, and the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. WAGNER ) has been a leader in speaking out on this critical issue for many years now, and we appreciate her leadership on that. As a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, I have had the opportunity to advocate for global human rights issues for many years. Tonight, I want to condemn a genocide that has been happening before our eyes: the genocide against the Rohingya in Rakhine State, Burma. Last September, the Burmese military began a socalled clearing operation, allegedly in response to some insurgent attacks. In reality, this was just an excuse for a massive and barbaric campaign to forcibly remove the Rohingya from Burma altogether and erase their memory from the Rakhine State once and for all, resulting in over 700,000 Rohingya, many of whom are children, fleeing Burma for Bangladesh. This has needlessly left Bangladesh and the world with one of the worst humanitarian crises that the world faces today. While these numbers are truly shocking, as we learn more about the crimes committed by the Burmese military, there can be no doubt that this is, in fact, genocide. When the Rohingya arrived in Bangladesh, they told story after story of the crimes that they had witnessed and that they had personally suffered: widespread killings, mass graves, rapes, and other unspeakable horrors and injuries. These atrocities have been confirmed by many people who had no ax to grind here or anything, So this is something that the world must see and must believe. In addition, hundreds of villages have been burned and others have been simply bulldozed in a clear attempt to prevent the Rohingya from ever returning. Together, these heinous acts are a deliberate attempt to irreparably harm the Rohingya. This is absolutely genocide. Together with Mr. ENGEL and Mr. CROWLEY , our colleagues here in the House, I have helped to lead the House’s efforts to address this crisis. With our passage of H. Con. Res 90, the House unequivocally condemned the Burmese military’s atrocious actions, but more serious action is still needed. Burma’s constitution allows the Burmese military to control much of the government, and civilian leadership has taken virtually no real steps to address this violence. That is why I joined again with Mr. ENGEL and Mr. CROWLEY to introduce the BURMA Act, which applies tough, targeted sanctions on the individuals involved in leading this genocide. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation and then, ultimately, of course, to vote for it when the time comes. As we remember the victims of all genocides this month, we must work to adequately address one which is unfolding right before our eyes, right before the world’s eyes right now. So, again, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Missouri for calling this particular action to the attention of our colleagues and the attention of the world, but also other genocides and other atrocities that have occurred across the globe. She is truly a leader, and we are lucky to have her doing that in Congress on an everyday basis, but also, in particular, this evening. Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT ) for his kind words. He is a leader and a senior member of our House Foreign Affairs Committee, and I also have the privilege of serving on it. It is an honor to have Congressman CHABOT here at this Special Order during Genocide Awareness and Prevention Month to give voice to those millions of victims and to say we live for a time when this is nonexistent in society. I look forward, Mr. Speaker, tomorrow, to offering my amendment to the State Department Authorization Act of 2018, asking the administration to study countries at risk of genocide and mass atrocity crimes and crafting the kind of training regimens for U.S. foreign service officers that are so very important. I look forward to the time when my piece of legislation, the Elie Wiesel Genocide and Atrocities Prevention Act, will, Mr. Speaker, be signed into law. It will improve the U.S. efforts to prevent mass atrocity crimes, and I think we all, in this Chamber, on a bipartisan level, Mr. Speaker, continue to hope and, more importantly, to work towards a time when America says, ‘‘Never again,’’ and our actions reinforce our words. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for coming out. I thank those advocates on the Friends Committee on National Legislation’s stand. Together we remember the Carl Wilkens Fellowship and so many others that stand with the victims of genocide and mass atrocities. It is an honor to be with my colleagues here tonight and with the advocacy groups that stand for the millions that say, ‘‘Never again.’’ Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. f
