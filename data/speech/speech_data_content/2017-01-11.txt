Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, a strong, safe, reliable, and efficient infrastructure system is vital for robust and sustained economic growth. Comprehensive infrastructure reform is allinclusive and requires an ongoing investment by the Federal Government in not just our roads and bridges but in all of the vital systems that support our way of life. Currently, the United States needs around $3.6 trillion in infrastructure investment by 2020, just to keep our country in a state of good repair. By contrast, China, perhaps our greatest international rival, spends nearly four times of its GDP on infrastructure than we do and announced nearly a trillion dollars more infrastructure spending just last year. Put simply, our national infrastructure system is an embarrassment, earning a Dplus grade from the American Society of Civil Engineers. It is a threat to our economy, to American jobs, to our national security, and to our environment. We need a public transportation system that gets people where they need to be, keeps our roads clear, and makes our cities better places to live. We need a freight system that moves products and raw materials quickly, safely, and efficiently. We need airways that reliably move people and cargo around the country and the world in a timely manner. We need river locks and ports that allow American farmers to ship their products to market, no matter where that is. We need water pipes and sewers that transport safe, clean water to every American. And we need to close the broadband gap so that every American can take advantage of the opportunities the Internet provides. Investing in America’s infrastructure is good politics, good economics, and the right thing to do. Each year, Americans take around 11 billion trips on public transportation systems like buses, commuter rail, and light rail, contributing to the $58 billion industry that employs nearly half a million people. And yet, almost half of our Nation’s buses and a quarter of our rail assets are in marginal or poor condition. My city of Chicago is the crossroads for the Nation’s freight system, and each day more than 54 million tons of freight is moved across the U.S., and nearly a quarter of it passes through the Chicago city limits—at times, very slowly. We stand to lose $1 trillion a year in lost sales in 2020, if we fail to build out our freight infrastructure to keep pace with future growth. Congestion is also an issue at our Nation’s airports. Ground delays are becoming a greater challenge as more and more people fly regularly. These delays can have a very serious consequence, resulting in passengers being late to their destinations, lost productivity from cargo sitting on runways, and increased pollution due to needlessly burning jet fuel. In addition to air and ground, we must also talk about our waterways. Each year millions of tons of material traverse inland waterways like the Mississippi River and the Saint Lawrence Seaway. But, according to the Army Corps of Engineers, there is a billion dollar maintenance backlog that threatens to keep our waterways from maintaining adequate levels of performance. There are problems in our water and sewer systems, too. The 240,000 water main breaks that occur in this country each year cost us more than $2.6 billion; not to mention the lost productivity caused by closed roads, lost water, and other indirect impacts. Nearly all of the U.S. underground water pipes will reach or surpass their useful lifespans in the next decade. The longer we wait, the higher the price tag will become. Finally, we can use our infrastructure system to promote economic growth and economic equality, and one great way to do that is to close the broadband gap and increase access to highspeed Internet. As many as 50 million Americans live in areas without the ability to get highquality and useful Internet access. Extending the ability to get online benefits businesses, employees, students, and everyone else without this vital utility, all while spurring economic activities that ripple throughout the economy. 
The benefits of smart investment and infrastructure are massive. Every billion spent in infrastructure creates 13,000 jobs, in addition to improving the efficiency of the system. And every dollar invested generates almost $3 in economic activity. Conversely, the consequences of failing to act are dire. Each American household stands to lose $3,400 per year in disposable income thanks to infrastructure deficiencies. That is money taken directly from our constituents’ pockets, money they would use to support themselves and their families, not to mention the economy as a whole, which could lose more than $4 trillion in GDP and more than 2.5 million jobs by 2025. We owe it to each other and every one of our constituents to act. I urge the 115th Congress to prioritize infrastructure spending and pass a comprehensive package that addresses all aspects of the connected infrastructure system. 
WE MUST STAND WITH FREEDOM LOVING NATIONS AROUND THE WORLD The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. KINZINGER ) for 5 minutes. Mr. KINZINGER. Mr. Speaker, I was reflecting the other day. Last week, we all joined together in this Chamber, we held up our right hand, and we swore an oath to protect and defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. That is an oath I have taken both as a Member of Congress—now on my fourth term—and as a military pilot, something similar to that, talking about the importance of the military to protect and defend the Constitution. In both of these roles, I have seen firsthand the sacrifice that men and women of the military have been willing to make to defend their freedoms, to defend the Constitution, defend the country. This last month was especially tough for our Nation’s security and for our foreign policy. The 8year decline of American global leadership, under the President, came to a head. A sad trend built by the Obama administration continued as the White House worked with our enemies and abandoned our friends. For one, the recent ceasefire in Syria was reached without United States’ input, ultimately empowering tyrants in Iran and in Russia. In fact, to think about the situation in Syria, I want to remind people there are half a million dead Syrians right now, innocent civilians. And I have heard people say, completely incorrectly, that it doesn’t matter; they are all basically terrorists. Untrue. But let’s say it is. There are 50,000 children in Syria that did not get an opportunity to go be a teacher or a police officer or a firefighter or a doctor because of tyrants in Iran, because of Bashar al Assad and because of Russia empowering them and using precisionguided munitions to hit innocent civilians and take their life away. Last week, the U.S. abstained from a vote in the United Nations Security Council on the biased resolution targeting our ally Israel. Mr. Speaker, rather than turning on freedomloving nations around the world, we must stand with them. Nowhere is this more important than in the fight against terrorism. Before the holidays, a list went out from ISIS accounts with the names of churches in the United States that should be attacked over the holidays. Then, an attack in Berlin took the lives of 12 innocent civilians and injured more than 50 in a Christmas market. On New Year’s Eve, there was a savage attack at a nightclub in Istanbul, killing 39 revelers and injuring dozens. Both attacks were claimed by ISIS seeking to strike fear into freedomloving people around the world. While we all must remain vigilant, we cannot give in to that fear, and we must continue to live our lives. What we need right now, Mr. Speaker, is a renewed American moment, renewed American leadership after 8 years of decline. We need a Churchill moment. I think about Winston Churchill after the bombs rained down in London, and instead of hiding and cowering and talking about how terrible it is, he goes out on the streets, rallies the people, and says that you cannot shatter us. And the people unite behind him. It is time for America to exhibit the same kind of leadership exhibited by George W. Bush in the bullhorn speech after the fall of the World Trade Center. He showed Americans unity, strength, resolve, and he reminded the world that our foundations will not be shaken even if you shake the foundations of our biggest buildings. And you can shatter our steel, but you can’t shatter the steel of American resolve. I haven’t heard speeches like that in quite a while from the oval office. Mr. Speaker, it has been a rough election cycle for our country. It has been a tough, very divisive, and difficult time, but now it is time to come together. We are going to have our partisan differences and battles, and that is fine. That is what we are out here for. But, Mr. Speaker, America needs to remember our mission, our Godgiven mission. I believe that is to be an example of selfgovernance to billions of people that don’t have what we have, but are desperate for it. We used that kind of leadership in the cold war as millions lived behind the Iron Curtain and saw what freedom could be. And there are iron curtains that exist today; terrorism, strongmen, a resurgent Russia—an iron curtain of soft expectations and low expectations of people. For the last 8 years, we failed to articulate that mission. Mr. Speaker, we are a nation in need of remembering that mission, and it is my sincere hope that this will change very soon. f 
IMMIGRATION The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. GUTIE´RREZ ) for 5 minutes. Mr. GUTIE´RREZ. Mr. Speaker, as I have said before, we hope for the best from the new President, but we must prepare for the worst. Everyone who has looked at the record of the key advisers to President elect Trump on the issue of immigration has reason for very deep concern that the new President is going to follow the advice of some of the most extreme voices in the immigration debate. As for the new President himself, he is a bit of an unknown because he changes his mind on key issues just as quickly as his Twitter feed refreshes. He says he has a plan for this and a plan for that, but they are secret plans, and, as far as we know, they are even secrets to him. He knows more about computers and the Internet, ISIS and terrorists, Russia and NATO than all of the policy experts put together, and he thinks of himself as kind of the ultimate Presidential adviser to the new President. But it is Trump’s lieutenants who worry most of us. They are the most clearly ideological and dangerous set of leaders ever assembled in American Government on immigration and any number of issues we care about. They are vindictive when it comes to our immigrant community. The truth is that among the new President key advisers are some of the staunchest opponents of legal immigration. They are against legal immigration. That is right. While we all oppose illegal immigration, and some of us have been working for years to upgrade the American system so that immigrants come with visas instead of smugglers, the people with access to the Presidency disagree, and they don’t want immigrants to come here at all from anywhere. Look, we have made legal immigration extremely difficult for everyone and simply impossible for most people. And then we have been relying on deportation, walls, enforcement, and curtailing due process rights for immigrants, and that constitutes their immigration control strategy for the past 25 years. And it hasn’t worked for 25 years. But the American people want a humane, sustainable, secure, and effective legal immigration system and a way for people who already live and work here peacefully in America to be able to do so within the law. So, Mr. Speaker, this is why I will join a few thousand allies here in Washington this Saturday at the historic Metropolitan AME Church on M Street to send a clear message that immigrants and their allies are standing up for immigrant communities. 
And check out the Web site. The D.C. rally will be one of more than 50 public actions and marches across America on or about this Saturday the 14th, where leaders of the immigrant rights’ movement will stand alongside elected officials, faith, labor, education, and LGBTQ leaders to say: we will not allow mass deportation or immigrant roundups on our watch. b1015 That we do not want endless delays that keep families waiting 10, 15, 20 years for a visa. That we don’t want people to have to choose between 10 years in exile or the green card for which they qualify under U.S. law because our laws have been crafted to punish people by keeping them in an undocumented status even when they can apply to be here legally. That we are committed to defending immigrant communities if and when the new President and his henchmen develop Muslim registries or neighborhood sweeps or mass roundups disguised as ‘‘fugitive sweeps.’’ We will fight attempts to criminalize immigrants and fight attempts to take away documents from people who are now in the system and working on the books, like the 750,000 young people who signed up for DACA. With the BRIDGE Act, we will fight so that DREAMers are protected from deportation and can lead the fight for millions and millions of other immigrants who have no options under our current law. Let’s just be clear, 76 percent of Latinos in this country are citizens of the United States. So threequarters of us can vote or will soon be able to vote. And for Latinos under 18, the percentage of Latinos who are U.S. citizens is 93 percent. So don’t think you can deport us into silence. Don’t think that deporting everyone and eliminating legal immigration, as some in the new President’s circle may fantasize, will suddenly make Brown people disappear from America. We are here and we are joined by allies of every color, shape, national origin and segment of society. We are men, we are women, we are children, we are straight, we are gay and trans, rich and poor, old and young, and everything in between; and we are locking arms with all of our allies to say that when you come for any of us, we will force you to come for all of us. We are here to stay and we stand together. I ask all of those interested to please go to the Web site, www.togetherforimmigrants.com. Join us this Saturday. 
HONORING JUDGE ALLI B. MAJEED The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida (Mr. POSEY ) for 5 minutes. Mr. POSEY. Mr. Speaker, on a brighter, more positive, and nonpartisan side this morning, it is an honor and a pleasure to recognize the lifetime achievements of my longtime friend and a true patriotic citizen, Judge Alli B. Majeed, who has just retired after 24 years of service on the bench. He was the longest serving county judge in the 18th Judicial Circuit. That includes Florida’s Brevard and Seminole Counties. Judge Majeed, or A.B. as many of us know him, was born in the former British colony of Guyana, South America, to parents who were descendants of indentured servants from India. Having grown up in a small village, his family didn’t have much, and they worked hard for what little they did have. A.B. cherished the opportunity to attend and graduate from high school. In 1969, he came to the United States on a student visa. He was Phi Beta Kappa and graduated magna cum laude from Howard University here in Washington, D.C. In 1975, A.B. graduated from the Catholic University of America’s Columbus Law School. Alli became a U.S. citizen on November 16, 1979, and began his legal career working as an attorney and supervisor at Community Legal Services in Philadelphia, where he served the needy and indigent clients. He went on to work as a criminal attorney, assistant public defender, and assistant State attorney. I knew A.B. before he was appointed as a county judge in 1993 by thenGovernor Lawton Chiles to fill a vacancy and was subsequently reelected to new terms unopposed all but one time. Once on the bench, Judge Majeed became known as a competent and respected judge. He also became well known for his motivational and educational talks about the importance of jury duty to groups of new jurors, many of whom show up disenchanted about being selected to serve. As someone who has been a juror and has heard his talk firsthand more than once, I can promise you that it is extraordinary. No one in my pool of jurors looked forward to being called for jury duty, but after Judge Majeed’s patriotic, uplifting, and inspiring lesson, everyone became enthusiastic about the opportunity to serve. ‘‘We take an oath to obey, preserve, and protect the Constitution of the United States of America,’’ said Judge Majeed. To the Majeed family, this oath is serious business. He has three nephews who have served in our Nation’s Armed Forces: Steve Majeed, U.S. Navy; Rick Majeed, United States Air Force; and Omar Majeed, United States Marines. ‘‘I love this country,’’ he said. ‘‘We believe deeply in it.’’ In his letter of resignation to the chief justice of the State of Florida, Judge Majeed penned these words: ‘‘I am beholden to the United States of America who opened her doors to me as a twenty two year old, on a student visa. She allowed me to dream the impossible dream, then showed me the way to make those dreams come true. ‘‘Serving the public, interacting with the Bar, and my many judicial colleagues have left me with a sense of accomplishment beyond my loftiest dreams. ‘‘As I tender my resignation my heart is filled with great joy of twenty four years of judicial distance well run. With credit to President Lincoln, I go forth from this place with malice towards none and charity towards all.’’ Judge Majeed was elected president of all of the county judges in the State of Florida. He has dedicated much of his noncourtroom hours to civic activities motivating and educating the public on the virtues of the United States Constitution and our democratic Republic. Alli Majeed is the father of three daughters and one son. His wife, Yasmin Majeed, is very active in community and charitable causes throughout our community. I ask my colleagues to join me in saluting Judge Alli Majeed’s achievements, his service to our community, and his commitment to our country. f 
PLAYING POLITICS WITH HEALTH CARE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ ) for 5 minutes. Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, House Republicans are playing politics with millions of Americans’ health care. In fact, if Republicans go forward with their plan to chaotically dismantle the Affordable Care Act, 30 million Americans will lose health insurance. In New York State alone, 1.6 million of our neighbors, who gained coverage through ACA, will see their health insurance taken away; and 2.7 million New Yorkers who have enrolled in Medicaid could lose coverage. But let us remember that this is not just about New Yorkers. In fact, the sad irony is that many of the Americans who will lose and be most devastated by repeal of this law are in red States and counties, the places that voted for Presidentelect Trump. Those areas have high numbers of Americans on the Medicaid rolls. Already, States like Idaho, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Georgia are putting Medicaid expansion on hold, waiting to see how action on the ACA plays out. That means half a million Americans will have to wait for health benefits. But let’s keep in mind that this is not just about Medicaid and it is not just about those who obtained coverage through the exchanges. What we need to remember is that all the elements of healthcare reform work together. If you start chipping away at one part of the system, you will see disasters in other parts of the market. This is about the young person, just out of college, who can stay on their parents’ insurance until they are 26, giving them time to secure employment and coverage on their own. It is about patients with a preexisting condition who, until the ACA, were barred 
from securing quality medical insurance. It is about women who have, time and again, faced gender discrimination in the insurance market. Just this past Saturday, New Yorkers in my district rallied together to oppose Republican plans to roll back the ACA and make America sick again. We heard from our local hospitals and healthcare providers who talked about how they will be affected by a dramatic surge in charity care. Nationally, healthcare providers could get stuck with $88 billion in 2019 alone and $1.1 trillion from 2019 to 2028 in uncompensated care. This will strain resources and make it harder for them to provide care to all their patients. And we heard from ordinary working people who have benefited from the ACA, people like Juana Alvarez, who was able, for the first time, to secure coverage for herself and her family through this law. We heard from Susan Maples, who told us she would not have been able to start her own business without the health benefits afforded under ACA. These are the people Republicans are planning to harm with their irresponsible, chaotic, and destructive attack on our health system. Now, let me also note this: The Republican slogan ‘‘repeal and replace’’ is a sham. What are they going to replace the ACA with? They have never—not once—put together a realistic, defensible plan to replace the ACA. The Republican plan is not repeal and replace. It should be called ‘‘repeal and displace’’ because it will mean displacing millions of Americans from their health coverage. So let’s be clear. If you are voting to take away the ACA, you are voting to take away health care from millions. And for those who do retain their employerbased coverage, you are voting to increase their premiums, as millions of healthy Americans are taken out of the insurance pool. This is a recipe for disaster. It is a plan to make America sick again, and it cannot stand. I urge my colleagues to think about what you are doing. Think about going home and looking in the eyes of your constituents and telling them you voted to take away their health coverage. Enough playing politics with health care. 
TIME TO GET SERIOUS ABOUT A BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK ) for 5 minutes. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, in the last 8 years, our Nation’s debt has doubled. That means that the Obama administration has borrowed as much in just 8 years as our government borrowed in the 220 years between the first day of the George Washington administration and the last day of the George W. Bush administration. Our interest costs are now eating us alive. Last year the Congressional Budget Office warned that within 6 years on our current trajectory, interest payments on the debt will exceed what we now spend for our entire defense budget. Before we can provide for the common defense and promote the general welfare, we have to be able to pay for it, and our massive debt directly threatens our ability to do so. History warns us that nations that bankrupt themselves aren’t around very long. I am confident that the new administration clearly understands the peril this poses to our country. The nomination of MICKMULVANEY to head the Office of Management and Budget is a powerful signal that this danger will soon be addressed aggressively and effectively. This debt is our generation’s doing. It is our generation’s responsibility to set right. When we do so, we will need to leave behind the mechanisms to assure that reckless borrowing never threatens our government again. For this reason, last week I introduced a proposal for a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, H.J. Res. 12. The beauty of the American Constitution is in its simplicity and its humility. The American Founders recognized Cicero’s wisdom that the best laws are the simplest ones, and they humbly realized they couldn’t possibly foresee the circumstances and conditions that might confront future generations. They resisted the temptation to micromanage every decision that might be made in the centuries to come. Instead, they set forth general principles of governance and erected a structure in which human nature itself would naturally guide future decisions to comport with these principles. In crafting a balanced budget amendment, we need to maintain these qualities. We should not attempt to tell future generations specifically how they should manage their revenues and expenditures in times that we cannot foresee or comprehend. The experience of many States that operate under their own balanced budget amendments tells us that the more complicated and convoluted such strictures become, the more they are circumvented and manipulated. In 1798, Thomas Jefferson wrote this observation to John Taylor: ‘‘I wish it were possible to obtain a single amendment to our Constitution. I would be willing to depend on that alone for the reduction of the administration of our government to the genuine principles of its Constitution; I mean an additional article taking from the federal government the power of borrowing.’’ What is a balanced budget? It is simply a budget that doesn’t require us to borrow. So why don’t we just say so, as Jefferson did? Instead of trying to define fiscal years, outlays, expenditures, revenues, emergencies, contingencies, triggers, sequestrations, and on and on, I would hope we would consider 27 simple words: ‘‘The United States Government may not increase its debt except for a specific purpose by law adopted by threefourths of the membership of both Houses of Congress.’’ That is it. b1030 Such an amendment, taking effect 10 years from ratification, would give the government time to put its affairs in order and thereafter, naturally, require future Congresses to maintain both a balanced budget and a prudent reserve to accommodate fluctuations of revenues and routine contingencies. It trusts that threefourths of Congress will be able to recognize a genuine emergency when it sees one and that onefourth of Congress will be strong enough to resist borrowing for trivial reasons. The States’ experience warns us that a twothirds vote is insufficient to protect against profligacy. Some advocate going much farther and establishing limitations on spending and taxation as well, but prohibiting borrowing sets a natural limit to the limits of the people to tolerate taxation and, therefore, spending. The real danger is when runaway spending is accommodated by borrowing—a hidden future tax. The best and most effective way to invoke that natural limit is a simple prohibition. In drafting an amendment to guide not only this generation but all those to follow, I would hope that we would do as the Constitutional Convention would have done if it had the benefit of Jefferson’s wise counsel: set down the general principle only and allow future generations, with their own insight into their own challenges, to put it to practical effect. 
HONORING FNS UNDERSECRETARY KEVIN CONCANNON The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the incredible work of Kevin Concannon, Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services at the United States Department of Agriculture. Kevin’s dedication to public service is admirable. Throughout his distinguished career, Kevin has not only served in Federal Government, but he also led Health and Human Services departments in his home State of Maine and in Oregon and in Iowa. Kevin also helped to advance our knowledge of social policy as a graduate professor at several universities across our country. Since 2009, Kevin has capably led FNS, the division of USDA responsible for administering and overseeing SNAP, the National School Breakfast and Lunch Programs, the Summer Food Service Program, WIC, The Emergency Food Assistance Program, and several other nutrition programs. Under Kevin’s leadership, we have made significant progress in ensuring our most vulnerable neighbors have 
healthy options to feed their families. He helped to spur a dramatic increase in the number of farmers markets accepting EBT cards, thereby allowing SNAP recipients greater access to fruits and vegetables while also supporting local farmers. He also oversaw the creation of USDA’s Farm to School Program, an effort focused on incorporating local foods in our school meal programs. During his tenure, we enacted the Healthy, HungerFree Kids Act, legislation that, for the first time in over 30 years, made muchneeded improvements and increased access to our school meal programs. Kevin oversaw our Nation’s premier antihunger program, SNAP, as it provided millions of our neighbors with food assistance during the height of the Great Recession and the recovery that followed, and he has been a fearless advocate for the food and nutrition programs he oversees. When it comes to the nuances of SNAP or WIC or school meals, Kevin’s knowledge and expertise is simply unmatched. He knows the issues impacting vulnerable families, and he is passionate about addressing hunger in this country. Mr. Speaker, during the past several years, I have had the privilege to collaborate with and learn from Kevin as we worked to address hunger and food insecurity in the United States. I am particularly appreciative of the time he took away from his office in Washington to join me on two summer meal tours in my home State of Massachusetts. Together, we visited a number of schools, parks, camps, and community centers supported by USDA’s Summer Food Service Program that ensures children and teens in lowincome areas have access to healthy meals during the summer months. I was always impressed by how he connected with my constituents and his passion for the work he does. He is, truly, a remarkable public servant, and he has made a real difference in the lives of millions and millions of people in this country. Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for Under Secretary Concannon’s efforts on so many levels, but I especially appreciate all he has done to try to end hunger in our country. There are too many people in the United States of America, the richest country in the history of the world, who are hungry; and, quite frankly, we could all do more in this Chamber. Sadly, Congress too often in the past has voted in ways and advocated for policies that have actually made hunger worse in this country. In all candor, I am concerned about the future of some of these programs that provide food and nutrition to vulnerable citizens. I am concerned based on the rhetoric of leaders in this House of Representatives, and I am concerned by the rhetoric of the Presidentelect and his potential Cabinet. Time and time again, we have heard them talk about those in poverty with disdain and contempt. We have heard them denigrate the plight of those struggling in this country. We have heard them belittle their struggle. Quite frankly, that is unacceptable. I urge my colleagues to learn from Kevin Concannon, to be inspired by his example, and to do what we can all do together to try to end hunger now. I ask all of my colleagues to join me in recognizing his incredible accomplishments. We wish him well in his next chapter, but we will certainly miss his expertise and passion at FNS. 
RESTORE THE PROMISES OF HIGH QUALITY OF CARE, LOWER PRICES, AND DOCTOR OF CHOICE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. OLSON ) for 5 minutes. Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, Texans know the difference between right and wrong, between truth and lie. The Democrats promised four things when they passed ObamaCare: number one, you can keep your insurance; number two, you can keep your doctor; number three, you have a better quality of care; and number four, that care will come at a lower cost. Within weeks, we found out that all four promises were being broken; all four were lies. But don’t take my word for it. Take the word of the constituent from Texas 22, my boss Andrea Kulberg. Andrea writes: 
I am a 42yearold, legally blind, single parent in Sugar Land, selfemployed, working very hard to rear two great kids, ages 15 and 13. I have a master’s degree in education and work extremely hard to provide a stable, comfortable life for my kids. In doing so, I have invested time and dollars into my own health care because the kids need me to be healthy. I lost my right eye a few years ago to complications from ROP, too much oxygen at birth, and my left eye is severely impaired with potential for complications that would need immediate specialized care. I have different specialist doctors for different issues related to each eye. Additionally, I am a cancer survivor, renal cancer, RCC, which also requires specialist followup. For these reasons and others, I have spent time and efforts to get drivers to take me to specialists for these specific positions. Over the years, I have paid high healthcare premiums for this, usually around $500 per month—that is crazy in itself—for a PPO to allow me freedom to keep my existing doctor. I paid these fees and sacrificed other luxuries in life so I could get the care I needed with the doctors I wanted. They are the best doctors in their respective fields, and my trust in them is important with this type of care. I don’t have the PPO option now for my health care in 2016 through the ACA. The HMOs and EPOs being offered are not being accepted by my doctors. I am certain you have heard this as well, but I am writing to you anyway because it has to be said that among these needs of many others in similar situations as my own, my remaining eyesight and renal function should never be less important than anything in politics. And while I know that there were many, many people in this same boat, for today, while I write this letter, it is about my kids getting to keep their mom and about me keeping the ability to see them grow up. I know PPOs won’t suddenly appear on healthcare.gov because I sent this email. I know this can’t be immediately fixed. But I write because it needs to be said; it needs to be heard; it needs to be acted on. I don’t know the right actions that need to happen. I will leave that to your area of expertise. But I know the way it is now doesn’t work. In the past, I paid a lot and had my share of insurance issues, but at least I could still choose my own doctor. At least in a crisis, which I have had, I went straight to the doctor who knew me and my history and could resolve it without a referral and delay after delay. HMOs might work for some, but not for those who don’t want one. Letters to a Congressman are supposed to be more formal, but seriously, what country are we in? I am not asking for a handout. I am asking for a reasonable choice of a basic PPO, which I have paid for in the past and am asking to have the option to pay for now. I am not just writing to vent. I am asking for some sort of solution through this train wreck of healthcare options or lack thereof. If President Obama thinks this is actually working, then he is more blind than me. And that is as nice as I can be now. Thanks for hearing me out and for looking for solutions that impact real lives. Respectfully, Andrea Kulberg. Mr. Speaker, I don’t care if you are a Democrat or Republican. Hear Andrea’s words—act. Let’s rescue Andrea from ObamaCare and restore the promises of quality of care, high quality of care, lower price, doctor of choice. 
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT REPEAL AND REPLACE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California (Ms. BROWNLEY ) for 5 minutes. Ms. BROWNLEY of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning to share the story of Judith and her daughter KC. Like all mothers, Judith only wants the best for her children—to live a full and purposeful life, the ability to pursue their dreams and reach their utmost potential. However, at a very young age of 11, KC was formally diagnosed with bipolar disorder. This health condition causes KC to have uncontrollable mood swings, to perceive reality differently, to see and hear things that aren’t there, and to sometimes even become disconnected with reality altogether. It has taken an enormous emotional and physical toll on KC and her family. As a mom of two kids, I cannot imagine the difficulties that Judith has faced. Some nights, Judith had to hold her daughter tightly all night long to help her through her psychosis and her panic, not to mention the emergency hospitalizations. Living with this condition has been a lifelong struggle for KC and for her 
family. It requires a combination of daily medications, weekly psychiatric treatments, hospital visits, and constant support and medical care. And that is only half the story. Without this intensive treatment, KC would simply be unable to function. With it, she has the tools she needs to live a healthy and productive life. When KC was younger, she was covered by a family healthcare policy, but even then, Judith needed to pinch pennies and barely scrape by due to the high cost of insurance copays and deductibles, costing her $13 to $15,000 per month. To try to keep up with her never ending medical bills, Judith used all of her retirement savings. When KC reached adulthood, she was bumped off the family insurance plan. Fortunately, KC qualified for healthcare coverage through the ACA Medicaid expansion. Without it, she and her family would have had no viable alternative. The ACA provided KC with access to reliable, consistent medical care that has been vital to her wellbeing and has allowed her to thrive. b1045 I am very happy to share that KC finished her bachelor’s degree in May and is now pursuing her master’s in counseling psychology. With her own struggles as her inspiration, she decided to make psychology her life’s work, and Judith says that KC is now the person whom everybody goes to anytime one has a problem or needs comfort. Without the healthcare coverage that KC obtained from the Affordable Care Act, she would never have been able to obtain private health insurance due to her preexisting conditions and rigorous health needs. With the Affordable Care Act, Judith was able to see her daughter realize her dreams. I know all of you who are parents want the same for your children; so, when I hear my colleagues on the other side of the aisle talk about eliminating KC’s healthcare coverage, I get a pit at the bottom of my stomach. This is not about politics; this is about people’s lives. This is about KC’s life and Judith’s life and the lives of 20 million Americans who have gained healthcare coverage because of the Affordable Care Act. Today, I rise to speak up for KC and for Judith and for the millions of other Americans whose lives would be put in jeopardy if we repeal the ACA without our having an adequate replacement. I urge my Republican colleagues to reconsider this reckless repeal that would throw our entire healthcare system into chaos and take lifesaving care away from those who need it the most. 
HOUSE MEMBERS ATTEND 101ST PENNSYLVANIA FARM SHOW The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON ) for 5 minutes. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate an industry that allows Americans to have access to affordable, highquality, and safe food—the agriculture industry: our farmers, our ranchers, farm families. Without food security, we do not have national security; so I am here today to recognize all of those who work so hard in that industry. Over the weekend, some members of the House Agriculture Committee were able to join me in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, our State capital, to attend the 101st annual Pennsylvania Farm Show. This event has been widely attended for generations, and it is the largest indoor agriculture expo in the country. It showcases 300 commercial exhibits, 6,000 heads of animal, 10,000 competitive exhibits, and more than a half a million visitors. On Saturday, Agriculture Committee Chairman MIKECONAWAY and I hosted a public listening session. We wanted Members of Congress to hear directly from farmers and ranchers, from FFA members, from kids in 4–H—the future of agriculture—on how agriculture policy impacts them. I thank the following Members who were able to join us at the farm show: Congressman MARK AMODEI , Congressman LOUBARLETTA , Congressman T OM MARINO , Congressman D ANNEWHOUSE , and Congressman TEDYOHO. We covered a range of topics, Mr. Speaker, during our public forum, from raising awareness about agriculture education, to hearing very real concerns from our dairy farmers, to receiving an update from our forest industry about the best ways to strengthen forest management. As chairman of the Agriculture Subcommittee on Conservation and Forestry, this was of particular interest to me. The Pennsylvania Farm Show, which continues throughout this week, brings together so many different farmers and growers and ranchers, all with unique issues. This, truly, is an event like no other. The Farm Show Complex and Expo Center houses 24 acres under one roof, spread throughout 11 buildings, including three arenas. There is no admission fee. It is a great event for the entire family, and there are numerous educational shows that are, obviously, all free of charge. This year’s theme is ‘‘Our Commonwealth’s Blue Ribbon Experience.’’ It reminds us that there really is something for everyone, farmers and nonfarmers alike. The Pennsylvania Farm Show provides an atmosphere for everyone to walk through, observe, and educate themselves about different areas of agriculture and to be able to reconnect with the farm—the Commonwealth’s largest industry, which brings in nearly $6.9 billion annually in agricultural cash receipts. Almost a half million jobs are tied to the industry, which positively impacts all Pennsylvanians. Undoubtedly, one of the most popular attractions at the Pennsylvania Farm Show is the food court, which is located in the complex. The food court offers visitors a variety of Pennsylvania preferred products, and it generates income to support the nonprofit Pennsylvania Agricultural Commodity Organizations. There is where you will find the famous Farm Show baked potatoes. The Pennsylvania Cooperative Potato Growers, Inc., is the oldest in the United States, chartered in 1922. The money raised during the week helps to support the marketing and the promotion of Pennsylvania potatoes. Money is also used to pay the dues for Pennsylvania growers to belong to national potato organizations, fund research projects, and promotional opportunities for Pennsylvania’s growers. Our delegation was able to stop by and sample some of the wellknown potato doughnuts. The Pennsylvania Dairymen’s Association is also on hand at the expo. This service organization provides scholarships, youth programs, and agricultural education programs across the Commonwealth. It also maintains the milk house facilities that are located in the farm show complex. The Dairymen rely on the revenues that are generated during the farm show to fund their activities, including a statewide fresh milk program, called Fill a Glass with Hope. All of their activities are bolstered with the sales of milkshakes, milk and chocolate milk, ice cream sundaes, grilled cheese sandwiches, ice cream cones, and my favorite—fried cheese cubes. Over a century ago, the first Pennsylvania Farm Show was a 3day exhibit. Today, the event is a weeklong celebration of how the agriculture industry touches our lives every day. If you pick up a fork, a spoon, or a knife, you are touched by agriculture. Proudly, this event draws visitors from across the country to highlight everything our State has to offer when it comes to agriculture. As the 115th Congress begins to address the next farm bill, listening sessions like the one that we hosted Saturday will continue to be critically important. Policy that is based on discussion within the vacuum—the beltway— of Washington usually fails and falters. When we open it up to the people who are impacted, we get the best policy. If you are looking for the best agriculture expo in the country, head to Harrisburg this week. 
MEETING THE THRESHOLD OF UN AMERICAN The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN ) for 5 minutes. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, what is more important than being the President of the United States? For all of us here, that is a no brainer; but, each day, I find myself asking that of the Presidentelect. 
Last night, we watched President Obama say farewell to the country he served. For the past 8 years, parts of our country disparaged him, and some of our colleagues fought him tooth and nail at the expense of their constituents; but, each day, we were assured that our outgoing President put this country and our interests first. Presidentelect Trump seems to serve himself. Yesterday, several news sources reported the possibility of a continuing exchange of information between Russia and Trump campaign officials during the election; so, in the face of yet another troubling revelation that further sullies the ground on which his loyalty to America stands, I have questions: Is our Presidentelect willing to sacrifice his personal gain for the good of this great Nation? When will we find out if he has fulfilled his legal obligation to pay taxes like millions of Americans do? How can we be sure that our interests will take precedence if we don’t even know that they ever have? Will this White House serve as ‘‘Trump Tower South’’? The actions and words of the President of the United States have a loud and reverberating effect through the world economy and the international political system. To date, Presidentelect Trump’s promises to America have been hollow and his actions selfserving. President elect Donald Trump does not merely offer an alternative direction for our Nation; he, it seems, offers to use the Presidency primarily for his personal benefit. When given an opportunity to set these concerns aside, he scoffs at his critics and embraces our Nation’s enemies. Instead of making reasonable attempts to reassure the American public, whom he will soon swear to protect, he gaslights us with tweets, mockery, and lies. In the past, we have seen the term ‘‘unAmerican’’ used to indict members of the public executing their civil liberties. Antiwar advocates protesting for peace have been called unAmerican. Civil rights leaders standing against discrimination have been called unAmerican—just ask Senator JEFF SESSIONS . Professional athletes taking a knee to acknowledge sordid realities within our justice system are deemed unAmerican, and comedians and pastors, alike, for using their microphones to criticize our Nation. But, quite frankly, dissent is American; protest is American; criticism is American. Healthy skepticism toward our national intelligence is American. Disparaging and discrediting it is not. Working with foreign powers to ensure peace is not only American, but also Presidential; inviting a foreign power to compromise the cybersecurity of private citizens is not. Empowering Americans to become involved in the political process, to take action, and to even be critical of you is American; attacking them when they call untruths and inciting your supporters to do the same is not. For these reasons and a host of others, I simply ask the question: At what point do the actions of our next President—Presidentelect Donald Trump— meet that threshold of unAmerican? The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the Presidentelect. f 
U.N. RESOLUTION 2334 The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DESANTIS ) for 5 minutes. Mr. DESANTIS. Mr. Speaker, U.N. Resolution 2334 was an antiIsrael resolution that sought to erase the history of the Jewish people and their connection to their historic homeland. Under U.N. Resolution 2334, the Western Wall, which is the holiest site in Judaism and the last remnant of the Second Temple, is considered occupied territory. You can’t even make this up. I think it is important to point out that the territory at issue, which we are talking about, including the West Bank, which is historic Judea and Samaria—some of the oldest Jewish lands dating back thousands of years—is disputed. It is not occupied territory. When you use that term for things like the Western Wall, you show that all you are trying to do is to harm and attack the State of Israel but not do this in an intellectually honest way. If you look at the Balfour Declaration, that entire mandate was originally for a Jewish state, including what is now Jordan. As we got into the 1920s, Britain thought that giving what was called Transjordan—what is considered to be the eastern part of Palestine—would be a reward for the help of some of the Arabs during the First World War. That had been under Turkish control for hundreds of years before World War I. It was then under British control. You have this British mandate, and they eventually give Jordan everything east of the river; but then Jewish Palestine—this is a Jewish state, which is all of Israel proper: Jerusalem, Judea and Samaria, you name it—was what Britain wanted to do. The League of Nations in 1922, which is the last legally binding document, recognized that as well. Fastforward past World War II and we get into the late forties. The Arabs always rejected having a state shared with Israel in that respect. Then we get to 1948 and the U.N. Partition Plan. How much measly less territory for Israel? It is really an indefensible country. There is a massive Arab state there; yet Israel accepted even these little crumbs of territory. What did the Arabs do? They rejected having a state. You had invasions against Israel from all sides, and the goal was the annihilation of the Jewish state in 1948. Between ’48 and ’67—we always heard about these 1967 lines. Those are not political lines. Those are armistice lines. Israel won the war for their independence. They beat back the Arab armies. You had Egypt controlling the Gaza Strip and you had Jordan controlling Judea and Samaria, what we know as the West Bank. b1100 So those were armistice lines, never internationally recognized. Jordan’s occupation of the West Bank was not recognized internationally. When Arafat founded the PLO, it was in 1964, ’65, when you still had these armistice lines. So the Palestine Liberation Organization, what are they trying to liberate Palestine from? He is not talking about the West Bank. He is talking about Israel proper. He wanted to push the Jews to the sea. So why would we be rewarding? Palestinian Arabs rejected a state in ’48. They rejected a generous offer in 2000, 2007. Every time, they have chosen to go to war with Israel, and they are more opposed to a Jewish state than they are interested in their own state. We do have an example, though. What happens? You talk about Israel occupation. They don’t occupy the Gaza Strip. What is the Gaza Strip? Is this like a nice lala land on the Mediterranean? No. It is a terror state controlled by Hamas, and they launch incessant rocket attacks against Israel. So a Palestinian state in this area, JudeaSamaria—West Bank—would be what they call judenrein. It would be free of Jews. They would ethnically cleanse every Jew who was in anything considered earmarked for Palestinian Arabs. It is an interesting contrast, because in Israel, Arab Israelis live and prosper, and they are treated as equal citizens. So we have to get this straight. What the U.N. did was totally unacceptable. This body needs to remove funding for the U.N. until they repeal that offending resolution, and the new administration needs to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in a show of solidarity with our friends in Israel. 
ACA REPEAL AND DELAY The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California (Ms. SPEIER ) for 5 minutes. Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, the Republicans’ plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act should be entitled repeal and collapse, because it will generate, in this country, a financial and healthcare meltdown for tens of millions of people. In fact, if we repeal the ACA, 30 million Americans will lose their health insurance. States and hospitals will be on the hook for $1.1 trillion in uncompensated care, and rural hospitals will close. It will cost the country 3 million jobs. All of this is to give the top one half of 1 percent an almost $200,000 tax break and costs middle class families as much as $6,000 more a year. Once 
again, the Republicans are taking care of the richest while imposing tax hikes on hardworking Americans. As this chart shows, the ACA has caused dramatic reductions in every age group across the entire marketplace in terms of uninsurance, a 50 percent reduction in uninsured in America. So what does this mean to the average American? For my constituent, Penny Floor, it could return her to a time when she lived with no health insurance whatsoever. Here is a picture of Penny. She works for the San Mateo Community College District and is one of the 27 percent of Americans under the age of 65 who have a preexisting condition. She is now at risk, thanks to the GOP’s reckless ideological agenda, to lose her health insurance. This is Penny’s story in her words: 
I tried to buy health insurance in my thirties and in my forties, and both times I was turned down and was told I was ineligible. Basically, I didn’t lie on the portion of the form that asked if I had ever been hospitalized for mental illness. I said I was treated for depression when I was 17, and for that I was denied the ability to purchase health insurance. For a long period of my adult life, I had no health insurance. I worked for a nonprofit childcare center and had no coverage. I got married in my forties, and both my husband and I went to graduate school and were covered then. But when we received our degrees, the coverage ended. My husband was working as a freelance computer programmer. He ended up taking a corporate job that wasn’t his dream job so we could be insured. He is still there today. He is 62, and I am 60, and we live in fear he will be laid off. I am holding my breath that there will be some coverage through Medicaid if that happens, or if we make it to retirement. When I was younger, I was lucky enough to have incredible health. I didn’t go to the doctor or the dentist for 10 years. I was constantly terrified that I would be in a car accident and would be sued. And I was afraid my family would be bankrupt trying to take care of me. Thank God for Planned Parenthood and access to birth control. It is the only medical attention I received during that time because their sliding pay scale was the only thing I could afford. Now I am 60, though, and I do have health issues. I was hospitalized earlier this year for blood clots in my legs and lungs. It was scary and expensive, but we had good coverage. But if the ACA is repealed and Medicaid is affected, I don’t know what we will do. We are educated, not poor, very productive members of society, and we are scared. 
These are the words of a real American, my constituent, Penny Floor. 
HUMAN TRAFFICKING MONTH The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. FARENTHOLD ) for 5 minutes. Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, this year, Texas has the great honor of hosting the Super Bowl. In just a couple of weeks, Houston will host the largest event of the year in the United States with approximately 100,000 people expected to attend and more than 100 million expected to tune in on television. The Department of Homeland Security calls the Super Bowl the most attractive target for those who want to commit harm. Thanks to partnerships between local, state, and Federal officials, K9s will be deployed for bomb detections, officers on the lookout for suspicious activity, and air security will be ramped up, to name just a few of the precautions. Law enforcement is doing a great job of reminding everyone who plans to attend: if you see something, say something. Since it is January and it is Human Trafficking Awareness Month, I want to remind everyone that ‘‘see something, say something’’ doesn’t just apply to unattended backpacks. During a recent meeting on Capitol Hill, DHS reminded all of us that events such as the Super Bowl bring the good, the bad, and the ugly. While a majority of the attendees are coming to have a good time and with good intentions, the few who do not can disrupt and ruin many lives. So I ask those who attend to help us in keeping Texas one of the safest and best States in the country by reporting anything to law enforcement they may believe to be suspicious and allow trained officers to investigate. This includes suspected human trafficking. According to the Polaris Project, warning signs of someone being a victim of human trafficking include not being allowed to leave or come and go as they wish; appearing malnourished; not being in control of his or her own identification documents; not being allowed to speak for themselves; and showing signs of physical abuse, torture, or physical restraint. While law enforcement will be ramping up efforts to reach out to victims and give them the resources they need to get help, it lies on each and every one of us to be aware of our surroundings and help when someone is in trouble or something is not right. It is important to remember that human trafficking doesn’t just happen during large sporting events. It happens every day, often going unseen. While events like the Super Bowl help bring it to our attention, it is important to remember that, when the event is over, men and women, boys and girls are still being victimized each and every day. UNICEF has estimated there were 1.5 million victims of human trafficking in the United States alone in 2014, and that number soars to 27 million worldwide. This is a problem that is going to continue to need our attention 365 days a year. We have got to work together to end this form of human slavery. OBAMACARE REPEAL AND REPLACE  
Mr. FARENTHOLD: Mr. Speaker, I spend most of my time, when Congress is not in session, back home in Texas. I hear over and over again from constituents: ObamaCare is not working for me. Premiums are too expensive and deductibles are too high. That is just not a problem in Texas. ObamaCare is failing nationwide. It is now the unaffordable, nocare act. That is why I support repealing and replacing it. The House will set up the framework to do just that with the budget bill we expect to pass this week. It sets up budget reconciliation that will be the vessel for beginning to fix this failing law. I am looking forward to a healthcare system that allows individual consumers more choice in the plan that they pick, a healthcare system that will return choice to the American consumer while ensuring that people can’t be turned away or lose coverage due to age, medical condition, or circumstances. I also look forward to a healthcare system that protects Medicare for senior citizens while ensuring Medicare is financially solvent and will be there for future generations. I also look forward to a healthcare system that is free of burdensome bureaucracy and a tax system that hampers the development of new medical devices and therapies, discourages savings, and penalizes employers and the American people if they don’t do Uncle Sam’s bidding. I have heard from restauranteurs in my area. In Port Aransas, I ran into a guy at the airport. He said: I want to expand my restaurant, but it will put me over the limit for employees and put me under ObamaCare. I just can’t afford it. So he chose not to expand. He wasn’t able to hire more people, give people jobs. Another restaurateur in Corpus Christi said: You know, I am over the limit now, but I am only hiring part time people. I can’t afford the coverage, and I can’t afford to raise prices because the market just won’t bear more expensive meals. This means that people who could have gotten full benefits under a different plan are having to suffer with no benefits and work two parttime jobs rather than a fulltime job. It is time we repeal and replace ObamaCare and replace it with a healthcare plan that meets people’s needs, not Washington, D.C.’s needs. You can read more about the House plan at Better.GOP. f 
FLOODING AND WATER STORAGE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. COSTA ) for 5 minutes. Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about the water conditions facing California as I have for many times over the last 6 years. Today, obviously, we have recent storms that we welcome in California. Over the past several days, my district has received aboveaverage rainfall and snow in the mountains; and we welcome that. But also that presents flood conditions. After over 5 years of recordbreaking drought conditions, of course, we welcome the rain and snow; but there is 
also destructive flooding that is occurring as a result of that. Regrettably, to reduce this potential flooding, we are having to let this water go out to the ocean. This precious water could be extremely beneficial to farmers, farmworkers, and farm communities in the dry years. But, of course, we can’t store it because the storage is not there. This water could be used to replenish groundwater aquifers that were depleted during these drought conditions and could be carried over for ground storage for use in dry years. This water could help ensure that farming communities would not continue to deal with doubledigit unemployment levels that we have had to face over the last 6 years. It is why we need to invest more in the water storage projects in California, both surface storage and groundwater recharge, like raising the gates at Exchequer Dam, building Sites Reservoir and Temperance Flat Dam. The WIIN Act that we passed last month was enacted in December, and it provides funding for water storage authorization and for groundwater banking projects. And just in the last several weeks, we have determined that over 130,000 acrefeet of water is available today for use in our farm communities that otherwise would not be available. It is my sincere hope that those projects and others like this, like the Los Banos Creek Reservoir and raising San Luis Reservoir, are advanced as rapidly as possible in the next administration so that we can begin to capture the muchneeded water that comes from these storms as we have had in the last 10 days. Fixing California’s broken water system requires a multiprong approach, as I have said many times on this floor, and focusing on how we improve the water infrastructure and storage capacity will be imperative as we work together to update California’s water system, both here in Congress with the new administration and with the administration in Sacramento that is also trying to create a water system that serves California’s needs in the 21st century. After 5 years of devastating drought conditions, we are now witnessing these large storm events which have created floods in certain regions of California. It is either feast or famine in California; and with the climate change impacts, we know that will only continue in the future. So as we reflect on the last 5 years and we look at the progress we made last month with the WIIN Act that was part of WRDA legislation, as time goes on, it is important that in the future, during the dry years that we will face more intensive drought conditions, that we plan and provide for those drought conditions by creating the necessary surface storage and groundwater storage projects so that when we have wet years—we have wet times, as we witnessed in the last 10 days, when we see greater rainfall amounts, increased flooding, and snow pack—that we have the water storage capabilities to meet the captured water during the wet years so we can use it during the dry ones. Common sense tells us that. b1115 I urge my colleagues in Congress and the people of California to continue to work together on a bipartisan basis because it is the only way we ever get anything done. So for the new administration, for my colleagues in the new Congress, and for my friends back in California, we must work together. If California, one of the most prosperous States in the Nation, the seventh or eighth largest economic power in the world, cannot fix the water challenges that we face in the 21st century, God help the rest of the world. This is all about sustainability—sustainability of our food supply, sustainability of our Nation. Food is a national security item. We don’t look at it that way, but it truly is. Mr. Speaker, I look forward to the new Congress and the new administration to build on the progress we made last month so that we can fix California’s broken water system by using all of the water tools in our water toolbox, and we can only do that on a bipartisan basis. 
ENFORCEMENT OF MARIJUANA LAWS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. ROHRABACHER ) for 5 minutes. Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to praise Senator JEFFSESSIONS , Presidentelect Trump’s nominee for Attorney General. Senator SESSIONS , I am praising him today for his inspiring testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee yesterday. During his confirmation hearings, Senator SESSIONS was questioned on a wide variety of issues that will be under his purview as our Attorney General. Included in the numerous topics covered were questions about his intentions to enforce Federal law as it pertains to marijuana policy. Senator SESSIONS is a patriot. He is a constitutionalist. He is a man of the highest moral integrity, and I have complete confidence that if confirmed as Attorney General, he will faithfully enforce our laws—not just those he agrees with, but all the laws duly enacted by Congress. As it pertains to marijuana policy, Senator SESSIONS promised to do the same, to follow the law. During his exchanges on that topic of medical marijuana policy, being questioned by both Senators Leahy and Lee, Senator SESSIONS stated his intention to follow Federal law. At one point he indicated that if Congress no longer desired to make possession and distribution of marijuana an illegal act, ‘‘Congress should pass a law to change the rules.’’ At this time, I feel compelled to point out that Federal law has been changed and currently prohibits the Department of Justice from spending appropriated funds to prosecute individuals who are acting in compliance with their State’s medical marijuana laws. In fact, a provision has been in the law since December 2014, when Congress passed and President Obama signed into law the Consolidated Further Continuing Appropriations Act. The act included a provision passed on the floor of the House as an amendment earlier that year by a vote of 219– 189. The following year, a similar provision was passed by a wider margin of 242–186. That provision, offered by myself and cosponsored by my colleague, SAMFARR, restricts the Federal Government from superseding State law when it comes to the use of medical marijuana. This law will remain in effect through April 28 of this year, although I expect with the House and the Senate, both on record on this, that this provision will be renewed. I am especially confident of that when realizing that Presidentelect Trump is on the record, as he stated in the last campaign, that this issue should be left to the States. Thus, I am confident that this legal provision, which says that the Federal Government shall not supersede State law when it comes to medical marijuana, will be renewed. Importantly, in August of last year, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in U.S. v. McIntosh that Federal funds cannot be used to prosecute those in compliance with their State’s medical marijuana laws. This provision will be part of American law as long as it is renewed and Congress makes it part of the law. I am confident that if Congress does that, Attorney General JEFFSESSIONS , my friend, a person I admire greatly, will abide by the provisions and, thus, respect State medical marijuana laws, as dictated by Congress and enforced by the judiciary. As he rightfully pointed out in his testimony yesterday, Senator SESSIONS  said it will be his duty to see to it that the laws under his purview as Attorney General are faithfully executed, and this includes the RohrabacherFarr limitations that no funding shall be used to prosecute those throughout our country who are in compliance with our States’ medical marijuana laws. All of this comes down to a constitutional theory and a constitutional commitment to what we call the 10th Amendment, and that is the States have a right to make determinations in all of those areas that the Federal Government should not be involved in. This should definitely be left to the States. 
CONGRATULATING CLEMSON UNIVERSITY The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. DUNCAN ) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, in the history of mankind, civilizations have turned to sports as a means of entertainment, as a distraction from the routines of everyday life, a great way to spend time with friends and family. Whether it was the gladiators in the coliseums of Rome, the jousting in the Middle Ages, or college football today, it is a great form of entertainment. I rise today to honor and recognize Clemson University, the 2016 college football national champions. The coaches are to be commended—from Dabo Swinney and his coaching staff, the team he has put together, the men of character that he builds, and I will mention some of those shortly; President Jim Clements; athletic director Radakovich; the students of Clemson; and, most importantly, the fans, a 35– 31 victory against Alabama. It has been 35 years since Clemson won the national championship in 1981. That is a special national championship to me because my brother John was on the national championship team in 1981. Danny Ford, Coach Ford, was the coach when the 1981 national championship team was inducted, recognized in the College Football Hall of Fame the very night, Monday night, of this year’s national championship. The connections between the University of Alabama and their football program and Clemson University’s football program are numerous. Danny Ford played football for Bear Bryant. He coached the national championship in 1981. Dabo Swinney, current head coach at Clemson, played for Alabama. Dabo was a walkon at Alabama. It has been 110 years since Clemson defeated Alabama, 1905. I am not taking anything away from Coach Saban and the Alabama Crimson Tide. What a great football program they have in the great State of Alabama. They fell to a very good Clemson football team on Monday night. Deshaun Watson, number 4, he was the difference. He is the best football player in the Nation with 420 yards passing, 36 for 57; total offensive, 511 yards. Watson was the MVP of the national championship game. Ben Boulware was Clemson’s defensive MVP of the game. But I want to give a special shout out to a unique individual, Hunter Renfrow, number 13, who caught the winning touchdown pass at the end of the game with 1 second left. Hunter Renfrow, a walkon at Clemson, like his head coach, Dabo Swinney, a walk on who earned a spot, ultimately catching two touchdown passes in this national championship game, two touchdown passes in the 45–40 loss last year, a walkon. Both ends of the spectrum, a fivestar quarterback, number 4, Deshaun Watson, arguably the best quarterback in the Nation, throwing to the other end of the spectrum, a walkon. What a great story. I want to give a shoutout to the coaching staff, specifically Dabo Swinney, and to Deshaun Watson for both recognizing that their talents and that team’s specialness came from Almighty Creator God. Clemson is special to me. I am a 1988 graduate. I played walkon at Clemson 1984, 1985, and part of 1986. Part of Hunter Renfrow’s and Dabo Swinney’s stories that you can be a walkon and ultimately succeed is one that we should take away from this great game. So my congratulations, standing here on the floor of the United States House of Representatives, representing the Third Congressional District, home of Clemson, South Carolina, home of Clemson University, and now home of the 2016 college football national champions, the Clemson Tigers. I am proud to be here and say, ‘‘Go Tigers.’’ Congratulations, Clemson. 
CREATING TECHNOLOGY JOBS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. KHANNA ) for 5 minutes. Mr. KHANNA. Mr. Speaker, I have the great privilege and honor of representing Silicon Valley in the United States Congress. We are living through revolutionary times. If 100 years ago we had the industrial revolution, today we have the software revolution, and the forces of automation and globalization are fundamentally changing our economy. We first must thank the hardworking Americans who helped build this economy—the steelworkers and the coal miners and those who were machinists who built the economy that made us an exceptional Nation—that were the foundation of everything that Silicon Valley does today. We need to thank them for the extraordinary hard work and grit that they showed. We also need to recognize that our economy is changing, and not everyone has participated in the technology revolution. Some folks have benefited, and they are creating jobs and wealth, and others have been left behind. We have an obligation to make sure that every American and their daughters and their sons get to participate in this technology revolution and have technology jobs. Enrico Moretti, an economist at Berkeley, has shown for every one technology job, it creates four to five other jobs in communities, from the barista to a lawyer, to a construction worker. Tech jobs have a larger multiplier today than manufacturing jobs had in previous eras. My commitment, my vision is to see how Silicon Valley can help create technology jobs not just in my district, but across America. There is no reason that Des Moines, Iowa, and Wichita, Kansas, and Dayton, Ohio, cannot become centers for technology innovation and have extraordinary technology jobs. I look forward to working across the aisle with my Republican colleagues and Democratic colleagues to figure out how we create tech jobs across this Nation. f 
b1200 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker at noon. 
PRAYER The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: Dear God, we give You thanks for giving us another day. As a parent encourages a child or a mentor calls forth the hidden potential of an intern, Lord our God, may You bless all who work as the 115th Congress convenes, especially those new Members. Remove fear and confusion, wipe away distrust, which only inhibit good judgment and leadership. Strengthen the resolve and compassion of all Members, that they may serve Your people with renewed clarity of vision and refined purpose that will soon unify this Nation in selfdiscipline and confidence. For You reward the just and their deeds. Bless all Members this day, O God, and be with them and with us all in every day to come. May all that is done be for Your greater honor and glory. Amen. 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. LANGEVIN ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. LANGEVIN led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, for almost 8 years, we have heard about Republicans’ plans to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. During that time, the House has voted dozens of times to repeal or defund ObamaCare; but now as Republicans prepare to take control of the White House, it is clear that Republicans don’t have a plan to replace ObamaCare. Instead, they will repeal and displace millions of hardworking Americans, cutting them off from quality, affordable health care and making it even harder to get ahead. The Republican repeal and displace plan will take away health insurance from 30 million Americans and will increase prescription drug costs, premiums, and outofpocket expenses for American families; and it will end health coverage for millions of Americans in order to give a huge tax cut to the richest Americans. Repealing ObamaCare will also cause a loss of 2.6 million jobs, including 12,100 jobs in my home State of Rhode Island. Mr. Speaker, let’s be clear: the Republicans’ repeal and displace plan is just wrong. It is time for Republicans to end this charade and get back to doing the people’s work by partnering with Democrats to strengthen and improve the Affordable Care Act and stop threatening all these harms on the American people. f 
SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL (Mr. WILLIAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to reaffirm this Congress’ commitment to America’s greatest ally in the Middle East, Israel. Last week, the House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly to object to the United Nations Security Council antiIsrael resolution. H. Res. 11 was supported by most Democrats and all but four Republicans. The House vote was prompted by the Obama administration’s refusal to use its veto power to shoot down a U.N. resolution condemning Israeli settlements. As I wrote in a recent oped: This U.N. resolution was onesided. It failed to recognize that Israel is the only Jewish state and that it is fighting for survival every single day. This U.N. resolution will be used to justify the actions of those who want to wipe Israel off the map. As I speak, we are still mourning Sunday’s attack on a group of Israeli soldiers that left four dead and more than a dozen injured. Mr. Speaker, I think most of us can agree that U.S.Israel relations have hit a low point under this administration. When I first ran for Congress 4 years ago, I ran on a sevenpoint platform that included standing with Israel. Mr. Speaker, I will not waver in my support for our friend. I hope the incoming administration sets a new tone in reestablishing America’s alliance with the Jewish state. In God we trust. 
YOUR VOICE DOES MATTER (Mr. BLUMENAUER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, there is lots of incredible news out there. The Trump press conference just makes your head spin, but we have seen that the public’s voice does matter. Because of public outcry, within minutes after the latenight closed meetings, the Republican plan to gut the independent Office of Congressional Ethics was reversed. In response to outrage about jeopardizing health care for millions of Americans, some Republicans now admit that repealing the Affordable Care Act is not quite so simple and maybe they should come up with a replacement, even if they don’t yet know how to do it. Senate Republicans even delayed some of the Cabinet confirmation hearings to allow a more orderly review and scrutiny. Your voice does matter. The President said last night that change only happens when ordinary people get involved, get engaged, and come together to demand it. Obviously, these fights are just beginning, but the last 10 days shows that together we can and will protect the values and programs so vital to America. f 
DATA IS BETTER THAN PREDICTIONS (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, whenever you see climate change in the news, remember the difference between actual data and exaggerated predictions. For example, much coverage was given yesterday to the predictions by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service that polar bears now face extinction because of climate change. That prediction is contradicted by the evidence. The polar bear population has been increasing and is now around 26,000, probably the highest number in many years. Climate alarmists want to scare people with extreme predictions. Better for Americans to look at the scientific evidence and discount the wild tales. Climate change has many causes and has occurred throughout the history of the Earth. Real scientists acknowledge this and are hesitant to make long range predictions. 
RECOGNIZING KRISTIN NICHOLSON (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, it is always difficult saying goodbye to a Member of our Hill family. When I was first elected to Congress, I sought a chief of staff who could work with me to help lead my team and shape my policy portfolio: someone who knew the Hill as well as the legislative process in Congress; someone who was smart, strong, and compassionate; someone with sharp instincts; and, most importantly, someone I could trust. I found all of those qualities and so much more in Kristin Nicholson. As my chief of staff, Kristin has been a trusted confidant, adviser, and a true friend. So it is with both sadness and pride that after 16 years in my office I say goodbye to Kristin as she leaves the Hill to become director of the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University. Kristin’s leadership has been essential to me and my entire staff; and although we will miss her tremendously, she leaves behind a team that has benefited from her professionalism, passion, humor, and grace under fire. Kristin, I cannot thank you enough for your service to me and the people of Rhode Island. Congratulations and best wishes. 
OBAMACARE HAS NOT BEEN AFFORDABLE (Mr. BIGGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, ObamaCare has been a disaster for Arizonans. My home State of Arizona has been hit the hardest. Premiums in Arizona for many have increased over 100 percent, and providers have fled the State, leaving some counties with one provider and little options for healthcare insurance. ObamaCare must be repealed. In fact, there is no constitutional authority given to the Federal Government to take over our healthcare system. These issues are, in fact, best left to the States to manage. I am advocating for a complete repeal of ObamaCare as soon as possible, with a transition period of no longer than 24 months. The approach I am suggesting will remove government from between patients and their doctors. Our alternative will encourage competition, which will in turn lead to lower costs to all Americans, but in particular, Arizonans. I remain committed to seeing this happen. 
UNION CITY PUBLIC SCHOOLS (Mr. SIRES asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Union City Public Schools for their outstanding achievements. Having come to the United States from Cuba as a child, I experienced the challenges of assimilating into a new community firsthand. As the representative of one of our Nation’s most diverse districts, many of my constituents experience these challenges every day. Giving immigrants the tools they need to succeed is not only beneficial to our country, it is sound policy. According to The Wall Street Journal, Union City Public Schools ‘‘have become a model for ushering lowincome Englishlanguage learners into the mainstream.’’ With a student body that is 95 percent Hispanic, one of the keys to Union City Public Schools’ success is their English as a second language program and their early childhood programming. The programming has become a model for educators in the U.S. and as far away as Europe. Graduation rates have also increased by nearly 10 percent, in just 2 years, in the district. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent a school district that has made tremendous strides in easing the transition of immigrant youth into our society and become the foundation of success for thousands of children and young adults. COMMENDING THE EFFORTS OF PEOPLE FOR LIFE (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend the efforts of People for Life, a nonprofit in Erie County, Pennsylvania, that is dedicated to educating and promoting righttolife causes in northwestern Pennsylvania. This organization hosts several events throughout the year to bring together people of the prolife community. People for Life organizes an annual bus trip to participate in the national March for Life in Washington, D.C., and it also hosts its own March for Life in Erie. For nearly four decades, People for Life has hosted a ProLife Breakfast that highlights the sanctity of human life in all phases and conditions. Attendees can hear stories of love, courage, and victory through God’s mercy and grace. I thank People for Life for all the work it has done in Erie and northwestern Pennsylvania on this topic of such great importance. They work to save lives through education and love. They recognize how sacred each human life is and fully understand the need to protect the most vulnerable. They are a voice for the voiceless. I am deeply grateful for their work. 
WE MUST STRENGTHEN FLIGHT SAFETY MEASURES (Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, nearly 8 years ago, western New Yorkers watched in horror as Continental flight 3407 crashed, tragically ending the lives of those on board. Since then, the families of those lost have turned their grief into a relentless fight to strengthen pilot training and flight safety rules. Today, the families of flight 3407 are in attendance at the Senate nomination hearing for the new Secretary of Transportation. Their presence is an urgent reminder that the work of Congress and the administration still remains to be done. In 2010, Congress passed landmark flight safety legislation with the families of 3407 leading the charge. Since then, there have been nearly 8 years of no fatal commercial crashes on domestic U.S. airlines. Now the Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization is on the horizon, and we must further strengthen flight safety measures. It is essential that we continue to stand alongside the families of flight 3407 and fight attempts to roll back pilot training and safety provisions. We must not forget those we lost nearly 8 years ago and do all that is possible to prevent another tragedy of this kind. b1215 TRADE IS A TWOWAY STREET (Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, some people have expressed concern that Presidentelect Trump will start a trade war if he gets tough on trade. But what they are not admitting, or perhaps it has never occurred to them, is that we have been in a trade war for many years, and we have been losing. China has followed a Chinafirst policy for years to their great benefit, while we have sent millions of good jobs to other countries and several million of our young people now can find jobs only in restaurants. With only 4 percent of the world’s population, we buy 21.7 percent of the world’s goods. We used to buy about 25 percent, but we have more competition around the world now as most countries are trying to move away from socialism while we seemingly move toward it. But we still have tremendous leverage on trade that we have not used because every country wants desperately into our markets. We need to negotiate trade deals that will create more jobs in this country. We need, Mr. Speaker, to tell foreign leaders that we want to buy things from them, but they need to start buying from us, too. Friendship is a two way street. f 
DON’T MAKE AMERICA SICK AGAIN (Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that 22 million Americans would lose their health insurance if the Republican bill from last Congress becomes law. Let’s don’t make America sick again. There should be no repeal of health reform without an immediate, adequate replacement that achieves the same historic goals in coverage, ensures people with preexisting conditions aren’t blocked or priced out of the market, and that plans cover a basic set of benefits and consumer protections. Repealing the Affordable Care Act without a replacement in place will cause chaos. Millions will lose coverage; the individual insurance market will be in shambles; doctors, hospitals, and States will lose billions; and the economy will be hurt. Without health insurance, people with chronic diseases will lose care and become sicker. Every major law that Congress has passed needs oversight and revision to make sure it is as effective as intended. Congress can amend any law, but doing so in a way that will cause 22 million of the newly insured people to be without health insurance is just wrong. 
I urge my colleagues to stop working against the health of American people. We should not be making America sick again. 
RECOGNIZING MACY MAINE AND HANNAH MASON, INSPIRATIONAL ROLE MODELS (Ms. MCSALLY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. MCSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize two southern Arizona young women for their achievements and for serving as role models in their communities. Macy Maine, a senior at Buena High School, and Hannah Mason, a senior at Pusch Ridge Christian Academy, were recently given the 2016 Brilliant, Beautiful and Bold Role Model Award from the Girls Rule Foundation. The award recognizes only a handful of young women across the State who are making a difference. Macy was given the award for her active engagement in the community. She represented her high school as an American Legion Auxiliary Arizona Girls State delegate, is an AllAmerican cheerleader, and represented her city at the Power Up Teen Leadership Conference. She is a frequent volunteer and hopes to enter public service. Hannah has been a selfless leader for her family and community. After a car accident took the life of her father and severely injured her older sister, Hannah stepped up to care for her family. She helped her sister through multiple surgeries while continuing to excel at school and remain active in the community. She hopes to enter medical school one day. Mr. Speaker, I congratulate both Macy and Hannah for being inspirational role models to their peers and wish them the best of luck as they continue to pursue their dreams. 
HONORING THE MEMORY OF COLONEL HOWARD MERRITT STEELE, JR. (Mr. BEYER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Colonel Howard Merritt Steele, Jr. Colonel Steele was the epitome of a soldier. He loved his family, his country, his God, the Army, and West Point. He attended the prestigious Peekskill Military Academy, Yale University, and the United States Military Academy. Colonel Steele fought in Korea, where he was awarded the Silver Star for gallantry in action. He received the Bronze Star for his service as a rifle company commander. After the war, he was company commander in the 3rd Infantry, The Old Guard, at Fort Myer, Virginia; two tours in Vietnam; Commander of the 54th Infantry Battalion; and a graduate of the Army War College. Colonel Steele’s awards include three Bronze Stars, Meritorious Service Medals, three Legions of Merit, three Air Medals, Army Commendation Medal, the Vietnam Cross of Gallantry with Palm, and a number of other service and foreign medals. He is survived by Dotsie, his beloved wife of 65 years; his son, Howard Merritt Steele, IV; two daughters, Cynthia Steele Vance and Susan Steele; and six adoring grandchildren. Colonel Steele, you led a long, brave, generous life of service to others—a soldier’s soldier. Your legacy is a growing family who basked in your love and a country just and free. f 
STAND UP FOR LIFE (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, this weekend, I was grateful to participate in the Stand Up for Life March and Rally in Columbia, hosted by the South Carolina Citizens for Life during a rare snowstorm. I appreciated hearing remarks from Evangelist Alveda King, niece of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., a dedicated prolife activist. I was also grateful to attend the grand opening of Daybreak, a crisis pregnancy center, hosted by Director Brennan Aschleman. I thank Lisa Van Riper, president of South Carolina Citizens for Life, with Holly Gatling and Brenda Cerkez for organizing such a meaningful event. I was grateful to participate, as well, with Bishop Robert Guglielmone of Charleston and the Knights of Columbus led by Thomas Monahan. Prolife voters have made a difference with all statewide officials, both U.S. Senators and six U.S. Members of Congress supporting prolife initiatives, along with super majorities in the State house and senate. I was grateful to begin this new Congress by being an original cosponsor of H. Res. 354 to provide for a moratorium on Federal funding to Planned Parenthood, which has disgracefully sold baby body parts. In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may the President, by his actions, never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. 
MISSION STATEMENT OF A NEW MEMBER (Mr. GOTTHEIMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today for my first statement from the House floor, honored and humbled to serve as the Representative from New Jersey’s Fifth Congressional District. I vow to work tirelessly on their behalf. We are all tired of Washington’s partisanship, and I will work across the aisle, whenever possible, to get things done. New Jersey families and businesses are struggling with high taxes and not seeing good return on investment for the hardearned tax dollars they send to Washington each year. I will work to bring those dollars home to fight domestic terror, deal with opioid abuse, improve our schools, and fix our crumbling roads and bridges. I will work to bring goodpaying jobs back to New Jersey and keep them there, to lower our taxes, cut wasteful spending and unnecessary regulations, and ensure every tax dollar is used wisely. I will stand up for New Jersey values, ensuring that women, minorities, and the LGBT community are always treated with respect. I will have the backs of our veterans, law enforcement, firefighters, and all first responders. I will stand with Israel, ensure our children have clean drinking water, and stand up for equal pay and a woman’s right to choose. I will work for everyone in the District. Working together, I believe our best days will always be ahead of us. f 
LAW ENFORCEMENT APPRECIATION DAY (Mr. YODER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. YODER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Law Enforcement Appreciation Day, which was observed this week in honor of the contributions countless men and women in uniform have made to keep our communities safe and secure. This year’s observance was particularly difficult for our Kansas community. Over the last year, three police officers in my district made the ultimate sacrifice while in the line of duty. Brad Lancaster, Dave Melton of Kansas City, and Brandon Collins of Overland Park each lost their lives while protecting our community. Law Enforcement Appreciation Day is a day to remember them and to honor the men and women who remain in the field each day keeping our children and families safe. They are the ones who run into danger when others run away. They are the true heroes, and we should always regard them as such. It is also a day to honor the United States Capitol Police to keep Congress, our staff, and our visitors in this very Chamber safe. Mr. Speaker, let us never forget the service and sacrifice of our law enforcement officers, and let us continue to honor them with the gratitude and respect they deserve. 
THANKING PRESIDENT OBAMA FOR THE CLARITY OF HIS MORAL LEADERSHIP, FOR HIS GRACE, AND HIS CLASS (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, last night, President Obama delivered his farewell address to the Nation. Today, I rise to thank President Obama for his steady and his strong leadership over the past 8 years. He has served this Nation with dignity, with purpose, and helped us achieve some important successes during his tenure. When he took office, this country was on the brink of a depression, facing a financial crisis unlike anything we have experienced. He has helped to put us on the right track, rebuilding the American auto industry and steady private sector job growth. Now, we know we have a lot left to do, as he said last night. But he has given us the opportunity and the tools to continue that good work. No country, no nation, and certainly no government is dependent on any single individual. As he said, it is up to all of us, not just those of us in Congress or in public office but all citizens, to continue to work together to create the great society that we are all committed to. But it would be a mistake to not take this moment to thank that individual, to thank President Obama, for the clarity of his moral leadership, for his grace, and his class. We owe him a great debt of gratitude. 
SCIENCEBASED INNOVATION IN THE FIELD OF WATER RIGHTS (Mr. MCNERNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MCNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to continue a series of cool 1minute science topics. Today, I will speak about science based innovations in the field of water rights. Previously, conflicts over water resource management have reduced agricultural productivity and distracted farmers with lawsuits and litigation. But researchers at the University of Illinois at UrbanaChampaign have developed an online system for farmers to trade groundwater pumping rights. The National Science Foundation funded research that resulted in the creation of a new company, Mammoth Trading, which allows farmers to manage their lands and water rights to improve environmental conditions, improve resource allocation, and increase efficiency. These innovations demonstrate the power of science to increase productivity and positively influence the market. Congress should continue to encourage this type of ingenuity and innovation through R&D science funding. 
JACKI DIXON MARSH (Mr. POLIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, today, I would like to talk about a constituent in my district, Jacki Dixon Marsh. Jacki is an entrepreneur. She owns a historic storefront in downtown Loveland. In fact, she is the only woman who owns commercial space in the neighborhood. She runs a gallery featuring the work of over 100 local artisans, actively supporting jobs and contributing to our community. Jacki was also a competitive long distance runner. In 1972, she won the first women’s only road race in New York, and she continues to run. Finally, she has a pacemaker. She suffers from cardiomyopathy, a rare heart disease she developed after contracting the flu. While the doctor gave her only 2 years to live, she exceeded that prognosis by three decades, but her health depends on replacing her pacemaker every 7 to 8 years. Jacki is one of countless Americans for whom insurance through the Affordable Care Act is literally a matter of life or death. She says she pays a lot for her coverage, about 900 a month, but she told me she is excited to pay it. Before the Affordable Care Act, her precondition meant no coverage at all. When I asked Jacki what message she wanted me to share with my colleagues in Congress, she made clear that I should share the message that her situation is not unique. We need to act to make sure that people like Jacki continue to have healthcare coverage rather than ending the provisions of the Affordable Care Act that they rely on. f 
PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 78, SEC REGULATORY ACCOUNTABILITY ACT; PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 238, COMMODITY ENDUSER RELIEF ACT; AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 40 and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. BOST). The gentleman from Washington is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. POLIS), my good friend, pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Washington? There was no objection. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, the Rules Committee met and reported a rule, House Resolution 40, providing for the consideration of two important pieces of legislation: H.R. 238, the Commodity EndUser Relief Act, and H.R. 78, the SEC Regulatory Accountability Act. The rule provides for the consideration of these measures under a structured rule and makes in order any amendment submitted to the House Rules Committee, including all five Democratic amendments to H.R. 78, as well as all eight amendments submitted for H.R. 238, allowing for a balanced debate on these very substantial issues. H.R. 238 is essential to the smooth functioning of the American economy and is long overdue for enactment into law. This important legislation reauthorizes until 2021 the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, also known as the CFTC, which had its statutory authority lapse in 2013. The House passed the Commodity EndUser Relief Act with bipartisan support in the 114th Congress, and a similar bill was also adopted in the 113th Congress, establishing a strong record of bipartisan support for this measure. Unfortunately, in both instances, the Senate failed to take up the legislation before the end of its respective Congress, which is why it is imperative that we pass this bill through both Chambers and send it to the President’s desk. After the financial crisis of 2008, practically everyone agreed that changes needed to be made to our financial services sector in order to protect families, farmers, small businesses, and our economy, as well as to prevent another crisis in the future. Like many of my colleagues, I have concerns with some of the reforms that were instituted in response to the crisis because they have put overly burdensome restrictions and regulations on our economy and our business communities. But like every major, comprehensive law, there are always unintended consequences that need to be addressed, and H.R. 238 does exactly that. For example, the authors of Dodd Frank argued the law’s main purpose was to reduce systemic risk to our economy. However, I don’t think anyone would argue that farmers who are simply trying to lock in a good price for their corn or their wheat are a systemic risk to the economy. Similarly, restaurant chains looking to make sure they have enough beef, enough pork, or enough potatoes to sell to their customers don’t pose a systemic risk, just as utility companies seeking to ensure that they have adequate power supplies to meet the needs and demands of their ratepayers did not cause the financial crisis. Unfortunately, the current law imposes rules that treat all of these entities as major risks to our economy, and it imposes overly burdensome capital and paperwork requirements on them. Mr. Speaker, critics may claim that this bill undermines consumer protections. However, this could not be further from the truth. Title I of the legislation puts in place greater consumer protections, like requiring brokerage firms to notify investors before moving funds from one account to another in order to prevent abuses like those that occurred at MF Global prior to its bankruptcy. Title II makes reforms to the CFTC and strengthens the costbenefit analysis the Commission must perform when considering the impacts of its rules. Opponents have claimed that requiring costbenefit analyses will open up the CFTC to lawsuits. However, H.R. 238 merely gives the CFTC a standard for writing good rules the first time, which will be a benefit for all of us. Title III provides relief to the farmers, the restaurants, the manufacturers, the utilities, and other entities which rely on a steady supply of commodities and inherently want to avoid risk but have been caught up in the unintended consequences of the Dodd Frank reforms. These users have a genuine need to use markets to hedge against bad weather, natural disasters, inflation, price shocks, and other unforeseen circumstances that could jeopardize their ability to serve their customers. The rule also provides for the consideration of H.R. 78, the SEC Regulatory Accountability Act. This legislation replaces guidance adopted by the SEC in 2012 that currently governs the use of economic analysis in SEC rulemakings and requires the SEC to identify and assess the significance of problems prior to regulating. It directs the agency to conduct a review of existing regulations within 1 year of enactment— and then every 5 years thereafter—to determine the sufficiency, the effectiveness, and the burdens associated with their implementation. Further, H.R. 78 instructs the SEC’s Chief Economist to conduct a costbenefit analysis on regulations the agency is promulgating as well as to provide an explanation describing the SEC’s decisionmaking process, including the implications of not taking the regulatory action. Economic analysis is the cornerstone of prudent rulemaking and entails evaluating the qualitative and quantitative costs and benefits of proposed regulations as well as potential alternatives in order to determine the correct action an agency should take. We must ensure Federal regulators are thoroughly assessing both the need for the regulation and adequately evaluating its potential consequences—intended as well as unintended—to prevent small businesses and job creators from being unnecessarily burdened by onerous Federal regulations. Mr. Speaker, this is a good, straightforward rule, allowing for the consideration of two bills that will hold Federal agencies and their rulemaking processes accountable to the American people. Voters sent a clear message in November that they want a Federal Government that is smaller, less intrusive, and more discerning in its regulatory actions. House Republicans created our A Better Way agenda by listening to Americans about the ideas for our Nation, and the new, unified Republican government will continue our work to change the status quo and provide real progress for all Americans. The adoption of this rule and the passage of the underlying bills is yet another opportunity to show that we heard this message loud and clear and that we will reinforce our commitment to restoring the people’s voice in our Federal Government. I am proud to support the rule providing for the consideration of these measures, and I urge my colleagues to support the rule and the underlying bills. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank the gentleman for the customary 30 minutes. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule and the underlying bills. I start by, again, mentioning the fact that we have before us, under this rule, H.R. 238, the Commodity EndUser Relief Act, and H.R. 78, the SEC Regulatory Accountability Act. I will talk about them in a minute. There are 56 Members of this body who are new Members and who had no chance to participate in marking up 
these bills in their committees of jurisdiction. Sure, I am back and Mr. NEWHOUSE is back, but 56 people who were in that Congress in December are not here now, and there are 56 new people. Again, a regular order process would allow these bills to go through committee and have ideas and the participation from Democrats and Republicans, who represent, collectively, tens of millions of people in this country, in improving these bills. We did not allow it. These bills just appeared fait accompli in the Rules Committee yesterday. Here we are on the floor. None of the new Members had a chance in their committees to offer them. b1245 In fact, I am not sure where the Republicans are in their process, but Democrats are still finalizing our committee assignments. We have some of them, and the rest will be completed shortly. For Congress to work well, we need to have regular order. And for regular order to work, we need to make sure that the 56 new Members who represent tens of millions of people are not disenfranchised in this process. Now, getting to the bills. H.R. 238, the Commodities EndUser Relief Act, has been brought to the floor even before the Agriculture Committee convened or held its organizing meeting. It reauthorizes the Commodities Futures Trading Commission through 2021. It makes a lot of changes to internal changes and modifies a number of provisions that were designed to prevent financial meltdowns. Additionally, H.R. 238 includes language on issues that the Commodities Futures Trading Commission has already addressed through its own efforts. For example, the Commodities Future Trading Commission has acted on 16 of 22 provisions in titles I and III. Particularly, many of us are concerned by the crossborder language in the bill, which would undercut efforts already underway by the Commission to negotiate an international system of safe and robust derivative rules. H.R. 238 would actually require the Commodities Futures Trading Commission to create a rule that would automatically allow U.S. banks and foreign banks conducting business in the U.S. to do so under the rules imposed by foreign jurisdictions, which can be substantially different than those of our own, removing the confidence in the marketplace that is needed for a commodity market to work. Finally, as you know, Congress passed a number of reforms to enable regulators to respond quickly to changing markets. The provisions in title II would weaken the CFTC’s ability to respond in a timely and effective manner. The financial services industry continues to innovate. It is important that regulators keep pace and prevent systemic risks, prevent meltdowns, prevent bailouts. This bill would make it harder to do that. An example of how the Commission is engaged with and talking about innovation is how to fully embrace emerging technologies like blockchain and decentralized distribution ledgers. They are doing that because many financial firms are focusing on how to incorporate this technology into their business models. Therefore, it is imperative the Commission is given the ability to stay involved and understand the implications of new technology and innovations and is not hamstrung by this overly prescriptive law. Now, the Commission does need reauthorization, and I would love the opportunity to work with my colleagues on the other side to do so. It should be in a thoughtful, bipartisan manner that gives the agency the ability it needs to effectively look at incredibly complicated financial transactions, make sure that consumers and users of commodities that hedge their risks are not abused in the process. We do not want to hamstring the agency by unnecessary and counterproductive requirements as this bill does. The other bill, H.R. 78, the SEC Regulatory Accountability Act, also was brought forward before the Financial Services Committee got organized. This bill was not even considered by the House last Congress, and it stalled in the Financial Services Committee. So you actually have a bill that didn’t even clear committee last Congress. I was complaining about how the 56 Members that are new to this body didn’t have a chance to put their imprint on the first bill. The second bill didn’t even make it through the Financial Services Committee and didn’t even pass the House floor last session. Yet, here it is without the appropriate committee consideration, depriving new Members representing tens of millions of Americans—Democratic and Republican—the ability to improve this bill. Under the guise of regulation changes, H.R. 78 would actually require the SEC to conduct enhanced costbenefit analysis in order to ensure that benefits of their regulation justify the cost. In effect, the bill directs the SEC to look at things like market liquidity and small businesses, which, of course, it already does as part of its economic analysis. So, again, it is a bill that would bury the SEC in regulatory paperwork. H.R. 78’s costbenefit analysis is weighted toward helping large financial institutions save money. I support reducing costs for financial institutions. Who wouldn’t? But that is not the primary drive of our regulatory structure. We should put consumers and our systemic risks first and foremost and, of course, where we can reduce the unnecessary costs for our financial institutions in the hope that those would be passed along to those they serve. I, therefore, oppose both of these bills. I oppose the rule that limits the opportunity for Members to offer amendments to these two pieces of legislation. I oppose this process that disenfranchises our new Members. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. First of all, in fact, if I could read from a letter I received this morning from over two dozen agricultural groups. In one sentence, it says: ‘‘Thank you in advance for your support of this bill that is so important to U.S. farmers, ranchers, hedgers and futures customers.’’ It is signed, like I said, by over two dozen organizations. I include in the RECORD the letter I received this morning, I think, as did my colleague, Representative POLIS, from over two dozen agricultural groups and associations located throughout the country in unanimous support of H.R. 238. 
JANUARY 11, 2017. DEAR MEMBER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES : The undersigned organizations represent a very broad crosssection of U.S. production agriculture and agribusiness. We urge you to cast an affirmative vote on H.R. 238, the ‘‘Commodity EndUser Relief Act,’’ when it moves to the floor for consideration. This legislation contains a number of important provisions for agricultural and agribusiness hedgers who use futures and swaps to manage their business and production risks. Some, but certainly not all, of the bill’s important provisions include: Sections 101–103—Codify important customer protections to help prevent another MF Global situation. Section 104—Provides a permanent solution to the residual interest problem that would have put more customer funds at risk—and potentially driven farmers, ranchers and small hedgers out of futures markets—by forcing premargining of their hedge accounts. Section 306—Relief from burdensome and technologically infeasible recordkeeping requirements in commodity markets. Section 308—Requires the CFTC to conduct a study and issue a rule before reducing the de minimis threshold for swap dealer registration in order to make sure that doing so would not harm market liquidity and end user access to markets. Section 311—Confirms the intent of Dodd Frank that anticipatory hedging is considered bona fide hedging activity. Thank you in advance for your support of this bill that is so important to U.S. farmers, ranchers, hedgers and futures customers. Sincerely, American Cotton Shippers Association, American Farm Bureau Federation, American Feed Industry Association, American Soybean Association, Grain and Feed Association of Illinois, Kansas Grain and Feed Association, Michigan AgriBusiness Association, Michigan Bean Shippers, National Association of Wheat Growers, National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, National Corn Growers Association, National Cotton Council. National Council of Farmer Cooperatives, National Grain and Feed Association, National Milk Producers Federation, National Pork Producers Council, National Sorghum Producers, Nebraska Grain and Feed Association, North American Millers Association, Northeast Agribusiness and Feed Alliance, Ohio AgriBusiness Association, South Dakota Grain and Feed Association, USA Rice, Wisconsin AgriBusiness Association. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, also, in response to just one of the points that my colleague brought up, in the first 2 weeks of this 115th Congress, the Speaker, as well as the chairman of the Rules Committee, Representative SESSIONS , has provided opportunity for all Members to appear before the Rules Committee, has invited all Members to submit amendments. In fact, I can gladly say and happily say that every amendment submitted on these two bills has been accepted, if they were proven to be germane. In fact, one of the arguments made by my good friend is that the freshmen have not had an opportunity to weigh in on these two pieces of legislation. Actually, the young freshman from Maryland had an amendment brought forward, and it was accepted to bring for consideration on the floor. So I think the arguments fall hollow that Members have not had an opportunity to be heard. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CONAWAY ), the good chairman of the Agriculture Committee. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule to provide consideration of H.R. 238, the Commodity EndUser Relief Act. I want to start by thanking Mr. NEWHOUSE , Chairman S ESSIONS , and the entire Rules Committee for the time and work that they spent preparing this rule. I appreciate the committee’s time, attention, and interest in the work of the Agriculture Committee. I am especially gratified by their support of my push to authorize all of the unauthorized agencies and programs under our committee’s jurisdiction. Last Congress, we came very close, but we fell one agency short. The Commodities Future Trading Commission ended the year as it began it, unauthorized. The Commission, in fact, has not been reauthorized since October 2013. And since that time, the House of Representatives have voted twice to fix that problem. The most recent effort was in June of 2015. Tomorrow, if we pass H.R. 238, will be the third time this House has done its work on this oversight business. Under this rule, we have the opportunity to pick up where we left off and resume the House’s debate on the Commodity EndUser Relief Act. The text of H.R. 238 is identical to the legislation passed by this House last Congress, except for four changes: First, we included a specific annual spending authorization level, and it is set at the same level as last year’s appropriations. This ensures compliance with the majority leader’s floor protocols on both specific authorization levels and discretionary CutGo. Next, two sections were removed because they were already signed into law. Finally, we removed a section that required the Commission to report to Congress on the status of a pending Board of Trade registration application. That application has been approved, so there is no longer a reason for the Commission to comply with that language. Other than those four changes, the text of H.R. 238 includes every word passed by this House last Congress, including amendments offered by Mr. GALLEGO to encourage diversity in the Office of the Chief Economist, as well as Mr. Takai to identify information security vulnerabilities. This bill does not just reauthorize the CFTC. It also makes important process reforms and targeted changes to help Main Street businesses continue to access the risk management tools that they need to serve their customers. Over the past 4
1⁄2years, the House Committee on Agriculture has held almost two dozen hearings examining the Commission and investigating the impacts that the DoddFrank Act has had on derivatives markets. What we have found is that some of the rules have had unintended consequences for farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, and other businesses who use these markets to protect themselves from uncertainty. Our witnesses, many of whom were market participants struggling to comply with burdensome rules and ambiguous portions of underlying statute, were consistent in their call for relief. To address their concerns, H.R. 238 makes reforms that fall into three broad categories: customer protections, commission reforms, and enduser relief. The Commodity EndUser Relief Act does not roll back any of the key reforms made under DoddFrank. What it does, however, is allow Congress to keep its promise to Main Street America: Main Street did not cause the financial crisis, so Main Street should not have to pay for it. They shouldn’t have to pay for it with new fees. They shouldn’t have to pay for it in new compliance obligations. They shouldn’t have to pay for it in higher transactions costs. And they shouldn’t have to pay for it in lost opportunities to manage their business risks. I would like to close by thanking Chairman AUSTIN SCOTT and Ranking Member DAVID SCOTT for doing much of the heavy lifting on the committee’s issues. The two of them got deep into the weeds of financial reform. I would also like to thank Mr. LUCAS , who is a sponsor emeritus of this bill. We have been working on this issue since he was chairman, and much of the bipartisan work he did remains in this bill. I urge adoption of this rule and support for all the amendments that were made in order. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. When we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up legislation that would require the President and Vice President of the United States, their spouses and dependent children to disclose and divest any personal financial holdings that could create a conflict of interest by placing them in a blind trust. This has been standard for previous Presidents, and this legislation ensures that that precedent continues. In today’s news conference moments ago, Presidentelect Trump said that he did not plan to follow with precedent and place his assets in a blind trust and would continue his direct ownership interest in them. President elect Trump has refused to release his tax returns, refused to resolve conflicts of interest related to his business dealings. The American people expect the President to do what is best for the country and not what is best for his business or his pocket. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the amendment in the RECORD , along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Colorado? There was no objection. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, to discuss our proposal, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. CLARK ), the lead sponsor of the bill that I am proud to cosponsor. Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous question so we can bring up the Presidential Conflicts of Interest Act. Mr. Speaker, American families are worried. Over the last month, I have been flooded with messages from my constituents who are anxious about the direction of our country. Never before has our country been forced to ask its incoming President if he is motivated by service to his country or if he is motivated by personal enrichment. Never before have we had a Presidentelect who will act as both landlord and tenant of a publicly owned property being used for private profit. Never before have we had the same people who are running a President’s businesses also act as official advisers and agents. Never has a Presidentelect owed millions of dollars of debt to foreign banks. The next administration will shape how our tax dollars are spent, who the Federal Government does business with, and the integrity of America’s standing in the global economy. Every President in modern history has taken voluntary steps to ensure his financial interests do not conflict with the needs of the American people. Yet, the current Presidentelect refuses to place his assets and his businesses in a blind trust. The American people are left wondering whether their Presidentelect will work in their best interest or to line his own pockets. Mr. Speaker, this is unprecedented. There should be no question about whether the administration will put the needs of Americans first. There is 
nothing partisan about transparency and accountability that comes with being the leader of the free world. That is why we should all support the Presidential Conflicts of Interest Act. This bill strengthens transparency in the Oval Office and guarantees that the needs of the American people will never compete with or be beholden to a President’s financial interests. This bill ensures that the President and Vice President’s assets are placed in a certified blind trust. b1300 The bill also requires Presidential appointees to recuse themselves from matters involving the President’s financial conflicts of interest. Every President in recent history, from President Johnson to President Obama, has voluntarily used some form of blind trust or placed their assets in an investment vehicle over which they had no control. Our bill simply aligns the Presidentelect and future Presidents with this longheld practice. The American people are counting on our leadership. Every Democrat and every Republican should want to eliminate uncertainty and promote transparency and accountability in the executive branch. I ask my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous question so we can bring this urgently needed legislation to the floor. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, while I applaud the optimism and enthusiasm of the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. POLIS) about defeating the previous question, getting back to the debate on the rule, I have no further speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield myself the balance of my time. I just want to emphasize how important it is that we defeat the previous question. There are so many questions that have been raised. Not only is it in keeping with longstanding precedent for the President to divest and place their assets in a blind trust, but it is more important than ever with this President who has a complex web of assets, nationally and internationally, which are rife with conflicts of interest for the incoming administration. I truly hope we can act in a bipartisan way to defeat the previous question and bring forward Ms. CLARK ’s simple, straightforward bill. It affects future Presidents, Republican and Democratic, and it is a very simple, commonsense piece of legislation simply saying that they will divest and place their assets in a blind trust, something that is important for both the appearance of propriety as well as for the sake of propriety. And yet instead of focusing on legislation to investigate foreign powers undermining our recent election, instead of focusing on preventing conflicts of interest for the incoming administration, instead of focusing on legislation that would create jobs, reduce our deficit, or improve on health care, instead we have partisan legislation that hasn’t gone through regular order. It has left 56 new Members representing tens of millions of Americans on the sideline. The House passed a lot of legislation last Congress. That does not mean that we should bring every bill directly to the floor and skip the committee process, because there are 56 new Members who should also have a chance to put their imprint on legislation. The way the majority is bringing bills to the floor, it ignores the concerns of the American public; it ignores pressing issues related to the incoming President. We have this window of time under the outgoing President to send a bill to his desk to require disclosure and divestment from the new President, but that window is rapidly closing. We will only have President Obama in the White House for another week, so time is running short. If we act now and defeat the previous question, hopefully the Senate will act within a few days, and we can get the bill to President Obama. But the timeline is very, very short to do this. I do not expect that Mr. Trump would sign a bill that puts additional requirements on himself, although he would perhaps change that bill to affect future Presidents because it needs to be done. It is kind of shocking that we relied on precedents rather than law in this area. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ and defeat the previous question so I can bring forward Ms. CLARK ’s bill as my amendment. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the rule, and I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the underlying bill. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I certainly appreciate the discussion over the past few minutes. I believe that this rule and the underlying bills are strong measures that are important to the future of our country. This rule provides for ample debate on the floor, the opportunity to consider and vote on both H.R. 238 and H.R. 78, as well as every amendment that was submitted to the House Rules Committee, which reflects the balanced, open, and deliberative process afforded by this rule. H.R. 238 is a solid, substantial measure that will address several critical issues that the CFTC and end user are facing, while also addressing the CFTC’s lapsed reauthorization with reauthorizing the Commission through 2021. While some opponents have called for an open rule, this structured rule makes all eight submitted amendments in order. Mr. Speaker, no one wants to see complete deregulation of our financial services industries and our commodities and derivatives markets. However, it is critical that the regulations put in place are appropriate for our economy and our users. These rules have to provide safeguards and prevent systemic risk but should not hinder our entire economy with onesizefits all regulations. As we have discussed today, the current rules place enormous compliance and financial burdens on small businesses, on farmers and ranchers, utilities, and manufacturers. They take these small, riskaverse entities and place them under the same regulatory scheme as large financial institutions and hedge funds. H.R. 238 will differentiate and exempt the end users who are not a cause of systemic risk—as these entities inherently want to avoid risk—and, thus, shouldn’t be subject to the same rules and requirements as financial and investment firms that are less risk averse in nature. The Commodity EndUser Relief Act would make muchneeded reforms at the CFTC to strengthen their rulemaking process and add commonsense consumer protections so these regulations are not a continual burden on our Nation’s farmers and small businesses. Mr. Speaker, the rule also provides for consideration of H.R. 78 under a structured rule and makes all five Democratic amendments in order. This legislation takes important steps to engrain a stronger commitment to economic analysis at the SEC, which will facilitate the promulgation of reasonable rules that do not unduly burden registered companies or negatively impact job creation. The measure will increase transparency and oversight, while facilitating additional analysis and reviews of existing regulations, which should be something that all Members of this body can support. As elected Representatives, I believe we must ensure our regulatory framework is not politicized and that Federal regulators are thoroughly assessing both the need for the regulation as well as adequately evaluating its potential consequences. This bill takes important steps towards achieving all of these goals. It is important to remember that the financial crisis was not caused by the farmer who grows the food you eat for dinner, or by the utility you buy electricity from, or by the people who provide the wood in your desk or the metal used in your car. I don’t know of any reason why we should continue to treat them as if they were responsible, which is what the current law does and is what H.R. 238 seeks to correct. Further, better informing the American people of the true impact of major regulations does nothing to diminish the ability of regulators to adequately address illegal or inappropriate activities but, rather, increases transparency and the efficacy of Federal rules, which is why passage of H.R. 78 is so critical both to our constituents and to our economy. Mr. Speaker, this is a strong rule that provides for open and fair consideration of these vital pieces of legislation as well as every amendment that 
was submitted to the House Rules Committee. I am proud to speak in favor of this rule, and I urge all of my colleagues to support House Resolution 40 and both of the underlying bills. The material previously referred to by Mr. POLIS is as follows: 
THEVOTE ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION : WHAT ITREALLY MEANS  This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the House of Representatives (VI, 308–311), describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.’’ To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition’’ in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R–Illinois) said: ‘‘The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.’’ The Republican majority may say ‘‘the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.’’ But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here’s how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ‘‘Although it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by voting down the previous question on the rule. . . When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.’’ In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled ‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ‘‘Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon.’’ Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Republican majority’s agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous question. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule XX, this 15minute vote on ordering the previous question will be followed by 5 minute votes on agreeing to the resolution, if ordered; and suspending the rules and passing H.R. 39. The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were—yeas 232, nays 168, not voting 34, as follows:

MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT A message in writing from the President of the United States was communicated to the House by Mr. Brian Pate, one of his secretaries. REGULATORY ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 2017 GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 5. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Virginia? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. ALLEN ). Pursuant to House Resolution 33 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 5. The Chair appoints the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST) to preside over the Committee of the Whole. b1350 
Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill (H.R. 5) to reform the process by which Federal agencies analyze and formulate new regulations and guidance documents, to clarify the nature of judicial review of agency interpretations, to ensure complete analysis of potential impacts on small entities of rules, and for other purposes, with Mr. BOSTin the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the first time. The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOODLATTE ) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. CONYERS ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, it is a new day in America. For 8 years, the Obama administration has brought us one thing in response to the Nation’s need for recovery from hard times—failure. Bold, innovative measures to unleash American freedom, opportunity, and resourcefulness could have brought prosperity’s return after the Great Recession, just as under Ronald Reagan following his era’s recession. But the Obama administration responded differently, with measure after overreaching measure, through regulation, taxes, and spending. It was consumed by the folly of trying to force transformation from the American people through command and control from Washington. Everywhere it went, it sought to choose the winners and losers. When Washington tries to choose the winners and losers, we all lose. And lose we have. We have a national debt of $20 trillion thanks to the outgoing administration’s blowout spending. We have an economy that for 8 years has failed to produce enough good, new, fulltime jobs to sustain growth and restore dignity to the unemployed. We 
have 92 million Americans outside the workforce, a level not seen since the Carter years, and nearly $2 trillion of American wealth is commandeered each year to be spent as Washington bureaucrats see fit, through runaway regulation. But it is a new day in America. An incoming administration promises a new approach to make America great again. Central to that approach is regulatory reform. The Obama administration abused regulation to force its will on the American people. The assembling Trump administration promises to wipe out abusive regulation, freeing Americans to innovate and prosper once more. Today’s legislation will give this new administration the tools. The heart of today’s bill, the Regulatory Accountability Act, title I, restores to the people the true right to be heard by Washington’s regulators. It commands Washington bureaucrats to listen to the facts and ideas offered by the people and to follow them when they are better than the bureaucracy’s own. It calls on regulatory agencies to achieve the benefits Congress has called on them through statutes to achieve. But it gives the people full opportunities to offer fresh alternatives for doing so and to vet with the agencies the facts and ideas that work and those that don’t. After the public has fully contributed its say, agencies must choose the lowest cost alternative proven to work, achieving the needed benefits but rejecting unneeded costs. That leaves resources free to generate the benefits, create the jobs, and yield the higher wages only the private sector, through hard work and ingenuity, can achieve. The other titles of the bill strongly buttress this reform. Title II, the Separation of Powers Restoration Act, wipes out judicial deference to agency interpretations of statutes and regulations and restores to our system of checks and balances the rule Justice Marshall declared in Marbury v. Madison that ‘‘it is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is’’—not the bureaucracy. When title II is law, our courts will no more be rubber stamps for runaway regulatory interpretations that burst the bounds of what Congress truly intended through statutes. Title III, the Small Business Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act, provides teeth to existing law written to prompt regulatory agencies to tailor flexibility for small businesses into their rules. Small businesses have fewer resources to comply with Washington’s mandates. They need flexibility to survive. The terms of existing law for too long have been ignored by Washington bureaucrats. Title III assures the law will no longer be ignored, resulting in freedom and flexibility for America’s small businesses, which create the lion’s share of new jobs in this country and are pillars of communities across this land. Title IV prevents one of the most egregious of bureaucrats’ regulatory abuses: the promulgation of new rules that impose over a billion dollars in annual compliance costs, which must then be complied with even while meritorious litigation challenging their issuance proceeds in court. Title IV, the REVIEW Act, eliminates this abuse, forcing agencies to stay their billiondollar rules administratively if they are timely challenged in court. And in titles V and VI of the bill, the ALERT Act and the Providing Accountability Through Transparency Act, this legislation delivers much needed, greater transparency for the public about what new regulations agencies are developing and proposing so they can better prepare to comment on what is proposed, shape what is promulgated, and comply with final rules. With the help of these reforms, we can truly make America more competitive again, put Americans back to work, and free America’s entrepreneurs to innovate and launch more exciting new products and services again. I thank my colleagues, Small Business Committee Chairman CHABOT , Subcommittee Chairman MARINO , Representative RATCLIFFE , and Representative LUETKEMEYER , who have joined me in contributing titles to this legislation. I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT AND GOVERNMENT REFORM , Washington, DC, January 6, 2017. Hon. BOBGOODLATTE , Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN : I write concerning H.R. 5, the Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017. As you know, the Committee on the Judiciary received an original referral and the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform a secondary referral when the bill was introduced on January 3, 2017. I recognize and appreciate your desire to bring this legislation before the House of Representatives in an expeditious manner, and accordingly, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform will forego action on the bill. The Committee takes this action with our mutual understanding that by foregoing consideration of H.R. 5 at this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this or similar legislation. Further, I request your support for the appointment of conferees from the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform during any HouseSenate conference convened on this or related legislation. Finally, I would ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the Congressional Record during floor consideration to memorialize our understanding. Sincerely, JASON CHAFFETZ , Chairman. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY , Washington, DC, January 6, 2017. Hon. JASON CHAFFETZ , Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Washington, DC. DEARCHAIRMAN CHAFFETZ : Thank you for consulting with the Committee on the Judiciary and agreeing to be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 5, the ‘‘Regulatory Accountability Act,’’ so that the bill may proceed expeditiously to the House floor. I agree that your foregoing further action on this measure does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of your committee or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives on this bill or similar legislation in the future. I would support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate number of conferees from your committee to any HouseSenate conference on this legislation. 
I will seek to place our letters on H.R. 5 into the Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill. I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward to continuing to work together as this measure moves through the legislative process. 
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES , Washington, DC, January 6, 2017. Hon. STEVE CHABOT , Chairman, Committee on Small Business. DEAR CHAIRMAN CHABOT : Thank you for consulting with the Committee on the Judiciary and agreeing to be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 5, the ‘‘Regulatory Accountability Act,’’ so that the bill may proceed expeditiously to the House floor. I agree that your foregoing further action on this measure does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of your committee or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives on this bill or similar legislation in 
the future. I would support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate number of conferees from your committee to any HouseSenate conference on this legislation. I will seek to place our letters on H.R. 5 into the Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill. I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward to continuing to work together as this measure moves through the legislative process. Sincerely, BOBGOODLATTE , Chairman. 
Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in opposition, of course, to H.R. 5, the socalled Regulatory Accountability Act. Under the guise of improving the regulatory process, H.R. 5 will, in truth, undermine that process and jeopardize the ability of government agencies to safeguard public health and safety, the environment, workplace safety, and consumer financial protections. It is not a pleasant picture. The ways in which this legislation accomplishes this result are almost too numerous to list here, but, of course, I will mention a few. For example, title I of the bill would impose more than 70 new analytical requirements that will add years to the rulemaking process. Is that what we want to do? I don’t think so. Worse yet, many of these new requirements are intended to facilitate the ability of regulated entities—such as wellfunded corporate interests—to intervene and derail regulatory protections they oppose. And it would function as a ‘‘supermandate,’’ overriding critical laws that Congress specifically intended to prohibit agencies from considering costs when American lives are at stake. Additionally, the bill creates numerous procedural hurdles in the rulemaking process, further endangering American lives through years of delay and increasing the likelihood of regulatory capture. b1400 For example, H.R. 5 dramatically expands the use of formal rulemaking, a time and resourceintensive process, requiring formal, triallike hearings for certain rules. Formal rulemaking has long been roundly rejected for good cause as being excessively costly and illsuited for complex policy issues. The administrative section of the American Bar Association noted that ‘‘these provisions run directly contrary to a virtual consensus in the administrative law community that the Administrative Procedure Act formal rulemaking procedure is obsolete.’’ I am also concerned that H.R. 5 would impose an arbitrary, onesize fitsall, 6month delay on virtually every new rule. Specifically, title V of the bill will prohibit agency rules from becoming effective until the information required by the bill has been available online for 6 months with only limited exception. Clearly, H.R. 5 fails to take into account a vast array of timesensitive rules ranging from the mundane, such as the frequent United States Coast Guard bridge closings regulations, to those that protect public health and safety, such as forthcoming updates to the Lead and Copper Rule by the Environmental Protection Agency to reduce the lead in public drinking water. Finally, title II of H.R. 5 would eliminate judicial deference to agencies and require Federal courts to review all agency rulemakings and interpretations of statutes on a de novo basis. The unfortunate result of this requirement is that the bill would empower a generalist court to override the determinations of agency experts, regardless of the judge’s technical knowledge and understanding of the underlying subject matter. By eliminating any deference to agencies, H.R. 5 would force agencies to adopt even more detailed factual records and explanations, which would further delay the finalization of critical lifesaving regulatory protections. The Supreme Court has recognized that Federal courts simply lack the subjectmatter expertise of agencies, are politically unaccountable, and should not engage in making substantive determinations from the bench. It is ironic that those who have long decried judicial activism now support facilitating a greater role for the judiciary in agency rulemaking. These are only a few of the many serious concerns presented by H.R. 5, and, accordingly, I urge my colleagues to strongly oppose this dangerous legislation. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. 
AFL–CIO LEGISLATIVE ALERT , Washington, DC, January 10, 2017. DEAR REPRESENTATIVE : On behalf of the AFL–CIO, I am writing to express our strong opposition to H.R. 5, the Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017. This sweeping bill, which packages six antiregulatory measures passed by the House in the last Congress, would upend 40 years of labor, health, safety and environmental laws, threaten new needed protections leaving workers and the public in danger. The AFL–CIO urges you to oppose this harmful legislation. The Regulatory Accountability Act (RAA) is drafted as an amendment to the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), but it goes far beyond establishing procedures for rulemaking. The RAA acts as a ‘‘super mandate’’ overriding the requirements of landmark legislation such as the Occupational Safety and Health Act and Mine Safety and Health Act. The bill would require agencies to adopt the least costly rule, instead of the most protective rule as is now required by the OSH Act and MSH Act. It would make protecting workers and the public secondary to limiting costs and impacts on businesses and corporations. The RAA will not improve the regulatory process; it will cripple it. The bill adds dozens of new analytical and procedural requirements to the rulemaking process, adding years to an already slow process. The development of major workplace safety rules already takes 8—10 years or more, even for rules where there is broad agreement between employers and unions on the measures that are needed to improve protections. OSHA’s silica standard to protect workers from deadly silica dust took nearly 19 years and the beryllium standard 15 years. The RAA will further delay needed rules and cost workers their lives. The RAA substitutes formal rulemaking for the current procedures for public participation for high impact rules and other major rules upon request. These formal rulemaking procedures will make it more difficult for workers and members of the public to participate, and give greater access and influence to business groups that have the resources to hire lawyers and lobbyists to participate in this complex process. For agencies that already provide for public hearings, such as OSHA and MSHA, the bill would substitute formal rulemaking for the development of all new rules, overriding the effective public participation processes conducted by these agencies. H.R. 5 would subject all agencies—including independent agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to these new analytical and procedural requirements. It would be much more difficult for agencies to develop and issue new financial reform rules and consumer protection rules required under recently enacted legislation. This radical legislation doesn’t just apply to regulations; it would also require agencies to analyze the costs and benefits of major guidance documents, even though these documents are nonbinding and have no legal force. Guidance documents are an important tool for agencies to disseminate information on significant issues and hazards quickly in order to protect the public and workers. For example, in response to the Ebola virus threat, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) issued critical guidance documents in order to prevent the spread of disease, including recommendations for infection control and protections for healthcare workers and emergency responders. Similar guidance was issued was issued to prevent transmission of the Zika virus. Under the RAA’s provisions, CDC would be required to assess the costs and benefits of these major guidance documents, making it virtually impossible to provide information and recommendations in a timely manner. H.R. 5 also includes a grab bag of other harmful antiregulatory measures that thwart, weaken and undermine protections. The Separation of Powers Restoration Act abolishes judicial deference to agencies’ statutory interpretations in rulemaking requiring a court to decide all relevant questions of law de novo, allowing courts to substitute their own policy judgements for the agencies’ expert policy determinations. The Small Business Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act (SBRFIA) imposes numerous unnecessary new analytical and procedural requirements on all agencies. It gives the Chief Counsel of the Small Business Administration’s (SBA) Office of Advocacy, which in practice operates largely as a mouthpiece for large business interests, new broad powers to second guess and challenge agency rules. The Require Evaluation before Implementing Executive Wishlists Act (REVIEW Act) would automatically stay the implementation of any rule with an estimated annual cost of $1 billion that has been challenged, precluding courts from making this decision, and delaying protections. Other titles add even more unnecessary requirements to the rulemaking process. The Regulatory Accountability Act would gut the nation’s safety, health and environmental laws, stripping away protections 
from workers and the public. It would tilt the regulatory process solidly in favor of business groups and others who want to stop regulations and make it virtually impossible for the government to issue needed safeguards. The AFL–CIO strongly opposes H.R. 5 and urges you to vote against this dangerous legislation. Sincerely, WILLIAM SAMUEL , Director, Government Affairs Department. 
CONSUMER FEDERATION OF AMERICA , January 10, 2017. Re Oppose legislation on House Floor to undermine crucial consumer protections: H.R. 5. DEAR REPRESENTATIVE : The Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017 (H.R. 5) would handcuff all federal agencies in their efforts to protect consumers. H.R. 5 is a vastly expanded version of previous versions of the Regulatory Accountability Act (RAA). H.R. 5 not only significantly and problematically amends the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) which has guided federal agencies for many decades but also now incorporates five additional bills that thwart the regulatory process: the Small Business Regulatory Flexibility Improvement Act; the Require Evaluation before Implementing Executive Wishlists Act (REVIEW Act); the All Economic Regulations are Transparent Act (ALERT Act); the Separation of Powers Restoration Act; and the Providing Accountability Through Transparency Act. These titles make an already damaging bill even worse. Specifically, the RAA would require all agencies, regardless of their statutorily mandated missions, to adopt the least costly rule, without consideration of the impact on public health and safety or the impact on our financial marketplace. As such, the RAA would override important bipartisan laws that have been in effect for years, as well as more recently enacted laws to protect consumers from unfair and deceptive financial services, unsafe food and unsafe consumer products. For example, the RAA would likely have prevented the Federal Reserve from adopting popular credit card rules under the Truth in Lending Act in 2008 that prevented card companies from unjustifiably increasing interest rates and fees on consumers. This is because these farreaching changes to abusive practices that were widespread in the marketplace were not the ‘‘least costly’’ options that were considered, although they were arguably the most costeffective. The RAA would have a chilling impact on the continued promulgation of important consumer protections. Had it been in effect, for example, the RAA would have severely hampered the implementation of essential and longstanding food safety regulations, such as those requiring companies to prevent contamination of meat and poultry products with deadly foodborne pathogens. In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has credited the implementation of regulations prohibiting contamination of ground beef with E. coli O157:H7 as one of the factors contributing to the recent success in reducing E. coli illnesses among U.S. consumers.’ But such benefits are impossible to quantify before a rule is enacted. Further, had the RAA been in effect the necessary child safety protections required by the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA) may have never been implemented. For example, between 2007 and 2011 the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) recalled 11 million dangerous cribs. These recalls fol owed 3,584 reports of crib incidents, which resulted in 1,703 injuries and 153 deaths. As a direct result of the CPSIA, CPSC promulgated an effective mandatory crib standard that requires stronger mattress supports, more durable hardware, rigorous safety testing, and stopped the manufacture and sale of drop side cribs. If the RAA were implemented, such a life saving rule could have been delayed for years or never promulgated at all, at countless human and financial cost. The RAA also would add dozens of additional substantive and procedural analyses, as well as judicial review to the rulemaking process for every major rule. It would: expand the kind of rules that must go through a formal rulemaking process; require agencies to determine ‘‘indirect costs’’ without defining the term; require an impossibleto conduct estimation of a rule’s impact on jobs, economic growth, and innovation while ignoring public health and safety benefits; and expand the powers of the White House’s Office of Management and Budget’s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs to throw up numerous rulemaking roadblocks, including requiring them to establish guidelines for conducting costbenefit analysis. This would further delay or prevent the promulgation of much needed consumer protections. The new titles of H.R. 5 also add numerous roadblocks to the promulgation of necessary consumer protections. The Separation of Powers Restoration Act (Title II) eliminates 
judicial deference that agencies are granted when rules are challenged in court. This allows judicial activism and political considerations to trump agency expertise. The Small Business Regulatory Flexibility Improvement Act (Title III) would increase regulatory delays and create new opportunities for court challenge to regulations. The Require Evaluation before Implementing Executive Wishlists Act (REVIEW Act) (Title IV) would encourage frivolous legal challenges and infuse the regulatory process with years of delay by requiring courts reviewing ‘‘high impact’’ regulations to automatically ‘‘stay’’ or block the enforcement of such regulations until all litigation is resolved. The All Economic Regulations are Transparent Act (ALERT Act) (Title V) would also blatantly and purposefully lengthen the regulatory process by requiring a sixmonth delay in the development of regulations. We urge you to oppose this significant threat to consumer protection, a fair marketplace, health, and safety posed by H.R. 5. If adopted, this proposal would waste federal resources, minimize the ability of federal agencies to do their jobs, grind the regulatory process to a halt, and infuse the regulatory process with roadblocks preventing the protection of the public and ultimately putting American consumers at risk. We strongly urge you to oppose this harmful bill. Sincerely, RACHEL WEINTRAUB , Legislative Director and General Counsel. 
COALITION FOR SENSIBLE SAFEGUARDS , January 10, 2017. Re Floor vote of H.R. 5, the Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017. DEAR REPRESENTATIVE : The Coalition for Sensible Safeguards (CSS), an alliance of over 150 labor, scientific, research, good government, faith, community, health, environmental, and public interest groups, strongly opposes H. R. 5, the Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017 (RAA), which will be voted on this week. H.R. 5 is a compilation of radical and harmful legislative proposals that will permanently cripple the government’s ability to protect the public by rigging the regulatory process against new regulatory safeguards in favor of deregulation or regulatory inaction. The bill is just as dangerous and extreme as the REINS Act (H.R. 26) and the Midnight Rules Relief Act (H.R. 21). All of these bills are designed to make it as difficult as possible for federal agencies to implement existing or new laws that ensure our access to clean air and water, safe workplaces, untainted food and drugs, safe toys and consumer goods, and a stable financial system free of Wall Street recklessness. On the other hand, deregulatory actions that repeal existing rules are exempt by virtue of the legislation’s myopic focus on ‘‘costs’’ to corporate special interests instead of ‘‘benefits’’ to the public. In short, the legislation will create a double standard in our regulatory system that systematically favors deregulation over new public protections and ‘‘fasttracks’’ the repeal of rules while paralyzing the creation of new ones. The new version of the RAA, introduced in this Congress, takes the previous RAA legislation and folds in several destructive pieces of other socalled regulatory reform bills including: the misleadingly named Small Business Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act, the Require Evaluation before Implementing Executive Wishlists Act (REVIEW Act), the All Economic Regulations are Transparent Act (ALERT Act), the Separation of Powers Restoration Act and the Providing Accountability Through Transparency Act. These pieces of other bills seek to worsen an already destructive bill and add several more corrosive layers intending to dismantle our public protections. The current rulemaking process is already plagued with lengthy delays, undue influence by regulated industries, and convoluted court challenges. If passed, Title I of this bill would make each of these problems substantially worse and would undermine our public protections and jeopardize public health by threatening the safeguards that ensure our access to clean air and water, safe workplaces, untainted food and drugs, and safe toys and consumer goods. Rather than enhancing protections, it does the exact opposite. It adds 80 new analytical requirements to the Administrative Procedure Act and requires federal agencies to conduct estimates of all the ‘‘indirect’’costs and benefits of proposed rules and all potential alternatives without providing any definition of what constitutes, or more importantly, does not constitute an indirect cost. The legislation would significantly increase the demands on already constrained agency resources to produce the analyses and findings that would be required to finalize any new rule. Thus, the RAA is designed to further obstruct and delay rulemaldng rather than improve the regulatory process. This legislation creates even more hoops for ‘‘major’’ or ‘‘highimpact’’ rules i.e., rules that provide society with the largest health and safety benefits. It would allow any interested person to petition the agency to hold a public hearing on any ‘‘genuinely disputed’’ scientific or factual conclusions underlying the proposed rule. This provision would give regulated industries multiple opportunities to challenge agency data and science and thus further stretch out the already lengthy rulemaking process. H.R. 5 would also create a restrictive mandate of a ‘‘onesizefitsall’’ directive that every federal agency adopt the ‘‘least costly’’ alternative. This is a profound change and effectively creates a ‘‘supermandate’’ for all major regulatory actions of executive and independent agencies which overrides twentyfive existing statutes, including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, and the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act. These laws prioritize public health, safety, and economic security, not the cost concerns of regulated entities. Title II of H.R. 5 is the Separation of Powers Restoration Act piece which seeks to destroy the Chevron deference principal. It would remove the judicial deference that agencies are granted when their regulations are challenged in court. This would be a radical change that upends one of the fundamental principles in administrative law, namely that courts should not secondguess scientific and technical expertise at federal agencies. Overly intrusive judicial review is one of the primary reasons for regulatory delay and paralysis and this legislation would make those problems much worse. The misleadingly named Small Business Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act (Title III) is a Trojan horse that would expand the reach and scope of regulatory review panels, increase unnecessary regulatory delays, increase undue influence by regulated industries and encourage convoluted court challenges all in the name of helping ‘‘small business,’’ but so expansively applied that mostly big businesses would benefit. Because the bill mandates that these panels look at ’indirect costs,’ which are defined very broadly, it could be applied to virtually any agency action to develop public protections. The REVIEW Act (Title IV) would make our system of regulatory safeguards weaker by requiring courts reviewing ‘‘highimpact’’ regulations to automatically ‘‘stay’’ or block the enforcement of such regulations until all litigation is resolved, a process that takes many years to complete. It would add several years of delay to an already glacially slow rulemaking process, invite more rather than less litigation, and rob the American people of many critical upgrades to science based public protections, especially those that ensure clean air and water, safe food and consumer products, safe workplaces, and a stable, prosperous economy. The ALERT Act (Title V) is designed to impede the government’s ability to implement critical new public health and safety protections by adding a sixmonth delay. This amounts to a sixmonth regulatory moratorium, even after the often lengthy period required for developing and finalizing these regulations. Such delays could extend well beyond that initial sixmonth period should the OIRA Administrator fail to post the required information in a timely manner. This new version of the RAA would override and threaten decades of public protections. The innocuoussounding act is, in reality, the biggest threat to public health standards, workplace safety rules, environmental safeguards, and financial reform regulations to appear in decades. It acts as a ‘‘supermandate,’’ rewriting the requirements of landmark legislation such as the Clean Air Act and the Occupational Safety and Health Act and distorting their protective focus to instead prioritize compliance costs. We strongly urge opposition to H.R. 5, the Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017. Sincerely, R OBERT WEISSMAN , President, Public Citizen Chair, Coalition for Sensible Safeguards. 
AFSCME, WEMAKEAMERICA HAPPEN , Washington, DC, January 9, 2017. DEARREPRESENTATIVE : On behalf of the 1.6 million working and retired members of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), I am writing to urge you to oppose the Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017 (H.R. 5). This reckless legislation would severely undermine the nation’s ability to ensure that workers are safe on the job and in the marketplace. If enacted, H.R. 5 would effectively end the federal government’s ability to enact new protections on behalf of the American people. Instead, the Regulatory Accountability Act looks to protect businesses from people as a platform for policymaking. The Regulatory Accountability Act would upset the constitutional balance between branches of the government and impose new burdens on an already cumbersome regulatory process. In rulemaking, federal agencies must adhere to the requirements of the statue being implemented, and are often given a roadmap from Congress. From there, federal agencies must also follow the robust procedural and analytical requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, the Paperwork Reduction Act, and the Congressional Review Act, The Regulatory Accountability Act adds more than 70 steps to the regulatory process while giving corporate interests more opportunities to influence and weaken standards. It would require unnecessary Advance Notices for a large number of rules, and impose unnecessary new evidentiary standards as a condition of rulemaking. It would subject the regulatory process to unneeded rounds of litigation. 
The Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017 will prevent agencies from growing and addressing new issues for environmental, public health, workplace safety and consumer financial security protections. We urge you to oppose this legislation. Sincerely, SCOTT FREY, Director of Federal Government Affairs. 
Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. CHAFFETZ ) who is the chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee and a member of the Judiciary Committee. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairman GOODLATTE . I also want to thank Congressman RATCLIFFE of Texas. Included in H.R. 5 is the All Economic Regulations Are Transparent Act, or the ALERT Act. I want to highlight that, in the past two Congresses, the ALERT Act was reported favorably out of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. The ALERT Act itself is simply a transparency bill. It requires the administration to provide meaningful information about upcoming regulations online before those are actually issued. Early online disclosure will create the need for transparency so the public can see what is on the horizon. Each month, Federal agencies will be required to list all regulations expected to be proposed or finalized within the following year. For each regulation on the list, the issuing agency is required to provide basic information to the public about that regulation. This includes the objectives of the regulation, the legal basis for the regulation, and where it stands in the rulemaking process. If the agency expects to finalize the regulation within the following year, the agency is also required to provide information about the impact of the regulation. This includes estimates on the costs, the completion date, and the economic effects of the regulation, including the net effect on jobs—something that doesn’t happen now but seems to be just common sense. In this 21st century, Federal agencies should have to show their work online so the public can engage. That is why I like what Mr. RATCLIFFE has championed since he has become a Member of this Congress. Let’s also understand and remember that, by the administration’s own estimates, Federal regulations promulgated over the last 10 years have imposed the cost of at least $100 billion annually on the American taxpayers. Again, I appreciate Chairman GOODLATTE ’s work and commitment on this issue. I want to thank, again, our good friend, Congressman JOHN RATCLIFFE , for his work on this. The Oversight and Government Reform Committee has looked upon this very favorably. We are very supportive of the overall bill, as well as this specific provision. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT) who is a very active former member of the Judiciary Committee. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend for yielding. Mr. Chairman, over the past 2 weeks, the majority has considered three bills on the House floor designed to undermine the ability of the executive branch to implement essential economic and public health protections for the people we have the honor to represent: the socalled Midnight Rules Relief Act, which could retroactively disallow rules issued as far back as June of last year; the REINS Act, which requires a majority vote of both Houses of Congress before any major rule can go into effect; and today’s Regulatory Accountability Act, which is an 82page omnibus bill which would effectively tie the executive branch into so much red tape that environmental, workplace, and consumer protections might never see the light of day. By enacting these statutes, Congress would impair the constitutional duty of the executive branch to ‘‘take care that laws be faithfully executed’’ and replace them with a series of layers that can be applied by deeppocketed special interests, including one provision that prevents some rules from going into effect that may affect public safety if somebody files a lawsuit. The question is: Who loses when these playing fields are tilted this way? Well, just a couple within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Education and Labor, 4.2 million working people would lose. That is the number of people who would be eligible for overtime pay as a result of the responsible actions taken by the Obama administration. They would lose the benefit of overtime for time worked in excess of 40 hours a week. Working families and seniors could lose their retirement savings. Last year, the Obama administration released a fiduciary rule that ensures that retirement savings are protected from financial advisers who may prioritize fees over services. Without the rule, working families and seniors could lose billions of dollars every year in retirement savings by being unnecessarily charged by unscrupulous financial advisers. Students in lowincome school districts could lose. Without the Department of Education’s new supplement notsupplant rule, these students would lose critical resources, and those resources would be redirected to wealthier districts. So let’s be clear. The bill before us is not on the side of children, workers, and retirees. Instead, the bill throws sand in the gears of the regulatory process by adding more layers to the process, rigging it in favor of powerful corporate interests, and encouraging frivolous lawsuits. That is not what Congress should be focusing on. Instead, we should be building on the progress that has been achieved over the last 8 years. We should be considering legislation that increases wages, improves the lives of working families, increases access to high quality child care and early childhood education, supports quality public schools in every neighborhood, makes colleges more affordable, helps American families balance work and family life, and empowers workers to organize and collectively bargain. That has been the focus of my Democratic colleagues on the Education and the Workforce Committee, and that focus will remain in the years ahead. So I urge the majority to partner with us to protect and promote the rights of working people and students by defeating this bill. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCARTHY ) who is the distinguished majority leader of the House. Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank the chairman for his work. I would also like to highlight a few Members whose work is inside this bill. First, Congressman MARINO , Congressman RATCLIFFE , Chairman C HABOT , and Congressman LUETKEMEYER have all done a tremendous amount of work to make this bill here today, and I appreciate that. Mr. Chairman, we have a grave problem in our Federal Government. It undermines our Constitution, it contradicts the will of the people, and it is a deadweight on our economy destroying American jobs and costing billions of dollars per year in paperwork and lost opportunities. I am talking about the duplicative and unforgiving Federal bureaucratic state. But before I discuss the dangers that an overzealous bureaucracy poses to our country, I want to be clear that the House has already made great progress. We are engaged in a twostep approach: first, to change the structure of Washington that deprives the people of their power; and second, to repeal specific harmful regulations. We will get started on the second part early next month. We have already passed two bills last week to change Washington’s structure, the Midnight Rules Relief Act and the REINS Act. Today, we will pass the third, the Regulatory Accountability Act. This requires agencies to choose the least costly option available to do what they are charged to do and prohibits large rules from going into effect while they are still being challenged in court. It also ends something called Chevron deference where courts automatically bend to the agency’s interpretation of the rules. Under the current standard, that means the agency will win almost every single time in the courtroom and the people lose. These three bills are about more than stopping bad regulations from being made. They are about changing the process in Washington that systemically prioritizes government over the 
common good instead of making government serve the common good. Mr. Chairman, our Nation is based on a principle that power ultimately comes from the people. Elections are the great foundation of our Republic, and, as we saw so clearly this last November, through them, the people can make their voices heard. But something has changed. Some of the most significant decisions in Washington, those that most affect the lives of the public, are made by those who don’t stand for election. What happens when the EPA imposes rules that deprive people of their property rights, when the Department of Health and Human Services tries to force nuns to violate their religion, or when the VA perpetuates a system that lets veterans die while they wait for their care? The people can’t vote out bureaucrats who write rules at the EPA or the Department of Health and Human Services. They can’t vote out bad leaders of the VA. These bureaucrats know it. They know they aren’t accountable to the people even as they exercise great power. Without elections, the people lose. Washington is brimming with executive employees devoted to preserving the status quo. Then there is a revolving door of highlevel Federal employees who head to major consulting firms and lobbying arms to influence the very agencies they came from. This breeds thousands of regulations that further enrich the connected and powerful—sometimes at the great expense of the average American. b1415 It is our economy and the American workers who suffer the most. Federal regulations written and enacted by these bureaucracies impose a burden of about $1.89 trillion every year. That number is hard to make sense of or to even imagine. It comes to, roughly, $15,000 per U.S. household, or 10 percent of the American GDP. The Obama administration alone has written regulations that require over 583 million hours to comply with. That is an average of nearly 5 hours of paperwork for every single fulltime employee in America. The Federal Register is now the length of 80 King James Bibles. When bureaucrats and agency heads cannot be held accountable and when they keep their jobs regardless of corruption, incompetence, waste, fraud, abuse, or the backroom deals they make with special interests, that is the problem. That is the swamp, and we need to drain it. There is a reason the House is restructuring Washington first. It is that we made a commitment to the American people that we would drain the swamp. Now we are today. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. CUMMINGS ), the ranking member of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. Mr. CUMMINGS. I thank the gentleman. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 5. Before I go into that, let me be clear. After listening to the leader a minute ago, I thank all of the Federal employees who work so hard and give so much and who are so often unseen, unnoticed, unappreciated, and unapplauded. I oppose this unnecessary and potentially dangerous legislation in its entirety. However, I will focus my remarks on title V of this bill, which is in the jurisdiction of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. Title V, also known as the ALERT Act, is an attack on agency rulemaking, like the rest of this bill. This title would prohibit the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs from taking into account benefits when providing estimating costs of proposed and final rules. That is not transparency. It is one side of the story. This bill would also prevent a rule from taking effect until certain information is posted online for 6 months by the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. The only exceptions to this requirement would be if an agency exempts the rule from the notice and comment requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act or if the President issues an executive order. That is a 6month delay in putting any rule in place no matter how big or how small. Right now, there are rules pending to protect the public from pipeline accidents involving hazardous liquids—those are our constituents, by the way—and to protect the privacy of patients’ records. Again, those are our constituents. This bill would put an arbitrary 6month moratorium on rules like these. The Coalition for Sensible Safeguards, which is a coalition of over 150 labor, scientific, health and good government groups, sent a letter on January 10, 2017, opposing H.R. 5 to all Members of the House of Representatives. That letter read in part: The ALERT Act is designed to impede the government’s ability to implement critical new public health and safety protections by adding a 6month delay. This amounts to a 6 month regulatory moratorium even after the often lengthy period required for developing and finalizing these regulations. Such delays could extend well beyond that initial 6 month period should the OIRA Administrator fail to post the required information in a timely manner. 
The other titles of this bill are not any better and would impose so many requirements on agencies that issuing regulations to protect health and safety would be almost impossible. I urge my colleagues to reject H.R. 5. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. MARINO ), the chairman of the Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law Subcommittee and the chief sponsor of one of the bills contained herein. Mr. MARINO. I thank the chairman. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5, the Regulatory Accountability Act. This bill represents a monumental opportunity for the American people. After 8 years of one new crushing regulatory burden after another, the time has come to finally free the American people and create a new future for our economy. In 2017, regulatory burdens are at record levels. One recent analysis by the American Action Forum puts the cumulative paperwork burden on the American people at 11.5 billion hours. How could any small business person or entrepreneur survive in the face of this monstrous web of regulation? The short answer is that they cannot. It is a fact seen across my district as I have talked to workers covering every industry or occupation imaginable. When I ask businessowners about their concerns, first and foremost, the greatest hardship they face is the burden of Federal regulation and red tape. Funds, which otherwise could be invested in new employees, training, or equipment, must be dedicated to the demands of faceless bureaucrats in D.C. This applies to plumbers as well as to farmers, manufacturers to home builders. The list of those affected is long and varied. The simple truth is that the Obama administration’s onesizefitsall regulatory agenda has been a disaster for the American Dream, and we have seen over the past several months how disconnected it was from the wants and needs of Americans across the country. In Congress, however, we have heard their pleas and have taken action in the early days of the 115th Congress. H.R. 5 is the third regulatory reform bill we have considered in 2 weeks. It represents our brightest opportunity to unleash innovation and investment so that American businesses, big and small, can create new futures. I am also grateful that H.R. 5 includes my bill, the REVIEW Act. The REVIEW Act was featured as part of Speaker RYAN’s A Better Way agenda and passed the House on a bipartisan basis last fall. It represents a simple premise: regulations should be narrowly tailored, and massive regulations deserve full and thorough scrutiny. The REVIEW Act would mandate a stay of any highimpact, billiondollar regulation while judicial review is underway. Historically, billiondollar rules have been few and far between. In fact, only 26 have been put in place since 2006; but, in recent years, their frequency has grown along with the unprecedented reach of the regulatory state. In the past 8 years, an average of three per year have been put in place. Their significance, however, lies in their impact on our country. These regulations are massive and have the potential to fundamentally and irreversibly change entire industries. If, later, judicial review finds the agency’s reasoning to be legally unsound or contrary to the intent of Congress, the 
compliance costs incurred—often meaning jobs that were lost—cannot be undone. The REVIEW Act provides an important check on regulatory largesse and is an important piece of this bill. The American people have spoken, and they have spoken clearly. It is time for us all to take our country and the economy in the right direction. The Regulatory Accountability Act provides the reforms that are necessary to get us there. I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. COHEN ), a senior member of our committee who has followed this matter very closely. Mr. COHEN. I thank the gentleman. Mr. Chairman, these bills are a group of bills that have been considered for many years and have passed on partisan votes in the House. What you do when you repeal regulations or make it harder to have regulations is you make it better for business, better for the Chamber crowd, better for the manufacturing folk. But there is always a cost for everything. I think it was Isaac Newton who said: ‘‘For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.’’ You take these regulations off, increase business, and make it easier; but there is an equal and opposite effect in that Newtonian law as the consumer of the products. Whether it is food and food safety, whether it is water safety and purity, whether it is air safety, whether it is toys and manufacturers’ defects or automobiles and safety in transportation—it could be airplane transportation—there is always a side that loses; and the side that loses is that of the consumers and the folks who will be injured and/or killed because of lack of regulations. I don’t know how much one life is worth. If it is mine or one of my loved ones or one of my constituents—I am getting a little political here—it is worth a lot, but it is worth a lot no matter who it is, and there are going to be lots of people who will not survive some of these regulations. There are going to be injuries in the workplace because regulations for safety aren’t there. There will be food products that are defective because regulations aren’t in place, and people will eat food that is not appropriate, not pure. I had an amendment I proposed here on civil rights, and I think civil rights is one of our most precious rights—one that has been neglected on many occasions. That amendment would have said that this would not affect any civil rights rules, but it was not put in order; but it includes people with disabilities. Those are areas in which we should have exempted and not had anything stop our steadfastness toward securing civil rights and securing opportunities for people with disabilities. I am against the bills. I am for the consumer. I think there might be a measured way to do this, but this is a heavyhanded way to do it, and the consumer loses. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT ), the chairman of the Small Business Committee, a member of the Judiciary Committee, and the chief sponsor of one of the bills contained herein. Mr. CHABOT. I thank the chairman for yielding. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5, the Regulatory Accountability Act. In response to the previous gentleman’s comments, I would just note that none of the regulations that we are considering today—the legislation—is going to do away with regulations altogether or even significantly, especially, regulations that have to do with people’s safety. We are not trying to do anything that is going to affect the safety of the American people. We are just trying to make sure the regulations are smarter, and that is what this is all about. I am also pleased that title III of H.R. 5 is a bill that I sponsored last term and in this Congress—the Small Business Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act. The Committee on Small Business, which I happen to chair, and the Committee on the Judiciary have crafted this bill with bipartisan input over many years. I thank Chairman GOODLATTE for working with us on this important legislation, and I thank him for his leadership. Small businesses are found in every congressional district and in every industry. They provide livelihoods for millions of workers and for their families. Small businesses employ nearly half of the private sector workforce and generate two out of every three new jobs in the private sector today. The Federal Government should be doing everything it can to encourage these small but mighty job creators. Unfortunately, oppressive red tape has had the opposite effect of discouraging investment, expansion, and job growth. I am not saying that all regulations are bad, but there are too many rules. For too long, agencies have ignored their true effect, their true impact, on small businesses. Small businesses are at a real disadvantage because they have fewer resources and rarely have inhouse counsel, the regulatory compliance staff that would be necessary to guide them through this maze. Generally, small businesses just don’t have that. So shouldn’t regulators, at the very least, examine the effects of new rules on small businesses and consider ways to reduce excessive burdens? Of course they should. There is a law, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, or the RFA, which requires agencies to conduct this commonsense assessment when they regulate. Even though the law has been on the books for over 36 years, agencies too frequently just ignore its requirements. b1430 The Small Business Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act, which is title III in this bill, eliminates loopholes that agencies like the Internal Revenue Service have used to avoid compliance with the RFA. It also forces agencies to analyze not only the direct, but also the indirect effects of rules on small businesses, just as agencies are required to do when promulgating major rules affecting, for example, the environment. It gives small businesses additional opportunities for early input on proposed rules and regulations and strengthens the RFA’s requirements for agencies to periodically review old rules. Nothing in our legislation today takes away an agency’s ability to issue a rule or a regulation, but it will force the rulemakers to think carefully before they act. It is great legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. RATCLIFFE ), a member of the Judiciary Committee and the chief sponsor of two of the measures contained here. Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017. I thank Chairman GOODLATTE for the opportunity to again lead on this issue and for the inclusion of two of my bills—the Separation of Powers Restoration Act and the ALERT Act—in this incredibly important regulatory reform package. Because you see, Mr. Chairman, the realities of President Obama’s failed liberal progressive experiment are all too real for the threequarters of a million Texans that I represent, realities like higher prices for families in Sulphur Springs trying to make ends meet, fewer jobs for those seeking work in Texarkana, and small businesses in Sherman and Rockwall forced to close their doors. Mr. Chairman, these are just a few of the countless devastating symptoms of overregulation that citizens across our great country have been forced to endure under President Obama. The President gives a good speech, and he did so again in his farewell address last night. But the President read us a fictional tale last night. The inescapable truth is that for 8 long years, the constant stream of regulations being pumped out by the Obama administration has taken a terrible toll on families, on businesses, and on our economy. It has made our Nation less prosperous and leaves folks worse off than they were before. The urgency to reverse this unsustainable regulatory quagmire couldn’t have been made more clear than in November, when the American people rose up and voted for a new President who vowed not to subject us to more of the same. That is where my 
bill and all of the bills in the Regulatory Accountability Act come into play. When you look back at the last 8 years, many people wonder how the Obama administration was allowed to grow at such an alarming rate. Now, while there are a lot of troubling factors that go into that equation, the result of an infamous 1984 Supreme Court decision, the Chevron doctrine, is certainly recognized as one of the key culprits. For three decades now, this doctrine has required courts to defer to agency interpretations of congressional intent. Said in more plain terms, Mr. Chairman, this means that when individuals challenge Federal regulators in court, the deck is stacked in favor of the regulators, the very same regulators who have written the regulations in the first place. Letting regulators grade their own papers, if that doesn’t reinforce the need to drain the swamp, then I don’t know what does. My legislation, the Separation of Powers Restoration Act, will fix this perversion of our Constitution by ensuring that Congress, not executive branch agencies, write our laws and that courts, not agency bureaucrats, interpret our laws. Mr. Chairman, title V of this bill is my ALERT Act legislation, and it provides another critical remedy to the current regulatory process by fixing the lack of transparency that is both unfair and harmful to individuals and small businesses across the country. Right now, the current law requires the administration to release an update twice a year on the regulations that are being developed by Federal agencies—the problem is that the regulators are ignoring the law—as these updates have either been very late or never issued at all under President Obama’s watch. Up to this point, there hasn’t been a way to reinforce and enforce these requirements. So the ALERT Act tackles this problem by forcing the executive branch to make the American people aware of regulations that are coming down the track; and it prohibits any regulations from going into effect unless and until detailed information on the cost of the regulation, its impact on jobs, and the legal basis for the regulation have been available to the public on the Internet for at least 6 months. Mr. Chairman, the way our government has been allowed to function under this administration isn’t how our forefathers intended our government to work. Today’s legislation takes a giant step forward in fixing how Washington works. I have already spoken to Presidentelect Trump about partnering together to make this the law of the land and to give the American people back the government that our Founders intended, a government that works for them, not the other way around. Mr. Chairman, we owe them nothing less. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time is remaining on each side. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. DONOVAN ). The gentleman from Virginia has 9 minutes remaining, and the gentleman from Michigan has 15
1⁄2minutes remaining. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. PETERSON ), the ranking member of the House Agriculture Committee. Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Chairman, I strongly support H.R. 5 and urge my colleagues to do so as well. This bill will reform our regulatory system and reduce burdens on our farmers, ranchers, and businesses. H.R. 5 will create a more streamlined, transparent, and accountable regulatory process and give the American people a stronger voice in agency decisionmaking. Requiring agencies to choose the lowest cost rulemaking option and providing additional opportunities for judicial review will ensure that regulations are narrowly tailored, addressing the issues at hand; and this will reduce the burden on farmers, ranchers, businesses, and everyday citizens. This is a good bill, and I urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. LUETKEMEYER ), the chief sponsor of one of the bills contained herein. Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Chairman, today I rise in strong support of the bill on the floor before us, the Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017. Over the last 8 years, it has been clear that our country has been on the wrong path. Through overregulation and government bureaucracy, the chance at the American Dream has seemed to be slipping away and unreachable for far too many Americans. In November, the American people spoke and made it clear: it is time to change course and reform the rulemaking process to energize robust growth in the American economy. To do so, we not only need to address the number of Federal regulations, but also their convoluted and complex nature. Our constituents should not need a law degree or an army of consultants and accountants to understand the rules they are required to follow. Nevertheless, given their technical language, it can be extremely difficult to fully understand proposals unless one is an expert in that field. Title VI of H.R. 5 includes language from a bill that I introduced earlier in this Congress. My bill, the Providing Accountability Through Transparency Act, would require each Federal agency, when providing notice of a proposed rulemaking, to produce a 100word, plainlanguage summary of the proposal and make it publicly available online. This commonsense reform would give the American people straightforward and uncomplicated access to the rules proposed by the executive branch. The American people deserve to be informed about the rules and regulations being proposed by their government, and I am honored to have my legislation included in this regulation curbing package. I thank Chairman GOODLATTE for his leadership on H.R. 5, as well as my colleagues who joined me in contributing language to this critical legislation. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. ROTHFUS ). Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 5, the Regulatory Accountability Act. Many speaking today in support of this legislation are right to point out the crushing impact that Washington’s overregulation has had on our economy. We know all too well how overregulation has driven up the cost of health care, financial services, and energy; and it is long past time for reform. I would like to highlight a provision of this legislation that I offered 3 years ago that requires agencies to identify when new rules will have a negative impact on jobs and wages. Too often, regulators and agency heads are well aware of the negative impact a regulation will have on Americans’ jobs and wages even before it is imposed, but they impose it anyway. Specifically, my provision defines when rules have a negative impact on jobs and wages and requires agency heads approving such a rule to submit a statement that they approve the rule knowing its negative impact. When people in this faroff Capitol take away the jobs and livelihood of working families, as they have done with miners and power plant workers and laborers in my district, they need to own up to it. The Regulatory Accountability Act will help us to provide American workers with substantial relief from what is often Washington overreach, and I encourage all of my colleagues to support this commonsense legislation. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE), a senior member of the House Judiciary Committee. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the distinguished chairman and the distinguished ranking member for convening us. It reenforces my commitment to the importance of the House Judiciary Committee for important, innovative, and groundbreaking, in some instances, work that we have done. In this instance, I find fault because this legislation does not meet that criteria. Just a few days ago, we read the 
Constitution, and some might make the argument that H.R. 5 fits very comfortably into the Bill of Rights, Amendment V and Amendment XIV. Both frame themselves around the question of due process. I make the argument that this legislation is sorely lacking. I want to take up, first of all, a point made by my colleague, a member of the Rules Committee. This legislation, to my recalling, has been circulated for many years. It seems that I have been in the House when a bill like H.R. 5 has passed over and over again. This bill appeared in the 114th Congress. Many Members left since that time. New Members are here. New Members, Republicans and Democrats, will be added to the House Judiciary Committee and to the Senate Judiciary Committee. None of them will have had the opportunity for regular order, to be able to ensure hearings and to be able to engage in input with amendments that I would agree or disagree with, but to have a vigorous debate in our Judiciary Committee as well as in the Senate. It did not happen. We are now on the floor of the House. So that is one fracture of what we are doing, one Achilles’ heel to this legislation. In the last 24 hours, I heard a news account of a little boy who swallowed magnets that were produced by a particular company. It went through the process. It was designated dangerous; and then, unfortunately, that dangerous status was pulled back, and the company is excited about producing those magnets again. The little boy who swallowed the magnets, I think, was about 2 years old. A happy little boy, of course, that is how children are. He had major intestinal surgery, and most of his intestines were removed. He is now 6 years old, and he must now be fed intravenously. b1445 His devastation is our failure. That is what we are facing with H.R. 5. I don’t know if my colleagues agree, as boring as the Administrative Procedure Act was in law school, I liked the course. I had a great professor who made me understand the life of the APA and its value. This legislation attempts to rewrite the Administrative Procedure Act to the detriment of the American people. Consider this, hardworking agencies should have oversight; that is what our committees are all about. They should have oversight. They will now have to jump through hoops of 70 new criteria. I didn’t say 10; I didn’t say a quarter of 100, 25; I didn’t say a half of 100, 50; but 70 when issuing rules, including alternatives to any rule proposal, the scope of the problems the rule meant to address, and potential cost and benefits of the proposal and alternative. I want to see small businesses thrive. Part of that includes a reasonable healthcare package like ObamaCare, the Affordable Care Act, for its employees, a reasonable new structure dealing with taxation that helps small businesses and does not give a mountain of benefit to major corporations. Maybe we should address the needs of small businesses in that manner, or, as my minority constituents tell me, access to credit which is generally denied to women, Hispanics, in some instances, and certainly African Americans. That may help our small businesses get them back on their feet. But that is not what H.R. 5 does. It stifles the work of our agencies of which we have attributed to them, the Small Business Administration, Health and Human Services, the Federal Trade Commission, the FCC, and, in some instances, the Department of Justice articulating regulations dealing with funding of juvenile issues. The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the gentlewoman. Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank the gentleman. These are agencies that are depended upon to give regular order. Oversight is important, but I would make the argument that stifling, denying, demolishing, or destroying is not order. Now, I had an amendment that I think is crucial. It is to provide an exception under this bill for regulations that help prevent cyber attacks on election processes or institutions. Mr. Chairman, not only have we found with much profoundness that a foreign entity, in this instance Russia, maybe it might be Iran, maybe it might be some other country, intruded into the democratic process of elections. I am glad Senator GRAHAM said this is not Republicans or Democrats. This is about the integrity of the election system. And why we were hesitant to make this amendment in order, because there is no stopping of the peaceful transfer of government. The American people see to that process. Thank God for our love of democracy. We are able to express our opposition in many different ways. But there is no doubt there was not only intrusion, there was skewing from one candidate versus another. There are prints—this is public knowledge— that have been able to be tracked to suggest who, what, and what country, and how far up the chain to Mr. Putin that it went to. So my amendment, I think, was constructive. Why would we be reluctant to debate it? Why would we be reluctant to acknowledge the intelligence report assessing Russian activities and intentions in the recent U.S. elections? And why would we be reluctant to find out who was involved? H.R. 5 is not doing what it is supposed to do. It is, in fact, undermining the Constitution and eliminating the protections for a little boy who now lives his life completely different because maybe we didn’t intervene in the regulatory manner of oversight over that product that we should have, and maybe now we have given them a pass so that other children might suffer the same consequences. I ask my colleagues to vote against the underlying bill and send it back for us to do the work of the people in regular order. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. KELLY ). Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5, and let’s get back to what we are talking about. We are talking about overregulation right now. We are not talking about the Red army or any other type of a red threat that is coming in here. The real threat is red tape. We are not talking about scotch tape or duct tape, we are talking about red tape. There is $2 trillion worth of red tape that the American consumers have to pay for every year. That is trillion with a ‘‘T.’’ Every single regulation that goes into effect, not by elected officials but by unelected bureaucrats, I am not saying they are not well intended, I am just saying they are not well thought out. And we really don’t know who is going to pay for all of these. The burden is on the American consumers, the American taxpayers. So if we are talking about creating jobs and if we are talking about getting our economy back on track, let’s get the heavy regulatory boot of the American government off of the throat of American job creators. Why don’t we make it easier for people to be profitable. Why don’t we make it easier for people to start a new business. Why don’t we make the prices cheaper on the shelves, and all of the services that are out there cheaper for the American people to buy and purchase. We get caught up in debate about things that don’t make sense to everyday Americans. They elect us to come and represent them. They don’t elect us to preach to them. They don’t elect us to say: You, poor, stupid people, you don’t understand, we are trying to help you. The Congress has oversight of this. This is our job. Why would we turn it over to unelected bureaucrats. How about this: In 2015, we passed 114 laws. Meanwhile, there were 3,410 rules that were put into effect. Is there a little bit of a problem with the balance there? Is there a little bit of a problem with the people who sent us to represent them telling them: you don’t understand, that rule, that regulation, I never had a chance to weigh in on it? They are asking: Then why the heck did we send you? And I appreciate the fact that Federal employees need to be appreciated. Being one of those employees, I do appreciate that. When I go home, I love when people tell me: you know what, we really appreciate that you are standing up for us. We really appreciate that you are watching where our tax dollars are going. We really appreciate the fact that you are trying to make it easier for us to breathe, make 
it easier for us to succeed, make it easier for us to supply all this revenue. Every single penny that this government needs to run on is not supplied by the Congress, it is supplied by hardworking American taxpayers. And you know what, we can’t even collect enough money from them to cover our bills. We have to go out and borrow more. But they are responsible for it. We sign their name on every single debt that we make. It is time to wake up and smell the coffee. This is not about some other debate. This is about what we are doing to hardworking American taxpayers and hardworking Americans every single day. Then some say: you don’t understand, you poor, stupid people, we are trying to make the air clean and the water drinkable. Yes, I understand that. That is what we are doing. Why do you try to change it into something that doesn’t even make sense? Please go back into your communities and talk to these folks that are saddled with these expenses and look them in the eye and tell them you are just not smart enough to know how government works. The one thing they know is we are $20 trillion in the red. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. JOHNSON ), a distinguished member of the Judiciary Committee. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member and the chairman. I rise in opposition to H.R. 5, the Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017. I have a number of concerns with many provisions of this voluminous page, this 82page bill. It has not gone through regular order, not one committee meeting. Congress just came into session last week. So we have got 50plus new Members in this body who have not had one single day of an opportunity to pay any attention to learn what is in this bill. Yet, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are going to force their folks to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this bill. I urge them to vote ‘‘no’’ and think about it. The reason they should think about it is because H.R. 5 is a destructive revision of the Administrative Procedure Act which fiendishly convolutes the agency rulemaking process through numerous analytical requirements. We call that gumming up the works. These requirements, which are largely opposed by the Nation’s leading administrative law experts, would cause years of delays in the rulemaking process and deregulate entire industries through rulemaking avoidance by agencies. In addition to imposing over 60 new procedural requirements on regulatory protections, title I of H.R. 5 imposes a new supermandate requiring that agencies adopt the least costly rule considered during the rulemaking that meets relevant statutory objectives and permits agencies to choose a more expensive option only if the additional benefits justify its additional costs. The AFL–CIO has observed that this provision would make protecting workers and the public secondary. Limiting costs and impacts on business and corporations is the prime purpose of this legislation. There is little doubt that this proposal will compromise public health, workplace safety, and environmental protections. Agencies will be forced to make pennywise and pound foolish decisions. It costs more to remedy an environmental or financial calamity than it would be to protect the public from the calamity occurring in the first place, which the underlying regulation would do, but they don’t want regulations. This is unbelievable. Title II of the bill abolishes judicial deference to agencies’ reasoned statutory interpretations, which has been a hallmark of judicial review for more than three decades. Talk about judicial restraint and not legislating from the bench. That is what the Supreme Court in its Chevron rule has emphasized over the last three decades. In addition to incentivizing judicial activism by generalist courts, which could engage in rulemaking from the bench by making policy decisions rather than strictly interpreting the law, this provision will also make the regulatory system more costly and time consuming because it would require agencies to take even more time to promulgate critical protections that the court ultimately decides on its own through its ability to legislate from the bench that it doesn’t like. This is nonsense. It is hypocritical. Title III of the bill further paralyzes agency rulemaking through unworkable, complex requirements, while endowing the hallowed Small Business Administration’s Office of Advocacy with broad authority to act as the gatekeeper of our Nation’s entire regulatory system. As the Center for Progressive Reform reported in a 2013 report, this entity, this Small Business Administration’s Office of Advocacy, exists in an unchecked capacity to funnel ‘‘special interest pressure into agency rulemakings, even though such interests have already had ample opportunity to comment on proposed regulations.’’ So in other words, the Small Business Administration’s Office of Advocacy is a back door wide open to corporate interests seeking to come in and undermine the regulatory authority of an agency. At a time when there has been much talking and tweeting about draining the swamp, this measure would function as a green light to special interests to manipulate the regulatory system in their favor. Moreover, my Republican colleagues’ repeated claims that this measure will create regulation by representation, or clawback authority from the executive branch, that argument is fundamentally undermined by the fact that this bill consolidates the role of a subagency, the Small Business Administration, in such an opaque and reckless manner. The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. CONYERS. I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Have Members ever heard of any legislation that purports to take power back from unelected bureaucrats and then places it right back in the hands of a bureaucrat in the same piece of legislation? This is ridiculous. Title IV of H.R. 5 would automatically delay the effective date of any rule exceeding $1 billion in costs that is challenged in court, regardless of whether the party challenging the rule has any likelihood of success on the merits, is actually harmed by the rule, or whether staying the rule would be contrary to public interest. b1500 So while they sit here and take the rights of regular, ordinary working people to sue corporations under the guise of socalled tort reform, they turn around in this legislation, open the courthouse door wide to corporations to come in and file frivolous complaints against a regulation and automatically stall it. This is ridiculous. This legislation is rife with corporate protections at the expense of the people, and I ask my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this legislation. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, at this time it is my pleasure to yield 1
1⁄2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. KNIGHT ). Mr. KNIGHT. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5, the Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017. Over the last 8 years, we have seen the administration authorize hundreds of executive orders directing Federal agencies to issue, finalize, and implement an unprecedented number of regulations. Most of these impose one sizefitsall standards on small businesses with little to no consideration for their impact on small businesses. As a member of the Small Business Committee, it is kind of my job to go out and find out what small businesses have to offer, what is impeding their ability to create and make more jobs for our industry and for our economy. What we have found is that overregulation is stifling them. This is the problem. This is not something that we have made up. That is the problem in this economy. That is why I am proud to support H.R. 5, and particularly title III, which addresses one vital area that protects small businesses—the Regulatory Flexibility Act, or RFA. The RFA requires agencies to assess the economic impacts of new regulations on small businesses. However, Federal agencies regularly exploit loopholes in the RFA requirements that allow them to produce inadequate or inaccurate analysis of impact. We know this can have devastating outcomes, as witnessed in the Department of Labor’s overtime rule issued 
last year, which was one of the top concerns for many of the small businesses and nonprofits that operate in my district and across this country. Title III of H.R. 5 would eliminate loopholes to ensure compliance and would also require agencies to provide more detailed information in each analysis. I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this legislation. Mr. CONYERS. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, in closing, this has been an enlightening discussion because we have determined that H.R. 5 is based on the faulty premise that environmental and public safety protections kill jobs, result in economically stifling costs, and promote uncertainty. In fact, regulatory protections that ensure the safety of Americanmade products unquestionably foster job creation and protect the competitiveness of our business and global marketplace. This explains why so many organizations—more than 150—strongly oppose this legislation. Mr. Chairman, our constituents and the American citizens deserve something better than H.R. 5. We need legislation that creates middle class financial security and opportunity. We need sensible regulations that protect American families from economic ruin, that bring predatory financial practices to an end. We need workplace safety protections that ensure hardworking Americans can go to work each day without having to risk their lives as a result of hazardous work environments. Unfortunately, the measure before us does nothing to advance any of these critical goals, and so I must, therefore, oppose H.R. 5 and ask my colleagues to support a negative vote on this matter. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. The facts are plain, the conclusion is clear: the rampant tide of unchecked, unbalanced Federal regulation is overwhelming job creators and households all across this Nation. Thanks to Washington’s endless excess of regulations, hardworking Americans face higher prices, lower wages, fewer jobs, and fewer new business starts; and America as a whole is less competitive, less innovative, and less prosperous. Federal regulations now impose an estimated burden of an amazing $1.89 trillion per year. That burden is burying America’s job creators and suffocating job opportunities. It equals roughly $15,000 per U.S. household, over 10 percent of America’s GDP, and more than the GDP of all but eight countries in the world. The Obama administration set new records for numbers and effects of major regulations, over 600 in total, with an average of 81 per year. That is roughly one every 3 working days. Through just August 2016, these rules had economic effects of over $740 billion and imposed 194 million paperwork burdenhours; and this only built upon the insufficiently checked regulation already imposed by previous administrations. This problem must be solved, and this bill is the number one solution to this problem. Its bold, innovative measures will unleash American freedom, opportunity, and resourcefulness by dramatically reducing new regulatory costs; and they will do that while still allowing agencies to achieve the benefits that Congress’ statutes have tasked them to achieve. Far fewer costs, all the benefits, who could be against that? We all should be for it, just as the American people are. Support the American people. Support the Regulatory Accountability Act. I urge my colleagues to do so. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 5, the ‘‘Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017,’’ which is a radical measure that could make it impossible to promulgate safety regulations to protect the public. I oppose this legislation because it would effectively shut down the entire U.S. regulatory system, amending in one fell swoop every bedrock existing regulatory statute. My opposition to H.R. 5 is amplified by the Rules Committee’s decision to decline to make in order the Jackson Lee Amendment, ‘‘to provide an exception for regulations that help prevent cyberattacks on election processes or institutions.’’ Apparently, House Republicans are still reluctant to debate the subject—undisputed by our Intelligence community—of Russian cyberattacks on American cyber networks and infrastructure. Key Judgments in the Intelligence Community Assessment’s declassified version of a highly classified report entitled, ‘‘Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent U.S. Elections,’’ have confirmed that 2016 witnessed the first American presidential election that was the subject of cyberattacks. These and other subversive activities have been confirmed to have been perpetrated by entities allied with the Government of Russia and were undertaken for the express purpose of influencing the presidential contest to secure the election of its preferred candidate, Donald Trump, who made history by becoming the first presidential candidate to invite a hostile foreign power to launch cyberattacks against his political opponent. All three agencies, CIA, FBI and NSA, agree with this judgment. The socalled Regulatory Accountability Act (RAA), in addition if to this rule, demonstrates the deceptive design of the majority to make it harder to establish regulations to protect the public by tilting the entire regulatory system significantly toward special interests. The bill allows Federal courts without expertise on technical issues to substitute their judgment for those of the expert federal agencies. These agencies are staffed with career subject matter experts that are deeply knowledgeable of the background, context, and history of agency actions and policy rationale. For this reason, courts have long deferred to agency experts who are in the best position to carry out the statutes. The RAA would end this wellestablished practice and allow far less experienced judges to second guess expert opinion—essentially sanctioning judicial activism. The Jackson Lee Amendment, however, would have attuned this dangerous legislation to provide an exception for regulation upon which Americans so greatly rely on their government to help prevent cyberattacks on our highly coveted and esteemed election processes and institutions. The bill promoted by the majority, calling for accountability from our Administrative Agencies—fails to answer in accountability to the threat posed by foreign and domestic invaders on our national cyber networks. As the new Congress commences in the People’s House, obstructionist Republicans are circumventing the very procedures by which elected officials answer the cries of outrage and dismay of desperately concerned constituents. To the obstructionist majority perpetuating this restrictive rule, let me stand firm in the American convictions laid bare by the Jackson Lee Amendment—the system of Checks and Balances established by the Separation of Powers clause of the Constitution will not be thwarted. The spirit of the H.R. 5 is clearly designed to stop all regulation dead in its tracks—no matter the threat to cyber networks, national security, economy, or the very health and safety of the American people. We know that Russia’s cyber activities were intended to influence the election, erode faith in U.S. democratic institutions, sow doubt about the integrity of our electoral process, and undermine confidence in the institutions of the U.S. government. These actions are unacceptable and will not be tolerated. The mission of the Intelligence Community is to seek to reduce the uncertainty surrounding foreign activities, capabilities, or leaders’ intentions. On these issues of great importance to U.S. national security, the goal of intelligence analysis is to provide assessments to decision makers that are intellectually rigorous, objective, timely, and useful, and that adhere to tradecraft standards. Applying these standards helps ensure that the Intelligence Community provides U.S. policymakers, warfighters, and operators with the best and most accurate insight, warning, and context, as well as potential opportunities to advance U.S. national security. This objective is difficult to achieve when seeking to understand complex issues on which foreign actors go to extraordinary lengths to hide or obfuscate their activities. My amendment would have improved H.R. 5 by exempting only those regulations critical to making cyber networks invulnerable to attack from foreign and domestic agencies and individuals. Specifically, the amendment that the Rules Committee disallowed for presentation on a vote here on the floor today would have provided the American people an exemption to allow for the prevention of tampering, alteration, or misappropriation of information by agents of foreign countries with the purpose or effect of interfering with or undermining election processes or institutions. 
In particular, restrictions put forth in H.R. 5 could result in further delay to agencies attempting to take action to help network defenders better identify new tactics or techniques that a malicious actor might deploy or detect and disrupt an ongoing intrusion, in addition to protecting data that enables cybersecurity firms and other network defenders to identify certain malware that the Russian intelligence services use. The Regulatory Accountability Act provides no accountability to the American public. Instead, it allows polluting industries and special interests to game the system and escape accountability for any harm they inflict. It makes it incredibly difficult, if not impossible, to secure new public protections and arms industry with numerous tools to avoid their legal obligations. The increasing use of cyberenabled means to undermine democratic processes at home and abroad, as exemplified by Russia’s recent activities, has made clear that a tool explicitly targeting attempts to interfere with elections is also warranted. We cannot afford to let global terroristic threats, in the form of cyber activities, erode faith in U.S. democratic institutions, sow doubt about the integrity of our electoral process, influence elections, or undermine confidence in the institutions of the U.S. government. My amendment would have offered protections guarding the integrity of our cyber networks, while at the same time allowing the bill to achieve the proponents’ major purposes. For these reasons and more, I oppose this bill. The Acting CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired. Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment under the 5 minute rule.

AMENDMENT NO . 1 OFFERED BY MR . GOODLATTE  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 printed in part A of House Report 115–2. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 39, line 3, insert after ‘‘made by agencies.’’ the following: ‘‘If the reviewing court determines that a statutory or regulatory provision relevant to its decision contains a gap or ambiguity, the court shall not interpret that gap or ambiguity as an implicit delegation to the agency of legislative rule making authority and shall not rely on such gap or ambiguity as a justification either for interpreting agency authority expansively or for deferring to the agency’s interpretation on the question of law.’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 33, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOODLATTE ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, if Congress is effectively to rein in the runaway administrative state, a crucial part of the plan must be to overturn, legislatively, the doctrines of judicial deference to agencies’ interpretations of the statutes and regulations they administer. These doctrines, founded in the Supreme Court’s decision in Chevron v. NRDC and Auer v. Robbins, have, over the years, turned the courts far too much into a rubberstamp rather than a vigorous check on the selfserving tendencies of agencies to interpret the law to expand their own power. Title II of the bill, the Separation of Powers Act, delivers this legislative reversal of Chevron and Auer. There is one thing, though, that still needs to be added to that portion of the bill; that is language to check the potential that once they are restored—the full interpretive powers that rightfully belong to them—our Article III courts will not engage in judicial activism. To put a point on it, judges must not be allowed to use the Separation of Powers Act as a license to interpret ambiguous statutes always to expand agency power. My amendment, therefore, succinctly but powerfully provides just that. It prohibits courts from reading ambiguities in statutes to contain implicit delegation of legislative rulemaking authority to agencies or from reading those ambiguities expansively to extend agency power. Although it failed in its task, the Chevron doctrine was originally crafted to help check that kind of judicial activism. As we end the failed Chevron experiment, we should make sure we do not go back to judicial activism. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chair, to say that this amendment stops judicial activism is stretching things a little bit, I believe. This opens the floodgates to judicial activism, the Goodlatte amendment, so that is why I oppose the amendment. It revises title II of the bill to eliminate agencies’ ‘‘gap filling’’ authority when interpreting ambiguous statutes. Judicial review of final agency action is a hallmark of administrative law and is critical to ensuring that agency action does not harm or adversely affect the public. But as the Supreme Court held, in Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council in 1984, reviewing courts may only invalidate an agency action when it violates a constitutional provision or when an agency exceeds its statutory authority as clearly expressed by Congress. That is a clear rule that has worked fine for America for the last 30 years. Over that time, this seminal decision has required deference to the substantive expertise and political accountability of Federal agencies because, after all, judges don’t have political accountability because they are appointed for life. They are not elected by the people. So this legislation is turning around this very fair and balanced court decision and, instead, imposing a new setup, one that invites judges—whom they appoint, by the way. They are the ones who have refused, for the last year, to appoint or to consider the appointment of a U.S. Supreme Court Justice so that they could get a Republican in the White House. They did not want anybody other than somebody made to order, and this is what this legislation lays the groundwork for is that new Supreme Court Justice who has yet to be named by a Republican incoming President. But you can bet it will be one who has corporate interests at heart instead of that of middle class and working people and regular, ordinary people. You can bet that that Supreme Court representative will be ready to do away with the Chevron doctrine and comply with this legislative mandate, which is open season on regulations, allowing the Federal judiciary to impose its political beliefs on regulations. So that is going to be bad for America. Generalist courts, which are constitutionally insulated from political accountability, should not have the power to secondguess agency experts concerning the appropriateness of highly technical regulations crucial to protecting the health and safety of millions of Americans. Moreover, this doctrine promotes predictability for businesses and the public. Professor Levin notes that ‘‘because citizens can put some confidence in the expectation that decisions by a centralized agency will not be readily overturned by a variety of courts in different parts of the country,’’ that contributes to predictability. b1515 Title II of H.R. 5, however, would upend this longstanding precedent by abolishing the Chevron doctrine. This amendment further puts the thumb on the scale against lifesaving protections by ensuring that practically any statutory ambiguity will be resolved in favor of a regulated entity and against agency action, no matter how important. This amendment is also a solution in search of a problem. As Professor Levin has testified, ‘‘the field of administrative law has worked out a variety of political and judicial oversight mechanisms to maintain a delicate balance of power among the branches of government.’’ Any administrative action based on an ambiguous statute could be challenged by an affected party, and these checks already apply to judicial review. Finally, this measure would apply equally to regulatory and deregulatory actions. John Walke, the clean air director and senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council warns that if an ‘‘administration more ideologically opposed to regulation wishes to take advantage of the inevitable vagueness, conflicts, and gaps in federal statutes, it may adopt the least protective regulation permissible under a federal law.’’ Mr. Chair, because this is a bad amendment, I ask that it be opposed. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I include in the record a list of organizations supporting H.R. 5. I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment. 
AGRICULTURAL RETAILERS ASSOCIATION , Washington, DC, January 11, 2017. TOALLMEMBERS OF THE U.S. H OUSE OF  REPRESENTATIVES : On behalf of the Agricultural Retailers Association (ABA), I am writing to urge a vote in support of H.R. 5, the ‘‘Regulatory Accountability Act’’ sponsored by Representative Bob Goodlatte (R–VA). This legislation includes a number of important provisions designed to reform the Federal rulemaking process. All stakeholders have a right to fair, open, and transparent rulemaking that respects the proper role of the states and the intent of Congress. For decades, there have been Executive Orders issued from both Republican and Democrat Administrations highlighting the importance of an open, transparent, and fair regulatory process. H.R. 5 is an important step forward in codifying the principles that Presidents of both parties have issued in Executive Order 12004 (Issued in Match 1978), Executive Order 12291 (Issued in February 1981), Executive Order 12866 (Issued in September 1993), Executive Order 13132 (Issued in August 1999), and Executive Order 13563 (Issued in January 2011). Some of the reforms in H.R. 5 include provisions such as requiring federal agencies to use less costly regulations, rather than more costly proposals, to obtain a stated objective; requiring federal agencies to explain how their proposed regulations would impact small business owners, their employees, and customers; prohibiting any new rules with a significant economic impact from taking effect until litigation against such proposal has been fully settled without impacting existing regulations; and requiring Federal agencies to publish mandatory transparency reports. Rep. Collin Peterson (D–MN) plans to offer an amendment on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives to prohibit agencies from using social media to sway public opinion in favor of a pending agency proposal. This commonsense amendment is necessary to prevent actions taken by federal agencies such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that the General Accountability Office (GAO) found took unlawful actions during its ‘Waters of the United States’’ (WOTUS) proposed rulemaking. ARA urges all House members to vote in favor of the Peterson amendment and to vote ‘‘Yes’’ on final passage of H.R, 5. Sincerely, RICHARD D. G UPTON , Senior Vice President, Public Policy & Counsel. 
AMERICAN FARMBUREAU FEDERATION , Washington, DC, January 9, 2017. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , Washington, DC. DEAR REP.: The House of Representatives will soon take up H.R. 5 for debate and a vote. This measure contains a number of important elements that are designed to improve the Federal rulemaking process. American Farm Bureau urges all members to vote in favor of this legislation. For decades, presidents of both parties have issued Executive Orders and Memoranda underscoring the importance of a regulatory process that is open, transparent and fair: President Carter stipulated in EO 12044 that regulations should not impose unnecessary burdens on the economy. President Reagan issued EO 12291 in February 1981 to assure that leastcost alternatives would be used in regulatory decision making. President Clinton affirmed that regulations should maximize net benefits (EO 12866, September 1993). Later in his Administration, President Clinton issued EO 13132 reaffirming the importance of federalism and respecting the rights of states. President Obama underscored the importance of sound science in his Memorandum of March 2009. He also reaffirmed President Clinton’s EO 12866 when he issued EO 13563. We understand that an amendment to H.R. 5 will be offered on the floor by Rep. Peterson to prohibit agencies from using social media to sway public opinion in favor of a pending agency proposal. This amendment stems directly from EPA’s conduct in its ‘waters of the US’ (WOTUS) rulemaking, conduct found unlawful by the General Accountability Office and scrupulously detailed in a report released by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, ‘‘Politicization of the Waters of the United States Rulemaking.’’ We strongly support the Peterson amendment and urge all members to vote in favor of its adoption. All stakeholders—farmers, ranchers, environmentalists, academics, agency staff, and the general public—have a right to a rulemaking process that is fair, open, transparent, respectful of the role of states in our Federal system, and faithful to the intent of Congress. H.R. 5 is an important step in codifying principles that Presidents of both parties have enunciated for decades. This legislation deserves strong, bipartisan support. We urge all members to vote in favor of the Peterson amendment and to vote ‘‘Yes’’ on final passage of H.R. 5. Sincerely, ZIPPY DUVALL , President. 
ASSOCIATED BUILDERS AND  CONTRACTORS , INC., Washington, DC, January 5, 2017. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , Washington, DC. DEARREPRESENTATIVE : On behalf of Associated Builders and Contractors (ABC), a national construction industry trade association with 70 chapters representing nearly 21,000 members, I am writing in support of the Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017 (H.R. 5) introduced by Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R–VA). ABC supports this legislation, which would reform the Administrative Procedures Act and strengthen existing checks on federal agencies, allowing for more costeffective regulations through a more transparent process. As builders of our communities and infrastructure, ABC members understand the value of standards and regulations based on solid evidence, with appropriate consideration paid to implementation costs and input from affected businesses. ABC strongly supports comprehensive regulatory reform which includes acrosstheboard requirements for departments and agencies to appropriately evaluate risks, weigh costs, and assess benefits of all regulations. H.R. 5 is an excellent step in regulatory reform as it ensures more accountability from federal agencies and greater stakeholder transparency. Today, federal regulatory agencies wield incredible power through rulemaking. They have grown adept at using procedural loopholes in order to accomplish narrowlyfocused goals. These agencies operate relatively unchecked and unsupervised, especially during the early stages of the regulatory process. They often disregard and circumvent the will of Congress and the American public by issuing regulations with poor or incomplete economic costbenefit forecasting or other data analysis, instead of using the best and most accurate data that could have created more practical, sustainable rules and regulations. Consequently, some regulations that have limited or questionable benefit result in crippling costs for companies and often no serious consideration is given for more practical alternatives. For the construction industry, these regulations routinely translate into higher costs and are passed along to the consumer. Ultimately, these costs impact our industry’s ability to expand and hire more workers. It is particularly alarming that small businesses, which comprise the vast majority of the industry, are disproportionately affected by this irresponsible approach to regulation. Thank you for your attention on this important matter and we urge the House to pass the Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017. Sincerely, KRISTEN SWEARINGEN , Vice President of Legislative & Political Affairs. 
THEASSOCIATED GENERAL  CONTRACTORS OF AMERICA , Arlington, VA, January 10, 2017. Re Vote ‘‘YES’’ on the Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017, H.R. 5. Hon. PAULRYAN, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARREPRESENTATIVE RYAN: On behalf of the Associated General Contractors of America (AGC) and its more than 26,000 commercial construction company members, I strongly urge you to vote ‘‘YES’’ on the Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017, H.R. 5. This legislation is critical to helping ensure that regulations undergo thorough economic analysis, are based in sound science and/or substantial empirical data, and are transparent with clear and feasible methods and goals. The current regulatory process allows federal agencies to promulgate rules based on unconvincing, scant and—sometimes—just plain wrong evidence. For example, Professor David L. Sunding, Ph.D., Thomas J. Graff Chair of Natural Resource Economics at the University of California, Berkeley found that the ‘‘errors, omissions, and lack of transparency’’ in the Environmental Protection Agency’s economic analysis underlying its Waters of the Unites States (WOTUS) rule to be ‘‘so severe as to render it virtually meaningless.’’ Yet, the EPA was able to finalize that rule based on such flawed analysis. Federal agencies also write rules that are not feasible for the construction industry to follow. The Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) crystalline silica rule, for instance, put forth a permissible silica exposure limit that is beyond the capacity of existing dust filtration and removal technology. Despite this fact, OSHA finalized this rule and the construction industry is left liable to implement. The Regulatory Accountability Act will help hold federal agencies accountable to the facts throughout the rulemaking process. Under this legislation, the public could challenge the underlying evidence agencies put forth to justify their rules. Such challenges could occur through hearings before the agency and before courts, which generally defer to any evidence put forth by federal agencies currently. As a result, agencies would be incentivized to undertake more rigorous and realistic analyses, rather than risk delays as a result of relying on cherrypicked studies or selfserving, internal data. The purpose of the bill is not partisan. Rather, it is to ensure that the regulations federal agencies put forth are feasible and based in thorough economic analysis and sound science. To do so, H.R. 5 allows for greater transparency, more public participation and needed objectivity in the rulemaking process. As such, AGC again urges you to for in favor of H.R. 5. 
Thank you for your consideration. Sincerely, JEFFREY D. S HOAF , Senior Executive Director, Government Affairs. 
BUSINESS ROUNDTABLE , January 6, 2017. Re Support for H.R. 5—The Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017. Hon. PAULRYAN, Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. NANCY PELOSI , Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR SPEAKER RYAN AND LEADER PELOSI : On behalf of the CEO members of Business Roundtable, who lead major U.S. companies with more than $6 trillion in annual revenues and nearly 15 million employees, I am pleased to express our strong support for H.R. 5, the Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017, introduced by Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte. Business Roundtable CEOs have consistently identified overly complex and burdensome federal regulations as harmful to accelerating job creation, job retention and increased economic opportunity for American workers and their families. We support a smarter approach to federal regulation that would engage regulated parties earlier in the process, improve the quality of information used to make regulatory decisions and consistently apply rigorous costbenefit analysis to major regulatory proposals. We are particularly pleased that H.R. 5 includes the previously introduced version of the Regulatory Accountability Act, also championed by Chairman Goodlatte, the ALERT Act, championed by Representative John Ratcliffe, and the Providing Accountability Through Transparency Act, championed by Representative Blaine Luetkemeyer. Overall, the smart regulatory improvements embodied in the Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017 will: Make U.S. companies more competitive. Usually after prolonged periods of consideration, federal agencies regularly issue rules that impose large and often unnecessary burdens on U.S. businesses—burdens that foreign competitors may not have to bear. The Act will reduce these burdens. Enable U.S. companies to be more innovative. American businesses are the world’s most innovative, and that innovation supports America’s high standard of living. Rules that require particular technologies or approaches or fail to keep up with technological evolution can jeopardize future innovation. The Act will encourage flexible, non prescriptive implementation that preserves the capacity to innovate. Stimulate investment by enhancing business certainty. If companies are unsure about what regulators will require or how to comply with rules, they will be reluctant to commit capital to new or expanded productive investments. By encouraging early engagement with regulated parties and improving the transparency and accountability of the regulatory process, the Act will result in greater certainty for U.S. businesses and thereby accelerate job growth and investment. The Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017 would make the U.S. regulatory system more transparent, accountable and effective. We endorse this legislation and pledge our full support to see it enacted into law. Sincerely, MARKJ. C OSTA , Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Eastman Chemical Company Chair, Smart Regulation Committee, Business Roundtable. NATIONAL ASSOCIATION  
OFREALTORS , Washington, DC, January 9, 2017. Hon. PAULRYAN, Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. NANCY PELOSI , Democratic Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR SPEAKER RYAN AND DEMOCRATIC  LEADER PELOSI : On behalf of the 1.1 million members of the National Association of REALTORS® (NAR), I urge the House to approve H.R. 5 (Goodlatte, R–VA; Peterson, D– MN), the ‘‘Regulatory Accountability Act’’. NAR believes that federal regulations should be narrowly tailored, supported by strong data and evidence, and impose the least costs possible on regulated stakeholders. The Regulatory Accountability Act embodies these principles and will contribute to a more transparent and accountable regulatory process by: Increasing public participation in shaping the mostcostly regulations at an earlier point in the rulemaking process; Instructing agencies to choose the least costly option that achieves congressional intent unless they can show a costlier option is needed to protect health, safety, or welfare; Requiring public hearings for the most costly regulations; Improving the process for evaluating how small businesses are impacted by regulations; and Providing for a more rigorous test in legal challenges for those regulations that would have the most impact. The Regulatory Accountability Act builds on established principles of a fair regulatory process and would make the regulatory process more transparent, agencies more accountable for their decisions, and regulations bettertailored to achieve their purpose without unnecessary burdens on stakeholders. The Regulatory Accountability Act would allow Congress and the public to reassert control over the federal regulatory bureaucracy. Therefore, NAR strongly supports the Act, and urges passage of the bill when it comes to the House floor for a vote. Sincerely, WILLIAM E. B ROWN , 2017 President. 
NATIONAL FEDERATION OF  INDEPENDENT BUSINESS , Washington, DC, January 11, 2017. Hon. STEVE CHABOT , Chairman, House Committee on Small Business, Washington, DC. DEAR CHAIRMAN CHABOT , on behalf of the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), the nation’s leading small business advocacy organization, I am writing in support of H.R. 33, the Small Business Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act of 2017. This legislation puts into place strong protections to ensure that federal agencies fully consider the impact of proposed regulations on small businesses. In an economy where twothirds of all net new jobs come from the small business sector, we appreciate that this legislation would require regulators to analyze further the impact of certain proposals on job creation. As you well know, the annual cost of federal regulation per employee is significantly higher for smaller firms than larger firms. Federal regulations—not to mention state and local regulations—add up and significantly increase the cost of starting and running a small business. H.R. 33 expands the scope of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) by forcing government regulators to include the indirect impact of their regulations in their assessments of a regulation’s impact on small businesses. The bill also provides small business with expanded judicial review protections, which helps ensure that small businesses have their views heard during the federal rulemaking process, not after. The legislation strengthens several other aspects of the RFA—such as expanding the small business advocacy review panel process to all agencies. Currently, the panels only apply to the Environmental Protection Agency, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. These panels have proven to be an extremely effective mechanism in helping agencies to understand how their rules will affect small businesses, and help agencies identify less costly alternatives to regulations before proposing new rules. Finally, H.R. 33 expands the standard for periodic review of rules by federal agencies and gives the U.S. Small Business Administration’s Office of Advocacy increased input into agency compliance with the RFA. These important protections are needed to prevent duplicative and outdated regulatory burdens as well as to address penalty structures that are too high for the small business sector. NFIB supports H.R. 33 because it strengthens the requirement for federal agencies to consider both the direct and indirect economic impact of proposed regulations on small businesses. We look forward to working with the committee towards enactment of the Small Business Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act of 2017. Sincerely, JUANITA D. D UGGAN , President and CEO NFIB. 
CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF THE  UNITED STATES OF AMERICA , Washington, DC, January 6, 2017. TO THE MEMBERS OF THE U.S. H OUSE OF  REPRESENTATIVES : The U.S. Chamber of Commerce strongly supports H.R. 5, which includes the Regulatory Accountability Act, and may consider including votes on, or in relation to, H.R. 5 in our annual How They Voted scorecard. The Chamber commends the House for acting on regulatory reform legislation so early in the 115th session, and for bringing H.R. 5, which also includes important provisions related to small businesses, to the floor. The Regulatory Accountability Act is a longstanding priority for the Chamber and would update the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) to improve how federal agencies promulgate those rules with the most significant impact on jobs and economic growth. Modernization of APA is long overdue. While there has been a dramatic increase in high impact, transformative rules that are slowing economic growth and inhibiting job creation, APA rulemaking provisions have remained virtually unchanged since 1946 when the law was established. H.R. 5 would target only the most expensive and burdensome of these rules for increased scrutiny by providing greater transparency, by holding agencies accountable, and by making sure the data behind the decisions of regulators are made publicly available. The Chamber urges you to support this legislation and to oppose any weakening amendment when it is considered likely next week. Sincerely, JACKHOWARD , Senior Vice President, Congressional and Public Affair. 
Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOODLATTE ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Virginia will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO . 2 OFFERED BY MR . CHAFFETZ  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 printed in part A of House Report 115–2. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
The Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of the Office of Management and Budget shall establish any guideline required to be established by this title or the amendments made by this title by not later than 270 days after the date of enactment of this title. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 33, the gentleman from Utah (Mr. CHAFFETZ ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. H.R. 5 requires the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, often called OIRA, to provide guidelines for agencies on how to effectively conduct regulatory activities. This is a great bill. I wholeheartedly support the bill. We simply want to add a timeline to this bill so that we give the proper incentive, notification, and time to properly institute what this new law would do. The regulatory activities engaged in this bill that OIRA, the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, deals with need to include cost and benefit assessments and their economic or risk assessments; coordination, simplification, and harmonization of the agency rules; conforming rulemaking to the notice and comment requirements and formal rulemaking requirements in the Administrative Procedure Act; as well as the application of the Information Quality Act to rulemaking proceedings under what is called the APA. These guidelines required by the underlying bill are moving the country in the right direction and will ensure that agencies produce thoughtful, comprehensive, and wellvetted regulations. The simple amendment that I offer today, Mr. Chairman, to H.R. 5 simply requires OIRA to issue guidance within 270 days. I think this is the right balance of encouragement to have them get going on it right away, but at the same time not allowing this to linger in perpetuity with no end in sight. This amendment provides OIRA, I think, the proper balance. That is why I have offered this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the Chaffetz amendment. This amendment establishes a deadline of 270 days—a magical number of days—for some reason. There is no reason given for that being the number of days, but that is what they give to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, or OIRA, to issue guidelines pursuant to title I of this bill. Why 270 days? Well, I think I can answer that question. They know that OIRA is not equipped to sufficiently deal with regulations within that same amount of time period. We have had all this budget cutting going on. We have been attacking the Federal Government regulatory authorities throughout the entire 6 years that Republicans have been in control of this House. They have done 6 years’ worth of hobbling OIRA, and now they are going to come forward and impose a 270day requirement. That is like asking someone who you have handicapped to run in a relay race that you know they can’t win. To begin with, I would note that OIRA, which typically has fewer than 50 employees, often serves as a bottleneck for the promulgation of economically significant rules, as reported last year by Public Citizen. Moreover, as a group of the Nation’s leading administrative law scholars have noted that the Regulatory Accountability Act is ‘‘unusually ambitious and crammed with details that are impossible to summarize,’’ that will ‘‘further ossify the rulemaking process with little offsetting benefits in the form of better rules.’’ Many of these new procedures task OIRA with making numerous new determinations and expanded review of formal rulemaking. In addition, to hobbling over the last 6 years, and then imposing a deadline of an arbitrary and capricious number of days, you are going to heap additional requirements upon them without increasing their staff that you have already cut. Given the sheer breadth of these requirement, it may be difficult or impossible for OIRA to comply with the deadline imposed by this amendment, absent additional congressional appropriations, which, of course, they are not interested in. Accordingly, I rise to oppose the amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, certainly the gentleman from Georgia is not opposed to the number 270. It is a beautiful number. Normally we give them about 6 months to promulgate a rule. This is 50 percent more than that. It is roughly 9 months. If a woman can give birth in that amount of time, my guess is they can go ahead and put together some rules in that amount of time. We gave it quite a bit of thought. I think it is properly balanced. We don’t want it to be a year. It is 50 percent more than we normally ask and that OIRA is used to doing in rulemaking. So certainly they can accomplish that. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOODLATTE ), chairman of the committee. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I just want to say that title I of the bill contains several key requirements for the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OIRA, to put out high quality, governmentwide guidelines that all agencies can follow. These include, for example, guidelines on cost benefit analysis, risk assessment, consistency with the Information Quality Act, and good guidance practices. Since the importance of these issues and the need for swift and effective implementation of reform, the amendment’s institution of a 270day deadline for the issuance of these guidelines is very reasonable, very constructive. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I think what I gather is that we need better regulations. Therefore, we have to provide more requirements on OIRA with respect to the regulations it issues, while at the same time claiming that regulations are bad and we have unelected bureaucrats and all of this kind of stuff like that. So we need better laws to allow them to regulate better. Then we are going to give them 270 days, which is a little more than we give the average agency. Well, I thank you for that, but you have not increased the manpower of the agency to deal with the new requirements that you are stacking on them. It just doesn’t make a whole lot of sense. The real reason for this amendment is to help foster the gumming up of the Federal regulatory system. That is what it is all about. There are a lot of little small ways of doing that, heaping it on top of the larger measure, which is itself just inimical to good rulemaking. This is a game, and the American people are the big losers. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chairman, I know my colleague from Georgia is opposed to this bill, but I do think it is reasonable to give a time frame as to when they are supposed to issue this so it doesn’t continue on in perpetuity. I think it is reasonable. 
To the gentleman’s point about the staffing, we don’t get into that granular detail here. That is left to the Office of Management and Budget. Those decisions have been made by the Obama administration for the last 8 years. The new Office of Management and Budget will need to take into account the staffing levels and how OMB will determine whether they need more staff or less staff, but I would certainly support the idea that, if they are overwhelmed with issues, let’s make sure that they are properly staffed. This is an important agency. It is the bottleneck. We have to make sure that they are functioning properly. We are supportive of that, but I do think it is reasonable to offer that timeline. I appreciate the support of the chairman on this, and I urge passage of this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Utah (Mr. CHAFFETZ ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 3 OFFERED BY MR . CHABOT  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 printed in part A of House Report 115–2. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 33, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I offer this amendment to address a longstanding problem: agencies not fully analyzing the effects of regulations on small businesses. Under the current Regulatory Flexibility Act, an agency may certify a rule if it expects that the rule will not have—and I am quoting the current law here—‘‘a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.’’ When an agency certifies a rule, it does not need to perform a full regulatory flexibility analysis. This provision makes sense because not every rule affects small businesses. Unfortunately, agencies appear to be abusing this provision. According to a recent study, agencies only prepared analyses for approximately 8 percent of rules finalized between 1996 and 2012. A recent example of this occurred with the controversial waters of United States rule. The Environmental Protection Agency and Army Corps of Engineers certified that rule despite the significant and direct consequences for farmers, ranchers, and home builders. Most of those are small businesses. Although the Small Business Administration Chief Counsel for Advocacy sent a letter to the agencies stating that the certification was improper and urging them to withdraw the rule, the agencies ignored the Chief Counsel and proceeded to finalize it anyway. b1530 This amendment addresses this problem by requiring agencies to include— and I am quoting my amendment—‘‘an economic assessment or a summary thereof that is sufficiently detailed to support the agency’s certification.’’ This will be published in the Federal Register as part of the detailed statement and certification for the proposed rule. This approach mirrors the one used in the National Environmental Policy Act. When an agency finds a project to have no significant impacts on the environment, it is required to provide an environmental assessment or a summary of it. Since agencies are required to provide a threshold analysis when they issue a finding of no significant impact for actions that could affect the environment, it just makes sense to extend the same type of requirement to rules that could affect small businesses. Small businesses, after all, are the folks that are responsible for creating twothirds, or about 70 percent, of the new jobs created nowadays. So anything that burdens these small businesses is something that is, by definition, bad for the economy and bad for job creation. This particular amendment, I think, improves the underlying legislation. It makes sense. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, which will further strengthen the RFA and ensure that agencies’ decisions are supported by data. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would require agencies to provide a detailed economic assessment prior to certifying that a rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small business entities. I oppose this bill for a number of reasons. Number one, it forces agencies to prove a negative. The negative being that it will not have a significant— bookmark that for a second—a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. I mean, proving a negative is always very difficult to do, that it won’t do this. Certainly very difficult. But then when you give the decisionmaker a vague and ambiguous frame of reference like ‘‘significant,’’ what does significant economic impact mean? It means different things to different people. So that is vague and ambiguous. It allows for unbridled discretion by an unelected bureaucrat, to use that term that my friends like to use, but in this instance I am using it with respect to a newly appointed plutocratic bureaucrat like, say, Linda McMahon at the Small Business Administration, a billionaire. Give that to, you know, a bureaucrat such as that and let them decide whether or not it has a significant economic impact. They are going to say, yes, it has a significant economic impact. They are going to do it every time because that is their agenda. They support a probigbusiness agenda. That is what they represent, and so that is how they would rule. When you add that it has to be a substantial number of small businesses, well, what is a substantial number? Is it 10 percent, 20 percent, 50 percent? That is up to whoever the decisionmaker is, the unelected bureaucrat. We see the setup. I think the American people understand what this amendment seeks to do. It requires agencies to provide a detailed economic assessment of the economic impacts of a proposed or final rule prior to certifying that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small businesses. Title III of H.R. 5 substantially increases agencies’ responsibilities with respect to rulemaking, including a requirement to supply a detailed statement that includes the factual and legal basis of the reasons why an agency has determined that a proposed or final rule will not have a significant economic impact on small businesses. Boy, you can just chase your tail all around for days trying to meet that standard. This onerous measure will force agencies to expend already strained resources and incur considerable costs to implement the bill. Also, giving corporations an opportunity to contest these arbitrary decisions if they go the right way in court. Unsurprisingly, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that an identical version of this legislation considered last Congress would cost $55 million over the 2015–2020 period, assuming appropriation of the necessary funds. By requiring agencies to quantify the economic effects that a rulemaking will have on small businesses, which may be unknowable in some cases, this amendment may task agencies with providing an economic report on a counterfactual hypothetical basis. This requirement would do little to ease compliance costs or promote small business development or growth, and more likely it will lead to regulatory avoidance and ossification and less small business activity because the big businesses are going to be allowed to crowd them out. Accordingly, I oppose 
this amendment and urge my colleagues to do the same. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I will be brief, and then I will invite my colleague from Virginia to respond. Just a couple of quick points. First of all, relative to this significant economic impact language that my distinguished colleague from Georgia is talking about, that is already in the existing law, so we are not changing anything there. We are not saying it ought to say a significant economic impact. It already says that in the existing law. Both the bureaucrats and the courts are used to determining what the terminology like ‘‘significant’’ means under the rule or regulation or the law, just as what a reasonable man is. ‘‘Reasonable’’ is quite common throughout the legal structure. We are also not giving discretion to Ms. McMahon, the soontobe head of the SBA. It is to the Chief Counsel, and he is independent. I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOODLATTE ), our chairman. Mr. GOODLATTE. I thank the gentleman for his amendment. Title III of the bill contains important reforms to make sure agencies finally take seriously Congress’ directive to write rules with flexible accommodations for small businesses, the source of most of our Nation’s job creation. Congress’ demands for flexibility began with the Regulatory Accountability Act during the 1980s, but agencies have never fully complied. One of the key ways agencies have skirted the law’s requirements has been to certify their way out of any need to actually provide flexibility by finding that a proposed or final rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. This amendment puts the brakes on an inadequately substantiated certification by requiring certifications to include economic assessment details sufficient to support the certifications. I support the amendment. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, it is already covered in current law, so why do we need this amendment? Well, it is a messaging piece to be able to say to the listening audience that we support small business. Well, gosh, I think we have answered that question here on this side whether or not they really do support small business. It is clear they support big business, and that is what this amendment is going to help facilitate without adding to the overall bill. For that reason, I ask that we oppose it. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT ). The amendment was agreed to. AMENDMENT NO . 4 OFFERED BY MS . VELA´ZQUEZ  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4 printed in part A of House Report 115–2. Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Strike line 13 on page 39 and all that follows through line 26 on page 69, and insert the following (and conform the table of contents accordingly): TITLE III—SMALL BUSINESS REGULATORY IMPROVEMENT ACT 
This title may be cited as the ‘‘Small Business Regulatory Improvement Act of 2017’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 33, the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New York. Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. The Regulatory Flexibility Act has reduced regulatory costs by $130 billion since 1998. However, it could do better. The amendment I am offering will improve this process. However, unlike the underlying bill, my amendment is actually aligned with the original statute, which was created to protect the unique needs of small businesses in the regulatory process, not to stop regulations. My amendment is also much more cost effective to the taxpayers, as the underlying bill creates a massive and unnecessary government bureaucracy. It should be noted that my amendment is based on bipartisan legislation from a previous Congress, which the committee reported by a recorded vote of 26–0. The amendment makes improvements to the most significant deficiencies facing the Regulatory Flexibility Act without the overly broad changes contained in the underlying bill. This includes making sure that agencies live up to their obligations to retrospectively review the burdens of existing rules on small businesses. The GAO has reported on numerous occasions that agency compliance with this requirement was poor. My amendment holds the agencies more accountable by requiring them to report the results of their reviews to Congress annually. My amendment also takes steps to make analyses more detailed so that agencies cannot ignore the RFA and simply certify that a rule has no significant economic impact on small businesses. Addressing this matter will ensure that agencies are required to provide a more factual basis for such certifications rather than just a sentence which dismisses the concerns of small firms. The most important aspect of my amendment is what it does not do. Unlike H.R. 5, my amendment does not create a new governmentwide bureaucracy or foist a truckload of new responsibilities on the Office of Advocacy, which only has a $9 million budget. For instance, H.R. 5 requires the Office of Advocacy to approve size standards, a function already handled by the SBA. This is like creating a Rayburn cafeteria next to the Rayburn cafeteria. It is ridiculous. This is a complete waste of taxpayer resources and will, ironically, take the Office of Advocacy away from its core mission of monitoring regulations. Also, another aspect that is very important, what this legislation does is it is setting the Office of Advocacy to fail. They do not have the expertise. They do not have the resources. In addition, H.R. 5 imposes the panel process across the entire government. I will say that again. Across the entire government, including all independent agencies. So much for fiscal responsibility. There is another complete waste of taxpayer resources, and it will further limit the Office of Advocacy’s ability to weigh in on the most important matters affecting small businesses. Instead, my amendment makes the targeted changes to the RFA that small businesses have called for over the last 5 years. In doing so, it is cost effective and responsible to the taxpayers. I urge Members to vote ‘‘yes’’ on my amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. b1545 Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Ohio is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Just a couple of points. First, before speaking in opposition to this amendment, I would note that the ranking member, Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ , and I worked very much in a bipartisan and cooperative manner on a whole range of issues. We have done that when she chaired the committee and I was the ranking member, and we do that now that I am the chair and she is the ranking member. I commend her for that cooperation. We have actually gotten a lot of things done in the Small Business Committee on behalf of small businesses all across the country in both Democratic and Republican districts. That being said, I would also note that this particular language, in essence, replaces our H.R. 5, title III, with Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ ’s version. She mentioned that hers is bipartisan. Ours is as well. Mr. CUELLAR was a principal cosponsor of this particular legislation, so, by definition, it is bipartisan. I would also note that we have dealt with this a number of times over the years, and we have included a significant number of Democratic amendments already in our underlying bill as well. So it truly is bipartisan. The gentlewoman from New York’s amendment would essentially strike title III of the bill, and it would replace it with alternative language. While I am heartened that she agrees that the Regulatory Flexibility Act needs to be improved, this amendment just does not go far enough to address, in my view, most Federal agencies’ habitual disregards for small businesses. We know that the bureaucracy does disregard small businesses time and time again. That is why we feel so strongly about this bill. Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ ’s amendment includes a few of the reforms that the current title has, but, unfortunately, it fails to include many other important ones. Her amendment does not close the loophole the IRS uses to avoid complying with the RFA, for example, and it does not provide additional opportunities for small businesses to provide input on proposed rules through the Small Business Advocacy Review panel process. It does not require the Chief Counsel for Advocacy to issue governmentwide RFA compliance regulations that all agencies must follow. Without these compliance regulations, agencies will just continue to develop their own interpretations of the RFA to avoid complying with the law’s requirement. America’s small businesses deserve more meaningful reform, and the current title III of the bill, in our view, does just that; therefore, I would urge my colleagues, respectfully, to oppose this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the chairman for being so kind. But let me just say that on this one, your approach is not balanced, and it is going to impact the very agencies that you are empowering with so many responsibilities. I would like to ask the gentleman, adding all these new responsibilities that would require manpower and expertise that is needed, how much money is included in the authorizing process for this office to work properly? Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Chairman, I don’t think we need to increase bureaucracy or hire a whole lot more people to implement this. We have plenty of people right now who work for the Federal Government, and I am sure that we can shift some resources around, people can work harder and smarter, and we can be leaner and meaner. The bureaucracy has grown far too large over the years. That money comes from somewhere. Where does it come from? It comes out of the hardworking taxpayers of our country. A lot of those folks are small business folks, and they are folks that 
have gotten the short end of the stick far too often. Hopefully, this Congress will move legislation that comes out of this body in a direction where, rather than throw roadblocks, hindrances, and more problems in the pathway of small businesses, we are going to help them. I know the last thing they want to hear is: I am from the government, and I am here to help you. The fact is the government does exist, and to the extent we can help them, we ought to do that. But most of the small businesses that I talk to, what they say is: just get the heck off my back. Quit telling me how to do what I know how to do best. So we are not anarchists over here. We are not saying that we don’t need any bureaucracy, we don’t need any government, and we don’t need any regulations. We do need some regulations, but we overregulate now. Hopefully, this is just one step in scaling back on the overregulation that comes out of Washington and is like a wet blanket over small businesses all over the country and like a wet blanket over the American economy. So let’s get that wet blanket off, let’s get the economy moving, and let’s Make America Great Again. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ ). The amendment was rejected. 
AMENDMENT NO . 5 OFFERED BY MR . PETERSON  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5 printed in part A of House Report 115–2. Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 33, the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. PETERSON ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Minnesota. Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment. This amendment will prohibit Federal agencies from using taxpayer dollars to advocate on behalf of a rule or generate comments to overwhelm the record with one point of view. A GAO report documents how the EPA created a campaign to generate comments in support of the waters of the U.S., or the WOTUS rule. This is not how government, or the rulemaking process, should work. The comment period should be a time for agencies to hear from the public about what is good, what is bad, and what needs to be fixed with a proposed rule. In my opinion, agencies too often take laws passed by Congress and then turn them into something that is unrecognizable. That is why this amendment is needed and has the support of the American Farm Bureau Federation, the National Association of Wheat Growers, and the National Association of Home Builders, among others. This is a commonsense amendment that will improve the bill, and I urge my colleagues to vote in support. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I respectfully claim the time in opposition. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment which would prohibit Federal agencies from making any public communications that would promote a pending regulatory action. We can all agree that the rulemaking process should be transparent, flexible, and accountable to the public. But rather than achieve this goal, my colleagues’ amendment would decrease transparency in the rulemaking process and burden agency rulemaking with little corresponding benefits to the public. A variety of statutes, including the Administrative Procedure Act and agency specific statutes, already prescribe the method that agencies may communicate to the public with regard to proposed rules. Agencies should, and indeed are required by law to, communicate why rules are beneficial to the public. For example, in 2014, the Department of Defense proposed a rule to protect servicemembers and their families from predatory lending schemes. In a press release discussing the rule, the Defense Department highlighted the benefits of the rule such as ‘‘this proposed rule would better protect Active Duty servicemembers and their families from excessive debt.’’ This plain language explanation of the proposed rule would be flatly prohibited by this amendment. Indeed, there is little that an agency could discuss about a pending rule that would not be considered to be promoting the rule within the meaning of this amendment. In the context of the proposed deregulation actions, in 2003, Bush administration officials posed with chainsaws and scissors next to a stack of papers to promote efforts to cut red tape. It is doubtful that this form of public communication would be permissible under this amendment. By the way, to see the Bush administration officials with a chainsaw and scissors going at regulations reminds me of what we are doing here today. In the context of a veto threat of a similar antiregulatory proposal last Congress, the Obama administration stated that similar requirements would prevent agencies from efficiently performing their statutory responsibilities and potentially lead to a less informed public. Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to do so as well. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOODLATTE ) who is the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I support his amendment. Title I of the bill contains critical reforms to the rulemaking process first introduced in the 112th Congress. In one sentence, one could say that these reforms have one ultimate goal—to assure a fair rulemaking process that achieves the benefits Congress seeks and keeps unnecessary costs to a minimum. The gentleman’s amendment, of which I am a cosponsor, responds to an extreme example of rulemaking abuse that played out during the 114th Congress. That abuse was the Environmental Protection Agency’s advocacy campaign to skew the information submitted for its administrative record and promote lobbying on behalf of its massive proposed waters of the United States rule. It is one thing to propose a rule and open the agency’s doors impartially to information from all members of the public. It is quite another to promote public submissions to guarantee the cooking of the administrative record to support the agency’s view and to advocate lobbying of Congress to support that view. This amendment makes sure that the biased agency activity manifest in the waters of the United States rulemaking never happens again. Mr. Chairman, I support the amendment. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, Congressman Gerald Connolly wanted it to be known for the record that agency employees are already barred under appropriations bills from engaging in publicity or propaganda. Agency employees are specifically barred from engaging in substantial grassroots lobbying campaigns when those campaigns are aimed at encouraging members of the public to pressure Members of Congress to support 
administration or department legislative or appropriations proposals. Mr. Chairman, I have no further speakers. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. PETERSON. I have no further speakers, Mr. Chairman. I just want to say that some of us who have been chairmen of committees and passed legislation around here, sometimes what comes back you don’t even recognize from what you passed legislatively. This bill and this amendment will help solve that problem, to some extent. So I encourage my colleagues to support the amendment and support the bill. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Chair, I rise today in opposition to this amendment and in strong opposition to the Regulatory Accountability Act. This bill is another thinly veiled mechanism for the majority to attack agency rulemaking with which they disagree. This amendment would prevent agencies from publicly disclosing information that, quote, ‘‘directly advocates, in support of or against the proposed rule, for the submission of information to form part of the record of review for the proposed rule.’’ I am concerned that the way this language is written it could restrict agencies from providing information about the benefits of a rule and soliciting public feedback. The Administrative Procedure Act requires agencies to solicit public comments on proposed rules except in narrow circumstances. We should be encouraging agencies to solicit public comments in order to provide businesses, consumer groups, and other members of the public with the opportunity to make suggestions to the agency for improving the proposed rule. Agency employees are already barred under appropriations bills from engaging in publicity or propaganda. Agency employees are specifically barred from engaging in ‘‘substantial ‘grassroots’ lobbying campaigns’’ when those campaigns are aimed at encouraging members of the public ‘‘to pressure Members of Congress to support Administration or Department legislative or appropriations proposals.’’ While transparency is always helpful in the regulatory process, a requirement that agencies report to Congress every communication to the public—including every oral communication from an agency official—would be unnecessarily burdensome and would not be feasible for agencies. The GAO has already defined covert communications, selfaggrandizement, and purely partisan activities as categories of agency communications that are often restricted by these appropriations riders. Agencies are authorized to regulate by Congress, but this amendment would further handicap federal agencies from fulfilling their critical missions. Under the guise of ‘‘accountability’’ this amendment is not even a thinly disguised attempt to muzzle commonsense regulation by suppressing even the ability to explain the proposed rule in the first place. I urge my colleagues to uphold Congress’ confidence in the agency rulemaking process and vote against this amendment and against the Regulatory Accountability Act. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. PETER SON). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Minnesota will be postponed. b1600 
AMENDMENT NO . 6 OFFERED BY MR . GRAVES OF  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6 printed in part A of House Report 115–2. Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 33, the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. GRAVES ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Louisiana. Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Chairman, since 2008, approximately 3,300 regulations have been issued on an annual basis. I will say that again. Since 2008, approximately 3,300 regulations have been issued on an annual basis. The cost of compliance with those regulations is estimated to be somewhere around $981 million, and if you add up the costs of compliance of all regulations, it is approximately double that. According to various studies that are out there, since 2008, the costs of complying with Federal regulations has doubled. Mr. Chairman, this isn’t about some huge megacorporation that is worth billions of dollars and is a multinational company. This impacts individuals. This impacts families. As a matter of fact, a study done by the Competitive Enterprise Institute estimates that approximately $15,000 per year is how much the average American family spends just to comply with Federal regulations. Major regulations are regulations that are estimated to cost in excess of $100 million. Under our amendment, what we do is simply require that, every 5 years, the Federal agency that has promulgated—that has finalized—a regulation go back and check how much it is actually costing to comply with the regulation. Here is why it is important, Mr. Chairman. If you go back to a regulation that was proposed by the Department of the Interior within the last year and a half that has to do with well control in offshore energy production, the Department of the Interior estimated that the cost of complying with that regulation was going to be, approximately, $883 million over 10 years. However, a private analysis that was done estimated that that figure was approximately onetenth of the true cost of compliance over the first decade—onetenth. There is nothing that holds the Federal agencies accountable. They can lowball numbers. They can stay below the threshold of a major action and not ever have to be held accountable to the additional analysis that is required for major regulatory actions. This, simply, makes agencies go back on major regulations to requantify—reassess—the costs of compliance to make sure that their numbers are accurate, that they understand the costs of compliance, 
and the impact on the average American family. Lastly, Mr. Chairman, I am from the State of Louisiana. A study that was done by the Mercatus Center found that the State of Louisiana is the most federally regulated State in the United States. As a matter of fact, so regulated that we are regulated 74 percent more than the average State—74 percent more. That has a significant impact on jobs, on our economy. The cosponsor of this amendment— the gentleman from Texas with whom I worked very closely, Mr. Chairman— says his State of Texas is burdened by an additional 30 percent of regulations above the national average. It is inappropriate; it penalizes our economy; it sends jobs overseas; and, most importantly, it penalizes American families. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the gentleman’s amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, any time I hear the name ‘‘Mercatus Center’’ I think of probig business, antiregulation. This amendment imposes even more paralyzing rulemaking requirements to the more than 60 analytical and procedural requirements that are already mandated by title I of this bill. You are giving them more homework on top of homework—busywork, red tape. Gum up the works—that is what this is all about. The amendment would require agencies to assess the economic impacts of major rules every 5 years, including a costbenefit analysis of the rule every 5 years, an estimate of the rule’s cost on regulated entities, and whether these costs exceed an agency’s initial estimates, among other requirements. Worse yet, once this information is compiled, the amendment would also require the agency to reopen the public docket on the rule for 60 days to consider modifications to the underlying rule. Under current law, Federal agencies already conduct an extensive retrospective review process of existing rules and have already saved taxpayers billions in cost savings. This is yet another attempt to derail the rulemaking process by paralysis through analysis. Since 2011, the Obama administration has made a durable commitment to ensuring the retrospective review of existing regulatory protections. Pursuant to Executive Order Nos. 13563 and 13610, agencies are already required to conduct a periodic review of existing rules to protect public health while reducing paperwork burdens. Furthermore, as the Obama administration stated in the context of a veto threat of a similarly draconian antiregulatory proposal, ‘‘it is important that retrospective review efforts not unnecessarily constrain an agency’s ability to provide a timely response to critical public health or safety issues or constrain its ability to implement new statutory provisions.’’ This amendment would do just that by requiring agencies to conduct a perpetual noticeandcomment process for major rules that have been adopted long ago. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOODLATTE ), the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. Mr. GOODLATTE. I thank the gentleman from Louisiana, and I support his amendment. Mr. Chairman, many of the reforms in title I of the bill focus on assuring better decisionmaking and cost control for major rules—typically, those that impose more than $100 million or more per year in costs. One of these reforms is the commonsense requirement that an agency, when it publishes a major rule, include a plan for reviewing how the rule is working within 10 years. A focus of that review is to determine whether it is possible, after the rule has been put into practice, to find new ways to lower the rule’s costs. The gentleman’s amendment speeds this process up, requiring review within 5 years, and increases Congress’ oversight, requiring reports by agencies to Congress on their reviews. Most importantly, the amendment requires that, if an agency’s report to Congress shows the rule’s costs in practice are higher than anticipated at promulgation, the agency must institute a noticeandcomment process aimed at identifying revisions that can lower costs. This is a measure that can only strengthen the bill’s effectiveness and help lower unnecessary burdens on the American people. I support the amendment. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CUELLAR ). Mr. CUELLAR. I thank Mr. JOHNSON . I thank Ranking Member CONYERS  for the leadership that he provided the committee for so many years. I thank Chairman GOODLATTE and Congressman GRAVES for working in a bipartisan way. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is common sense. It calls on the government to bring transparency to the major rules. Once an agency finalizes a major rule, that is the end of it. They are not required to review the benefits or the economic impacts. This amendment, however, holds the agency accountable by requiring that it look back and assess the costs and benefits of that rule after it has taken effect. Should the cost of the regulation exceed the proposed costs under the rule, then, under this amendment, this agency will report back the increase to the Congress. This amendment would facilitate a dialogue between the agency and the stakeholders. If the costs have gone up, then the agency must open up a comment period to hear the stakeholders and consider possible modifications or alternatives to reduce the cost and increase the benefits. We do that in Congress. Every time we pass a piece of legislation, we go back and fine tune the legislation, and I think we need to do the same thing here. Again, we must not allow regulations to run out of control. We should hold agencies accountable. This amendment will bring transparency and begin those conversations between stakeholders and the agencies. Again, I thank Congressman GRAVES  for this bipartisan amendment. Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Chairman, again, I thank the gentleman from Texas, with whom I worked closely in developing this amendment, which was legislation we introduced last year and which had dozens of bipartisan cosponsors. In summary, this is an Article I issue. This ensures that when an agency tells Congress, they tell the American public that when the regulation is going to cost a certain amount to comply with, they are held accountable to that. This is about accountability. This is about transparency. My friend from Georgia mentioned that this was ‘‘busywork.’’ Mr. Chairman, I want you to think about that for a minute. This applies to major rules that are estimated to cost in excess of $100 million to comply with, and they find it offensive that we ask them to look back one time every 5 years for rules that cost American families over $100 million to comply with every single year? I am offended by that, and I am sure that millions and millions of American families are offended by that as well. It is all summarized by this, Mr. Chairman: since 2009, for the first time in recorded history, we have had a net loss in small businesses in the United States. Regulations are hidden taxes that impact our businesses, that impact our employment opportunities, and that drive jobs to other countries. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, the bottom line is that my friends on the other side of the aisle, in their quest to satisfy the big businesses that fund these campaigns, don’t like regulations that protect the health, safety, and wellbeing of Americans, including children, including the elderly, the weak, the sick. They are trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act; trying to kill those regulations; trying to kill regulations on DoddFrank, which is protecting people from financial ruin by Wall Street barons. This is an incessant march toward a deregulatory environment. We can’t let it continue unabated. We must protest. We must speak out. We must do the right thing to protect the people of this 
country. For that reason, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. CHABOT ). The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. GRAVES ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 7 OFFERED BY MR . YOUNG OF  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 7 printed in part A of House Report 115–2. Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 33, line 10, strike ‘‘agencies and’’ and insert ‘‘agencies,’’. Page 33, line 11, insert after ‘‘easy to understand,’’ the following: ‘‘and issues guidance in a manner sufficient to provide at least 90 days for affected entities to take steps to comply with such guidance,’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 33, the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. YOUNG ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Iowa. Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. I thank the gentleman from Virginia for his help and leadership on this issue. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is designed to make an already very good bill even better. Regulators regulate. That is what they do. Regulators regulate businesses, large and small, State and local governments, nonprofits, individuals, et cetera. These regulated entities often rely on guidance from agencies to become compliant with a new rule or regulation; but, occasionally, this guidance is offered far too late in the process, leaving entities with the decision to either move forward without guidance and face possible penalties, litigation, losses, or to wait until guidance is offered and then scramble to implement changes before the deadline, increasing the likelihood for mistakes and failure. My amendment seeks to ensure guidance is offered and available in a timely manner by instructing agencies to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs to issue guidance at least 90 days before a rule or a regulation goes into effect so that affected entities have time to comply. As an example, companies recently experienced the hardships of late guidance from HHS through CMS. There is a company in Iowa and similar companies from around America that produce forms, using post acute healthcare reimbursements, including skilled nursing and home care, both of which receive funding through Medicare. CMS is responsible for setting rules for the reimbursement forms. Okay. Fine. CMS specified a new set of rules for forms going into effect at the beginning of the year. Okay. Great. This company and other companies waited for CMS guidance before printing and sending reimbursement forms to its customers, and this company waited and waited and waited; but 3 weeks before the effective date, this company and others like it hadn’t heard anything from CMS on guidance or directions—crickets. b1615 So at this point, they had to make a business decision. That is the reality. Either wait for CMS and fail to have the required forms to its customers in time for the new year or send the forms to print, cross your fingers, say a prayer, roll the dice, and hope they will later be found in compliance. They sent the forms to print knowing full well they would eat the cost if the forms did not comply. Losses, penalties, litigation, a soiled reputation— those are the real things the lack of guidance and notice causes. Thankfully, everything worked out in this situation, but in other situations, things haven’t worked out. A few days after they sent the forms to print, CMS finally approved. However, this situation illustrates a broader problem that occurs too often transcending in other instances through the economy and needs to be addressed. We need to make sure that when we give agencies the power to effectively write law, we ensure compliance guidelines are clearcut, timely, and enforcement is fair. Allowing the regulatory process to continue as is and agencies to issue needed guidance at the last minute, we only further burden Americans in their organizations, businesses, these individuals in our districts. So I want to be clear what the amendment does not do. This amendment does not change a rule or regulation in any way. It does not direct the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs to do or speak to anything else other than the timeliness issue I just described. It is pretty plain language. My amendment says, when guidance is forthcoming, it arrives in a timely manner. Mr. Chairman, it is past time for Congress to rein in and approve this process so our constituents aren’t left with uncertainty, wringing their hands waiting for Washington, and can, instead, get to work. Let’s get this fixed right now, Mr. Chairman. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and the underlying bill. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana). The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I appreciate my friend Mr. YOUNG ’s amendment which establishes a 90day compliance period for guidance documents when, in the underlying legislation, it makes clear that during any compliance period for guidance it is nonbinding. So I rise in opposition to this amendment which imposes an unnecessary and burdensome 90day waiting period for agencies to issue guidance documents. Importantly, as a form of nonlegislative rule, guidance documents do not have the force of law and are not subject to the Administrative Procedure Act’s notice and comment requirements. Section 104 of H.R. 5 already clarifies that these documents are not legally binding and may not be relied upon by an agency as legal grounds for agency action. This provision additionally requires agencies to make this document available to the public and provide a plain and prominent statement that the document is not legally binding. Given the requirements that already exist in current law and the additional requirements imposed by title I of this bill, it is difficult to ascertain why an additional 90day compliance period for guidance that is not legally binding is warranted. Furthermore, in all cases, regulated entities have ample opportunity to challenge rules, including guidance, as ‘‘arbitrary or capricious’’ under the Administrative Procedure Act where an agency lacks statutory authority to issue the guidance or the guidance is otherwise legally unsound. Indeed, as Justice Elena Kagan noted in 2015 in Paralyzed Veterans v. Mortgage Bankers, the APA contains a variety of constraints on agency decisionmaking, the arbitrary and capricious standard being among the most notable. Accordingly, I oppose the amendment, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have left? The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman has 1 minute remaining. Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOODLATTE ), the chairman. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for the time. I support his amendment. Agency guidance is a crucial part of our regulatory system—flexible because not legally binding, but needed so regulated entities can understand how best to comply with agency rules. Guidance, if it responds in a timely way to the regulated community’s need for it, helps everything to function smoothly. But one thing that does not help is agency heeldragging in the issuance of guidance as the regulated community comes up against legal or practical deadlines by which it needs to implement compliance measures. Too often agencies hurry up and wait to produce needed guidance, then tell those who waited long and hard for it to hurry up and respond, pronto. That can leave very little time for the regulated community to act before deadlines hit. 
To solve this problem, the amendment offers a simple but muchneeded solution. It requires that, within ‘‘goodguidance’’ guidelines to be issued by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs under the bill, there be guidelines for agencies generally to assure at least 90 days for regulated entities to institute measures consistent with newly issued guidelines. I support the amendment. Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. YOUNG ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 8 OFFERED BY MS . CASTOR OF  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 8 printed in part A of House Report 115–2. Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 36, strike line 10 and all that follows through page 37, line 9. Page 38, strike line 11 and all that follows through page 39, line 12. Add, at the end of the bill, the following (and conform the table of contents accordingly): TITLE VII—EXCEPTION FOR CERTAIN RULES 
This Act, and the amendments made by this Act, shall not apply in the case of a rule (as such term is defined in section 551 of title 5, United States Code) that will result in a reduced incidence of cancer, premature mortality, asthma attacks, or respiratory disease in children or seniors. The provisions of law amended by this Act, as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of this Act, shall apply to such rules. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 33, the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. CASTOR ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida. Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Chair, I rise to offer an amendment to this troubling bill, a bill that proposes to erode the separation of power safeguards in the United States Constitution. My amendment would exempt from this bill rules that protect children and older Americans from cancer, premature mortality, asthma attacks, and respiratory disease so that such rules are not irresponsibly delayed or denied. H.R. 5 unreasonably condemns every major rule, no matter its subject, to an early bureaucratic demise at the hands of the special interests. Many laws and regulations that are adopted and developed to protect the public health and protect costly chronic diseases really shouldn’t be put on the back burner just because special interests can oftentimes muck up the gears of government here in Washington. For example, the Clean Air Act, which has been in place for over 40 years, has been one of the most effective public health laws on the books. In 1970, at a time when smog was dense and visible in our cities and towns and industrial areas, our leaders took an important step to protect the public health and regulate emissions of hazardous air pollutants by adopting the Clean Air Act, with only one ‘‘nay’’ vote here in the entire Congress. Since then, agency rules and regulations have been adopted to implement the act based upon the best science. Those vital policies have improved our health, protected all Americans from harmful air pollution, such as ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, and particle matter. This Republican bill, H.R. 5, largely, would end our ability to develop future safeguards for clean air. Toxic pollutants like ozone, which is a major component of smog, are linked to asthma, lung and heart disease, and result in thousands of deaths every year and up to 1 million days of missed school. Our kids are particularly susceptible to this type of pollution because their lungs are still developing, and they are more likely to spend long periods outdoors, placing them at higher risk. The American Lung Association states that inhaling smog pollution is like getting a sunburn on your lungs and often results in immediate breathing trouble. The University of South Florida’s Department of Child & Family Studies did a study in 2014 and said, in the State of Florida alone, there were 48,674 asthma emergency room visits by children and over 6,500 asthma hospitalizations. Any American who has been alive since the adoption of the Clean Air Act in the 1970s has an appreciation for the benefits of clean air. America is stronger and Americans are healthier because of the Clean Air Act. Let’s not go backwards. This bill, if adopted, would undermine the Clean Air Act and so many other policies that lift and protect our neighbors. We still have work to do when it comes to the air that we breathe because, even with all of the progress we have made, many working class communities continue to bear the brunt of environmental pollution because oftentimes the only homes that are affordable are located near industrial sites. According to the NAACP, 78 percent of African Americans live within 30 miles of an industrial power plant and 71 percent of African Americans live in counties that violate Federal air pollution standards; and the Environmental Defense Fund found that our Latino neighbors are three times more likely to die from asthma, often for the same reasons. If you establish such barriers to cleaning our air, it is not only our families and neighbors that will suffer, but it will also be the American economy. Far from being an economic burden, clean air protections in the U.S. have a great track record, demonstrating that economic growth and pollution reduction can go hand in hand. Since 1970, we have cut harmful air pollution by about 70 percent, and the U.S. economy has more than tripled. I urge my colleagues to side with hardworking American families and not corporate polluters who love this bill. Don’t prioritize polluter profits over science and the health and safety of the public, especially the most vulnerable among us. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. YOUNG of Iowa). The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chair, the gentlewoman’s amendment would strike from the bill the Separation of Powers Restoration Act and the core judicial review provisions of the Regulatory Accountability Act. The resulting legislation, rather than restore an adequate framework of checks and balances against agency overreach and abuse, would perpetrate and perpetuate features among the worst of our current, runaway regulatory system. We cannot complete true regulatory reform without restoring to the judicial branch the vigorous powers of judicial review the amendment would strike. In addition, the bill would exclude from title I’s critical rulemaking reforms all rules to reduce the incidence of cancer, premature mortality, asthma attacks, and respiratory diseases in children and seniors. All of us support the reduction of morbidity and mortality among children and seniors. Rules to advance these goals, done properly, contribute substantially to our Nation’s health and wellbeing, but the bill does nothing to frustrate the effective achievement of those goals. It simply assures the agencies issuing these types of rules—and all agency rulemaking in general—will avoid unnecessary and overreaching regulation and issue smarter, less costly regulation and guidance when necessary. I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on the Castor amendment to protect children’s health, to protect the health of our older neighbors. We value the air that we breathe. H.R. 5 would inject unnecessary barriers into the ability of our environmental agencies—heck, all of the agencies of government—to protect us. When it comes to the final bill itself, if you believe in checks and balances as a foundation of our constitutionally based government, I urge my colleagues to oppose the bill. I yield back the balance of my time. b1630 Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, I believe in the Constitution just like everyone else does, and primarily we, as congressmen and congresswomen, have 
a responsibility to make the laws, not unelected bureaucrats who have no experience in a lot of the areas where they are making these laws. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. CASTOR ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Florida will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO . 9 OFFERED BY MR . CICILLINE  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 9 printed in part A of House Report 115–2. Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 36, strike line 10 and all that follows through page 37, line 9. Page 38, strike line 11 and all that follows through page 39, line 12. Add, at the end of the bill, the following (and conform the table of contents accordingly): TITLE VII—EXCEPTION FOR CERTAIN RULES 
This Act, and the amendments made by this Act, shall not apply in the case of a rule (as such term is defined in section 551 of title 5, United States Code) pertaining to the prevention of the transmission of foodborne illness or assistance to domestic and foreign food facilities to meet preventivecontrol requirements for safety, such as hazard prevention practices in human and animal food processing, packing, and storage facilities. The provisions of law amended by this Act, as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of this Act, shall apply to such rules. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 33, the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Rhode Island. Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Chairman, the bill before us today promises to update the ways that agencies make and enforce their rules and regulations. But in many ways, it is a solution in search of a problem. When issuing a rule, Federal agencies must already adhere to rigorous analytical process of considering alternatives, justifying the cost of a rule, and considering input from stakeholders. Within this framework, agencies have been granted the necessary latitude to react quickly to urgent crises in consumer safety. It has preserved the safety of our food and our drinking water and has protected our families from defects in the products that we rely upon every day. However, the passage of this bill would put that safety and that protection at risk. With H.R. 5, we are getting six reform bills rolled into one. This sweeping regulatory bill would cumulatively add 60 new procedural and analytical requirements to the agency rulemaking process, invite frivolous litigation against agencies, empower special interests, and emphasize costsaving over public protection. If enacted, H.R. 5 will needlessly create such an enormous burden on the rulemaking process that it threatens to hamstring agencies and discourage them from pursuing new rules at all. In its present form, this bill endangers our Nation’s environmental, public health, workplace safety, and consumer financial security protections. My amendment would offer critical protection by exempting rules pertaining to the prevention of the transmission of foodborne illness or assistance to food facilities to meet preventivecontrol requirements for safety. Protecting consumers from dangerous food contamination is a worthy goal in and of itself. And this amendment would go even further by protecting jobs and businesses. For example, in 2015, Blue Bell Creameries suffered a deadly listeria contamination crisis and had to recall 8 million gallons of ice cream. After the company shut down most of its production, Blue Bell was forced to lay off 1,450 employees from their jobs, or 37 percent of their workforce, and an additional 1,400 employees were furloughed. Chipotle is also still reeling from various outbreaks of E. coli, salmonella, and norovirus over 2015 and 2016, which caused widespread panic among customers and the company’s shareholders. Despite marketing efforts to repair its reputation, Chipotle’s sales have steadily declined, and it plans to open fewer stores in 2017. This, in turn, had a domino effect on Chipotle’s paper bowl supplier who laid off 5 percent of its employees because of decreased demand from Chipotle. Afterward, both Blue Bell and Chipotle took aggressive remedial steps, such as conducting deep cleansing of equipment and facilities, changing food preparation procedures, hiring food safety consultants, training employees, and temporarily suspending operations. The FDA responded by proposing proactive rules, such as having manufacturers come up with a plan to identify potential food safety problems and how to respond to them. The FDA also proposed a rule to establish standards for growing, harvesting, packing, and handling produce. Both these rules could greatly assist businesses in minimizing future food contamination and having to deal with the economic aftermath of an outbreak. However, under H.R. 5 in its current form, similar such FDA rules could be delayed by years or halted entirely. We can’t afford to put consumer safety and our economy at risk while Congress entangles any real possibility for immediate and preventative action. I ask my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment to ensure that we protect the public and health and safety of our constituents. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. FORTEN BERRY ). The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. MARINO. Like the previous amendment, the gentleman’s amendment would strike from the bill the Separation of Powers Restoration Act and core judicial review provisions of the Regulatory Accountability Act. Faced with a runaway administrative state, we must not gut the bill’s crucial reinforcements of judicial checks and balances against agency overreach and abuse. For this reason alone, the amendment should be rejected. In addition, the bill would exclude from title I’s longneeded rulemaking reforms numerous types of food safety regulations. All of us support food safety. But the bill does nothing to frustrate the protection of food safety. In fact, it clearly calls upon regulatory agencies to achieve their statutory objectives in this and all areas. Beyond that, it simply ensures that agency rulemaking will avoid unnecessary and overreaching regulations and produce smarter, less costly regulation and guidance when necessary. I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend from Pennsylvania for his comments, but the assertion that this does nothing to frustrate or jeopardize food safety is not true. This creates 60 new procedural and analytical requirements to agency action, and that will invite frivolous litigation, empower special interests, emphasize cost saving over public protection, and make implementation of these rules almost impossible. It is important to remember, Mr. Chairman, when issuing a rule, Federal agencies already are required to adhere to a rigorous analytical process of considering alternatives, justifying the cost of the rule, and considering input from stakeholders. I gave two examples in my earlier comments that demonstrate that there is a real role for the Federal Government in the implementation of rules to protect food safety. There are real consequences not only to the individuals harmed but to our economy by these sorts of events. This bill will not only frustrate that, in many instances, it will make it impossible. I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, I respectfully disagree with my friend and NATO member. We have traveled together. A lot of the delay now is because of the agencies and how long they take to make decisions. With the premise behind our bills combined, agencies come 
up with an idea that they think will improve the quality of life, and that is what they should be doing. But then they immediately send it to us in the House, in Congress, and then we make the determination as to whether it is good law or it is bad law and apply it that way. We certainly have the time in the House, and I am sure the Senate has the time, too, to address these matters quickly and not delay it as long as the agency has been delaying making rules. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Rhode Island will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO . 10 OFFERED BY MR . JOHNSON  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 10 printed in part A of House Report 115–2. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 36, strike line 10 and all that follows through page 37, line 9. Page 38, strike line 11 and all that follows through page 39, line 12. Add, at the end of the bill, the following (and conform the table of contents accordingly): TITLE VII—EXCEPTION FOR CERTAIN RULES 
This Act, and the amendments made by this Act, shall not apply in the case of a rule (as such term is defined in section 551 of title 5, United States Code) pertaining to significantly improving the employment, retention, and wages of workforce participants, especially those with significant barriers to employment, such as persons with disabilities or limited English proficiency. The provisions of law amended by this Act, as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of this Act, shall apply to such rules. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 33, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. JOHNSON ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment to H.R. 5 which would exempt from the bill rules that improve the employment retention and wages of workforce participants, especially those with significant barriers to employment. When President Obama took office in 2009, he inherited the worse economic depression since the Great Depression. Since then, President Obama’s ‘‘North Star’’ on domestic policy has long been to make the economy work for the middle class and for those fighting to join it. Notwithstanding historic austerity levels and a Republican Congress more interested in winning elections than putting Americans back to work or increasing wages, President Obama has largely achieved this goal, while rescuing the auto industry and signing tax cuts for middle class persons, as opposed to just simply big business. According to the leading economic data, private sector businesses have created more than 15 million new jobs. The unemployment rate has dropped well below 5 percent to the lowest point in nearly a decade, wages are rising, and the poverty rate has dropped to the lowest point since 1968. And more people have health insurance than ever before. This has all occurred during an administration that is pro environment, pro clean energy, pro workplace safety, pro medical care, pro Medicare, pro Medicaid, pro Social Security. In fact, during this time, our Nation has doubled its production of clean energy and reduced carbon emissions faster than any other advanced nation. Notwithstanding this progress, there is still much work to be done for millions of Americans in every part of our country who are out of work, underemployed, or have not seen significant wage growth postrecession. But they should understand it was the Republicans who caused that to happen by not wanting to work with the President and members of the Democratic Party to make things better for working people in this country. Congress should be working tirelessly now across party lines to find solutions to persistent unemployment and stagnant wages, such as a public infrastructure investment agenda that will increase productivity and domestic output while turning the page on our historic underinvestment in our Nation’s roads, bridges, and educational institutions. Unfortunately, this bill, H.R. 5, is not one of those solutions. The Regulatory Accountability Act is nothing short of a train wreck for critical public health and safety protections that ensure that our air is clean, our water is pure, and that our workplace, vehicles, homes, and consumer products are safe. Freeing corporations from the costs of protecting Americans against harmful activity is not the right path forward to increasing employment and wages for all. It is a giveaway to the corporate sector that supports them. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. MARINO. This amendment would strike from the bill the Separation of Powers Restoration Act and the essential judicial review provisions of the Regulatory Accountability Act. It, too, should be rejected for those reasons. In addition, the bill would exclude from title I’s rulemakings reforms numerous types of rule related to employment and wages. But once again, the bill does nothing to prevent good rules in these areas. On the contrary, it would produce better rules, rules that are smarter and less costly, freeing resources for job creation and higher wages. I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I applaud Mr. JOHNSON , the ranking member of the subcommittee for his leadership on these issues, and the ranking member of the full committee, Mr. CONYERS , for his persistent leadership, having gone over this bill any number of times. Let me mention that Mr. JOHNSON ’s amendment is vital because it deals with vulnerable workforce individuals, individuals with disabilities, limited English proficiency, and other requirements. And I would beg to differ with my good friend from Pennsylvania, 70 different elements of criteria that you will put these regulations through, you are simply trying to implode those who advocate for the rights of workers, unions, and others. Therefore, I would question the viability of trying to obstruct, helping these vulnerable workers. This is a very good amendment. Let me be very clear. Since 2010, U.S. businesses have added 15.6 million jobs. From 2014 to 2015, real median household income grew by 5.2 percent. We know that, as Jason Furman, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers notes, demographic changes in labor force participation, primarily driven by a large increase in retirement by baby boomers that began in 2008, has consistently weighed on employment growth. It is quite different from when President Reagan was in. The labor force participation rate is low because of these variables. b1645 These regulations are not going to improve that participation. The Obama recovery has been slower because, under Reagan, we realized the baby boomers were in their prime. Now the baby boomers are retiring. We need to provide opportunities for younger workers, minority workers, workers with disabilities; and this, H.R. 5, with all of these hoops that the regulation has to go through that are protecting or empowering workers or increasing the opportunities for workers is certainly going to thwart that growth. You cannot deny that this administration has seen growth with 200,000 plus jobs per month over a series of 
years. I would argue that Mr. J OHNSON’s amendment is a strong amendment. It promotes job growth, and it gives opportunities to many who are vulnerable in the workforce. I ask my colleagues to support the Johnson amendment. Mr. Chair, my Republican colleagues have made several statements concerning economic activity that invite fact checks: First, they argue that the labor force participation rate is historically low, but as we all know, the labor force participation is affected by both long term trends and short term policies. As Jason Furman, the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, notes, ‘‘demograpic changes in labor force participation—primarily driven by a large increase in retirement by baby boomers that began in 2008—have consistently weighed on employment growth.’’ Second, they argue that the Obama recovery has been slower than the economic recovery under the Reagan Administration. But this argument is laughable. President Reagan’s recovery benefited from the fact that many baby boomers were in the prime working years while President Obama’s recovery has taken place in front of the backdrop of an aging U.S. population. More importantly, the economic lows of the Reagan Administration are not comparable to the mortgageforeclosure crisis, which resulted in higher unemployment than any other period since the Great Depression. Finally, despite many bald assertions, my Republican colleagues have not satisfactorily explained how H.R. 5 will create a single job or responded to President Obama’s unimpeachable jobs record. In fact, despite, strong economic headwinds and years of Republican obstructionism during the majority of his presidency, the U.S. economy is 11.5 percent larger than its peak before the 2008 economic crisis as of the third quarter of 2016. Since early 2010, U.S. businesses have added 15.6 million jobs. From 2014 to 2015, real median household income grew by 5.2 percent, the fastest annual growth on record, and the United States saw its largest oneyear drop in the poverty rate since the 1960s. In closing, there is little evidence supporting my Republican colleagues’ claims and if there is any doubt that the H.R. 5 will undermine workforce participation, my colleagues should support my amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chair, I simply would add that I ask my colleagues to oppose this amendment. As far as the jobs increase, or lack thereof, that my colleague speaks of, we have had the slowest growth rate in jobs in the history of this country. There are millions of people that are unemployed that are not seeking unemployment benefits, and they are not taken into consideration in the unemployment rate because it is much higher than it is; and the mean family income is at a low as far back as 14 years ago. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. MARINO. I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank the gentleman for his kindness. Would the gentleman not count automation and technology as one of the elements and, as well, the idea of the retiring of baby boomers as part of the issue of growth? And can we not work together to question those particular elements so that we can collectively and collaboratively promote job growth? Mr. MARINO. Well, first of all, I would certainly enjoy working on job growth with the gentlewoman. We have worked on issues in the past. But the gentlewoman forgets about the technology that has created jobs. People have to write those programs. People have to build that hardware. They have to come up with very intense, very intricate ways to make the machinery, continue updating the software. My daughter is a software major in college, and the jobs there are abundantly available. So the jobs are there, but what I am hearing from people in my district and across the country is the regulations that have been imposed, not only by this administration but other administrations as well, are crushing particularly our small businesses. So if we can step back and eliminate these jobcrushing regulations and take into consideration the economics involved, we are going to create more jobs, we are going to protect people, and we are going to protect the health of people. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. JOHNSON ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Georgia will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO . 11 OFFERED BY MR . RUIZ 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 11 printed in part A of House Report 115–2. Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment to H.R. 5 at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 36, strike line 10 and all that follows through page 37, line 9. Page 38, strike line 11 and all that follows through page 39, line 12. Add, at the end of the bill, the following (and conform the table of contents accordingly): TITLE VII—EXCEPTION FOR CERTAIN RULES 
This Act, and the amendments made by this Act, shall not apply in the case of a rule (as such term is defined in section 551 of title 5, United States Code) pertaining to the safety of children’s products or toys. The provisions of law amended by this Act, as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of this Act, shall apply to such rules. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 33, the gentleman from California (Mr. RUIZ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my amendment to H.R. 5, which will ensure children’s products are safe for use. In 2015, there were an estimated 254,200 toyrelated injuries treated in emergency departments across the Nation. Tragically, 15 children were killed in toyrelated incidents that same year. As an emergency medicine physician, I have treated children who have fallen victim to these accidents. H.R. 5, the Regulatory Accountability Act, prioritizes cheaper alternatives for companies over the safety of our children. To me, this is unconscionable. It is wrong. It is not the direction we should be taking our Nation. My amendment to H.R. 5 will ensure that an agency rule regarding the safety of children’s products or toys is not delayed by the bureaucratic hurdles that H.R. 5 imposes on Federal agencies. My simple amendment provides a straightforward safety net for our sons and daughters across the country. Our children should always be our priority. The facts are clear: a vote against my amendment is a vote to put a company’s bottom line above the safety of our children. So I urge all of my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment to protect our children. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, like other carveout amendments just offered, this amendment would strike from the bill the Separation of Powers Restoration Act and the essential judicial review protections of the Regulatory Accountability Act. It should be rejected. We should not be settling for weak judicial review that produces rubber stamps of agency action. We should be voting for the strong judicial review reform in the bill that prevents judicial rubber stamps. Beyond that, the bill would exclude from title I’s rulemaking reforms children’s toys and product safety rules. But again, the bill does nothing to prevent good rules in these areas. It will produce better rules, rules that are smarter and less costly, freeing resources for job creation and higher wages. Smarter rules are precisely what we need to protect children’s health and safety, and more jobs and higher wages are what are needed to help families provide for their children. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Chairman, I want to emphasize what is at stake here. We are talking about delay or forgoing regulations that protect our children, regulations that give parents like me the peace of mind that when I buy a bottle for my daughter, Sky, I know it is safe for her to use, and that when I buy a product that is labeled ageappropriate for my daughter, Sage, I can reasonably expect it will not contain small parts that Sage could swallow and send her to the emergency room with an obstructed esophagus that will require emergency surgery. For me as a dad it is personal, and for our Nation it is essential. This is commonsense legislation. I urge my colleagues to put aside partisanship, politics, and corporate greed and to think about the children in their lives who could be harmed by this bill. Vote ‘‘yes’’ on my amendment to protect children and save lives. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, respectfully, the gentleman does not have the market cornered on worrying about the safety of our children. I think anybody in this room who has children has just as much concern for our children. What his amendment does is gut—it guts—regulations, and what our amendments do—and the way we should be handling these as Congress making any laws—will improve the quality of life and improve the protections. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. RUIZ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO . 12 OFFERED BY MR . SCOTT OF  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 12 printed in part A of House Report 115–2. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk made in order under the rule. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 36, strike line 10 and all that follows through page 37, line 9. Page 38, strike line 11 and all that follows through page 39, line 12. Add, at the end of the bill, the following (and conform the table of contents accordingly): TITLE VII—EXCEPTION FOR CERTAIN RULES 
This Act, and the amendments made by this Act, shall not apply in the case of a rule (as such term is defined in section 551 of title 5, United States Code) pertaining to workplace health or safety at mining facilities which are subject to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (30 U.S.C. 801 et seq.) or workplaces which are subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 651 et seq.), and which is necessary to prevent or reduce the incidence of workrelated traumatic injury, cancer, or irreversible lung disease. The provisions of law amended by this Act, as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of this Act, shall apply to such rules. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 33, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, this amendment to the Regulatory Accountability Act, H.R. 5, if adopted, would exempt regulations proposed by the Mine Safety and Health Administration or the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, MSHA and OSHA, which are needed to prevent or reduce the incidence of traumatic injury, cancer, or irreversible lung disease. I am deeply concerned that this legislation would impose layers of unnecessary procedures to the rulemaking process and provide incentives for frivolous litigation, while hindering workplace safety agencies trying to help keep workers safe. Current procedures that govern OSHA’s rulemaking already involve an extensive review process and stakeholder engagement from small business review panels, risk assessments, economic feasibility determinations, public hearings, and multiple opportunities for public comment. According to the GAO, to meet these requirements, it takes OSHA 7 years to issue a new safety standard. In fact, it required 18 years for OSHA to update a rule that reduces exposure to beryllium, a metal that causes irreversible lung disease, even though there was broad agreement between employers and unions on the new standard. H.R. 5 imposes 60 additional procedural steps in order to issue a new rule, on top of extensive layers of review already required by the Administrative Procedure Act, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, Data Quality Act, and numerous executive orders. The goal of adding these layers is obvious: to tie agencies such as OSHA and MSHA in red tape so they can’t do their jobs protecting workers and improving workplace safety. One especially troubling part of the bill would require a supermandate that requires agencies to use the least cost alternative instead of the most protective rule. Nobody favors excessive cost, but this requirement overrides the carefully balanced requirements in OSHA that require life and limb must be fully protected, provided that the safety requirements are technically and economically feasible. That is the present law. The question that needs to be asked is: The least cost to whom and at what cost to others? What is the least cost mandate protection of workers? Is the least cost mandate secondary to worker safety in order to limit cost to corporations? And then again, who decides? Under the bill, some regulations could be delayed until the end of any litigation, the final determination in a lawsuit which, with trials and appeals, could take years. The bill prohibits the rules from going into effect until the end of the litigation. Now, normally, you can get an injunction, but that would require the court to consider the likelihood of success of the lawsuit and the potential harm done if the injunction is issued or not issued. Under H.R. 5, rules could exceed the least cost alternative, but only if the agency demonstrates that the additional benefits outweigh the additional costs. This eliminates a wellestablished test under OSHA which requires ‘‘the most productive standard which is feasible,’’ and that standard obviously just invites litigation which will delay the final rule for years. The problem with the least cost framework is that it would tilt the playing field to ensure the least cost for industry but at the expense of workers and the American public. According to expert witnesses before the Judiciary Committee, this bill will add another 2 or 3 years to the regulatory process, and these delays will allow preventable injuries and occupational diseases to continue unabated. Mr. Chairman, the premise behind this legislation is based on the erroneous assumption that regulations issued over the last 8 years have obstructed job growth; however, employment statistics do not bear this out. Since the end of the recession, the U.S. economy has gained almost 16 million jobs, while establishing the longest consecutive months of job growth on record. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment to ensure that, even if the bill passes, OSHA and MSHA will be able to prevent or reduce the incidence of traumatic injury, cancer, and irreversible lung disease. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, I certainly respect what my friend on the other side of the aisle has to say, but, again, I respectfully disagree. Once again, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would strike from the bill the Separation of Powers Restoration Act and the essential judicial review provisions of the Regulatory Accountability Act. That would have but one effect: to preserve the freedom to run riot that Washington bureaucrats have enjoyed for decades 
as they have racked up roughly $2 trillion in regulatory burdens on the American people. The amendment also would exclude from title I’s rulemaking reforms workplace safety rules issued by OSHA or the Mine Safety and Health Administration to reduce traumatic injury, cancer, or lung disease. I would urge my colleagues to read the bill and listen more closely. The bill does nothing to prevent good rules in these areas. It will produce better rules, smarter rules, less costly rules. That will free up resources for desperately needed job creation, meaning more workers will have more safe workplaces in which to earn a living. I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. b1700 Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Chairman, this amendment will preserve the ability of the executive branch to promulgate rules, which will save lives and avoid preventable deaths and disease. A vote for the amendment is a vote for a safe workplace. I would hope that the amendment would be adopted and save lives. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Virginia will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO . 13 OFFERED BY MR . TONKO  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 13 printed in part A of House Report 115–2. Mr. TONKO. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 36, strike line 10 and all that follows through page 37, line 9. Page 38, strike line 11 and all that follows through page 39, line 12. Add, at the end of the bill, the following (and conform the table of contents accordingly): TITLE VII—EXCEPTION FOR CERTAIN RULES 
This Act, and the amendments made by this Act, shall not apply in the case of a rule (as such term is defined in section 551 of title 5, United States Code) made pursuant to the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, or the amendments made by that Act. The provisions of law amended by this Act, as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of this Act, shall apply to such rules. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 33, the gentleman from New York (Mr. TONKO ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. Mr. TONKO. Mr. Chair, last May, Democrats and Republicans came together to pass the first major environmental law in decades, the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act. Before this reform, it had been widely acknowledged that the Toxic Substances Control Act, or TSCA, was broken. The law was hampered by litigation since shortly after it was passed in 1976, and was rendered almost completely ineffective. It has only been 7 months since over 400 Members voted for this reform, which requires a number of new rulemakings by the EPA. A primary motivation to reform TSCA was to remove procedural hurdles that were preventing the EPA from regulating dangerous chemicals. But the bill before us today would impose new, unnecessary obstacles in the rulemaking process, which will impede agencies that already are struggling with shrinking budgets and time constraints. Even some of the Members that had concerns with TSCA reform, myself included, would agree that it is imperative that these rulemakings go forward efficiently in order to protect public health and to give the private sector the certainty that it asks for when it supported the reform effort. Unlike 233 of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, I did not vote for this bill; but I do firmly believe that the rulemakings required by this law must be done effectively and quickly. Unfortunately, the bill before us today would undermine that process. For the record, I do not believe any amendments will fix the underlying bill, and I hope my colleagues will oppose this bill later today. While Congress has moved on to other priorities, the EPA has been hard at work implementing the law as Congress intended. Since being signed into law in June, the EPA has already put into place new processes to review new chemicals, which is exactly what this House instructed them to do. A number of rulemakings will soon get underway focused on how the EPA prioritizes chemicals for evaluation and how it will conduct risk evaluations. Other rules regarding the EPA’s chemical inventory and the process for collecting fees will also be needed. The Members that worked on TSCA reform deferred many of these procedural decisions to the EPA because we lacked the expertise necessary to determine every detail of the most effective, streamlined regulatory process. We are not toxicologists or chemists, so we empowered the scientists that do this work to receive public feedback and create regulations, based on congressional intent, within a reasonable amount of time. It is clear that an overwhelming number of Members of the House believe that the EPA needed these tools when we passed the Lautenberg bill to fix the EPA’s chemical program. Let’s not tie the agency’s hands as it seeks effective implementation. We have seen what happens with a broken chemical safety law. Let’s not go back to that. I would also caution against the bill’s requirement to choose the least costly regulatory option. People familiar with TSCA will know the term ‘‘least burdensome,’’ which required the EPA to select the restriction that was demonstrated to be the least burdensome to address identified risks. In practice, this requirement was so onerous that the EPA was not even able to restrict known carcinogens like asbestos. The Lautenberg bill ended this requirement. Let’s not reinstate this problem for our agencies. Personally, I do not believe my amendment goes far enough. We should exempt every major environmental law responsible for protecting Americans’ air, water, and land from this bill. We have seen in many cases that these rules do not hurt the economy. They protect public health and provide much greater benefits to society than costs. Many of our bedrock environmental statutes require agencies to review and update their rules periodically. Members of Congress should not prevent an agency from simply doing the job that is required of it under the law. But in terms of this amendment and TSCA reform, Congress knew exactly what would be asked of the EPA in order to carry out the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act when we passed it by a vote of 403–12 just a few months ago. We cannot tell the EPA to do something and then tie its hands and expect it to get it done. This amendment is simple. Do Members of this body want to give our regulatory agencies the tools they need to implement the laws that Congress has passed? And, in my view, it should not matter if these laws were passed 6 months ago or 60 years ago. Or should we make it more difficult to implement effective rulemakings, even when there is legislative consensus about the need for them? Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chair, one last time, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would strike from the bill the Separation of Powers Restoration Act and the judicial review provisions of the Regulatory Accountability Act. One last time, that attempt should be rejected. 
We need a strong judiciary, not a supine one, to stand up to agency overreach and abuse and protect the liberty and property of the America from the long hands of Washington’s restless bureaucrats. The amendment also would exclude from title I’s rulemaking reforms rules issued under the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act. Chemical safety is important to all of us. Congress worked hard on chemical safety legislation. But it is smarter regulations, supported by sounder science, at less cost that will best produce chemical safety under that act. That is precisely the kind of regulation that will happen once the 21st century rulemaking reforms in the Regulatory Accountability Act become law. I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. TONKO ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. TONKO. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO . 14 OFFERED BY MR . GRIJALVA  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 14 printed in part A of House Report 115–2. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 42, strike line 7 and all that follows through line 3 on page 45. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 33, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GRIJALVA ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, today, this Republican Congress is taking a short break from trying to destroy our healthcare system to try to destroy the rest of the Federal Government. H.R. 5 is nothing more than Republicans seeking to micromanage the regulatory process to death. They claim they only want good government. In reality, they want no government at all. They want to wrap Federal agencies in so much red tape that they won’t be able to move to protect our health, our safety, or our natural resources. Language in title III tries to prevent Federal land managers from actually managing Federal lands. This language would make land managers jump through the same procedural hoops over and over again just to put a new land management plan in place. These new requirements are completely redundant, which is, of course, the point. Federal land management plans already go through extensive review, including by the public, before they are ever even implemented. One way we know this is that the House Republicans complain constantly about how long it takes Federal agencies to come up with a decision. Yet, here they are claiming that this Republican Congress knows best how our public lands and resources should be managed. Let’s stop and look at the record. Last Tuesday, almost every single Republican Member of this House voted for a change in our House standing rules to calculate the value of all Federal lands as zero for accounting purposes. Yes, House Republicans agree that all Federal lands are essentially worthless. Then, on Thursday of this week, 229 House Republicans voted against an amendment I offered to another bill to declare that climate change is real. Yes, 95 percent of House Republicans voted to deny a settled scientific fact. Yet, here we are today with the same House Republicans who deny science; the same House Republicans who think public lands are worthless, claiming they know how to manage these public lands. Science deniers and those who think our public lands have no value have no credibility when they bring legislation to this floor claiming that they want to improve public land management. As with health care, as with so many things, they don’t want to improve it; they want to destroy it. Congressional Republicans have proved themselves completely incapable of building or preserving anything. They are only interested in tearing things down, starting with health, safety, and environmental protections for our people and our communities. This bill would needlessly tip the scales in favor of corporate polluters who want to be in power to ruin our public lands, taking the resources and the profits for themselves, leaving the American people with the mess and the consequences. My amendment strikes the section of this bill intended to turn our public land management process into nothing more than a board meeting of the American Petroleum Institute. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Ohio is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Chairman, a longstanding position of the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration has been that land management plans developed by the Forest Service and by the Bureau of Land Management are rules and that they are subject to analysis under the RFA. The same conclusion—that a land resource management plan is a rule—has been reached by the Government Accountability Office. Given the potentially significant consequences to small businesses that rely on public lands and small communities that border those lands, the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management should assess the impacts of their plans on these small entities. That is all this does. We are saying: How is this going to affect small businesses? Seventy percent of the new jobs created in America are created by small businesses? Should we care about what the bureaucrats are doing, how it affects those folks that are creating all these jobs? Common sense says yes, we ought to do that. This bill already includes a reform to prepare those agencies to prepare regulatory flexibility analyses when they are developing changes to resource management plans to determine how small businesses and small communities would be affected. b1715 Striking this provision from the bill would do away with a needed reform for small businesses, such as farmers and ranchers and their small communities, especially those located in the Western United States, which contains the vast majority of Federal lands. I would also note that my esteemed colleague talks about Republicans trying to destroy health care in this country. That is obviously absurd. We are trying to save health care. We are trying to make sure that Americans aren’t forced to pay a heck of a lot more and have higher deductions, things they can’t afford. Plans right now they are in, they are paying for plans and oftentimes get zero health care out of those plans because the deductibles are now so high under ObamaCare that they can’t even use it. I think there are a whole lot of people, when this was forced through this Congress on a purely partisan vote by my colleagues, the Democrats at that time, and by this President, there were a lot of Republicans who would have loved to have joined with them to do something to help people get health care who didn’t have it. That is a worthy cause. But that could have been done without screwing up everybody else’s health care in this country. That is what they failed to do when they did this. We are hoping, in a bipartisan way, we can work together to improve health care for lots of folks in this country. We will see if that is going to work out or not. I would also note that there is nobody on this side of the aisle who thinks we need no government at all, we need no regulations, we need no rules; but we don’t want to overregulate the job creators in this country so that they can’t create jobs. Those jobs 
that people don’t get, those are real people; or people who get knocked out of that employment are real people, and they have families. We ought to be supporting them. Overregulation kills those jobs. I would finally note, relative to climate change, what we are saying is that if we are going to do something, let’s do it in a smart manner. Let’s not try to save some things and then knock thousands, probably millions of Americans out of their jobs. There is a smart way of doing it and there is a wrong way of doing it. We would like to do it the smart way. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the comments of my esteemed colleague. We have to get past the point where we are just talking about repeal. As the President so eloquently said last night, if there is something that is going to improve the health and wellbeing of the American people relative to the Affordable Care Act, then bring it forward. We all have been waiting patiently for the Republican majority to bring something forward that not only repeals but replaces. We are still waiting. In terms of this amendment, the resource management plans are the backbone for every action and approved use on BLM land. It is about scoping. It is about public input, collaborative with State, local, tribal, and user groups across the spectrum, and that is the process that is in place now, a process that deserves to be continued, ratified, and protected. As far as the issue of climate change, the President eloquently said last night that we should go forward on the issue of climate change, putting science and reason as a priority on how we have that discussion. Once the majority is prepared to deal with science and reason, I think our side of the aisle is willing to do so as well. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. BYRNE ). The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GRIJALVA ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona will be postponed. The Acting CHAIR. The Chair understands that amendment No. 15 will not be offered. 
AMENDMENT NO . 16 OFFERED BY MR . POSEY  
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 33, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. POSEY ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. Mr. POSEY. Mr. Chairman, my amendment is about transparency and accountability. I rise to urge my colleagues to support it. When an agency decides to write a rule or revise an old one, they are sometimes required to share technical or scientific information to support their proposal. For many years, scientific research has relied upon the peer review process to ensure quality, integrity, and objectivity of published work. Peer review is when scientists open their research to the scrutiny of other experts in their field in order to receive feedback, criticism, and ensure their conclusions are sound. Unfortunately, when peer reviews of information return unfavorable comments or raise unforeseen issues with the quality of work, some agencies have acted to silence or hide the critiques. This, of course, is bad science, and it results in bad public policy. A recent example of this abuse occurred during a highly technical rulemaking proceeding in which an agency relied heavily upon a single study that many criticized as profoundly inadequate. The agency commissioned two peer reviews of the study, which were completed and returned 2 weeks into the comment period for the public. However, after both scholars submitted highly critical reviews that echoed the concerns of the many commentators, sadly, the agency withheld the release of their work to the public. When the agency finally did release the information as required by law, it was on the Friday that marked the very last day of the comment period as part of a massive document dump that buried the negative reviews. The political cherrypicking of scientific information and manipulation of the public record harms both the quality of Federal regulations as well as the overall integrity of the rulemaking proceeding. When Federal agencies distribute scientific research supporting a proposed rule, the public and those affected by it deserve to be certain that the science is of the highest quality and have a due process right to comment meaningfully on the rules the science intends to support. My amendment will help protect this basic principle of good government and ensure fairness in Federal rulemaking by requiring that the public be provided with a clear timeline for disclosure of any influential scientific information. The amendment will also require agencies to offer an explanation if they revise the anticipated public release date of peer reviews. Simply put, the Federal agency will no longer be able to shield from the public view the existence of information that is central to evaluating a proposed rule. We cannot continue to allow the Federal agencies to march toward a predetermined outcome at the expense of sound science and policy. I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. TONKO. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New York is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. TONKO. Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment which requires that an agency publish a list of scientific information relating to a rule or expected to relate to the rule for each rule that an agency expects to propose for the following year. I am concerned that this amendment would create unintended consequences and operate as a oneway ratchet to slow down and stop the rulemaking process by requiring burdensome disclosures and creating options for procedural gridlock. Agencies are already required to publish relevant data in support of a rule during these rulemaking processes. Rules that do not appear to be based on a reasoned analysis of relevant data may be vacated by reviewing courts as arbitrary or capricious. Moreover, data acquired through federally funded research is already accessible to researchers who have a legitimate purpose. I am also concerned that because this amendment does not define scientific information or clarify the scope of this publication requirement, peer reviewed materials may be taken out of context or otherwise misused for political purposes. In so doing, this requirement may chill feedback in the scientific community, undermine agencies’ ability to adopt the best rules possible, or otherwise manufacture delays in the rulemaking process. Any additional requirements in this area should strengthen, rather than weaken, the process of sciencebased 
rulemaking. Given these concerns, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. POSEY. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining? The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Florida has 2 minutes remaining. Mr. POSEY. Mr. Chairman, most members of the public don’t know what a rule is. Rules are laws made by unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats. We collected 4 years’ worth of Daily Registers in my office. Those are executive orders, rules, proposed rules, changes to rules. I ask people how big they think the stack is. I get answers 4 feet, 6 feet, 7 feet. Well, actually, in 4 years’ time, the stack was 7 stacks over my head—over 70 linear feet of laws made by unelectable, unaccountable people. The public thinks we make the laws. Most of the laws we don’t make. We allow unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats to make the laws; and the very least we can do to protect the public is ensure that we have transparency and accountability for their procedures, and that is exactly what this amendment does. Mr. Chairman, before I close, I include in the RECORD a letter from a leading policy research institution that highlights the need for legislation like my amendment that will improve the public peer review process in our Federal agencies. 
PHOENIX CENTER FOR ADVANCED  LEGAL & ECONOMIC PUBLIC POLICY  STUDIES , Washington, DC, January 11, 2017. Re Republic Peer Review. Speaker PAULRYAN, Washington, DC. Minority Leader NANCY PELOSI , Washington, DC. DEARSPEAKER RYAN AND MINORITY LEADER  PELOSI : As both of you know firsthand, developing and implementing good public policy is no easy task. The issues before regulatory agencies are often complex and technical, and therefore resolution benefits from input from the best minds both in and out of government. Yet, simply because someone writes a lengthy report on a particular topic does not automatically mean that their analysis is valid. No presumption of scientific legitimacy can be afforded when making good public policy. Instead, if policymakers are going to rely on a particular study, then that study deserves to be critiqued first via public peer review in a dispassionate manner to see if the prescriptions and findings hold up. This public peer review is exceedingly important when deciding controversial matters, particularly because reviewing courts are loath to secondguess expert administrative agency’s policy decisions—choosing instead to limit themselves only to questions of law. (See, e.g., USTelecom v. FCC, 825 F.3d 674, 697 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (we do not ‘‘inquire whether ‘some or many economists would disapprove of the [agency’s] approach’ because ‘we do not sit as a panel of referees on a professional economics journal, but as a panel of generalist judges obliged to defer to a reasonable judgment by an agency acting pursuant to congressionally delegated authority.’’)) As such, the peer review process allows the public to better hold government to account and results in more informed policymaking. Unfortunately, while the Office of Management and Budget mandates peer review, many administrative agencies do not take the peer review process seriously. By way of example, I am attaching an oped I wrote in The Hill last year demonstrating how the Federal Communications Commission flagrantly violated the public’s due process rights by hiding until the very last moments the highlycritical results of the agency’s peer review of an outside economic study which the agency intended to be the foundational document to impose price regulation for Business Data Services. By any account, such behavior is not an example of ‘‘good’’ government. Legislation to improve the public peer review process at federal agencies is therefore both welcome and necessary. Sincerely, LAWRENCE J. S PIWAK , President, The Phoenix Center. 
next week with all five members of the Commission in attendance, where perhaps some sunlight can be used as a disinfectant. I therefore encourage the Commerce Committee members and staff—from both sides of the aisle—to do their homework, come to the hearing prepared, and call Chairman Wheeler out on the carpet. 
Mr. POSEY. As the letter states: ‘‘No presumption of scientific legitimacy can be afforded when making good public policy.’’ Unfortunately, many administrative agencies make this assumption and do not take seriously the peer review process. For that reason, I once again urge my colleagues to support this good government proposal for transparency and accountability that will help protect the integrity of the Federal rulemaking process. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. POSEY ). The amendment was agreed to.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is ordered. Is a separate vote demanded on any amendment reported from the Committee of the Whole? If not, the Chair will put them en gros. The amendments were agreed to. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. MOTION TO RECOMMIT  
Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentlewoman opposed to the bill? Mrs. DEMINGS. I am opposed to the bill in its current form. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to recommit. The Clerk read as follows: 
Mrs. Demings moves to recommit the bill H.R. 5 to the Committee on the Judiciary with instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith with the following amendment: Page 36, strike line 10 and all that follows through page 37, line 9. Page 38, strike line 11 and all that follows through page 39, line 12. Add, at the end of the bill, the following (and conform the table of contents accordingly): TITLE VII—PROTECTING ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS FOR AMERICANS OVER THE AGE OF 65 
This Act, and the amendments made by this Act, shall not apply in the case of a rule (as such term is defined in section 551 of title 5, United States Code), pertaining to the provision of health and financial security for persons ages 65 and over by significantly reducing outofpocket medication costs for prescription drugs for plans under the Medicare program under part D of title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w–101 et seq.), regardless of the person’s income, medical history, or health status. The provisions of law amended by this Act, as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of this Act, shall apply to such rules. 
Mr. MARINO (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to dispense with the reading. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Pennsylvania? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from Florida is recognized for 5 minutes in support of her motion. Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended. Mr. Speaker, throughout my 27 years of law enforcement experience, I protected and served my community, and I stand here today to protect the most vulnerable of seniors in central Florida, and seniors all around this Nation. We have a responsibility to see that seniors are not put in a position where they will have to choose between buying food or buying their medication, which was the case before the Affordable Care Act. We must resist all efforts to reopen the Medicare part D prescription drug coverage doughnut hole. This doughnut hole required seniors to pay full price for their prescription drugs after they reach their catastrophic threshold. Research found, because of this doughnut hole, seniors would put their health at risk because they could not afford to pay the prescriptions, which ultimately lead to higher healthcare costs. Because of the Affordable Care Act, this doughnut hole is being completely phased out of the Medicare part D prescription drug program by the year 2020. Since the ACA passed in 2010, closing the doughnut hole has saved our seniors more than $23.5 billion on their prescription drugs. We know this is working. Florida seniors enrolled in the program are now saving an average of $987 a year because of closing the loophole. b1830 We know what $987 means to the average senior on Medicare. We also know that if these coverage gap discounts disappeared, part D enrollees would have to pay $3,725 for the time period they are in the doughnut hole. This $3,725 represents nearly 15 percent of a Medicare enrollee’s income. With too many Floridians and seniors across the Nation struggling to make ends meet, I strongly believe that Congress can do more to make sure we do not go backwards and reopen this doughnut hole. No one should ever have to choose between food or medicine. I urge my colleagues to consider the livelihood and dignity of our most vulnerable seniors and vote for my amendment to protect access to affordable prescription drugs for older Americans. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to recommit. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Speaker, this bill’s bold reforms deliver the heart of the regulatory reform this Nation desperately needs; and I cannot overstate how desperately we need it because, after 8 years of the Obama administration’s blowout administrative state, what do we have? We have an economy that for 8 straight years has failed to produce enough good, new, fulltime jobs to sustain growth and restore dignity to the unemployed. We have 92 million Americans outside the workforce, a level not seen since the Carter years. We have nearly $2 trillion of American wealth commandeered each year to be spent as Washington bureaucrats demand, through runaway regulation—$2 trillion. This is more money than the GDP of all but eight countries in the world. We do not need a regulatory state that is that size; we need a regulatory system that is cut down to size. And lest we ever forget, we need a regulatory system that never again allows 
a runaway executive branch to do what the Obama administration did: use a pen and a phone to undertake an end run around Congress and force on the American people jobcrushing policies that their elected representatives in Congress never supported. This motion to recommit turns a blind eye to all of that. It says to the runaway administrative state: Keep on running as fast as you can; we don’t care. It says to the American people: Sit down and be quiet. Washington bureaucrats are your betters, and you need to just keep doing what they tell you to do. Well, the hardworking taxpayers have spoken and yanked the boots of unelected bureaucrats off the throats of hardworking Americans. Enough is enough. Support this bill. Reject this motion to recommit. Show the American people that they come first, not bureaucrats in Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to recommit. There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it. 
Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote. A recorded vote was ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XX, this 5 minute vote on the motion to recommit will be followed by a 5minute vote on passage of the bill, if ordered. The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were—ayes 190, noes 233, not voting 11, as follows:

ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I send to the desk a resolution and ask unanimous consent for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the title of the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. The text of the resolution is as follows: 
The resolution was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
NATIONAL HUMAN TRAFFICKING AWARENESS DAY (Mr. YOHO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, today is National Human Trafficking Awareness Day, an issue close to my heart. Human trafficking is nothing more than modernday slavery. Last Congress, the Foreign Affairs Committee shined a light on this scourge that affects millions around the world and passed into law the International Megan’s Law, which attacks child sex tourism by child sex offenders, improves international law enforcement cooperation, and improves notices of child sex offenders traveling to the U.S. We have come a long way in creating awareness, but more must be done. According to the Polaris Project, from 2007 to 2015, over 25,000 cases of human trafficking were discovered in the United States, and 7,700 of these were minors. Over 100,000 calls were made to the National Human Trafficking Resource Center hotline. We all know this is an issue that does not discriminate. It can affect everyone. In north Florida, over Christmas, a man was arrested for trafficking a woman across five county lines. This case started with him luring her to Florida over the Internet and ended when law enforcement were able to save the victim after seeing her in adult advertisements online. I want to thank all those who were involved in bringing this person to justice. On this National Human Trafficking Awareness Day, we in Congress will not look away. We will continue to fight the scourge called human trafficking. 
MORE QUESTIONS THAN ANSWERS (Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, today, we have more questions than answers about profoundly disturbing ties between the Presidentelect and shadowy Russian influences. The American people deserve full disclosure about any financial or personal interests held over this incoming administration by foreign entities and potential collusion to undermine our democracy. Why has Mr. Trump failed to oppose Russia’s forceful annexation of Crimea? Why did he pressure his party to officially withdraw a plank calling for assistance to Ukraine? Why did Mr. Trump reflexively attack our own intelligence officials when they warned of Russian interference in the election? Why is he avoiding regular intelligence briefings? Now that our intelligence community has concretely confirmed that Russia meddled in our democracy, we must demand to know if there has been any undue influence on Mr. Trump since he began his campaign. These new allegations finally shed light on his potential motives. Mr. Speaker, Congress, as a coequal branch of government, must conduct a bipartisan investigation and do it immediately. f 
SHAME SEX TRAFFICKERS (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, human trafficking victims are slaves living in fear, totally losing their identity. On this National Human Trafficking Awareness Day, it is time to publicly expose the traffickers. As a former judge in Texas, I used public punishment to keep criminals from returning to my courtroom and to discourage other criminals from committing more crimes. This form of public shaming can be successful in combating human trafficking. That is why, today, I introduced the SHAME Act. This bill will give Federal judges the ability to publish the names and photographs of both convicted human traffickers and the buyers of trafficked victims. Buyers will no longer be able to hide in plain sight under a cloak of anonymity. My hope is that the SHAME Act strikes fear in those who think about purchasing young women for sex. Perhaps the thought of having their face on a billboard will make the scoundrels think twice about participating in the modernday slave trade. It is time to shame these horrible humans out of business. And that is just the way it is. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF PAUL STEWART ‘‘STU’’ SHANER (Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in sadness to honor the life of a friend, Paul Stewart Shaner, known as ‘‘Stu’’ around Oroville. He passed away just recently, December 13, at the age of 76. A resident of Oroville, California, since age 5, Stu was a prominent member of the community known for his civic engagement and a true passion for his small town, the one I grew up in as well. While poor eyesight prevented Stu from joining the military, he went out of his way to serve in many other ways, serving veterans, serving his community, and making veterans feel treasured. He served his community in so many different ways, it is not hard to think of Stu as the main fiber of our town of Oroville. One of Stu’s life goals was to erect a memorial park for veterans in Oroville. He worked very hard to accomplish this, serving as cochair for the Veterans Memorial Park for over a decade. When you heard from Stu, you heard from him. He was going to get this done, and we were all determined to be helpful for him. He was relentless. The new park is under construction this very moment. In the words of everyone who knew Stu, he was one of the good guys who loved his family, his town, and the veterans who served his country. God bless Stu Shaner’s family. We will miss him. f 
GEORGIA CYBER INNOVATION AND TRAINING CENTER (Mr. ALLEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to applaud Governor Deal’s plan to begin construction on the Georgia Cyber Innovation and Training Center in Georgia. Cyber is the new frontier in warfare. In order to field the threats of today and tomorrow, a 21st century military is essential. Our community back home in Georgia is proving to be a major influencer and champion in the cyber arena. With the U.S. Army Cyber Command’s transition to Fort Gordon, numerous tech companies and jobs investing in our area, the creation of local cyber institutes substitutes, and now the establishment of the Georgia Cyber Innovation and Training Center, Georgia’s 12th District has the potential to become the security, technology, and innovation hub of the southeast. Because of the work that will be done here, we will be leading the charge in creating the cyber workforce and leading our Nation. The battlefields don’t look like they used to. We have got to adapt fast. I am thankful to Governor Deal for his efforts to not only create jobs, but to strengthen our national security and invest in our community. 
2016 NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY—MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (H. DOC. NO. 115–5) The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. DUNN) laid before the House the following message from the President of the United States; which was read and, together with the accompanying papers, referred to the Committee on the Judiciary, Committee on Agriculture, Committee on Armed Services, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Committee on Education and the Workforce, Committee on Financial Services, Committee on Homeland Security, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Committee on Foreign Affairs, Committee on Natural Resources, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Committee on Ways and Means, Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, and the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and ordered to be printed: To the Congress of the United States: I am pleased to transmit the 2016 National Drug Control Strategy summarizing the accomplishments of my Administration’s 21st century approach to drug policy and opportunities to continue to reduce the burden of substance use in the United States. My Administration released its first Strategy in 2010 with a commitment to use the best available science and to consult broadly to develop a balanced and comprehensive approach to drug policy that incorporates both public health and public safety approaches to address this complex problem. We set aggressive goals to reduce drug use by 2015 and though the results of our efforts are mixed, we have seen progress in reducing drug use and in cooperation both nationally and internationally. As a Nation we exceeded our goals for reducing alcohol and tobacco use among youth and for reducing the number of new HIV infections attributable to drug use. We have been less successful in reducing illicit drugs in youth and young adults as well as reducing the number of druginduced deaths and driving while drugged. We also face serious challenges including an epidemic of opioid use and overdose deaths as well as growing threats from drug trafficking organizations involved in manufacturing and distributing cocaine and synthetic drugs, including novel psychoactive substances. These threats may continue to have an impact on drug use across lifespans, particularly chronic drug use and its consequences that contribute to poor academic performance, crime, underemployment, lost productivity, and health care costs, all of which threaten families and communities. My Administration has consistently sought a broad coalition of partners to provide input into the development and enhancement of the Strategy during the past 7 years. We have invested in science to better understand the nature of addiction and inform the prevention and treatment of addiction and support services to help maintain recovery in the community. We have sought to use medical terms and nonstigmatizing language when discussing substance use disorders, and those who suffer from this disease. Our support for law enforcement has led to significant outcomes in taking down drug trafficking organizations and removing millions of pounds of drugs from the market. And our work with our international partners has been instrumental in our allies’ increasing regulation of chemical precursors to synthetic drugs and reducing their movement across the globe. Throughout my Administration, we have used the best available evidence to balance the Nation’s public health and public safety and drive collaborative efforts to create healthier, safer, and more prosperous communities. The Nation’s work in reducing drug use and its consequences is not done and there are many opportunities for advancing efforts to address ongoing and emerging challenges. I thank the Congress for its continued support of our efforts and ask that you continue to support this vital endeavor. BARACK OBAMA .THEWHITE HOUSE , January 11, 2017. 
b1900 THE PEOPLE’S NIGHT: OBAMACARE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. WALKER ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, tonight is our third time that we have hosted People’s Night. This is a time for our Members to bypass outside forces and influences and talk directly to the American people. Tonight we are presenting something that has been very important, not just a topic, but something that nearly 6 years ago—or a little over 6 years ago— right here where we stand tonight was passed in an overly bipartisan manner and has burdened the American people in what is now known as ObamaCare, the Affordable Care Act. This is a piece of legislation that has burdened small businesses and individuals alike. Now we have been asked to fix it, to repeal and to replace. Well, it takes Members to be able to have experience in this particular field to understand the heart of community. One of the people who does that most, specifically in the area of poverty initiatives, who reaches across community lines, reaches across party lines is the gentleman from Kentucky, my good friend, Representative ANDYBARRfrom Kentucky. I yield to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. BARR). Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the gentleman from North Carolina, for his leadership not only of the Republican Study Committee as the new chairman—and I welcome you as the new chairman of the Republican Study Committee—but for his leadership on issues related to the importance of repealing this disastrous law that is making life harder on the American people; and not just repealing it, but replacing it with policy ideas that put power back in the hands of patients, their families, and their doctors instead of driving up costs, forcing people to lose their healthcare plans, forcing the government to ration health care. We need a better way. I am proud to say that we are supporting not just repealing ObamaCare here tonight, but bringing to the American people some constructive, positive ideas that will make life easier for them and improve their lives through better patientcentered health care. Mr. Speaker, Kentucky was once portrayed by President Obama, a red State, as a model of the implementation of ObamaCare. Yet, every day in Kentucky, in my district in central and eastern Kentucky, I hear stories from families and small businesses and individuals who have been hurt by this disastrous law. Now, over the next few weeks, as Presidentelect Trump comes into office and as this Congress revisits the issue of healthcare reform, I expect we will hear from our friends on the other side of the aisle, arguments like ‘‘Don’t repeal ObamaCare. We have 20 million new Americans who have insurance.’’ But that statistic needs to be scrutinized because the truth of the matter is ObamaCare forced people to lose their health care. In many cases, and in Kentucky as an example, many of my constituents lost highquality, private, commercial health insurance through their workplace, and millions of Americans received cancellation notices in the mail. Their small employers told them that they were going to have to change their health plans because of this law. So not only do we see now skyrocketing costs for those who currently have health insurance, but many Americans who our friends on the other side of the aisle say now are insured or covered, these are folks who lost their health insurance before. What happened? They lost highquality, jobbased health insurance, and so they were forced into these exchanges. In Kentucky it was called Kynect. In many cases, they went to the cheapest plan available, which happened to be Medicaid. Well, my fellow Americans, access to a waiting line is not access to health care. Unfortunately, Medicaid is oftentimes access to a waiting line, and it is not access to true health care. President Obama’s promise that his healthcare law would help people has not turned out to be the case. In terms of cost, remember, this is called the Affordable Care Act, but it is anything but affordable because even though he promised that premiums would decline 
by $2,500 a year for the average family, premiums have actually increased for hardworking Americans. Premiums have increased for 11 million people, according to a report by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Millions of Americans, as I said before, lost previous coverage or had to change doctors due to this disastrous law. Take, for example, Laura in my congressional district in Kentucky. Laura is a young mother who had a baby girl, Catherine. Catherine was diagnosed with a congenital heart defect, ventricular septal defect at birth, which is basically a hole in the wall of the heart. They needed highquality pediatric cardiology to help Catherine. So they got a specialist at Boston Children’s Hospital. Of course, a long way away from Kentucky, but they wanted the best, of course, for their daughter. When ObamaCare went into effect, unfortunately they lost their jobbased health insurance that allowed them to access these specialists up in Boston for Catherine. The result was, they lost their doctor. What do you think a young mother and a young father are going to do in that situation? Guess what, they had to find a very expensive policy to cover a Boston surgeon out of network out of State, and so their costs skyrocketed. This is the kind of thing that was happening to millions of Americans as a result of ObamaCare. Look, ObamaCare obviously reduced choice and competition. There are now only three plans participating in the ObamaCare exchange in Kentucky, one of which covers a full 78 percent of the State’s individual marketplace enrollees. In many States there is only one plan on the exchange. This has left too many families with no choice but to purchase highdeductible, highpremium coverage. In Kentucky, insurance plans have been forced to raise premiums by 23 percent in 2017 alone. There is a better way, and the better way is healthcare reform that is focused on the patient, not putting bureaucrats in charge, not taking away choices, not driving up costs, not creating narrow networks for people, not forcing people out of their highquality private health insurance into governmentrun health care, but, instead, empowering patients to access more affordable private coverage. And one of the ways we can lower the cost of health care, make it more affordable for people to access highquality private health insurance, is medical malpractice reform. Frivolous lawsuits, junk lawsuits, have driven up the cost of health care in this country significantly. One of the fatal flaws of ObamaCare is that it never addressed this cost of healthcare inflation. Over the course of their careers, it is estimated that 75 percent of all physicians will face a malpractice claim. Now, to be sure, some of those cases of medical negligence are legitimate. And, of course, those plaintiffs should be able to fully recover damages for those cases of genuine actual malpractice. But for these frivolous lawsuits, that is driving up the cost of care. The fact that ObamaCare never even dealt with that issue is a fundamental flaw in the previous efforts to reform our healthcare system. So I am a proud cosponsor of the Republican Study Committee’s America Health Care Reform Act. In the American Health Care Reform Act is legislation that I introduced with Senator BARRASSO called the Saving Lives, Saving Costs Act. This doesn’t cap damages for cases of actual malpractice, but if there is a frivolous claim, if the liability climate is producing frivolous lawsuits, what we say is this: If you are a hospital or a doctor or a nurse and you practice in accordance with peer reviewed, evidencebased clinical practice guidelines, that there should be a higher standard of proof for that plaintiff to get to a jury trial. We want a safe harbor for our outstanding medical professionals who practice in accordance with the latest stateoftheart guidelines on how to take care of patients. So this does two things. Number one, it raises the standard of care. We are helping people access better, higher quality medicine in this country with this legislation; and we are cutting out frivolous lawsuits, this litigation lottery that is driving up the cost of health care for all Americans. This is the kind of reform that, if enacted, would replace ObamaCare with reforms that would actually lower the cost of health care without growing government. I applaud the efforts of the Republican Study Committee for offering real solutions that will put patients and doctors in charge again and not Washington, D.C. Mr. WALKER. I thank Representative BARR. Your compassion on this topic is certainly evident. We appreciate your comments this evening. Mr. Speaker, there are a couple of numbers I would like to share that puts it a little bit in the context of what we are dealing with here. Seventyfive percent of coops have failed. In five States, Americans are down to just one option. The great thing about our country’s history is that we have choices. We have decisions. Yet, since the takeover of this administration over health care, those choices have continued to reduce. Sometimes you may hear Congress this or Congress that. One of the neat things about Congress is the amount of people coming from diverse backgrounds. Our next speaker tonight is Representative MIKEBISHOP , former senate majority leader in his home State of Michigan, who was already working on those reforms when he came to the United States Congress. Mr. Speaker, I yield to my good friend from Michigan (Mr. BISHOP ). Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his continued leadership and for the opportunity to rise today to join him and this group in this urgent discussion regarding solutions for our Nation’s healthcare crisis. I do appreciate the opportunity to be with my colleagues tonight and the sense of urgency that I feel from this group to address a very important issue. Mr. Speaker, since the 2,700page healthcare law was enacted in 2010, when our colleague from across the aisle absurdly rose and declared that we would know what was in it as soon as we passed it, young adults, families, and seniors have been punished and their policies canceled. We have seen skyrocketing costs, poor coverage and, clearly, a lack of choices. I hear from constituents every single day who say that the law has not made health care more affordable, as President Obama promised it would. Instead, healthcare insurance premiums have skyrocketed and are slated to increase again and again and again— significantly—regardless of what Congress is able to do about the law this year. In fact, those who currently have a plan can expect an average premium increase of 73 percent, while individuals who are just joining will see a 96 percent increase in premiums. Job providers are getting smothered as well. Prior to joining Congress, I was a member of the private sector, and I can tell you firsthand that small businesses are cutting hours. They are letting go of workers. All of these things they are doing to make room for the everexpanding healthcare law. It is preventing the economy—small business, which is the backbone of our economy—from growing to its fullest potential. For all of these reasons, 8 out of every 10 Americans now favor changing ObamaCare significantly or replacing it altogether. What we do know is that doing nothing is not an option. Leaving this alone will result in further costs, further struggles by our families and small businesses, and we will see this whole healthcare law collapse upon itself. I do not believe and I don’t think my colleagues believe here today that doing nothing is an option. Last year in Michigan, deductibles went up an average of $492 across all bronze, silver, and gold plans. This year our exchange rates will jump 17 percent in the State of Michigan. Families have a budget just like everybody else and they simply cannot absorb that kind of cost increase. Complicating matters further, insurers like UnitedHealth Group are leaving the exchanges. Private practices are folding and doctors are being forced to retire because they can’t financially stay afloat. b1915 I can tell you, from a personal perspective in my own family, I have seen my doctor disappear recently this past year. Seemingly overnight, he retired 
and moved away because he could not keep up with the costs of staying in business as a private practitioner. I had a rheumatologist in my district. He is a very wellrespected man who treats many rheumatoid patients in our district. It is a very sad fact. These people count on him every single day of the week. They have been forced out of his practice because they no longer fit into the network. He is forced with compliance costs—overwhelming compliance costs. He has to hire new people to cover the compliance requirements. He doesn’t have the same reimbursement rates. After all is said and done, a private practitioner, a specialist like this, can no longer stay in business; and families like ours, people like you and like me, can no longer continue to have that relationship, that doctorpatient relationship, that very personal relationship that we have had for years. These are real people, doctors, but also families and small businesses in our local communities that are struggling to stay financially afloat. The end result is we are losing good doctors because of the failures of ObamaCare. Mr. Speaker, when a law has unintended consequences, Congress has an obligation to step up and make things right. In 2017, this will require a collaborative, bipartisan approach to address the issue. This is about finding a painfree way to move forward with health care in our Nation to ensure our neighbors and our families don’t have to struggle to make ends meet because of failed law. We must act, Mr. Speaker. I want to thank Chairman WALKER for his continued support and his continued leadership on this important issue. Mr. WALKER. I thank Representative BISHOP of Michigan. One of the numbers my friend just mentioned was 8 out of 10. Nearly 80 percent, according to Gallup, believe this law should be overhauled or completely repealed. So I ask people watching tonight and my friends across the aisle: Are we to do nothing? In fact, even in the press conference today, Presidentelect Trump said that, if we did nothing, it would continue to fail. But we have an obligation to stand up and do what is right. We can’t do nothing. People are suffering—in fact, suffering to the place that even recently a couple months ago a Minnesota Governor was honest enough to talk about how it has damaged small business. Goodness gracious, even a former Democratic President has acknowledged the destruction it has caused for individuals and small businesses. No one knows more about what it does to our States than individual Representatives. One of the fine gentlemen that is speaking tonight is Representative FRENCH HILL. He is one of the sharper minds that we have had as part of the 114th class that I have been privileged to meet and serve with for the last 2 years. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. HILL). Mr. HILL. I thank the chairman for yielding and for his leadership to set aside for us to visit with the American people and talk about empowering patients, not politicians. For 6 years, we have witnessed the failed rollout of the ObamaCare program. We didn’t get to keep our plan that we liked, and we didn’t get to keep our doctor that we had such a good relationship with. We have seen physicians leave the business. We have spent billions on duplicative, unnecessary exchanges that are now failing across this country. So I commend the Republican Study Committee, and I am proud to be a part of this group to talk about how to bring relief to the American people on the failed ObamaCare law. I still hear from constituents—even now, 6 years later, from this rolling evolution of ObamaCare—who have seen their coverage lost and their increases in healthcare costs skyrocket. This healthcare regulatory burden that we are talking about tonight has led to droves of parttime jobs instead of full time jobs and unaffordable group plans for the people who were in a good small business group plan. This regulatory burden is on top of what has been a 6 year to 8year crushing burden on business from many different agencies from the EPA and beyond. One constituent wrote my office after he was forced to accept an insurance plan to meet the affordable healthcare law that cost him $1,300 a month, Mr. Speaker, and he still has to meet two $2,500 deductibles before the insurance coverage kicks in. Now, that is $20,600 a year. Mr. Speaker, I was a small businessman before I joined Congress, and we had employees that made $20,600 a year in our small business. So what is left for the family budget when you are going to spend $20,000 for health care? That is typical now after the rollout of ObamaCare for a family of four. This is in a place in our country where healthcare costs $20 or $30,000 a year in outofpocket expenses? Obviously, this system is broken. Now, in Arkansas, unlike much of the country where people are definitely seeing large, doubledigit, or, in some cases, larger increases in the ObamaCare premium, Arkansans, on the exchanges, are seeing lower than those average increases. In my view, this is largely because our Governor and our State legislature are working hard to make the best out of a bad situation and fighting to pursue innovative measures that work best for our small State. The Arkansas Works program has helped to prevent skyrocketing premiums on the exchanges, and the State is still subject, though, to duplicative reviews by Federal and State agencies and costly and burdensome regulations that have nothing to do with trying to lower the cost of health care for Arkansans. This week, Governor Hutchinson wrote the House leadership decrying the individual and employer mandates and stressing the need for healthcare reform that provides our States more flexibility—more flexibility, Mr. Speaker—to design programs that fit the needs of people in our State while increasing predictability and affordability. Some of the points Governor Hutchinson made in his letter to our leadership include calling for States having the option of receiving Medicaid funds through a block grant enabling them to tailor the program in the Medicaid population under health care in what fits Arkansas, what Arkansans can afford. In fact, that is our Better Way approach, Mr. Speaker, for the Medicaid population. He calls for the elimination of the Federal health insurance exchanges. We had exchanges before ObamaCare that can be operated by States in the private sector without Federal interference. Governor Hutchinson called for restricting the duplicative reviews of rate and plan filings by CMS. They are already being done by our individual State insurance regulators. Of course, the thing that drives up costs not only for the Medicaid population, for people on the ObamaCare exchanges, and for people out in the group health plans is the essential health benefits requirement. Governor Hutchinson says that this has driven up costs for everybody, for government, for families, and that elimination of these requirements would provide flexible options for insurance providers to offer cheaper plans to younger and healthier individuals. That is key to choice, Mr. Speaker. In some counties, Arkansans now only have one insurance option. I don’t think one option is an option. There is no choice. This monopoly or oligopoly pricing combined with the mandates are demonstrating the unaffordability of the Affordable Care Act. With the recent election, we now have a unique opportunity to recognize these flaws of this onesizefitsall, Big Governmentmandated, topdown approach to health care, reverse course, and, again, bring relief to the American people of this failed law put forth by the Obama administration. Chairman WALKER and the Republican Study Committee have put together a comprehensive plan to repeal ObamaCare and replace this failed law with conservative principles. Mr. Speaker, Americans want change. We are asking that we design those changes with patients in mind and that we, in fact, in this group—Mr. WALKER , I know you agree—we will read the bill before we pass it. So the RSC proposal and the Better Way framework outlined by Speaker RYANare going to bring relief, change, and opportunity that fit with the principles that have guided the Republican Party and the Republican outlook, the Republican Study Committee, which is 
we will bring competition and we will bring efforts to lower prices and increase access for the American people. With that, Mr. WALKER , I commend you again. Mr. WALKER. If you listened closely there, Representative HILL talked about some of the premiums increasing. If you think back 6, 7, even 8 years ago, even part of the original campaign talking about the Affordable Care Act, this ObamaCare, we think about three promises—we have all heard them—you can keep your doctor, you can keep your healthcare plan, and premiums are going down. Specifically one that stands out more was the premiums going down $2,500. My Democratic friends want to ignore some of those numbers, but here are the facts: In 2014, premiums increased across the board 37 percent; 2015, again, last year, 25 percent. In fact, in some States, it is out of sight. In my home State of North Carolina, it is 40 percent. But in some places, in Arizona, it is as high as 116 percent. So the process of working to put this together, the RSC plan and the repeal and replace, who better than to have people that have experience in this? There is maybe nobody better in the House who has the insurance background than our friend, Representative AUSTIN SCOTT from Georgia’s Eighth District. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT). Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, there is something I very much want to speak on. I rise today on behalf of my many constituents back in Georgia’s Eighth Congressional District who have been negatively impacted by ObamaCare. It is pretty clear to the vast majority of us that the attempt to fix our Nation’s healthcare problems by inserting more Federal control into the system has simply failed. There are some counties in the district that I represent in middle and south Georgia that are down to just one—maybe two—insurance providers that people can choose from. That is not competition, and that is not affordable. It is not even a choice really, and it is certainly not ‘‘if you like your plan you can keep it.’’ My colleagues and I on the Republican Study Committee have worked for a couple of years, and we have offered a plan to repeal ObamaCare and replace it with patientcentered reforms and freemarket solutions for American citizens. The American Healthcare Reform Act is not just about repealing ObamaCare. It is about fixing problems that existed in the healthcare system before ObamaCare and problems that, quite honestly, were made worse by ObamaCare. There is a lot of talk about what is in the bill that is a problem. I would like to talk just a second today about what is not in the bill that is a problem. Mr. Speaker, the President, by leaving the health insurance industry exempt from the antitrust laws of the country, created a bigger problem than we had prior to the healthcare bill going in place. That’s right. I want you to hear what I said. Under ObamaCare, health insurance providers are exempt from the antitrust laws. These are the very laws that are designed to promote competition for the benefit of the consumer. How is it that ObamaCare can mandate that Americans purchase a product from an industry that that very bill left exempt from playing by the rules? Why did the President and the Democratic leaders leave the health insurance industry exempt from the antitrust laws in the bill? I have asked these questions over and over. It is baffling to me. It means the big boys can play and the little man has to pay. I wish somebody from the press would ask that question. I don’t understand why the press doesn’t ask the Democratic Party: Why did you leave the health insurance industry exempt from the antitrust laws of the country? It is a question the President should answer. The American Healthcare Reform Act reverses that. Our legislation injects muchneeded competition into the health insurance marketplace by eliminating the antitrust exemptions for the insurance providers. By applying the antitrust laws to the insurance industry, we are making the market more competitive which, in turn, will drive down premium cost, increase choice, and does so without adding any new taxes. I hope the American Healthcare Reform Act will serve as the baseline for discussions on how to repeal and replace ObamaCare, bring about debate on how to lower healthcare costs, and allow for input from both sides of the aisle, which is something ObamaCare did not do. Along the way, Mr. Chairman and Mr. Speaker, I sure do wish the press would ask the President and the Democratic leadership: How could you do that to the American citizens? Mr. WALKER. Representative SCOTT, well articulated. I appreciate your heart on this. Looking at this and tackling this project because of the 2,600 pages of complexities, I guess we don’t need to reiterate it, but how the minority leader said that we needed to pass this law to be able to figure out what is in it. b1930 Obviously, it is more than just a running joke. With the people in the background, what does it take to kind of wrap our minds around it and to wrap our arms around it so as to find our way back? It takes people with medical experience, and it takes people with budget experience. This is going to be huge. One of the Members we have here with us tonight is the vice chair of the Committee on the Budget, someone who has great concern about the damage that this has caused to the fine folks of Indiana, whom he represents. It is my privilege to yield to the Representative from Indiana, TODD ROKITA . Mr. ROKITA. I thank Chairman WALKER for organizing the time tonight, and I congratulate the gentleman on leading this organization. I look forward to working with him. Mr. Speaker, we could all stand up here and take the barbs that have been leveled by some as to how we don’t care about people or how we are this or that or how we are just focused on the numbers. Nothing could be further from the truth. We could sit idly by and watch this terrible, insidious law continue to implode, to continue to hurt more and more Americans—insidious because it is built on lies, like you can keep your doctor if you want to, like you can keep your health plan if you want to—not true in any case. Instead, we are here tonight, talking with the American people about ‘‘what could be’’ when we first get rid of this terrible law—something that many of us have voted on 60 times or more to do. We now have a real opportunity with not only a Republican House, but a Republican Senate, and with a President who is willing to work with us. The verdict is in. In Indiana alone and in my district, I have met person after person who has horror stories about the failure of ObamaCare. I spoke with Anna, whose husband, Jack, survived stage IV cancer. With Jack’s cancer only having a 30 percent survival rate, it is crucial that he has effective doctors who know how to treat and how to work the problem. Instead, Anna’s doctor quit practicing medicine—well before his planned retirement age—due to the burdensome costs of ObamaCare, which is something that the gentleman from Georgia also mentioned. It is not just doctors who are unable to perform their duties—their profession—under this insidious law, but also insurance companies that are withdrawing from the market as we speak. Last year alone, we saw Indiana’s exchange lose 50 percent of its health insurance carriers due to regulations of ObamaCare. This included IU Health, which covered almost 30,000 Hoosiers. This lack of options means that healthy Hoosiers are being forced to pay for coverage that they don’t want, that they don’t need, and that, in fact, may do more harm than good. I spoke with Mark from Tippecanoe County, in my district, who talked about the harmful impact of ObamaCare. He stated that he was forced to buy insurance with only four doctors listed as providers for the entire county. What good does this insurance do Mark or the rest of us if he can’t even use it and schedule an appointment? I am very proud to have worked on this Republican Study Committee with the Health Care Task Force, led by my good friend, Dr. PHILROEof Tennessee. Over a period of a year or so, we have 
put together a plan that is a very real, patientcentered, consumerfocused, free marketdriven replacement for ObamaCare, but with one big difference—our plan would work because it harnesses the value that we all have innately as Americans and, really, as humans, which is the ability to value price once we have the information. If I left this Chamber and, God forbid, I broke my leg on my way down the steps, I wouldn’t worry too much about where I was going—just to the nearest emergency room. But that is not most of our healthcare transactions; that is not most of our healthcare decisions. Most of our healthcare decisions can be made by attaching value to the services and products that we want. We do it in every other part of our consumer driven life. Why can’t we finally do it with health care? That is what people like Dr. PHILROEhave practiced in medicine their entire lives. That is what he has taught me. That is what we know as American consumers. Why can’t we be trusted to do that with our health care? Whether the intent is malicious, whether the intent is malign, the intent of the people who support ObamaCare—that insidious law—is wrong. It says: just give your life over to these few people, and let them run it for a while, and everything will be fine. Unfortunately, throughout not only American history, every time it has been tried here and every time it has been tried in world history, it has failed. Control over the individual has failed, and it will do the same, as we are seeing every day now, with regard to our health care. Let’s repeal this insidious law, and let’s get back on the track of replacing it with something that we all can trust, beginning with ourselves. I thank the chairman for his leadership. Mr. WALKER. I thank Representative ROKITA . Mr. Speaker, as I was sitting here, I just received a text from a volunteer fire department official right outside of Charlotte, North Carolina. He writes that they were watching the proceedings this evening: 
I just want to let you know that even my drug prescription has gone up $200 out of pocket per person. 
He has three daughters in his family. Think about this. This is reallife stuff. That is why we are stepping in. Part of our plan in the repeal and replacement—the American Health Care Reform Act—allows you to have immediate access to your health savings account. You would not have to worry about somebody’s needing a prescription or somebody’s needing medicine— one of the children—and, every time, it is $200 out of pocket. That is why it is important to move—and to move with diligence. Someone who knows a little bit about the healthcare industry is my friend Dr. BRIAN BABIN of Texas, who has been dealing with this in his own dentist’s practice. He is a former veteran and is someone who cares about his district but who cares about all Americans. It is my privilege to yield to my friend from the great State of Texas, the Lone Star State, Dr. BRIAN BABIN. Mr. BABIN. I thank the gentleman from North Carolina, my good friend and RSC chairman, MARKWALKER , for this Special Order opportunity tonight. Mr. Speaker, Americans are hurting right now with their health care. ObamaCare supporters are quick to point out some Americans who have actually been helped by ObamaCare. After spending over $1 trillion of borrowed money, I would certainly hope that there are at least some people who have been helped by this terrible law that was forced on us over 6 years ago by the Democrats and without one single Republican vote. Thousands of my constituents are demanding to be rescued from ObamaCare. They have shared their individual stories with me about how it has hurt them—higher premiums, excessive deductibles—how it has disrupted cancer treatments, forced them to change doctors, and how it has even cost many their jobs. Here is what real people are saying— my constituents. This is what they are telling me: A young couple with three children, living in Tyler County, Texas, shared how their premiums have gone up year after year. They began with a $900 monthly premium and with a $2,500 deductible. The very next year, the premium went to $1,100, and the deductible went up to $5,000. Then, in 2015, they were forced from a PPO into an HMO at $1,000 a month with a $6,600 deductible. These are individual deductibles. That is $33,000, plus the $12,000peryear premium. That is an extraordinary burden on a young family. This family tells me about their problem every time they see me, and they see me a lot because this is my daughter and my soninlaw and my three grandchildren. Gale in Deer Park, Texas, and Alisa from Crosby, Texas, wrote to tell me how their ObamaCare mandates have forced their employers to cut their work hours. They are losing hundreds of dollars in income each and every month. This 30hour mandate means that this college student has lost out on hundreds of dollars in pay that she could have earned over the recent Christmas break. Tim in Baytown, along with several others, wrote to share with me that it cost him his job. Paul from Harris County and Frank in Jasper shared how they have been significantly experiencing higher costs and a decrease in coverage. Roy in Pasadena says that his deductible is now over $12,000. Ben and Carol, like thousands of others in southeast Texas, have had their healthcare plans canceled. This calamitous unaffordability and poor coverage have inundated folks everywhere, like Linda in Vidor, who have to choose between their medications and food; like folks in El Lago— David and Sheryl—and Brian in Houston. It continues to tragically affect folks every single day. Sharell from Jasper County has faced a doubling of her premiums, and Carol in Baytown shared how she has seen substantial increases in her premiums and her deductibles. Retirees who have worked their entire lives, like Jack from Orange and Glenda from Hardin County, wrote to tell me how they are finding it difficult to afford their healthcare costs. Let’s not forget that ObamaCare cut hundreds of billions of dollars and services from Medicare, hurting the elderly. Many who are sick have reached out to me, such as Randal of Harris County, who had their medical treatments disrupted by ObamaCare. I hear all the time the firsthand accounts of hardworking folks who are at their wits’ end under this monstrosity. I am voting to repeal ObamaCare in order to provide relief to Brian, Brad, LaLa, Gale, Alisa, Abby, Tim, Paul, Frank, Roy, Linda, David, Sheryl, Brian, Sharell, Carol, Jack, Glenda, Randal, and the tens of thousands more Texans just like them. Perhaps Paul in Deer Park sums it up the best: 
It made it worse for me. It increased the costs, and it decreased my coverage. 
That is the story I have heard for 6 long years, and it is why this failed program must be repealed and replaced with a plan that restores healthcare freedom to all Americans—health plans that are affordable and that meet their families’ needs—a plan that they choose, not the Federal Government. Americans need relief now. Mr. WALKER. I thank Dr. BABIN. I appreciate that spirited, heartfelt talk. In my previous vocation, we would usually call for an invitation at about this time. Mr. Speaker, this is not just a problem in red States; this is a problem in blue States, like it is with my good friend from the First District of California, Representative DOUGLAMALFA , to whom I yield as he shares a little bit of his heart when it comes to ObamaCare and the repeal. Mr. LAMALFA. I really want to thank Chairman WALKER of the RSC, the Republican Study Committee. I greatly appreciate the gentleman’s leadership on this event here tonight as well as the great job the gentleman is doing on the Committee. Mr. Speaker, we have had alternatives to the Affordable Care Act ever since I have been here. The American Health Care Reform Act, as put forward by the Republican Study Committee, has many of the elements we have all been talking about for several years: with the Affordable Care Act being forced upon Americans not in a bipartisan effort but strictly by the votes of one party when they had the majority—the ability—to force it 
through. We are suffering the effects of that now. One of my colleagues earlier was talking about: Why isn’t this being reported? Why isn’t this being talked about in the broad sense of how it is really affecting the Americans who are paying for it? People in my district, ever since I have been a Member of this House, have been pleading with us to do something about these high premiums, about the high deductibles, about the lack of access they have, especially in rural areas. Why are the proponents continuing to prop this up? It is clear that it doesn’t work: higher costs, fewer options, unworkable plans. The exchanges—we have watched in several States—most of them, after billions in investment, are shuttering; they are closing up shop. Where do those billions go that we have invested as a country into these exchanges? b1945 But on a patient level, it is putting even more of our most vulnerable patients on a system already known to be unsustainable without even ensuring access to quality care. In some cases, no care at all. How are people defining that as a success? We know that the main reason why so many people are uninsured is the high cost of coverage. But instead of investing vast amounts of money to bring more people into a broken system, let’s take this opportunity to start fixing the root of the problem. One, this is done by increasing competition, giving patients more options, choices. Mr. Speaker, give them a menu of options they can pick themselves, tailor the plan to what they need. A 20yearold young man has a completely different need than a 30 yearold mom and her family. Let them have the choices. Also, let’s get rid of the costly mandates, the taxes. There are taxes on everything, it seems, to help prop up ObamaCare, the Affordable Care Act, including the cost for students for college. They are paying for some of that. Then let’s build off successes that we have seen in the past and that are part of the proposal of the Republican Study Committee and the American Healthcare Reform Act. That could help fill our gaps in the healthcare delivery system. Community health centers, for example, is a model that is both cost effective and efficient in expanding access to care services in underserved areas, very rural ones, such as my own district at home. Healthcare reform affects the lives of every single person in this country, which is why it is high time that we put the health and wellbeing of the American people ahead of partisan politics and legacies. Let’s get to work and deliver actual solutions that empower patients, drive down the costs, and increase access to care in every part of the country. Let’s give back to Americans: ‘‘Keep your plan that you like, keep your doctor that you like.’’ So it is time to stop the partisan squabbling over it and the deception that has gone on for what is indeed for some a bad legacy of the American people. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. YOHO), our resident veterinarian in the House. Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. WALKER ) for hosting this Special Order. The American people have spoken, and it is time. The ACA, the Affordable Care Act—which it is not, and we know that. I want to take you back, a little history here. Back prior to 2009, before the Affordable Care Act came out, 85 percent of the people in America had health insurance either through their employer or on their own. Fifteen percent did not have health insurance. Yet, Congress, in their infinite wisdom, instead of fixing it for the 15 percent and getting them into the pool of people that had health insurance, said: No; we are going to change it. We are going to change it and disrupt the whole healthcare market and 20 percent of our economy. This is the epitome of legislative malpractice. This Congress was controlled by one party, the Democratic Party, through the House, the Senate, and the executive branch. They passed a 2,900page bill at the end of the year that nobody read. You can’t do that in any other business without going to jail. President Obama sold us a bill of goods on a lie. If you want to keep your doctor or your insurance, you can and your price will go down $2,500. Let me share three reallife stories. One was a 54yearold man that came into our office, single, making a six figure income, could afford insurance. He was going through the exchange. He changed his plan and wanted to pay for it right then. They said: Don’t worry about it, we will send you a bill. They never sent him a bill, and his insurance got canceled. He could not buy insurance because it was through the exchange and the signup period had expired. He got fined whatever the fine was. He got fined trying to do the right thing. Another one is a friend of mine who owns a restaurant franchise. He has 500 employees. He says: I can’t afford to pay for the health insurance. So he moved people from working 32 or 40 hours a week down to 26 hours. I could tell you a real personal story about a couple I know real well. They came to Congress. Their policy got canceled. Their premiums went up by over $11,000. Their deductibles went up and their coverage went down. I know that couple real well because it is my wife and myself. The American people have spoken and given us the majority for a reason, and that is to fix health care and allow the best healthcare providers, the best medicine, the best research and the institutions in America to provide that for all Americans and deliver that care to all Americans. The Republican Congress has a better way, and it starts with putting health care back into the hands of the physicians to the patients. It has a better way increasing access, the cure, the quality at a lower cost with a stable transition so no one is left out. And it starts with the repeal of ObamaCare. I appreciate Chairman WALKER doing this. This is a message we are going to drive home and home and home. We are going to fix this, and the American people will be better off and our economy will be better off. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, we talk about numbers. Twentyfive percent of all Americans have been damaged at some point under this Affordable Care Act. We cannot look the other way. One gentleman who doesn’t look the other way but stands up and speaks the truth is Representative PETEOLSON . I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. OLSON ). Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, my friend knows the American people spoke on November 8th. They gave our party control of the entire Congress and the White House because of the jobkilling, promisebreaking law known as ObamaCare. This was a repeal mission for almost 7 years, but now it has become a rescue mission. It is to rescue Americans like Andrea from my home in Texas in the 22nd Congressional District. She wrote me this letter last week: ‘‘I’m a 42 yearold legally blind single parent in Sugar Land, selfemployed working very hard to rear two great kids ages 15 and 13. I have a master’s degree in education and work extremely hard to provide a stable, comfortable life for the kids. In doing so, I have invested time and money into my own healthcare because the kids need me to be healthy. ‘‘I lost my right eye a few years ago to complications from ROP (too much oxygen at birth) and my left eye is severely impaired with potential for complications that would need immediate specialized care. ‘‘I have different specialist doctors for different issues related to each eye. Additionally, I am a kidney cancer survivor (RCC) which also requires specialist followup. For those reasons, and others, I’ve spent time and effort getting drivers to take me to specialists to develop rapport, trust, and history with specific physicians. ‘‘They are the best doctors in their respected fields, and my trust in them is important with this type of care. ‘‘I don’t have the PPO option now for my healthcare in 2016 through the ACA. The HMO’s and EPO’s being offered are not being accepted by my doctors. ‘‘ . . . among the needs of many others in similar situations as my own, 
my remaining eyesight and renal function should never be less important than anything in politics. And while I know that there are many, many people in this same boat, for today, while I write this letter, it’s about my kids getting to keep their mom and about me keeping the ability to see them grow up. ‘‘I write because it needs to be said and needs to be heard and needs to be ACTED on. ‘‘ . . . in the past I’ve paid a lot and had my share of insurance issues, but at least I could choose my own doctor. At least in crisis (which I’ve had) I went straight to the doctor who knew me and my history and they could resolve it without a referral and delay after delay after delay. ‘‘HMO might work for some, but not for those who don’t want one. ‘‘I’m not asking for a handout. I am asking for reasonable choice of a basic PPO for which I have paid for in past and am asking to have the option to pay for now. I’m not writing just to vent—I’m asking for some kind of solution to this train wreck of healthcare options or lack thereof. ‘‘If President Obama thinks this is actually working, he’s more blind than me.’’ Andrea, we have a plan to help you up. It is called A Better Way. How about this: Allow coverage across state lines, expand opportunities for pooling, make coverage portable, Medicare laws reformed, and preexisting condition protections. That is a better way. That is what the American people deserve. We will keep fighting for Andrea and people like her. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, who better to close out our Special Order than a gentleman, a doctor who has employed hundreds of people and has worked with thousands of patients? You may have heard the false narrative that, yes, we have contributed in breaking the program, from the Democrat’s perspective, and you guys need to fix it, but you don’t have a plan. Well, that is a false narrative and here to tell you why is Dr. PHILROE. I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE). Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I stand here in the well of the House tonight remembering 8 years ago when I stood here. I am the only one, other than PETEOLSON , that was here that has spoken tonight. I actually left my medical practice of 31 years. I have been a physician—it is hard to believe—46 years. I ran for Congress because I wanted to be involved in the healthcare debate. I realize that the American people needed healthcare reform. One of the most disappointing things I have had since I have been in the U.S. Congress was, when I showed up here, I naively thought that people cared what I thought. I found out I was wrong about that. We had nine physicians in the Doctors Caucus on the Republican side in 2009, and not one of us was asked one thing about that healthcare bill. Not one Republican amendment to that bill that would have made it better was ruled in order. So it was passed on oneparty rule, and now the Democrat party owns it. Unfortunately, patients own it. And that is what I came here to do, was to try to help people. I had spent 31 years of my life in the small town of Johnson City, Tennessee, practicing medicine and trying to do a good job for patients that I saw every single day. You have heard it many times before: If you liked your doctor, you can keep it. We are going to reduce your premiums by $2,500. The President also said that I will go over this bill line by line with anyone who wants to. We asked to do that on multiple occasions, and I am still waiting for my cell phone to ring. So we have heard over and over and over again that the Republicans have no ideas. Two Congresses ago we were challenged and asked to write a Republican alternative to the Affordable Care Act, and we did just that. I want to show you out there tonight—those of you who are watching— this is the bill right here. It is a 184 page bill. You can read it in an hour or so or less than that. I read the entire Affordable Care Act. I felt like I should. I didn’t pass it and see what was in it. I actually read it ahead of time. We had healthcare reform in Tennessee in the nineties called TennCare. I wrote the epitaph on this bill with MARSHA BLACKBURN in 2010, if anyone is interested in reading that. So what did we do with this bill? With the Affordable Care Act, the Federal Government said: You will purchase 10 essential health benefits or your insurance is no good. You have to get rid of it. And this 10 essential health benefits cost, in many cases, is a lot of money. Then what do we do? We passed a tax, a mandate, a fine, a penalty, whatever Judge Roberts decided he wanted to decide that it was, or define it, I should say. But here we are passing a mandate for people to purchase something they can’t afford. I find that astonishing that you tax people for something they cannot buy. So what our bill did was repeal the Affordable Care Act. It then massively expanded health savings accounts. Look, there are Indian tribes out there that use the Indian Health Service that can’t have an HSA. There are disabled veterans that can’t have an HSA. There are retired people that can’t have HSAs. We expanded that. I have used them in my own practice for patients. I use one myself. We used highrisk pools, and we expanded ERISA benefits to help offset preexisting conditions. Quite frankly, I think in two paragraphs I could have done twothirds of what the Affordable Care Act did, which is expand Medicaid, which is a system that needs to be reformed, and allowed 26yearolds to stay on their parents healthcare plan. b2000 We also allow you to buy across State lines with association health plans, malpractice reforms, and transparency. It is a very simple, patient centered bill. We have said this before, our bill is open for amendment. If a Democrat has a good idea, I am open to listen to it. The main thing is I want patients and doctors to be in charge of their healthcare decisions. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to be here tonight, and I look forward to going into much more detail about the details of this particular bill. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, the bottom line to the American people is this: it is time to return healthcare choices to the American people. God bless and good night. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. f 
PRESIDENT OBAMA’S LEGACY The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. FITZPATRICK ). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. FRANKS ) for 30 minutes. Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, one of the most important elements of this Republic is the ability of the people to understand and to remember the public actions and record of those they elect. This is vital to government accountability, to historical accuracy, and to the future direction of the future generations of this country. So, Mr. Speaker, what follows is the record and legacy of President Barack Obama. Last night, Mr. Speaker, President Barack Obama gave his farewell address to the Nation. In his speech, President Obama praised American exceptionalism for the very first time since his Presidency began. Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, much of the remainder of the President’s speech was far removed from reality. Mr. Obama implied that his Presidency had increased trust and respect for America. Yet, the truth is that under Mr. Obama’s Presidency, the trust and respect that both friend and foe alike previously had for America has been demonstrably diminished across the world. Mr. Obama, in fact, weakened our economy and led the most anemic military campaign in our history. So, Mr. Speaker, let us now recall the grand promise of candidate Barack Obama, bedecked with Greek columns and the rhetoric of bipartisan unity as it was, and let’s compare it to the actual legacy of President Barack Obama, the partisan heckler at home and the lead from behind, apologize for America, academic abroad who was evermore eager to force Catholic nuns to buy birth control than he was to fight the ruthless butchers of the Islamic State. 
Mr. Speaker, President Barack Obama has taken credit for a growing economy, but, after his failed stimulus, his was the worst economic recovery in the history of America. And his Presidency will be the first in modern times whose 8 years in office will fail to include even 1 year of 3 percent economic growth. Under Barack Obama’s Presidency, the number of longterm unemployed eclipsed 15 million for the very first time in history. Today, 95 million Americans, the highest number in history, are now not in the workforce in America. And according to the latest numbers from the Census Bureau, household income fell by more than $2,100 in inflationadjusted terms; and 45.3 million Americans, the highest number in history, now live in poverty. More than 43 million Americans were receiving food stamps under Barack Obama, the highest number in history. Barack Obama singlehandedly added almost as much deficit to the national debt as all of the other Presidents in the 240year history of the United States of America combined. And Standard & Poor’s downgraded the U.S. Government from its AAA credit rating for the very first time in history. Mr. Obama’s signature policy achieved what was called the Affordable Care Act. As we have learned year after year, essentially nothing Mr. Obama said about the Affordable Care Act was true. ObamaCare contained over $1 trillion in new taxes, which was the largest tax increase in history. Yet, millions remain uninsured. Healthcare costs have never been higher, and the entire debacle called ObamaCare is now catastrophically collapsing before our very eyes. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Obama engineered the sequester on the military which had devastating consequences on our men and women in uniform and our ability to fight and win wars when necessary. Mr. Obama’s was the opposite of a commitment to peace through strength. When it came to justice at home, Barack Obama told us that adult male transvestites had the moral right and the legal right to go into the bathroom with little schoolgirls whether their parents liked it or not. He fundamentally sought to abrogate religious freedom in America. He weaponized the Internal Revenue Service, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Attorney General’s Office, and the Justice Department against America’s own citizens. It was and is the epitome of tyranny. Mr. Obama unconstitutionally ignored and selectively applied America’s immigration laws and illegally suspended immigration enforcement. He released 19,723 criminal illegal immigrants from prison into every State of the Union. These nearly 20,000 criminal illegal aliens were collectively convicted of over 60,000 crimes, including over 12,000 drunk driving convictions, and over 8,000 violent crimes such as assault, rape, and murder. Mr. Obama’s actions endangered Americans and denied justice to the victims of their crimes. Mr. Obama bears a share of the responsibility for every crime that these criminals have committed or will commit against Americans since he released them from prison into American society. But, Mr. Speaker, perhaps Mr. Obama’s most egregious broken promise to all Americans is when he said: ‘‘I, Barack Hussein Obama, do solemnly swear that I will execute the Office of President of the United States faithfully, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.’’ Since then, he has shown complete and open contempt for the Constitution. Barack Obama blatantly stoked racial tensions in America, and, in the process, he painted a deadly target on the backs of the noble men and women in blue who risk their lives every day to protect the innocent citizens of this Nation. Barack Obama consistently subjected Americans to condescending lectures. If we opposed ObamaCare, we didn’t want people to have health insurance. If we opposed wasteful stimulus spending, we hated schoolteachers and firemen. If we opposed the nuclear deal with Iran, we were compared to terrorist sponsoring Iranian mullahs. If we believe in God and exercised our Second Amendment right, we were bitter. If we didn’t believe in open, unsecured borders and vetting those who came into this country, we were un American. If we believed in protecting unborn baby girls from being killed simply because they are little girls, we were waging war on women. And Mr. Obama was also fond of using politically correct euphemisms and constantly using them to distort nearly every issue. Evacuation of our Embassy in Yemen was ‘‘a reduction in staff.’’ Terror attacks are ‘‘mancaused disasters.’’ The global war on terror is an ‘‘overseas contingency operation.’’ An Islamic terrorist murdering 13 American soldiers is ‘‘workplace violence.’’ Terrorists beheading children, crucifying women, and burning men alive in the name of Islam are ‘‘individuals from various religions’’ who practice ‘‘hateful ideologies.’’ Veterans, prolife groups, and States’ rights advocates were listed as ‘‘at risk’’ to become domestic terrorists. Mr. Speaker, from day one, Barack Obama considered the cold war a giant misunderstanding. He did his famous reset with Russia and then turned and caved into everything that they wanted. Mr. Obama’s policies of weakness and appeasement yielded Crimea, the South China Sea, the rise of the Islamic State, the return of Iran, and the unspeakable desecration of thousands upon thousands of innocent people in Aleppo where the result to date is now where 4 million refugees and 400,000 people are dead. And during the so called Arab Spring, the Obama administration sided with the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt. At the end of the Obama administration, the only countries in the world that we have better relations with are Iran and Cuba—and even that has been entirely on their terms. Mr. Speaker, the average number of innocents killed by terrorists before the Obama Presidency was approximately 3,000 per year in the world. Now, under Barack Obama, it is probably 30,000 every year. Mr. Obama labeled the Islamic State a junior varsity team, and then stood by with a golf club in his hand while ISIS raped, butchered, and beheaded its way across Iraq, selling little, 6yearold girls into slavery, burning people alive, and perpetrating a genocide against Christians and Yazidis. The Islamic State now keeps an estimated 3,000 girls and women in sexual slavery while Mr. Obama runs out the clock on his term of office and hands the fight against ISIS off to the next President. Because of his delusional negotiation and acquiescence, the Islamic Republic of Iran, the number one sponsor of terrorism in this world, may place the finger of jihad on the launch button of an entire nuclear arsenal; and America’s children and future generations may thereafter be forced to live their lives in the shadow of nuclear terrorism. Mr. Obama stood before a group of thousands of supporters of Israel and proclaimed: ‘‘When the chips are down, I have Israel’s back.’’ But then as President, he blatantly refused even to acknowledge Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and consistently expressed more open rebuke toward Israel than he did toward Iran for building an entire nuclear effort to some day threaten the world. I am going to say that again, Mr. Speaker. As President, Mr. Obama blatantly refused to even acknowledge Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. And he consistently expressed more open rebuke toward Israel for building houses in its capital city than he expressed for Iran’s efforts to build nuclear weapons with which to existentially threaten Israel along with the peace and security of the entire human family. In the political safety of his lameduck, he orchestrated and failed to veto a resolution that undermines Israel’s very right to exist. Mr. Speaker, it was a cowardly act of political treachery that disgraced the United States, and it will send Barack Obama’s name down the corridor of history as on overt traitor to the State of Israel. When the Security Council Quartet meets on January 15 and the full United Nations Security Council meets 
on January 17, I am gravely concerned that Barack Obama will overturn U.S. precedent going back to Lyndon Johnson and use the opportunity to stab Israel in the back one final time by allowing the antiSemites at the U.N. to attempt to redraw the map of Israel to indefensible pre1967 borders, which would leave the only Jewish state less than 9 miles wide. Mr. Speaker, no government leader has any greater responsibility than that of protecting the innocent. Yet, Mr. Obama stood by and allowed not only ISIS, Boko Haram, Russia, and Syria, but also Planned Parenthood to brutally desecrate the innocent on a horrific scale. b2015 President Barack Obama went to great efforts, against taxpayers’ wishes, to give billions of taxpayer dollars to Planned Parenthood to expand abortion on demand in America and throughout the world and to proactively promote policies to allow the indiscriminate killing of these, the most defenseless of all human beings. As President, he appointed an empire of radically proabortion judges and government bureaucrats. When he was in the State legislature, Barack Obama actually voted ‘‘no’’ four times on a bill that would have protected babies after they were born alive. In the U.S. Senate, Mr. Obama voted ‘‘no’’ on a bill that would have prohibited someone from taking a minor child out of State for an abortion without even notifying the child’s parents. He vowed to veto the Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act, which would prohibit discriminating against an unborn baby girl by subjecting her to abortion simply because she is a little girl instead of a little boy. He promised to veto the PainCapable Unborn Child Protection Act, a bill that would have protected both mothers and their little paincapable babies between the beginning of their sixth month of pregnancy from the unspeakable cruelty of Planned Parenthood and evil monsters like Kermit Gosnell. Mr. Speaker, perhaps most astonishingly, Barack Obama, the President of the United States and the leader of the free world, wrote a letter to Congress and said he would veto the BornAlive Abortion Survivors Protection Act to protect breathing, crying, kicking, bornalive human babies if it ever reached his desk. Mr. Speaker, could not the President have agreed that little human babies who survive abortion and are born alive should be protected? President Barack Obama’s record is crystal clear. For his entire political life, he has strongly supported the full legalization of abortion on demand throughout all 9 months of pregnancy, for any reason or no reason, including sex selection, throughout all 9 months of pregnancy, and forcing American taxpayers to pay for it whether the taxpayers liked it or not. Under Barack Obama, nearly 9 million innocent, defenseless little American babies were aborted before they ever saw the first smile of their mother. Ironically, President Obama was in the unique position, perhaps among all other Presidents in history, of bringing this country together to protect these helpless little children. Yet, as the most powerful human being in the world, Mr. Obama chose to become the most powerful enemy of the most helpless human beings in the world. And nothing will stain his legacy or his claims of looking out for the little guy with more shame than going down in history as the ‘‘Abortion President.’’ Mr. Speaker, it gives me no pleasure to lay out this record. I truly and sincerely hoped for God’s best for Barack Obama when he took office. I wrote him a letter, hoping that he would be remembered as someone who stood up for the Constitution and stood up for the innocent. But in a Republic like ours, where the people are the final arbiters of our public policy and where those who would subvert this Republic consistently resort to deception and historical revisionism, an accurate record is vital to our Nation’s survival and its future generations. So, alas, Mr. Speaker, I am afraid Barack Obama tragically wasted his precious and historic opportunity. However, this is the true record of President Barack Obama and, to paraphrase William Wilberforce: We may choose to look the other way, but we can never again say that we did not know. Mr. Speaker, Under President Obama, as of 2015, Democrats lost 900+ state legislature seats, 12 governors, 69 House seats, 13 Senate seats. Mr. Obama lost more U.S. Senate and U.S. House seats than any president since FDR. I would suggest this was not caused by a lack of political skills. It was Mr. Obama’s policies and his attitude toward democracy and the Constitution that were so devastating to his Democrat party. From the beginning of his presidency it was President Obama’s theological conviction that America needed to be transformed into something far afield of the founding fathers dream. Last night the President gave his farewell address to the country. In his speech, President Obama praised American exceptionalism for the first time in his presidency. Unfortunately Mr. Speaker, much of the remainder of the president’s speech was far removed from reality. Mr. Obama implied that his presidency increased America’s wealth and power and respect. The truth is that under Mr. Obama’s presidency, the trust and respect from both friend and foe for America has been demonstrably diminished across the world. Mr. Obama in fact weakened our economy and led the most anemic military campaign in our history. One of the most important elements of this Republic is the ability of the people to understand and remember the public actions and record of those they elect. This is vital to the future direction of future generations of this country. So I come before the House today in order to lay out, and call for the American people to reflect upon, the true record of Barack Obama’s Presidency. During this crucial moment of selfreflection happening in our great Republic, it is incumbent upon us to look back over the past eight years to fully comprehend what are the wages of two full terms of Progressive governance under President Barack Obama. Because Mr. Speaker, if Hillary Clinton had been elected president, the leftwing, mindset to ignore the foundations of this nation, the Constitution, and so many millions of those it was designed to protect, would have continued unabated and this Republic may have been lost. Mr. Speaker, I solemnly wonder if America as a nation and Americans as individuals truly comprehend how close we came to actually losing this Republic and the founding fathers dream during the last election. As Americans soberly reflect on that reality, let us now recall the grand promise of candidate Barack Obama, bedecked with Greek columns and the rhetoric of bipartisan unity as he was, and compare it to the actual legacy of President Barack Obama—the partisan heckler at home and the leadfrombehind, apologize for America, academic abroad who was ever more eager to force Catholic nuns to buy birth control than he was to fight the ruthless butchers of the Islamic State. So Mr. Speaker, what follows is the record and the legacy of Barack Hussein Obama: 
Obama’s presidency will be the first in modern times whose eight years in office will fail to include at least one year of 3 percent economic growth. Mr. Obama has taken credit for a growing economy, but after his failed stimulus, his was the worst economic recovery in history. Using the broadest measure of economic progress, growth in output, the growth rate over the first 25 quarters under Reagan was 34 percent versus 14.3 percent under Obama. Yet, Under Barack Obama, the growth of a ravenous Leviathan called the federal government, grew larger and larger in scope and in power every single year he was president. 
Under Barack Obama’s presidency the number of LongTerm unemployed eclipsed 15 million for the first time in history. As the Los Angeles Times notes, ‘‘The longer people remain jobless, the more likely they are to suffer the scarring effects of unemployment that can hurt their earnings permanently and create a cycle of instability. 
The percentage of people participating in the labor market in January fell to 62.7 percent its lowest rate in 31 years. On his watch, the number of people forced to work part time for economy reasons eclipsed 8 million for the first time in history. On his watch, the average time it takes Americans to find a job reached the highest total in the history of the statistic being measured. The unemployment rate among African Americans was nearly double what it was for white Americans And today 95 million Americans, the highest number in history, are now not in the workforce in America. 
Under Barack Obama, American Families faced Higher Costs on Nearly Everything: 
Spending on gas, groceries, utility bills and health insurance premiums skyrocketed. However Wages were Down: according to the latest numbers from the Census Bureau household incomes fell by more than $2,100 in inflationadjusted terms,’’ 
When it came to taxes, Barack Obama said, ‘‘No family making less than $250,000 a year will see any form of tax increase.’’ He said that he ‘‘Will eliminate all income taxation of seniors making less than $50,000 per year. This will eliminate taxes for 7 million seniors— saving them an average of $1,400 a year— and will also mean that 27 million seniors will not need to file an income tax return, at all.’’ However, Mr. Speaker, Obamacare alone contained at least 20 new or higher taxes on American families and small businesses, representing over $1 trillion in tax increases, the largest tax increase in history. It has produced a crippling effect on the working and middle class. Mr. Obama’s tax increases include the Individual Mandate Excise Tax, Employer Mandate Tax, Surtax on Investment Income, taxes on health savings accounts, a hike in the Medicare Payroll Tax, and the elimination of the tax deduction for employerprovided retirement prescription drug coverage. 
Under Barack Obama the number of Americans living at or below the poverty line went up 5.5 million between 2008 and 2013. A record number of 45.3 million Americans now live in poverty. Under Mr. Obama’s presidency, the income gap between rich and poor reached its highest level in over 40 years, and the American poverty rate hit the highest level in the 52 year history of the statistic being measured. 
According to a report in the Washington Examiner, the number of AbleBodied adults on food stamps doubled, from 1.9 million in 2008 to 3.9 million in 2010, when Mr. Obama suspended the work requirement. On his watch, more than 43 million Americans were receiving food stamps, that’s an increase of 23% since January 2009 and more than at any time in American history. 
Barack Obama said, ‘‘I will not sign a plan that adds one dime to our deficits, either now or in the future.’’ And ‘‘Today, I’m pledging to cut the deficit we inherited in half by the end of my first term in office.’’ Yet the reality was that under Mr. Obama’s presidency, America had the first $1 trillion deficit in history. He raised the debt ceiling time and time again. He used scare tactics against seniors (‘‘he said quote ‘‘cannot guarantee’’ Social Security checks will go out) as a means of getting way with another debt ceiling raise and Standard & Poor downgraded the U.S. government from its 70 year AAA credit rating for the first time in history. He instituted Federal bailouts, including bailouts that went to hundreds of millions in executive bonuses. The Obama government alone was equal to the entire United States’ population in 1776. And he robbed the children coming up around her knees of their economic future and placed them on the path to national bankruptcy in order to ensure his radical, big government agenda was implemented. Barack Obama singlehandedly added almost as much deficit to the national debt as all of the other presidents in the 240 year history of the United States of America combined. MILITARY READINESS  
Mr. Obama engineered the sequester on the military which had devastating consequences to our ability to fight and win wars when necessary. The army is now the smallest it has been since Pearl Harbor; the Navy has shrunk to WWI levels; missile defense was cut every year he was in office, and the Pentagon was turned into a politically correct playground for social experimentation. During that same time, North Korea, one of the most dangerous police states in the world, tested nuclear weapons 5 times. Mr. Obama’s was the opposite of a commitment to peace through strength. The reason President Obama’s legacy will be endless war is because America’s enemies knew he never had the commitment or the will to win any war. So all they had to do was wait him out. And that’s exactly what they did; and so many people suffered and died as a result. When Mr. Obama was negotiating the New Start Treaty, he was caught on camera secretly asking Russian President Medvedev to ‘‘Give me more time until the elections’’. At least he meant for it to be a secret. Then after the elections he gave up far more that America got in return in that treaty, demonstrably diminished the strength of our nuclear deterrent and gave Russia a lopsided advantage over America in tactical nuclear weapons. I pray our children and grandchildren do not pay unthinkable price someday for the feckless and cowardly policy Mr. Obama negotiated. 
When it came to justice at home, Barack Obama fundamentally sought to abrogate religious freedom in America and he weaponized the Internal Revenue Service, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Attorney Gen.’s office and the Justice Department against America’s own citizens. It was and is the epitome of tyranny. President Obama turned the criminal justice system upside down. He commuted the sentences of 774 federal inmates which is more than the previous 11 presidents combined. He issued 590 commutations in the year 2016 alone, which is the highest in U.S. history according to his own White House. Mr. Obama pardoned a total of 148 people during his presidency and has shortened the sentences of 1,176 people, including 395 serving life sentences. Yet during his presidency, in Mr. Obama’s hometown of Chicago alone, a city where his policies on gun control are the strictest in the nation, there were nearly 800 murders this year alone which is the highest in history. It was also Mr. Obama’s administration that told us that mud puddles are navigable waters, that a tax is not a tax, that an exchange created by the federal government is an exchange created by a state, and that bureaucrats had more right’s then parents to decide their child’s education and that adult male transvestites had the moral and legal right to go into the bathroom with little schoolgirls whether their parents liked it or not. 
Mr. Obama unconstitutionally ignored and selectively applied America’s immigration laws perhaps because he saw those coming across the border into this country illegally, not as illegal immigrants, but as unregistered democrats. President Obama never gained control of the border and in fact, Mr. Obama unconstitutionally ignored and selectively applied America’s immigration laws and illegally suspended immigration enforcement. He released 19,723 criminal illegal immigrants from prison into nearly every state of the Union. These nearly 20,000 criminal illegal aliens were collectively convicted of over 60,000 crimes, including over 12,000 drunk driving convictions and over 8,000 violent crimes such as assault, rape, and murder. Mr. Obama’s actions endangered Americans and denied justice to the victims of their crimes. Mr. Obama bears a share of the responsibility for every crime that these criminals have committed or will commit against Americans since he released them from prison into American society. TERRORISM  
When President Obama took office in January 2009, Iraq was a relatively stable nation. Iran was contained and ISIS did not exist. Now there is chaos throughout the Middle East. Vladimir Putin’s Russia is in Syria, the Iranians have been unleashed, and ISIS has raped and butchered its way across Iraq declaring that there would be nothing for Christians but the sword and history will record that it was Barack Obama who willingly stood on the sidelines and knowingly let a genocide against Christians and Yezidis happen. Barack Obama drew red lines he had no intention of enforcing, stood back and watched as Syria burned and Islamist radicals grew in strength until they exploded out of Syria to bring Hell on earth to the innocent men and women across the region. To date, the result is over 4 million refugees and over 400,000 people dead. There are nine times more people killed in terrorist attacks today than there were in 2000. My colleagues and I earnestly warned President Obama and his administration of the dangers that Boko Haram and ISIS represented to innocent people in America and the world and pleaded with him to take actions to prevent them from desecrating the innocent. Mr. Obama casually dismissed our concerns related to both of those groups. His administration refused to call Boko Haram a terrorist organization and he dismissed ISIS as ‘‘Junior Varsity’’. My colleagues and I then repeatedly pleaded with Mr. Obama for over a year to resolutely respond to this insidious, murderous, hellish evil. I personally asked the president in an open video message if he did not realize ‘‘that by ignoring this monstrous, ideological evil, that you allow it to grow, and you ultimately invite it to exercise its desecration of the innocent within the shores of our own nation.’’ Yet, President Obama stood by casually, golf club in hand, and steadfastly refused ignored those entreaties. And terrorism did return to America and for the first time since 9/ 11, innocent Americans citizens were murdered by terrorists on American soil. Today Boko Haram and ISIS are responsible for 51 percent, of all terrorist fatalities in the world. Foreign intelligence agencies now estimate ISIS ranks are as large as 200,000 fighters from 90 countries. ISIS and its affiliates either control or hold influence in nearly 20 nations: Iraq, Syria, Egypt, Libya, Nigeria, Algeria, Morocco, Mali, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Lebanon, Russia, Bosnia, Philippines, Indonesia, and Malaysia. Whether they manifested themselves as the Iranian mullahs, ISIS, Boko Haram, Hezbollah, 
Hamas, or a dozen other names, Barack Obama refused to even call Global Jihadists by name and he fundamentally refused to marshal the resources of his presidency to bear on behalf of the thousands of helpless victims they slaughtered. It is a disgrace that leaves me without words to describe. Mr. Obama released five of the most dangerous Taliban leaders along with other terrorists held in Guantanamo Bay including 182 violent prisoners who have been released from Guantanamo Bay, nearly 20 percent of whom returned to the battlefield to fight United States forces and interests the world over. Mr. Obama’s ‘‘slap on the wrist’’ approach to national security needlessly added and continues to add to the dangers our men and women face in the fight against jihadist terrorism. President Obama abandoned the Iranian freedom movement in 2009 when the citizens of Iran took to the streets to protest the rigged presidential election and to remove the Khamenei regime peacefully. He supported the release of the Lockerbie bomber. He supported Civilian trials for terrorists. Then due to those very procedural protections in civil court that prevented introduction of crucial evidence, that Mr. Obama had been specifically and repeatedly warned about in advance, the civilian trial for the evil terrorist Ahmed Ghailani led to his acquittal on more than 280 criminal charges of a man who openly admitted his terrorist activities. And Mr. Obama specifically chose not to prosecute the Muslim Brotherhood in the Holy Land Foundation trial when the evidence against them was absolutely overwhelming. One week after three Americans and our Ambassador were killed by Terrorists in Benghazi, Mr. Obama and his administration stood in front of flag draped coffins and lied to the American people about what really happened. The average number of Innocents killed by terrorists before the Obama presidency was 3000 per year; now under Barack Obama it is thirty thousand per year. And the number of terrorists willing to blow themselves up to kill others is growing across the world. The chances of radical Islamists getting weapons of mass destruction are also growing. 
‘‘President Obama’s has been the leading apologist in the world for the Islamic Republic of Iran throughout his presidency. In his relentless quest for a nuclear deal with the Islamic regime of Iran, Mr. Obama simply chose to ignore the fact that Iran is the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism. The notion that the only alternative to seeking a nuclear deal with the corrupt Khamenei regime is war is an illusion created by the Obama administration. Obama communicated directly to Tehran through secret backchannels his willingness to support Khamenei. The truth is that the oppressed majority of the Iranian people did not then, and do not today, support the Khamenei regime’s nuclear program and in fact desperately want to be rid of this poisonous regime. Mr. Obama, with the help of liberal Democrats in Congress and the embrace of the left, got his deal with Iran at all costs. The left embraced it. But did Iran open its doors to U.S. goods? No. The Ayatollah banned them. Did Iran renounce its support for terrorism? No. It renewed support for Hamas, sent troops to Syria and armed rebels in Yemen. Is Iran acting like a responsible regional power? No. In blatant violation of U.N. sanctions, Iran is testing nuclearcapable missiles and firing rockets near U.S. ships. And when the U.S. threatened to respond to Iran’s missile violations, did Iran back down? No. Iran’s ‘‘moderate’’ president ordered his military to accelerate Iran’s missile program. The Iranians believe Mr. Obama is a total pushover. Mr. Obama said he was promoting peace, but he really only projected weakness and the world’s dictators took notice. To pave the way for his insane nuclear agreement with Iran, Mr. Obama ordered the CIA to sever contacts with green movement supporters and even ended U.S. programs to document Iranian human rights abuses. It seems there was nothing the Mr. Obama was not willing to sacrifice upon the altar of the Iranian nuclear deal. To begin finalizing the Iran agreement, Mr. Obama brought in John Kerry and the same basic team which negotiated the nuclear deal with North Korea that paved the way for North Korea to gain the nuclear weapons they have today—North Korea, if you need to be reminded, is the same country which just this year conducted a nuclear test, an ICBM test, and a submarine launched ballistic missile test. From day one and the eight years that followed it has overwhelmed comprehension how divorced the Obama Administration has been from reality. And Mr. Speaker, what exactly did the U.S. from the Iran Deal? A completely unverifiable and tacit agreement from Iran that it will not make a nuclear weapon in the next ten years. And that promise from the jihadist government of Iran was good enough for Barack Obama. And Mr. Speaker, what did Iran get out of the deal? The world’s leading sponsor of terrorism received $1.8 Billion in freed assets, a lifting of the arms embargoes in five years, the toothless U.N. ban on Iran missile development— which of course they are actively and continuously violating. And after eight years, Iran will [quote] ‘‘then be allowed to build an industrial scale nuclear program, with hundreds of thousands of machines, after a ten year period of restraint.’’ [end quote] In order to reach this agreement, Obama ordered the executive branch to cease categorizing Iranian human rights abuses, and now he has also illegally paid $400 Million in ransom for American hostages abducted by the Iranian regime, he has ceded control of Iraq to Iran, he has ignored Iranian development of missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons, and—most significantly—he has ensured the Iranian regime may legally develop nuclear weapons in the coming decade. After the nuclear deal, Iran became only more arrogant and bold. They seized two American naval vessels, took ten sailors hostage, and only released them after the Administration apologized. An Iranian general said the seizure of our ships was a warning to Congress against imposing new sanctions for Iran’s illegal nuclear missile tests. Iran’s intent and track record is crystal clear to almost everyone it seems, but to President Obama. The hallmark of Barack Obama’s presidency has been that of weakening, disarming, diminishing and apologizing for the United States of America. For years many of us watched in utter disbelief at the great lengths to which the Obama Administration has gone in order to secure a deal at any price with Iran on their nuclear weapons program. He has capitulated on every red line and minimum requirement that both he and the United Nations had required. He has now squandered away every form of leverage we had against this theocratic radial regime which has broken every promise it has ever made to us. The jihadist leaders of Iran came to the table with nothing and walked away with everything. And now, instead of making sure they never get a nuclear weapon, Barack Obama’s politically motivated, peaceinourtime capitulation has strengthened Iran’s ability to foment terrorism throughout the world as it has for the last 40 years. And, now, because of his delusional negotiation and acquiescence, this Islamic Republic of Iran, the number one sponsor of terrorism in the world, has become a nation on a path (cleared for them by President Barack Obama) to obtaining a nuclear weapons capability. Indeed, Mr. Obama’s actions may place the finger of Jihad on the launch button of an entire nuclear arsenal; and America’s children and future generations may thereafter be forced to live their lives in the shadow of nuclear terrorism. CONSTITUTION  
Perhaps Mr. Obama’s biggest broken promise to all Americans was when he said, ‘‘I, Barack Hussein Obama, do solemnly swear that I will execute the office of President of the United States faithfully, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect, and defend the constitution of the United States. Whether we’re talking about Obamacare, or Mr. Obama’s administration weaponizing the IRS to target conservative groups, seizing the phone records of the Associated Press, Suggesting that Fox News reporter James Rosen was a criminal without evidence as an excuse to monitor his phone and email, appointing Czars with no accountability, appointing Assistant AG Thomas Perez who steadfastly refused to affirm 1st Amendment Rights, called the Constitution an ‘‘imperfect document’’ that ‘‘reflected the fundamental flaw of the country that continues to this day’’, the seizure of the press’ phone records by the Justice Department, the walking of guns to cartels during Operation Fast and Furious, unconstitutional recess appointments, unconstitutional executive orders or the Administration’s intentional selective enforcement of the laws—This President has shown complete and open contempt for the Constitution as a mere obstacle to his preferred ‘pen and phone’ method of governing through an executive autocracy. When Barack Obama came into office only one of the 13 federal appeals courts had a majority of liberal Democrat appointed judges. Now, nine of the 13 appeals courts have liberal Democrat appointees. Barack Obama nominated to individuals to the Supreme Court who have no regard whatsoever for the plain meaning and original intent of the Constitution. The lawlessness of Obama’s Progressive Utopia, was one governed by the Pen and the Phone rather than the People. If Hillary Clinton had been elected in November she would have almost certainly appointed At Least Three more Supreme Court Justices which would have completely abrogated the United States Constitution along with the first second fifth and 14th amendments and all of the others for generation or more. For the first time in its history, America would no longer have been governed by the United States Constitution as the supreme law of the land. There are simply no words to describe the existential threat to the American Republic that Hillary 
Clinton would have inevitably represented if she had been elected president of the United States. Without the American Constitution there would have been no free America and without a free America there would have been no free world. The implications would have been beyond comprehension. 
Barack Obama’s record is that of having assaulted centuries of legal precedent and medical ethics, pushing forward his effort to roll back regulations that protect physicians’ rights of conscience. Amazingly, the Obama administration accused the Catholic nuns Little Sisters of the Poor, an entirely voluntary and Catholic organization dedicated to hospice care for the indigent, of promoting a war on women . . . for not agreeing to offer birth control as a Catholic health benefit, and then threatened them with $70 million a year in fines for not complying. The Obama administration essentially argued before the Supreme Court that the religious ministerial exception that had been bedrock law since the Constitution was written did not actually exist and that neither the Free Exercise Clause nor the Establishment Clause has anything to say about a church’s relationship with its own employees. In a 9–0 opinion, the Supreme Court unanimously rejected the Administration’s position, stating that ‘‘imposing an unwanted minister, the state infringes the Free Exercise Clause, which protects a religious group’s right to shape its own faith and mission through its appointments.’’ Despite Barack Obama’s supposed expertise on the Constitution, his administration has lost more 9–0 Supreme Court cases than any other Administration in history and no president in history ever posed more overt danger to religious freedom in America than Barack Obama. Mr. Obama casually ignored the historical and constitutional fact that religious liberty involves much more than freedom of worship alone, and that the fundamental rights of free speech and the free exercise of religion do not stop at the exit door of the local house of worship, but instead, extends to every area of life. Mr. Obama refused respect the public component of religious liberty, and failed to accommodate religion in our generally applicable laws, and placed in grave danger, the religious freedom in the Constitution which undergirds everything that is America. 
Barack Obama blatantly stoked racial tensions and in the process he painted a target on the backs of the noble men and women in blue who risk their lives every day to protect the innocent citizens of this country. Some people even went looking to assassinate police officers. And the result was that innocent Americans within both law enforcement and the minority community died across America for no reason. Barack Obama had an historic opportunity to unite America in a profound way. Instead, he chose for temporary political gain to become the divider and chief by seeking to divide America by race and class. 
Mr. Obama’s signature policy achievement was the socalled Affordable Care Act. As we have learned year after year, essentially nothing Mr. Obama said about the Affordable Care Act was true. He told us his mother’s health insurance denied her paying for her cancer treatments—but it was a blatant falsehood. He told America—many, many times—that if we liked our plan and our doctor, we could keep our plan and our doctor—but it was a blatant falsehood. In fact, Mr. Obama’s speech writers joked about deliberately putting that blatant falsehood over on Charlie Rose, who, like many in the media, never pressed the issue. Mr. Obama even deceived and betrayed Bart Stupak from his own party and used a myriad of special political handouts like the Cornhusker Kickback and the Louisiana Purchase to scrape together the support to shove a giant government takeover of the healthcare industry down the American people’s throats and then raided the coffers of Medicare to the tune of over $700 billion to help pay for it. Anyone with a basic understanding of economics warned was going to wreak havoc upon the insurance market. Barack Obama said, ‘‘Obamacare means more choice, more competition, lower costs.’’ But now under Mr. Obama’s presidency, the Cost of Average Family Health Insurance Plan has gone from $12,680 to over $25,000. Barack Obama said the ACA will cost around $900 billion over 10 years; in reality it is at least $2 trillion or more. Mr. Obama said that it would lower health insurance premiums by $2,500 per family. In 42 states, many premiums increased by over 100 percent. Mr. Obama said, ‘‘If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor’’ That was a blatant falsehood. Mr. Obama said, ‘‘I will protect Medicare.’’ That was a blatant falsehood. He robbed Medicare to pay for Obama care. He said, ‘‘Obama care will cover every American.’’ That was a blatant falsehood. Millions remain uninsured. Healthcare costs have never been higher and the entire debacle called Obamacare is now catastrophically collapsing before our very eyes. FOREIGN POLICY  
From day one Barack Obama considered the Cold War a giant misunderstanding. He did his famous reset with Russia and then turned and caved into everything they wanted. Mr. Obama cancelled the missile defense site and betrayed the Czech Republic and Poland to placate Russia. He told Russian President Medvedev he would be more flexible after his reelection on missile defense. Barack Obama lifted sanctions on the communist dictatorship of Cuba and the Islamist dictatorship of Iran. He has held our allies and the enemies of human freedom to different standards, restoring diplomatic relations with Cuba and making economic concessions to their government with no reciprocity on human rights. President Obama praised the murderous dictator when he offered condolences after Castro’s death. For decades, Democrats and Republicans alike maintained consistent policies. At the end of the Obama administration, the only countries in the world that we have better relations with under Barack Obama are Iran and Cuba—and even that has been entirely on their terms. The Saudis are so furious with Obama’s surrender to Iran that they are threatening to develop their own nuclear weapons. Mr. Obama’s policies of weakness and appeasement yielded Crimea, the South China Sea, the rise of the Islamic State, the return of Iran, and the unspeakable desecration of the innocent in Aleppo. Mr. Obama said we were exercising leadership in Syria. But under his ‘‘leadership,’’ he drew a red line and then ran from it. Iran and Russia are now taking the lead in Syria. While he talks about leadership, his lack of action contributed to 400,000 human beings dead and generated 4 million migrants who are now destabilizing Europe. The commentary of Jared Hatch of the Young Leaders Program at the Heritage Foundation said it this way: ‘‘Contemplating the extermination of Aleppo and its people, I was reminded of a sentence that I read this summer. It appeared in an encomium to Elie Wiesel shortly after his death. It was a sterling sentence. It declared: ‘‘We must never be bystanders to injustice or indifferent to suffering.’’ That was Wiesel’s teaching, exactly. The problem with the sentence is that it was issued by the White House and attributed to President Obama. And so the sentence was not at all sterling. It was outrageously hypocritical. How dare Obama, and members of his administration, speak this way? After five years and more in which the United States’ inaction in Syria has transformed our country into nothing other than a bystander to the greatest atrocity of our time, they have forfeited the right to this language. Their angry and anguished utterances are merely the manipulation of the rhetoric of conscience on behalf of a policy without a trace of conscience. You cannot be coldhearted and highminded at the same time. Historians will record—they will not have to dig deeply or interpret wildly to conclude—that all through the excruciations of Aleppo, and more generally of Syria, the 
United States watched. As we watched, we made excuses, and occasionally we ornamented our excuses with eloquence. The president is enamored of his eloquence. But eloquence is precisely what the wrenching circumstances do not require of him. In circumstances of moral (and strategic) emergency, his responsibility is not to move us. It is to pick up the phone. ‘‘Elie did more than just bear witness,’’ Obama said in his eulogy, ‘‘he acted.’’ And he added: ‘‘Just imagine the peace and justice that would be possible in our world if more people lived a little more like Elie Wiesel.’’ Just imagine. If Obama wants credit for not getting us into another war, the credit is his. If he wants credit for not being guilty of ‘‘overreach,’’ the credit is his. If he wants credit for conceiving of every obstacle and impediment to American action in every corner of the globe, the credit is his. But it is a shameful and incontrovertible fact of our history that during the past eight years the values of rescue, assistance, protection, humanitarianism and democracy have been demoted in our foreign policy and in many instances banished altogether. The ruins of the finest traditions of American internationalism, of American leadership in a darkening world, may be found in the ruins of Aleppo. Our ostentatious passivity is a primary cause of that darkening. When they go low, we go home. The Obama legacy in foreign policy is vacuumcreation, which his addled America First successor will happily ratify. Aleppo was not destroyed by the Syrian army. It was destroyed by a savage coalition led and protected by Russia. While they massacred innocent men, women and children, we anxiously pondered scenarios of ‘‘deconfliction.’’ We need to be unforgivingly clear. The obligation to act against evil in Aleppo was no different from the obligation to act against the evil in Sarajevo and Srebrenica. (Has anyone ever heard Mr. Obama mention Bosnia?) It was no different from the obligation to act against the evil in Rwanda. It was no different from the obligation to act against the evil in Auschwitz. And we scorned the obligation. We learned nothing. We forgot everything. We failed. We did not even try. No, that is not quite right. It would be incorrect to analyze our delinquency in Syria in the dichotomously simple terms of action and inaction. The administration creatively pioneered a third option, which it pursued not only in Syria but also in Ukraine and elsewhere: Between action and inaction, it chose inconsequential action. There is the Obama doctrine! We backed moderate Syrian rebels, but not as seriously or as generously as the immoderate Syrian rebels were backed. We sent in small numbers of special operators. The CIA ran a few programs. We acted, in sum, only in ways certain not to affect the outcome. We were strategically feckless. I suspect that the president believes that the United States has no moral right to affect an outcome in another country. I suspect that he regards such decisive action as imperialism, or at least as Iraqlike. What this means in practice is that we will not help people who deserve our help. In the spirit of respecting other societies, we will idly gaze at their destruction. How would disrespecting them be worse? As a direct or indirect consequence of our refusal to respond forcefully to the Syrian crisis, we have beheld secular tyranny, religious tyranny, genocide, chemical warfare, barrel bombs and cluster bombs, the torture and murder of children, the displacement of 11 million people, the destabilization of Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan, the ascendancy of Iran in the region, the emergence of Russia as a global power, the diminishment of the American position in the world, the refugee crisis in Europe, the resurgence of fascism in Europe and a significant new threat to the security of the United States. It is amazing how much doing nothing can do, especially when it is we who do nothing. Not long after he mourned Wiesel, the president engaged in another one of his exercises in empathy without consequence. At the U.N. Summit for Refugees and Migrants, he spoke of Alan Kurdi, the Syrian boy who washed up dead on a beach in Turkey. ‘‘That little boy on the beach could be our son or our grandson,’’ the president moistly said. ‘‘We cannot avert our eyes or turn our backs.’’ And then we proceeded to avert our eyes and turn our backs. The people who had the power to prevent, stop or even mitigate this catastrophe should now bow their heads and fall silent and reflect on how it is that they brought us so low. Aleppo is no more, and we are weakened and disgraced. Mr. Speaker, it is ironic and tragic that the fall of Aleppo comes as Barack Obama is to leave office. Because it is one of the clearest demonstrations of how his cowardly foreign and domestic policies have consistently left tens of thousands of innocent helpless victims dead in his wake. When Islamic terrorists bombed Brussels, killing and injuring hundreds of people, including Americans, President Obama was eating cracker jacks at a baseball game rubbing elbows with a communist dictator. When the Benghazi tragedy occurred in the middle of a presidential election, and three Americans and our ambassador were murdered by terrorists the Obama Administration’s spinmasters told us it was because of a YouTube video. It was a dark and deliberate lie to the American people in front of flag draped coffins and was an egregious example of the Obama Administration’s astonishing lack of accountability and transparency. At a time when noble Americans were fighting and dying in the sands of Iraq to secure a lasting peace and bring stability to the region, Senator Obama vigorously opposed the Surge in Iraq and said [quote] ‘‘I am not persuaded that 20,000 additional troops in Iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there, in fact I think it will do the reverse . . . I am going to actively oppose the president’s proposal.’’ [end quote]. In spite of the opposition to the Surge from Senator Obama, Senator Reid, and many other partisan Democrats notwithstanding, General Petraeus and our unbelievably courageous men and women in uniform were able to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat—decimating AlQaeda in Iraq, halting sectarian violence, and achieving a sustainable peace. As thanks for this historic military feat, the Left in America called him ‘‘General Betray Us,’’ and Senator Hillary Clinton said his reports to the Senate by General Petraeus required the ‘‘willing suspension of disbelief.’’ This was a despicable display of hyperpartisanship on the part of Mr. Obama and the Democrats who refused to accept American victory in Iraq. But then of course, the Obama Administration would go on to claim the peace in Iraq as one of their foreign policy achievements. Then in spite of the prescient advice President Bush gave on July 12, 2007 and the warnings of countless generals, Obama ignored his commanders and precipitously withdrew our troops from Iraq. Even as we withdrew our troops, Vice President BIDEN said of Iraq [quote] ‘‘I think it’s going to be one of the great achievements of this Administration. You’re going to see 90,000 troops come marching home by the end of the summer, you’re going to see a stable government in Iraq that is moving towards a representative government . . . ’’ [end quote] is precisely because of President Obama’s petulant decision to keep his politically motivated campaign promise to remove all our troops from Iraq that the Islamic State was able to form, spread across the region, and bring about a brutal reign of evil the likes of which the world has not seen since the Mongols rampaged across Asia. Right after the Islamic state entered Iraq, many of us in Congress wrote a letter to Mr. Obama beseeching him to understand the danger of this terrorist organization and imploring him to respond while there was time. Astoundingly, Mr. Obama labeled the Islamic state a junior varsity team and his administration stood by with the collective golf club in their hand while ISIS raped and murdered and beheaded its way across Iraq, selling sixyear old girls into slavery and burning people alive. The Islamic State now keeps an estimated 3,000 young girls and women in sexual slavery, and they are being beaten and raped day after day. It is mindnumbingly horrific to know what these innocent girls are going through every day while Mr. Obama runs out the clock on his term of office and hands the fight against ISIS off to the next president. Under Mr. Obama’s administration the murder of innocent people by terrorists increased almost tenfold. Then when President Obama drew his famous red line in Syria, Bashir Assad had been paying attention and he knew he could simply ignore this red line in the sand for what it was. And he proceeded to do just that and he remains in power to this day slaughtering the moderate rebels and the Kurds fighting ISIS. In response to the onslaught of ISIS, President Obama launched one of the most anemic and pathetic air campaigns in modern history and ISIS grew to somewhere around 40,000 fighters under President Obama’s watch. He enabled ISIS to grow and metastasize, attract and radicalize countless young men from the West who will attempt to return home and unleash their virulent brand of Islam upon innocent Europeans and Americans as we have so tragically seen in France, Brussels, and even in the United States. During the socalled Arab Spring the Obama administration sided with the Muslim brotherhood in Egypt. Barack Obama mocked Mitt Romney during their second presidential debate, saying ‘‘The 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back.’’ Mr. Speaker—would to God that we could get the foreign policy from the 1980s back! For eight years Barack Obama ignored the fact that Vladimir Putin is a KGB killer intent on restoring Russia to its Sovietera in prayer for error. And it has been an absolute national embarrassment to watch this Russian thug unceremoniously mop the floor and the map of the world with the President of the United States. 
In his first year of office, and on the very day of the 70th anniversary of Soviet Invasion Day in Poland, President Obama betrayed our European allies. The Czechs and the Poles had risked the survival of their governments by agreeing to implement a missileshield in their countries that could have significantly devalued Iran’s entire nuclear missile pursuits and even one day may have protected America from the Iranian nuclear missiles. But to placate a revanchist Russia Barack Obama blatantly betrayed both the Czechs and the Poles and unilaterally withdrew from the plan. Under Barack Obama, U.S. agreements with our understandably nervous friends in Eastern Europe were not worth the paper they were printed on. Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons with the written assurance from Russia and the United States of America that its national sovereignty would be protected. Then, in response to the unconscionable Russian invasion of Ukraine and seizure of the Crimean Peninsula, the Obama Administration would not even provide lethal armaments to the Ukrainians. Instead he offered MREs. Then Mr. Obama evidently did not deem that humiliation complete until he had turned to the Russians to assist with Syria. The complete and total lack of leadership from the Obama White House once again came full circle. Ben Rhoades made an attempt to analyze the mindset of Barack Obama. He said, [quote] ‘‘He is smarter than everyone and more than willing to actively lie and obfuscate to the American people and media to effect his desired outcomes, despite, or in spite of, the will of the American people, the law, and even common sense.’’ 
Barack Obama pledged [quote] ‘‘unshakeable commitment’’ [unquote] to Israel’s security. Mr. Obama stood before a group of thousands of supporters of Israel and proclaimed that ‘‘when the chips are down, I have Israel’s back.’’ But then as President, he blatantly refused even to acknowledge Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. Then Mr. Obama consistently expressed more open rebuke toward Israel for building houses in its capital city than he expressed for Iran’s efforts to build nuclear weapons with which to existentially threaten the state of Israel along with the peace and security of the entire human family. Mr. Obama all but ignored Iran’s call for Israel to be wiped off the map. He supported the unification of Fatah and Hamas. He pressured Israel to release over 100 murderers, rapists, and terrorists. He suggested that Israel return to 1967 border lines which would have made national security for the tiny nation of Israel almost impossible. Benjamin Netanyahu came to Congress and said ‘‘obviously we are going to have to continue to prepare to defend ourselves by ourselves.’’ On December 23, 2016, two days before Christmas and one day before the start of Hanukkah, in the waning days of his administration, in the safety of a lameduck presidency, President Obama and Secretary Kerry broke with over 20 years of bipartisan precedent and betrayed America’s best friend in the world when he orchestrated and then refused to veto a United Nations Security Council resolution that undermined Israel’s very right to exist. Under the manifestation of this resolution, Jewish citizens of Israel could not legally step foot into the Jewish quarter of Jerusalem (where they have resided for thousands of years) and they could not even stand in front of the Western Wall, the holiest site of Judaism. In accepting the factually and morally incorrect label of ‘‘occupied’’ proclaimed in this resolution, President Obama and Secretary Kerry have reinforced the position of the plethora of antiSemites at the U.N. This antiSemitic resolution fueled and lent legitimacy to the ongoing murderous hatred of Jews, which manifested itself once again two weeks later when an ISISinspired murderer rammed his truck into a group of 16 Jews who Obama helped label ‘‘occupiers’’ by his abstention. In an alltoofamiliar scene, thousands of people poured into the streets in Gaza to celebrate the murder of Jews. Amidst the celebrations, candy was passed out and Fathi Hamad, the leader of the Hamas, issued the following statement: ‘‘The message of our Islamic party Hamas is a message of encouragement and support for every jihadi who carries out an attack that puts an end to the acts of the Zionist enemy.’’ Despite lending credence to the casus belli of the ISISinspired attack, the President has yet to comment on this despicable act of terrorism. When the Security Council Quartet meets on January 15 and the full UNSC meets on January 17, I am gravely concerned that Barack Obama will overturn U.S. precedent going back to Lyndon Johnson and use the opportunity to stab Israel in the back one final time by allowing the antiSemites at the UN to redraw the map to Israel’s indefensible pre 1967 borders—leaving the world’s only Jewish state less than 9 miles wide. Up until Barack Obama became President, America protected the State of Israel against the antiSemitic mob we call the United Nations. The only thing United about the United Nations has been their consistent opposition to America and the state of Israel. Let me be very clear, Mr. Speaker. Orchestrating and then failing to veto this resolution that undermined Israel’s right to exist was a cowardly act of political treachery by Barack Obama that has disgraced the United States of America and it will send Barack Obama’s name down the corridor of history as an overt traitor to Nation of Israel. It is an absolute disgrace that this President has been willing to sacrifice the security and stability of this vital ally and our greatest friend in the world, upon the altar of perceived international civility. It is a betrayal that history will never forget. 
Perhaps the singularly saddest tragedy the Barack Obama leaves behind are all of the innocent victims that needed his help so desperately and for whom now that help is forever too late. Mr. Obama’s Administration consistently and unconscionably implemented policies across the board that negatively impacted the most vulnerable in human society. The Obama administration loosened restrictions on regimes using child soldiers. The Obama administration officials repeatedly ignored Chinese human rights abuses during trips to China. FBI statistics indicate that hate crimes against the Jewish population are up, but Mr. Obama was silent about that. There was and is genocide against Christians taking place in the Middle East, but he was also silent about that. He stood by and let ISIS, Boko Haram, Russia, Syria and Planned Parenthood brutally desecrate the innocent. ABORTION  
Only three days after he took office, on January 23, 2009, President Obama overturned America’s longstanding policy, which prohibited taxpayer dollars from being used to fund the killing of unborn children by abortion overseas. In a time of economic crisis, President Obama proceeded to give millions of U.S. Taxpayer dollars to abortion providers in foreign countries. Pastor Rick Warren asked candidate Obama, ‘‘Forty million abortions, at what point does a baby get human rights, in your view?’’ Mr. Obama’s response was, ‘‘Well, you know, I think that whether you’re looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective, answering that question with specificity, you know, is above my pay grade.’’ President Barack Obama had one of the greatest opportunities ever afforded to any president to take his place among history’s most respected heads of state by defending the rights of the defenseless which is the ultimate measure of every true statesman. Not only did he fail that opportunity, lie went to great effort to proactively promote the indiscriminate killing of the most defenseless of all human beings. Barack Obama worked diligently to expand abortion on demand in America and throughout the earth. He relentlessly worked against taxpayer’s wishes to give billions of taxpayer dollars to Planned Parenthood, the largest promoter and perpetrator of abortion on demand on Earth. Throughout his presidency, Mr. Obama surrounded himself with some of the most radical proabortion officials in public office, including Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius, who supports Partial Birth Abortions, and White House Science Advisor John Holdren, who has written openly about his support of radical policies like forced abortions and forced sterilization. In August 2010, authorities entered the clinic of Dr. Kermit Gosnell, and found a torture chamber for little babies that defies description within the constraints of the Englishlanguage. According to the Grand Jury report: quote ‘‘Dr. Kermit Gosnell had a simple solution for unwanted babies: he killed them. He didn’t call it that. He called it ‘ensuring fetal demise.’ The way he ensured fetal demise was by sticking scissors in the back of the baby’s neck and cutting the spinal cord. He called it ‘snipping.’ Over the years there were hundreds of ‘snippings’. Mr. Speaker, these were born alive children murdered by having their spines snipped with scissors without anesthetic. Ashley Baldwin, one of Dr. Gosnell’s employees, said she saw babies breathing and she described one as two feet long that no longer had eyes or a mouth, but, in her words, was like making this ‘‘screeching’’ noise . . . and it ‘‘sounded like a little alien.’’ For God’s sake Mr. Speaker, is that who we truly are? As President of the United States of America at the time, Barack Obama did not utter one syllable against these gut wrenching atrocities of Kermit Gosnell or Planned Parenthood. He lectured this country on almost everything and yet he was shamefully silent in 
the face of this insidious and horrifying genocide against these helpless little born alive human children. When he was in the state legislature, Mr. Obama actually voted no four times on a bill that would have protected crying, kicking, breathing babies after they were born alive. Mr. Obama, also consistently supported the policy that allowed more than 18,000 late term, pain capable unborn babies were torturously killed without anesthesia in America in just the last year. Many of them cried and screamed as they died, but because it was amniotic fluid going over their vocal cords instead of air, we couldn’t hear them. In his position, President Barack Obama could have easily and successfully enacted policies that would have saved the vast majority of the little babies like the ones Dr. Kermit Gosnell killed, yet all of his adult life he has actively and vigorously supported policies that not only allowed but were the direct result of them being killed. In 2015, the Center for Medical Progress released numerous video recordings that incontrovertibly documented corporate officers and employees of Planned Parenthood casually discussing the harvesting and sale of the little body parts of countless little babies among the hundreds of thousands of innocent babies they are killing in many of the hundreds of existing abortion clinics owned by Planned ParenthoOd across this nation. It was a revelation so ugly and evil that it still casts an indelible stain of shame on all of us as Americans. Yet, Barack Obama arrogantly and heartlessly did all that was necessary to force American taxpayers to continue to fund this organization of human butchery called Planned Parenthood. In the U.S. Senate, Mr. Obama voted no on a bill that would have prohibited someone from taking a minor child out of state for an abortion without at least notifying the child’s parents. He voted no on a bill that would have allowed unborn babies in low income households to be included for health insurance coverage. As President he appointed an Empire of radically proabortion judges and government bureaucrats. He vowed to veto The Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act which would prohibit discriminating against an unborn baby girl by subjecting her to abortion simply because she is a little girl instead of a little boy. He promised to veto the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act after its historic passage in the United States House of Representatives. This is a bill that would protect both mothers and their little pain capable unborn babies between the beginning of their sixth month of pregnancy and live birth from the unspeakable cruelty of Planned Parenthood and evil monsters like Kermit Gosnell. The House of Representatives later passed The Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. This was a humane and reasonable bill that in the name of humanity would simply protect those babies who had survived the process of abortion and were born alive. born alive, Mr. Speaker. Yet astonishingly, Barack Obama, the President of the United States and the leader of the free world wrote a letter to Congress and said he would veto this bill to protect these born alive babies if it ever reached his desk. I can only say Mr. Speaker, that there is a moment in the life of every policymaker when he or she makes a decision either to protect the innocent or to embrace the Cimmerian darkness where the light of human compassion has gone out and the survival of the fittest has prevailed over humanity. President Barack Obama failed that moment. President Barack Obama’s record is crystal clear. For his entire his political life, Mr. Obama has strongly supported the full legalization of abortion on demand throughout all nine months of pregnancy for any reason or no reason whatsoever including sex selection throughout all nine months of pregnancy and he supported forcing American taxpayers to pay for it whether the taxpayers liked it or not. Under President Barack Obama, nearly 9 million innocent, defenseless little American babies were aborted before they saw the first smile of their mother. So ironically, Mr. Speaker, President Obama once spoke very noble and poignant words that, whether he realized it or not, apply so profoundly to this subject. Mr. Speaker, let me quote excerpted portions of his comments: Mr. Obama once said, ‘‘This is our first task—caring for our children. It’s our first job. If we don’t get that right, we don’t get anything right. That’s how, as a society, we will be judged.’’ He asked, ‘‘Are we really prepared to say that we’re powerless in the face of such carnage, that the politics are too hard? Are we prepared to say that such violence visited on our children year after year after year is somehow the price of our freedom?’’ He also said ‘‘Our journey is not complete until all our children . . .’’ are ‘‘cared for and cherished and always safe from harm.’’ ‘‘That is our generation’s task’’ he said, ‘‘to make these words, these rights, these values of life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness real for every American.’’ Mr. Speaker, never have I so deeply agreed with any words ever spoken by President Obama as those I have just quoted. How I wish he could somehow open his heart and his ears to his own words, and ask himself in the core of his own soul, why these words that should apply to ALL children, cannot include the most helpless and vulnerable of all children? Are there any children more vulnerable than little pain capable babies are before they are even born? Could we not at least agree we should all come together protect them when they are between the beginning of the sixth month of pregnancy and birth when we know that the thousands upon thousands of babies Planned Parenthood kills at this age feel agonizing pain in the process of being murdered? Could we not agree that little human babies who survive abortion and are born alive should be protected? Could the President not have agreed to that much, Mr. Speaker? Ironically, Barack Obama was in the unique position, perhaps among all other presidents in history, to bring this country together to protect these helpless little babies. Yet as the most powerful human being in the world, Mr. Obama chose to become the most powerful enemy of the most helpless human beings in the world. Nothing will stain his legacy or his claims of looking out for the little guy with more shame than going down in history as the ‘‘Abortion President’’. Mr. Speaker, I know Mr. Obama will hold to the standard line and cloak it all in the name of freedom of choice as he is done throughout his political life, but I wish he could just ask himself, what is so liberating about dismembering living, helpless little human babies? Mr. Speaker, I once prayed and hoped that Barack Obama would take a different road than he did when it came to protecting innocent humanity. Just before he first took office eight years ago, I wrote the President of the United States an open letter on this very issue of protecting the innocent unborn child that was published in Human Events Magazine the very day he raised his hand to take the oath of office, swearing before God that he would preserve and protect the Constitution of the United States. Several days later in the White House I personally handed Mr. Obama that original letter which he promised to read. In that letter I wished him well, hoping that he would use his unique and historic opportunity to bring together Americans in their common humanity to a moment of renewed commitment to recognize and protect every member of the human family including the innocent unborn child. The letter is as follows: Dear President Barack Obama, History and the human family find themselves at a crossroads as you take the oath of office to become the 44th President of the United States. I am told you are the first to request to be sworn in with your hand on the same Bible used by Abraham Lincoln when he took the same oath. In the days, years, and generations to come, many voices will speak to the profound symbolism of this gesture on your part. History will also record whether or not you honored those noble principles held in the heart of Abraham Lincoln; that all of God’s children have the right to live, and be free, and to pursue their dreams. This is one Republican with the sincerest prayer that history will confirm that you did. May I submit that the surest hope of such a confirmation is for you and the Nation to remember why we built that grand white granite memorial along the Potomac to Mr. Lincoln, and why we revere him so deeply. We honor Abraham Lincoln most because he found within himself the humanity and courage to transcend the politics and convention of his day, to recognize the child of God in a slave, which both the tide of public opinion and the Dred Scott Supreme Court decision had declared to be a nonperson, and unprotectable by law. History found Abraham Lincoln a faithful steward of the hope, human dignity, and deliverance of those who bore the image of God in the shame of slavery; and now it waits to witness President Barack Obama’s stewardship of the hope, human dignity, and deliverance of those who bear the image of God in unborn silence. Yes, it is true, Mr. President, that no issue since slavery has divided Democrats and Republicans so deeply as abortion. Yet, the two issues are so profoundly similar. In both cases, the innocent victims were arbitrarily dehumanized in the name of freedom. And yes, it will be easy for you to listen to the voices of those who still today, in the name of freedom, would deprive the innocent of both life and liberty. Certainly, their familiar phrases prevailed for a time in the days of slavery. However, is it possible that in hindsight, and with the weight of history on your shoulders, that you might find the courage to reject this insidious deception that has crushed so many 
lives across history, and that relentlessly pursues this nation still? Mr. Lincoln did. He said, ‘‘Those who deny freedom to others deserve it not themselves, and under a just God, cannot long retain it.’’ That is why we love him, and built our memorial to him. So, as you lay your hand upon his Bible, Mr. President, may I adjure you to listen, in the stillness of your own heart, to the faint cries for mercy from those little souls who now look to you for hope; and to the words printed in red on the pages beneath your hand which will be declared again in eternity’s final day; ‘‘Inasmuch as you have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, you have done it unto me.’’ Mr. Speaker, I truly and sincerely wished God’s best for Barack Obama when he took office, just as I do now. And it gives me no pleasure to lay out what I believe to be the profound failures of Mr. Obama’s presidency. However, in a Republic like ours where the people are the final arbiters of our public policy, and where those who would subvert this Republic consistently resort to deception and historical revisionism, an accurate record is vital to our nation’s survival and its future generations. So, alas Mr. Speaker, I am afraid President Obama tragically wasted his precious and historic opportunity. However, this is the true record of President Barack Obama, and to paraphrase William Wilberforce, ‘‘We may choose to look the other way but we can never say again that we did not know.’’ Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President.
