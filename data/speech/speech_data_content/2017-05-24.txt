Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, yesterday President Trump laid out his budget request for next year. It represents the most draconian disinvestment in our country by any President in modern history, and it is littered with broken promises and fundamental errors in simple math. It is a budget that makes very clear that this President is not fighting for working Americans and their families, and, in fact, he is breaking his promises to make their lives better. It is shockingly devoid of the basic policy details necessary to back up its deficit cutting bravado. It includes an accounting discrepancy so large—over $2 trillion—that it can only be characterized as willfully hiding the ball from the American public, an exercise in extreme incompetence, or both. The purpose of a budget is to lay out the most complete description of a President’s governing vision for the country. By that measure and many others, this budget is an embarrassment. It is no wonder that it has already been panned by Members on both sides of the aisle in this House. My Republican friend, Representative MIKE SIMPSON , was absolutely right when he said of proposals like this one that the House can’t pass this budget. Nor will it. It is dead on arrival in Congress because Democrats and Republicans both understand that we can’t provide economic security to the American people and keep them safe from threats if we gut our investments in doing both. That is what the President’s budget would do. As The Washington Post eloquently pointed out, the Trump budget ‘‘is fundamentally at odds with what Trump told voters.’’ President Trump promised middle class American workers he would fight for them and their families. If implemented, his budget would make it harder for them to send their kids to college, access job training to get ahead, or even just stay in the middle class, and devastate seniors’ long term care. The dramatic cuts he makes to nutrition assistance, elimination of heating assistance during the winter months and Meals on Wheels will hit lowincome Americans and seniors hard, particularly in rural communities. And those, Mr. Speaker, are just a selection. He is breaking his campaign promise not to cut Medicaid and Social Security, taking $1.4 trillion out of Medicaid over the next 10 years, without offering a policy to achieve those cuts, and slashing funds for the Social Security disability insurance programs that serve 10 million Americans. Frankly, the President made fun of those with disabilities during the course of the campaign, and now he cuts billions of dollars from the ability of the disabled to maintain some degree of dignity and health. President Trump also pledged that the American taxpayer would not pay—would not pay—for the border wall he wants to build. Of course, his budget asks the U.S. taxpayer to pay for that wall. When it comes to keeping Americans safe from threats overseas, President Trump’s budget fails miserably as well, cutting the budgets for diplomacy and foreign aid that complement the work of our military in combating ISIS and other terror groups. Additionally, it punishes middle class Federal employees in every congressional district in our country for choosing to serve their country by cutting their pay and retirement benefits. One after another, the budget breaks the President’s promises. At every turn, it undermines our longterm security and prosperity by ignoring the critical lessons from past Republican administrations when it comes to basic economics. Like past Republican budgets, the Trump budget relies on discredited theories of how economic growth would result from tax policies. Unlike past attempts, however, the Trump budget double counts its fantasy supply side boost in an accounting error so large it could pay for the Pentagon 3 years over. Mr. Speaker, we know this budget will go nowhere in Congress. I believe there will not be a Republican in the House of Representatives, Mr. Speaker, 
who will offer this budget on the floor of this House. It does tell us, however, a lot about this President and his priorities. Former Vice President Biden has been known to say: ‘‘Don’t tell me what you value. Show me your budget.’’ President Trump has now shown us his budget, and none of us should be surprised. So now it is up to Democrats and Republicans in this House and in the Senate to work together to agree on a budget resolution and move appropriations bills through regular order. Let us hope we can do that. The American public would expect us to do that, and our country needs us to do that. We must not disinvest in those things that have made America great and will enable us to lay the groundwork for another century of American leadership. 
b1015 REMEMBERING U.S. MARINE CORPS LANCE CORPORAL MARC LUCAS TUCKER The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. KELLY ) for 5 minutes. Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I am humbled to rise today in the memory of United States Marine Corps Lance Corporal Mark Lucas Tucker, who was killed on June 8, 2005, in a nonhostile vehicle accident on Alternate Supply Route Uranium in Iraq. Lance Corporal Tucker, a Pontotoc, Mississippi, native, was assigned to the 9th Engineer Support Battalion, 3rd Force Service Support Group, III Marine Expeditionary Force, Okinawa, Japan, attached to the 2nd Force Service Support Group, II Marine Expeditionary Force, Forward. Lance Corporal Tucker’s mother, Donna Bagwell, is seated in the gallery today. She said her son wanted to be a marine from the time he was a little boy. He wanted to follow in the footsteps of his grandfather, who also served in the Marine Corps. In 2003, Lance Corporal Tucker enlisted in the United States Marine Corps. In 2005, he volunteered to go to Iraq to protect our Nation in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Mrs. Bagwell said her son planned to stay in the United States Marine Corps until retirement and make it a career. ‘‘He loved America,’’ Mrs. Bagwell said, ‘‘He loved the Marine Corps and everything about it.’’ Lance Corporal Tucker is survived by his parents, Kelly and Donna Bagwell, and Mark Tucker; and siblings, Christy Irby, Pam Bolen, and Terry Bagwell. Lance Corporal Tucker demonstrated the characteristics that make us all proud to be Americans, and we honor his service and his life. Semper fi, Lance Corporal Tucker. 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise, as we enter this Memorial Day weekend, to recognize all of those great Americans who have given their lives for the freedoms that we enjoy. This Nation can never forget those who preserved our Nation and died way too soon. God bless all those who have died in defense of this great Nation, and God bless America. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded that it is not in order to refer to an occupant in the gallery. f 
REMEMBERING SENATOR RALPH A. HUNT, SR. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. BUTTERFIELD ) for 5 minutes. Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and work of a dear friend, a North Carolina giant, the Honorable Ralph A. Hunt, Sr.: a community leader, businessman, educator, former North Carolina State Senator; and a devoted husband, father, grandfather, and friend. Mr. Speaker, Ralph Hunt was a resident of Durham County, North Carolina, a county that Congressman DAVID PRICE and I proudly represent. He was my constituent. Mr. Speaker, Ralph Hunt was also a native of my congressional district, having grown up in an adjoining county called Granville County, North Carolina. He was the seventh of eight children born in 1932 to Johnnie and Amanda Harris Hunt. As a young student at Mary Potter High School in Oxford, North Carolina, which was the only high school for African Americans during those days, Ralph grew up during the period of legal and forced segregation in the South, which helped lay the foundation for Ralph and others like him to get an education. Mary Potter High School was a nationally renowned high school for African Americans. Ralph Hunt, Sr., went on to further his education at Johnson C. Smith University in Charlotte, North Carolina, which is a Presbyterian school. He was drafted into the United States Army during his junior year in school, but he was honorably discharged 2 years later from the United States Army. He then returned to North Carolina to complete his college education, earning a degree in mathematics in 1956. After spending many years as an educator at Mary Potter High School and Hillside High School, Ralph was elected to the Durham City Council. He was one of only two African Americans serving on the city council at that time. His fellow council members selected him to serve as mayor pro tempore. Ralph was then elected to the North Carolina State Senate in 1985 and served many years. During his tenure, Senator Hunt was a true statesman who led with conviction. He served as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, served as majority whip, and a member of the Joint Legislative Commission on Government Operations. He introduced the legislation that changed the election law in North Carolina to allow a 40 percent threshold to avoid a runoff in a primary. In 1993, Senator Hunt was appointed by thenGovernor Jim Hunt to the prestigious North Carolina Utilities Commission, where he would serve as its chair. Ralph Hunt, Sr., retired from the North Carolina Utilities Commission in 2001 and returned to the State Senate very briefly from 2004 to 2005. Ralph’s career in public service should serve as a marker we can all strive to meet. He was a visionary who helped bring the Durham community to be the economic leader that it is today. Ralph Hunt, Sr., achieved many great things in his life, but his greatest achievement, Mr. Speaker, was his loving family: his dear wife of more than 50 years, Rebecca; and his three children, Ralph, Jr., Reginald, and Regina. Mr. Speaker, the city of Durham, the county of Durham, and the State of North Carolina all shine brighter because of the life and work of Senator Ralph Hunt, Sr. We will miss him dearly, but his legacy lives on. Everything God gave to Ralph, he gave it back to his family and to his community. I said those words at his memorial service the other day, and I say it now from the well of the U.S. House of Representatives: Everything that God gave to Ralph Hunt, Sr., he gave it back to his family and to his community. Mr. Speaker, in just a few moments, after the next Republican speaker, my dear friend and colleague, Congressman DAVID PRICE, who was also a dear friend of Ralph Hunt, Sr., will give additional remarks in tribute to this great leader. 
HONORING CAPTAIN AMY LYNN SVOBODA The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. MCSALLY ) for 5 minutes. Ms. MCSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Captain Amy Lynn Svoboda, my friend, A–10 squadron mate, and pioneer. Amy grew up in Illinois and graduated from the Air Force Academy in 1989, serving as a cocaptain of the volleyball team. She attended pilot training, then served as a T–37 instructor pilot before coming to Davis Monthan Air Force Base to become an A–10 pilot in 1996. Amy was 1 of only 14 female fighter pilots in the Air Force at the time, and I got to know her when she joined me in the 354th Fighter Squadron Bulldogs as the second female pilot ever in that unit. Amy was quickly wellrespected as a pilot and an officer, and well liked by so many. Her positive personality was infectious, and her dedication to excellence was a model to us all. She specifically inspired me as an example of how 
to be a woman warrior without losing herself in the tough environment of a fighter squadron. It was a relief and a blessing to finally have a wing woman. On the dark, moonless night of May 27, 1997, during a tactical training mission with night vision goggles on the Barry Goldwater Air Force Range, Amy paid the ultimate sacrifice while serving her country. I was on the range that night, and I remember like it was yesterday the deafening silence when I called her repeatedly on the radio in the hopes that she ejected before her A–10 crashed. Our hopes were dashed, and Amy’s extraordinary life was snuffed out with so much potential ahead. Her service and sacrifice is not forgotten. After the tragic accident, the Air Force finally invested in changing the lighting in all A–10 cockpits to be fully NVG compatible, likely saving lives. Those of us who served with her continue to be inspired by her example and her legacy. Generations of young girls will fly in the jet stream that she forged as a pioneering aviator. I cannot believe that it has been 20 years since that night. On Saturday, we will honor Captain Svoboda’s service, bravery, and sacrifice with her family and friends, just 2 days before Memorial Day. Thank you, Amy, for your willingness to fight for our freedoms. We will never forget the price that you paid. 
REMEMBERING SENATOR RALPH A. HUNT, SR. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. PRICE) for 5 minutes. Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join my colleague, Mr. BUTTERFIELD , in honoring the life of a towering figure in North Carolina politics, Senator Ralph Hunt, Sr., of Durham. I first got to know Senator Hunt early in my political career when I was chairman of the North Carolina Democratic Party. Ralph was already a business and community leader in Durham, having served in the U.S. Army, taught in Durham city schools, started a career in business, and served as one of the first AfricanAmerican members of the city council, where he served from 1975 to 1985, including 3 years as mayor pro tempore. Ralph was a genial, energetic, and beloved leader. He was also a tireless advocate for the needs of the people of Durham—all of the people. It is no coincidence that the city has undergone a renaissance over the course of Ralph’s long career. He served as executive director of the Durham Business and Professional Chain for over a decade. He provided leadership to the Mutual Savings and Loan Association, which provided vital access to capital for many Durham residents; and to the Downtown Durham Revitalization Foundation board, which helped pave the way for the thriving downtown we see today. Ralph, of course, is best known, as my colleague has noted, for his service in the North Carolina Senate from 1985 to 1993, and again from 2004 to 2005. He held various leadership positions in our caucus, and he mentored a new generation of progressive elected officials. The North Carolina Senate still bears the mark of his leadership. In the intervening years, between those years of service in the Senate, he served with distinction on the North Carolina Utilities Commission. More recently—and I respect the fact that Ralph took this on late in his life—he assumed the challenge of chairing the Durham Committee on the Affairs of Black People at a critical juncture for that organization. In fact, Ralph always stepped up to the plate and always took on challenges when he was needed. He was an exemplary citizen. He was also a devoted husband, a loving father and grandfather, and a community leader who will long be remembered in Durham and throughout our State. As we mourn his passing, we give thanks for his life of strong citizenship and service. f 
CREATING AWARENESS ON POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN ) for 5 minutes. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to highlight a problem that impacts one in every nine women in our Nation today: postpartum depression. As you can see on this poster, the condition can impact any mother, regardless of background or regardless of circumstance. Warning signs often include: feeling overwhelmed, changes in sleep patterns, unexplained anger, weeping or sadness, difficulty concentrating, unexplained changes in appetite, and feeling anxious or nervous. Fortunately, if you are a new mother—and you don’t have to go through this alone, remember this—there are great organizations in my community in south Florida, like Postpartum Support International. They have dedicated staff and volunteers who are ready to listen, to help, and to provide you with the resources and the referrals that you need to overcome this condition and get back to enjoying your family. I would like to encourage every new mom in south Florida who may be experiencing any of these conditions to please get the help that you need now by calling 1–844–642–6667. Together, we can end postpartum depression in south Florida and, indeed, around our Nation. b1030 
Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize Joseph ‘‘Pepe’’ Badia for his commitment to expand educational opportunities for our south Florida students. Pepe’s latest philanthropic venture allowed for the establishment of a scholarship at my alma mater, Miami Dade College, in the name of its president, Eduardo Padron. Pepe Badia came to Miami at a young age, just like I did and so many others at that time, fleeing the regime of Castro. His father began a new business in a small storefront in Miami, where he and Pepe, by themselves, packaged spices by hand and distributed them to local bodegas around the city. Today, that small storefront has grown into an international giant known as Badia Spices. Pepe Badia has used his success to truly make a difference in our community, regularly donating portions of sales to many local and national charities and scholarships. I join with the Miami Dade College familia, but, truly, all of south Florida, in thanking Pepe Badia for making our paradise an even groovier place in which to live. WISHING JAY KISLAK A HAPPY 95TH BIRTHDAY  
Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to honor and wish a happy 95th birthday to Jay Kislak, a valued member of our south Florida community who has dedicated himself to preserving the history of our great Nation. Jay Kislak began his career as a real estate agent at the young age of 18, a trade he learned from his father who instilled within him the value of hard work, persistence, and attention to detail. Jay left his hometown of Hoboken, New Jersey, to pursue higher education at the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School of Finance. Jay Kislak graduated early to enlist in the United States Navy, serving as a naval aviator for 3 years of Active Duty, followed by 10 years of service in the Naval Reserve. The great State of Florida welcomed Jay Kislak and his family in 1953 with a promise of a better future, and it beckoned the young entrepreneur to seek our new business ventures. It was in south Florida that Jay grew his father’s humble business into the national real estate giant that it is today, with residential and industrial properties spanning from Florida to Nevada. Jay Kislak’s immense success allowed him the opportunity to explore his true passion: the history and culture of the early Americas. Jay, along with his wife, Jean, established the Jay I. Kislak Foundation to advance knowledge and understanding of world cultures and history. The Kislak Foundation’s impressive collections include oneofakind maps, books, letters, paintings, and many other artifacts. In the 50 years that Jay dedicated to collecting these rare treasures, he assembled one of the world’s best and most significant private collections of documents and artifacts related to the 
early Americas. Recognizing the significance of his impressive collection, Jay made an extraordinary gift in the year 2004 to our Library of Congress and to the American people with a contribution of 4,000 items, which are now on display permanently. The Library of Congress estimates that over 3 million visitors have visited this magnificent exhibit made possible by the generous donation of the Jay I. Kislak Foundation. Because of Jay’s extensive background in and knowledge of our great Nation’s history, he has served on numerous boards and has held many leadership posts in our community. Throughout all of his success, Jay Kislak never ceases to give back to our local institutions. His latest contribution to south Florida is the establishment of two new permanent exhibits at the University of Miami’s Otto Richter Library and at Miami Dade College’s Freedom Tower. I join with many in saying thank you to Jay Kislak and his family for his decades of hard work and dedication that he has given to bring the world these magnificent historical artifacts. Thank you, Jay Kislak, and many more years. 
ASIAN PACIFIC HERITAGE MONTH The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. COSTA ) for 5 minutes. Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about Asian Pacific Heritage Month. In May of each year, we come together to celebrate the Asian and Pacific heritage cultures that have made up America for generations. It is time to recognize those important significant roles that Asian Americans play in our American story. We are very lucky in the San Joaquin Valley to have a community rich with culture and ethnic diversity. Our AsianAmerican and Pacific Islander neighbors are an integral part of that richness. From the Chinese Americans, who helped build the transcontinental railroad in the 1860s, to the Japanese American farmers, who cultivated our valley in the early 1900s, to the Hmong and Vietnamese Americans who joined our community beginning in the late 1970s and 1980s after the Vietnam War, these Asian communities all have an important story that have added value to our country. As we reflect upon Asian Pacific Heritage Month, I am proud to join all Asian Americans and the Pacific Islanders in my district and across our country in celebration. So let me thank all of our Asian Americans for their contributions to our country. 
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak about the significance of Memorial Day this coming weekend, which we will celebrate across our Nation. This weekend, I will have the honor and the privilege to participate in three Memorial Day ceremonies in my district. We will pause to memorialize and thank those American servicemen and women who have made the ultimate sacrifice and to mourn the loss with their families. Words, for me, never seem adequate to express a profound thankyou, having members of families and my own family that have served and that have made those sacrifices, for these men and women are our heroes. They gave America the most precious thing they had: the last full measure of devotion to country. Because they did, we are who we are today: a free and prosperous nation that is reflected around the world in most positive ways. Our valley and our Nation owe an immeasurable debt of gratitude to these individuals and their families who so selflessly answered the call of duty, and our Nation can never, ever say thank you enough. Their sacrifice, bravery, therefore, must never, ever be forgotten. We must continue to work on behalf of veterans and their families. Whether it is cutting through red tape with their veterans’ claims or helping with assistance programs or educational benefits, we can always and should do more. As President John F. Kennedy said: ‘‘As we express our gratitude, we must never forget that the highest appreciation is not to utter words, but to live by them.’’ So each day, not just on Memorial Day, we must work to ensure that our veterans and soldiers who today are on Active Duty in harm’s way all around the world and their families receive the benefits that they have earned. On Monday, we will honor and we will remember and we will pledge never to forget, and we will say, in our most humble way, thank you. f 
NATIONAL FOSTER CARE MONTH The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. BACON ) for 5 minutes. Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate May as National Foster Care Month. I also welcome those currently in and alumni of our foster care system, along with our supporters, who are visiting Capitol Hill today. Foster Care Month is a very small way to acknowledge the youth that are a part of the system, along with all of those who make an enormous difference in their lives. This month is about improving the foster care system and providing support to the individuals who selflessly make this system work. The success of our country depends upon the wellbeing of our youth today. We know, through much social research, that family stability is directly linked to less behavioral and academic problems. We have the duty as a nation to empower all children so they can have the same sense of promise and possibility as any other, regardless of their circumstances. National Foster Care Month is a time to celebrate the selfless men and women who embrace children in the foster care system and recommit to helping more youth find permanent families so they can, too, experience stability and the freedom to fulfill their limitless potential. Mr. Speaker, the foster care system has always and will always be near and dear to my heart. My wife, Angie, and I adopted two children, Austin and Jessica, then 8 and 9, respectively, through the foster care system. The idea that children belong in stable families is not only one of the most bipartisan issues I have the privilege of working on, but it is one that is important to me and dear to me. Nothing is more important to a child’s upbringing and longterm success than a loving and stable home. The bedrock of the American story is a strong and supportive family. We must do everything we can to care for all of our youth so they can be free from harm and set up for success so that they might pen our country’s unwritten future. Today I have the honor of being shadowed for the day by Kimberly Grosse of Omaha, Nebraska. Kim was in foster care for 8 years. Starting off in a group home, she was later placed at Boys Town, where she graduated from high school. Kim currently works as a communications specialist, dispatching medical EMS helicopters. She also volunteers her time as a courtappointed special advocate for kids currently in the foster care system. Kim, like so many other alumni of the system, pays it forward with her dedicated support. She is a shining example of determination and perseverance in all aspects of her life. I know that this young lady has an extremely bright future ahead. I also appreciate my colleagues from both sides of the aisle—Representatives KAREN BASS, D IANE BLACK , T RENT  FRANKS , JIMLANGEVIN , BRENDA LAWRENCE , and T OMMARINO —for their leadership in the Foster Care Caucus. I am grateful to fellow Members who help advocate for this important cause. Now, let’s continue to embrace the spirit that every child matters and continue to work toward providing all of our sons and daughters an equal opportunity to lead productive and fulfilling lives, not limited to anything but their hopes, dreams, imagination, and perseverance. I salute all of those who are supporters of the foster care system. I also just want to add, I know, firsthand, when you see your foster children grow to be healthy, successful, independent, and loving adults that you gain a tremendous sense of satisfaction and thankfulness. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP’S BUDGET IS A SHORTSIGHTED PLAN The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida (Mr. LAWSON ) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. LAWSON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, once again, President Trump’s budget calls for extreme cuts to vital programs that are funding for the Nation’s poor, for healthcare, food stamps, student loans, and disability payments. It is a very shortsighted plan that seeks to break the situation that exists for those who can least afford it, while giving tax breaks to the wealthy in our country. In my district, one in every four Floridians have been on food stamps for some point over the last 12 months. This is twice the national average. It is really unconscionable for the President to propose cutting nutrition benefit programs by $192 billion because that would mean less to those in north Florida who need it the most. SNAP programs that benefit the needy are so important. We have kids in north Florida, which I have had the personal opportunity to witness, in school programs, and probably the only meal that they are going to get is at school where they come and don’t have an opportunity to get another meal at home. We put hardworking Floridians in a nowin position, having to choose between paying their light bills or affordable healthcare. This is totally unacceptable in America. This budget calls for slashing $800 billion from Medicaid over the next decade and $72 billion for disability benefits, which are so important. There is no way that we should be encouraging people who are disabled to go out and work to earn their benefits. Did you know, Mr. Speaker, that almost 40 percent of lowincome women in America who are between the age of 15 and 49 years use Medicaid to pay for their healthcare needs? And in my home State, Florida, 50 percent of those pregnancies are paid for by Medicaid. Who will make up the difference? The need will not magically disappear, as most people think. This is a shortsighted budget and one that eliminates programs that particularly are geared toward protecting the poor. That is what our job should be in government: to make sure that we protect those and speak for those who cannot speak for themselves. At this time, when we need to be working to make college more affordable and accessible in order to prepare the next generation of tomorrow’s leaders, this is counterproductive to be cutting financial assistance to these students. b1045 The President is proposing deep cuts to our Nation’s poorest urban and rural communities, which would shrink the supply of affordable housing and increase homelessness and other hardships across this country. I personally have been touring areas in my district where HUD has failed these communities. The budget continues corporate welfare to Wall Street, and what is so amazing is that Wall Street doesn’t receive those cuts. The people who receive the cuts are the ones who need it the most. An inspiring and most hopeful past President once said that the defining challenge of our time is making sure that our economy works for every working American. This budget cut does not put us on the path of tackling these challenges. I believe that our Nation’s budget should reflect our own values as a society, but it does not align with the values of the Fifth Congressional District, and, therefore, I intend to strongly oppose this budget. We need to remember that all of the issues we debate on this floor, from healthcare to the President’s budget, to America’s role in the Middle East, and our borders, foreign policies, those issues have an effect on all of our constituents. While some of our colleagues seem to only want to have political perks, sound bites in the media back home, I implore them to remember this simple fact: The work we do here matters to every person in America, not to just those who vote for us. It is important that as we approach this budget, Mr. Speaker, that we think about those who are less fortunate. 
HUMAN TRAFFICKING The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK ) for 5 minutes. Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to the statistics of human trafficking, and they are shocking: an estimated 21 million victims globally, a quarter of them children, and the majority of them women, resulting in a $150 billion criminal industry predicated on the destruction of lives. This criminal conduct may seem a world away, but it is not. It exists right here in our own backyards. Just last year, the human trafficking hotline reported 151 cases of human trafficking in our State of Pennsylvania. This week the House can—and must— act in a bipartisan fashion to support and bolster antihuman trafficking programs, upgrading our Nation’s response to this crime. By empowering nonprofits like NOVA and the Bucks Coalition Against Trafficking, and ensuring our local law enforcement’s ability to identify and prosecute those cases, these bills will provide services to victims of human trafficking and aid in apprehending the world’s worst offenders. 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Bucks County Sheriff’s Deputy Keith Clymer of Kintnersville, who our community lost last week when his motorcycle was struck by another vehicle. Deputy Clymer joined the Bucks County Sheriff’s Office in 2013, and he was assigned to the domestic relations warrant unit. He also served as a self defense tactics instructor. As the sheriff’s office noted in the announcement of his tragedy, Keith was liked by all who met and worked with him and will be sorely missed by all. Mr. Speaker, the loss of any member of our law enforcement community is heartbreaking, but the loss of Deputy Clymer, as we recognize National Police Week, both here in our Nation’s Capital and around my district, draws special focus to those who serve and protect our communities. My thoughts and prayers are with his sons, his family, and all those who Keith impacted, both personally and professionally. He lived his life serving and protecting us. For that, Mr. Speaker, we are eternally grateful. f 
NATIONAL FOSTER CARE MONTH The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. CASTOR ) for 5 minutes. Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of National Foster Care Month, and I am pleased to welcome Yves Luma and Anabel SanchezSenofonte for the Sixth Annual Congressional Foster Youth Shadow Day. I would also salute Congresswoman KAREN BASS, who is the most outspoken, energized advocate for foster youth anywhere in America. I am very proud of Yves and Anabel. They are an inspiration for all of us. Yves has persisted in the face of true adversity and is now a firstgeneration college student at Florida State University. She was born in Haiti, faced challenges at a young age that most of us will never understand. Not being able to count on a stable home environment in Haiti, Yves, with her younger siblings, moved around between extended family and friends before moving to the United States. Once in the United States, Yves did not have a consistent home. Yet through everything, she persevered, working to provide for her younger siblings while continuing her high school education at Plant High School and Blake High School in Tampa. She carried a heavy burden without parents that no child should have to endure. Due to the hard work and help of her school social workers, Yves was referred to Starting Right, Now, a Tampabased group home for homeless youth who value and desire a higher education. It was this support system and the help of a lot of others that enabled Yves’ talent and drive to catapult her to a promising future. Anabel is 21 years old, also a student at Florida State University, getting a BA in economics and sociology. Anabel grew up in Miami, where she spent most of her life in foster care. She was taken from her mother three times before permanently being removed from her custody. At that point, she entered a group home at about 5 years old. She 
went to a number of group homes before moving in with her parents who adopted her. Foster care was hard because she was separated from her brothers, but she had her sister. But sometimes having that sister around made it tough as well because the sister didn’t know how to read and had severe temper tantrums around her foster care parents, and they were usually taken away because of something her little sister did. So Anabel liked to slide under the radar and focus on school, but she is resilient as well. Now at FSU and working in Tallahassee, she is an Unconquered Scholar. And Unconquered Scholars either have to have experienced homelessness, foster care, or group homes, but now she is on the path to graduate school. And as a lesson for all of us, she advises that: ‘‘I believe that to get the results you want, you must insert yourself into the conversation.’’ That is right around here, Anabel, and we look forward to learning a lot from you here today and in the future. Yves and Anabel are just two of more than 400,000 youth in foster care in America. It is important to recognize the programs, initiatives, and people who contribute to the success of children in the foster care system, but it is tough when they age out. It is really an honor to have these young people here to shadow us on the Hill today, to share their life experiences directly with Congress, to help inform policy that will help them succeed. Their firsthand knowledge experience, and ultimate success, is a great resource, and the best evidence of our Nation’s commitment to providing basic protections to make this the great country that it is. Every child deserves a safe, supportive family, but when that doesn’t happen, it is incumbent upon all of us to help them succeed. And I can’t help but think, the day after President Trump submitted a budget, that really will take us backwards, in this case, and we are not going to let that happen. We are going to stand up and support our foster care kids and all children across America, but that budget is not going to be helpful. In any event, I want to thank Yves and Anabel for joining us today and for having the strength to share their perspectives and insights. Their resiliency is moving, and I hope my colleagues can mirror their bravery and find the will to support capable, bright, young people like Yves and Anabel, and provide them with the tools they need to be successful. 
RECOGNIZING 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BATTLE OF THE CORAL SEA AND LIEUTENANT WILLIAM E. HALL The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. FARENTHOLD ) for 5 minutes. Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 75th anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea, which took place in May 1942, and the heroic actions of sailors and naval aviators like William E. Hall. The Battle of the Coral Sea was the world’s first battle in which aircraft carriers engaged each other; the first sea battle in which neither side could see each other; and the battle that paved the way for the American victory at the Battle of Midway. With the Japanese fleet moving to strengthen its position in the South Pacific and capture Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, the United States, using intercepted signal intelligence, moved to block the Japanese ships as they crossed the Coral Sea. U.S. Admiral Nimitz ordered two aircraft carriers, the USS Yorktown and the USS Lexington and a number of smaller warships into the area. For 4 days, the opposing navies deployed aircraft on bombing runs against enemy ships. On May 7, 1942, Lieutenant Hall flew a SBD Dauntless dive bomber and attacked the Japanese aircraft carrier Shoho until it sank. On May 8, Lieutenant Hall defended the USS Lexington against a Japanese air force attack. Despite piloting a bomber illequipped for aerial combat, and dealing with numerous bullet wounds and shrapnel in his skull, Lieutenant Hall shot down three Japanese planes before landing safely back on the deck of the Lady Lex. When the smoke lifted, more than 650 brave American sailors had died. The enemy destroyed 69 U.S. aircraft. The Yorktown was severely disabled, and the USS Lexington had to be scuttled after taking critical damage. However, the U.S. forces critically damaged many Japanese ships, forcing them to turn back without capturing Port Moresby. Furthermore, the loss of two Japanese ships led to a smaller Japanese force at the Battle of Midway, which is considered a key factor for the United States’ victory there, and turning the tide of World War II. It is considered by historians to be ‘‘the most stunning and decisive blow in the history of naval warfare.’’ For his ‘‘extreme courage, and conspicuous heroism in combat, above and beyond the call of duty as a pilot,’’ Lieutenant Hall was presented the United States military’s highest honor, the Medal of Honor. While the original USS Lexington ended up on the ocean floor, its legacy lived on in a new aircraft carrier, also named the Lexington, which served the U.S. Navy from 1943 to 1991. The new Lexington now serves as a floating museum in Corpus Christi Bay where visitors can explore and learn about its storied past in conflict zones across the world. Additionally, Lieutenant Hall’s daughter Gwen, a Navy veteran herself, serves as a volunteer on the ship to share the history of its namesake in the Battle of the Coral Sea and her father’s action. Now, 75 years later, we remember the historic battle and, more importantly, those who served on the original Lexington, fought in the Battle of the Coral Sea, and helped ensure that the Japanese and Axis powers would never overtake the South Pacific. CONGRATULATIONS TO CALALLEN HIGH SCHOOL ’S 
Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the incredible career of the winningest Texas high school football coach in history, Calallen High School’s Phil Danaher. Coach Danaher was born in Missouri, but his family quickly moved to south Texas. He played football at Harlingen High School before receiving a scholarship to play at Angelo State University. After graduating in 1971, Coach Danaher became an assistant coach in San Antonio. In 1974, he landed his first headcoaching job in Dilley, Texas, and 4 years later, he moved on to become the head coach at HamshireFannett High School. In 1984, Coach Danaher took on the challenge of turning around the football program at Calallen High School, which had not reached the playoffs in 28 years. Thirtythree years later, Coach Danaher has led the Wildcats to 32 straight playoff appearances; 19 district championships; 11 trips to the State semifinals; and 2 State championships. In Coach Danaher’s 43 seasons of coaching, his overall record stands at 432 wins, 108 losses, and 4 ties. Coach Danaher’s recordbreaking success is a testament to his hard work and the thousands of lives he has touched while coaching the Wildcats. Mr. Speaker, I offer my congratulations to Coach Danaher, his family, and everyone at Calallen High School. 
b1100 NATIONAL FOSTER YOUTH MONTH The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California (Ms. BASS) for 5 minutes. Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, May is the month when people come together across the country to acknowledge the half million young people in the Nation’s child welfare system. This is National Foster Youth Month. The child welfare system is designed to protect children whose parents or caretakers have abused or neglected them. I am proud to say that Members of the bipartisan Congressional Caucus on Foster Youth are hosting over 100 young adults from 98 different congressional districts from the National Foster Youth Institute. I thank all of the Members of Congress who are allowing a young adult to shadow them this morning. They are here today on the Hill shadowing Members of Congress to share their stories, their challenges, their successes, and to help us understand how to improve the child welfare system. 
On Monday evening, the National Foster Youth Institute had a forum in which we were able to hear from many of the youth. They raised several issues. The young adults have already accomplished a lot in their life, and many are here to learn about the Capitol, their Members of Congress, the legislative process, but also to teach us. Here are several of the issues that the young folks raised on Monday: One individual raised the challenge of being raised in the system and being separated from his siblings. He said that he had six siblings, and even had a twin. It was very sad and upsetting to him when his twin was sent to one city and he had to live in another city. It took him many months to reestablish a relationship with his siblings. Another individual told us about her parents having a drug problem. She didn’t understand why she was removed and why her parents weren’t helped. In fact, she felt as though the court system used her as leverage over her parents in a way, to tell her parents that they should sober up if they wanted to retain custody. She then told us that the result was both of her parents passed away. She believed that they passed away from their addiction, and that one of the things that made their addiction worse was the fact that she had to be removed from the parents. Another individual raised the issue of sex trafficking. We have been discussing legislation in the House. We have passed several bills related to sex trafficking. But one of the things that many Members of Congress have grown to be aware of over the last few years is that a large percentage of underage girls, and some boys, who get caught up in sex trafficking are actually foster youth that have fallen through the cracks. Any time a foster youth falls through the cracks, the government is responsible. When we remove children from their parents, we, meaning the government, become the parents and we are responsible for them. So we are working on legislation to improve that. Another individual raised the issue that she was adopted, but the adoption didn’t work out. She asked: Why don’t social workers follow up after a child has been adopted, just to make sure that everything is okay? That adoption didn’t work out, and she had a lot of challenges afterwards. Another individual told us, in no uncertain terms, that, although many young people come to the Capitol and volunteer in internships, foster youth would love to be here and participate in internships as well, but when foster youth turn 18 and become an adult, we—essentially meaning the government again—wash our hands of them and put them out on the street. How can a young person volunteer? They need to be paid. She raised the issue that we should have interns at the Capitol, but they should be paid. Those were very important issues and they all raise areas of policy that need to be addressed. I am very honored and fortunate to have three outstanding young individuals with me. I want to tell you about them. Doniesha Thomas is from Los Angeles. She was in foster care for 20 years. She aged out of the system, but during the time she was in foster care, she was moved seven different times. She grew up in Los Angeles. She was in a foster home with her sister and brother. She was fortunate that her siblings were able to be kept together. She described her experience in the foster home wasn’t the best. She said that, sadly, her foster mother was abusive mentally, physically, and emotionally. She eventually left the home and then had to move from place to place, but she persevered and is currently a college student at Los Angeles Trade Tech. She is majoring in the administration of justice and minoring in paralegal studies. It is her dream to be a probation officer for juveniles. She also hopes to one day open up a group home so that, growing up in the system and knowing what the problems are, she can start a program where she addresses those problems. The second individual, Leonardo Jimenez, is 21 years old. He is also from Los Angeles. He was recently aged out of foster care. He decided to participate in the program because, as he gets older, he wants to learn to be a part in helping foster youth in his community. The last individual is Michael Rogalski. He is from Ohio. He was in foster care for 5 years and had 13 different placements, but he is succeeding in Ohio, working in the area of child support. Mr. Speaker, I hope that we remember the foster youth in our country this month. 
HONORING DR. TOD BURNETT ON HIS RETIREMENT The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. MIMIWALTERS ) for 5 minutes. Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Dr. Tod Burnett, who is retiring as president of Saddleback College in Mission Viejo, California. Since 2008, when Dr. Burnett was named the ninth president of Saddleback, he has transformed the college into one of the top higher education institutions in California and the country. Over the last 9 years, Dr. Burnett established partnerships with local school districts, supported adult education programs, and pioneered the development of comprehensive support services for veterans, ActiveDuty military, and their families. Prior to his time at Saddleback, Dr. Burnett was appointed to several government positions, serving in the administrations of a U.S. President, a Governor, and mayor. He also served as vice chancellor of the California Community Colleges, the largest higher education system in the Nation. More importantly, Dr. Burnett’s involvement in the community outside of work has left a lasting impression on those who know him. He has mentored veterans, personally funded student trips to Washington, and dedicated resources to various programs throughout the region. Dr. Burnett’s generosity and commitment to his community and career has transformed the lives of countless individuals at Saddleback College and throughout Orange County. Mr. Speaker, I thank Dr. Burnett for his decades of work and dedication to service of the people of California, and I wish him well during his muchdeserved retirement. f 
PRESIDENT’S PROPOSED BUDGET The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN ) for 5 minutes. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to announce that my foster shadow, Shaderra Riddick, who is a Rutgers student studying anthropology, is with me today in the gallery. I am delighted to have her with me, and I offer these remarks on her behalf. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask a simple question to my colleagues here who support President Trump’s budget proposal: What kind of America do you envision? What kind of America do you envision when you support proposed tax plans that line the pockets of Wall Street investors, yet raise taxes for the working men and women struggling to make ends meet. What kind of America do you envision when you support rewarding corporations that willfully and admittedly evade American tax laws by stashing profits overseas and, even with proposed tax amenities, still punish their rankandfile employees that can’t save because they are paid below a living wage? What kind of America do you envision when you proudly support the elimination of Federal agencies that protect our workers from discrimination or subject our children to an environment that is unhealthy and harmful to their health? The President’s budget proposal released yesterday is built on heartless cuts to Medicaid; SNAP; Social Security disability insurance benefits; additional income for poor seniors, disabled adults, and children; and public assistance for needy families. It threatens regular Americans’ ability to buy a home and the ability for that home to even be an investment worth the risk. Mr. Speaker, sadly, this budget is the latest in a series of actions that begs 
the question: What kind of America do my Republican colleagues and the President envision for our future? One where the investor class thrives, but the majority of workingclass Americans suffer? One where our environment provides temporary profits, but irreparable harm? One where we make a promise to seniors while they work hard to build and sustain our economy, but, upon retirement, snatch away their investments, along with any safety net? Mr. Speaker, I envision a different America. I envision an America where an honest day’s work, no matter where you clock in, deserves a living wage. I envision an America where my granddaughter, Kamryn, will make the same amount as your grandson for the same work. I envision an America where we double down on our investment in public education, and where we double down on our investment in this country’s future. I envision a country where commonsense gun legislation limits the opportunity for tragedy to strike in our schools and churches at the hands of hatred and bigotry. The America I am working toward is an America that celebrates the richness of our diversity, seeks to right past wrongs, an America to be envied. Mr. Speaker, I refuse to concede that we were too divided along this aisle that we can’t create new, goodpaying jobs, educate our kids, train our workers, create jobs for those workers, and create an America ripe with new opportunity for all. Mr. Speaker, the America I envision, the America I believe in, the America that we deserve is within our reach. Unfortunately, that America is threatened, ignored, and displaced with this President’s budget proposal. So, again, I ask this question of the President and of my Republican colleagues who will support this callous and shameful budget proposal: What kind of America do you envision, and when will you stand up and fight for the America we all deserve? The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. MIMIWALTERS of California). Members are reminded to address their remarks to the Chair and that it is not in order to introduce occupants in the gallery to the House. 
BIG BANK BAILOUTS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. DUNCAN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, in my 29 years in Congress, the issue on which I heard the most from constituents in the shortest time was on the big bank bailouts of several years ago. When that was before us, I received 6,600 emails in one weekend just in my Washington office from Friday, when the office closed, until Monday, when we opened back up. This, of course, was in addition to the many thousands of phone calls, letters, and emails that came in during the week before and the week after. I opposed that big bank bailout, but, of course, extremely big business won again and the Congress voted for the bailout. Three years ago, in 2014, I wrote the following in a newsletter to my 760,000 constituents: ‘‘A few weeks ago, George Mason University released a report saying that ‘since the financial crisis, U.S. banking assets and deposits have continued to consolidate in a handful of large banks.’ The five largest banks now hold 44 percent of U.S. banking assets compared to 23.5 percent in early 2000. Liberals in Congress passed the DoddFrank law, which I opposed, supposedly to get back at the banks that caused our most recent financial troubles. The George Mason report also said the DoddFrank law is ‘disproportionately burdensome to small banks’ and ‘creates a market expectation that designated firms are too big to fail.’ Columnist Veronique de Rugy wrote that ‘the number of small banks has dropped dramatically over the years,’ and this has been ‘driven by regulatory burdens that make it hard and expensive for small banks to survive.’ I have been told by several east Tennessee bankers that, unfortunately, their fastestgrowing departments have been their regulatory compliance sections. The more any business or industry comes under Federal regulation, the more it ends up being dominated by extremely big business.’’ Now, to update what I wrote in 2014. According to the Congressional Research Service, 1,744 banks have ceased to exist since the passage of Dodd Frank. Many of those have been forced to merge with a bigger bank because they simply were not able to keep up with all the rules, regulations, and red tape of DoddFrank and the resulting compliance costs. b1115 Even worse, 203 small banks have failed—been forced out of business by Big Government—with a resulting huge loss of jobs and lost investment by stockholders. In addition, nationally, 160 credit unions have closed. Either they failed or were forced to consolidate with a bigger credit union. Thus, DoddFrank, as most Federal regulatory legislation, ended up helping the big giants and hurting the little guys— the smallest banks and credit unions. In a study by Hester Peirce and Robert Greene, the authors wrote: ‘‘Regulatory compliance can be a particular challenge for small banks with limited compliance expertise. Regulatory expenses absorb a larger percentage of small banks’ budgets than of their larger counterparts’ budgets. As financial regulation has increased, so has banking concentration. The Dodd Frank Act, passed in 2010, imposes a new set of regulations that are disproportionately burdensome to small banks. Moreover, by designating the largest financial institutions as ‘systemically important,’ DoddFrank creates a market expectation that designated firms are too big to fail and generates funding and other competitive advantages for the largest U.S. banks.’’ Liberals, Madam Speaker, often claim that they are for the little guys, and most Federal laws are well intended. But there is a saying to ‘‘beware of the tyranny of good intentions.’’ Every industry that is highly federally regulated almost ends up in the hands of a few big giants. Federal regulators should start trying to help out the smallest business instead of always ending up helping extremely big business. That is something that happens in almost every business and industry in this country, and it needs to be reversed. f 
REMEMBERING RICHARD WILBUR COLLINS III The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. BROWN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Madam Speaker, Richard Wilbur Collins III was ready to graduate from Bowie State University yesterday. He just finished Army ROTC, was airborne qualified, and was just commissioned a second lieutenant in the United States Army’s intelligence branch. His father is a Navy veteran, and Richard wanted to follow in his footsteps and commit his life to serving our Nation. He was ambitious and driven. His calling was to protect our country and to do what is right and just. He loved soccer and lacrosse. He was the top runner in his ROTC unit. His Facebook page was filled with selfies with his friends. He was active in his church. His friends and family said that he had a loving and giving heart and would go out of his way to try and help others. On Saturday morning, while waiting for an Uber ride with two friends at the University of Maryland, he was approached by another student who demanded that he ‘‘Step left. Step left if you know what is best for you.’’ Richard simply replied, ‘‘no.’’ The other student stabbed him in the chest and fled. Richard died in the hospital. His bright future was stolen. His parents were robbed of their son. Our hearts are broken. This tragedy exposes a dangerous rising tide. This incident was not some random act of violence. It was a heinous, despicable, and unprovoked crime of hate. Richard Collins’ murderer—who was from a middle class family, who hung out at the student union and library— was a member of a racist neoNazi group called AltReich Nation. He was not some outsider. He was a homegrown terrorist who was radicalized on the university campus. What is most troubling is this isn’t the first incident of hate at the University of Maryland. This academic year 
alone, there have been antiimmigrant chalkings, racist fliers, threats, and, less than a month ago, there was a noose found inside a campus fraternity house. But this isn’t just a troubling trend at the University of Maryland. There has been an unprecedented spike in racist and hate activity on campuses since November. Posters at the University of Texas implored students to report any and all illegal aliens, that America is a White nation. Another flier, with swastikas, at UCLA read, in part: ‘‘the hordes of our enemies from the Blacks to the Jews are deserving of fates of violence.’’ Hate watch groups have tracked 150 racist incidents on college campuses in 33 States since the fall. Just a year ago, it was such a rarity that no one was even counting. Peddlers of hate are specifically targeting college campuses, declaring that their time has come, and trying to lure students with slogans like ‘‘serve your people’’ and ‘‘our destiny is ours.’’ They are working to translate their online activism to realworld action, and young people are prime targets, in part, because they are still figuring out who they are and what they believe. One would have to be purposefully obtuse to not see a direct line from the recent elections to the emboldening of these perpetrators across the country. Longtime White supremacist Jared Taylor described the November election result as a ‘‘sign of rising White consciousness’’ and that ‘‘now is the time to press our advantage in every way possible.’’ So, today, I am calling on the administration—that has repeatedly failed to denounce the hate crimes directed at Jews, members of the LGBT community, or immigrants—to denounce the hatefueled killing of a Black soldier, Second Lieutenant Richard Collins. The reaction to Collins’ murder is often formulaic. We extend our condolences and sympathies, call the killing a senseless tragedy, and proclaim that we won’t tolerate these incidents. That is not good enough. If this escalation of hate is going to end in Maryland and across the country, it will be because all of us take a stand not only against the hard right and hate festering on campus, but to leaders who have been too content to remain silent and look the other way. Hate speech is not protected. Encouraging open academic debate cannot lead to inaction that creates a breeding ground for prejudice, discrimination, and violent hatred on our college campuses or anywhere. Campuses should adopt successful strategies: Consider zerotolerance policies for hateful speech and acts of racism. Maybe if students know that they will be expelled for spreading racial slurs online, they will think twice; Replicate the University of Massachusetts. They have a hate SWAT team that counters hateful messages through an early alert system, a countermessaging response team, and counselors on call; Or promote more diverse voices in the faculty and staff. Pretending that the murder of Richard Collins in cold blood is an isolated incident will only make the situation worse. Diversity and unity—that American melting pot that is the foundation of our Nation—can only happen when the country does a better job confronting hate in all forms. We cannot simply start when students arrive on campus. In the absence of real change, we take to the streets; we protest; we hold vigils. But Richard Collins deserves better. Our children deserve better. Let us work together, and let’s not wait for another tragedy. Farewell and Godspeed, Lieutenant Collins. 
A CALL TO NATIONAL SERVICE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. LARSON ) for 5 minutes. Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Madam Speaker, while I put up a couple of charts here, the most noticeable one is I want to make everybody aware that tomorrow morning at 9 a.m. we will unveil ACTION, a call to national service. It will be carried live streaming on YouTube tomorrow morning, May 25, at 9 a.m. The first poster that I have up here is of General McChrystal. Tomorrow morning, JOHN LEWIS, DORIS MATSUI , JOEKENNEDY , our Senate lead Senator JACK REED from Rhode Island, and General McChrystal, among others, will be at our bill introduction and rollout. General McChrystal has said that we need to create a culture of service, where we are all vested in our Nation’s future and feel a shared sense of responsibility not only to our Nation, but to each other. General McChrystal also said, as was outlined in The Atlantic Monthly, that you don’t have to wear a military uniform to serve your country. But certainly wearing a military uniform in serving your country is an honor, and we commend those men and women who serve for what they do for our country. But many among them, including reservists and the National Guard, are not often eligible for the GI Bill, yet they have done tours of duty and served their Nation extraordinarily well. This Monday, Memorial Day, would be the 100th birthday of John Fitzgerald Kennedy. It is hard to believe that so youthful, so vital, so gracious, so eloquent, and so charismatic a leader was taken from us at such a young age. Yet it was he who gave us this great vision when, in his inaugural address, he said to the citizens of this country: ‘‘In your hands, my fellow citizens, more than mine, will rest the final success or failure of our course. Since this country was founded, each generation of Americans has been summoned to give testimony to its national loyalty. The graves of young Americans who answered the call to service surround this globe. ‘‘Now the trumpet summons us again—not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need—not as a call to battle, though embattled we are—but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle, year in and year out, ‘rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation’—a struggle against the common enemies of man: tyranny, poverty, disease, and war itself.’’ Kennedy was speaking of the Nation when he said: ‘‘Can we forge against these enemies a grand and global alliance, North and South, East and West, that can assure a more fruitful life for all mankind?’’ Then he said to all Americans: ‘‘Will you join in that historic effort?’’ ‘‘And so, my fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for you— ask what you can do for your country.’’ What we propose in this legislation tomorrow we are rolling out is that what you can do for your country is serve it. Whether in the military, the Reserves, or the National Guard, or whether in the Peace Corps, AmeriCorps, or VISTA, you can serve your country; and what your country can do for you in return is to help you get through college and pay off your debt that you have incurred. Rise with us, America, and join us tomorrow as we go on the march and make sure that, in the legacy of President Kennedy, we continue to move this Nation forward. 
b1200 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker at noon. 
PRAYER Pastor Becky Tirabassi, Viewpoint Church, Newport Beach, California, offered the following prayer: Father, I pray for the immediate outpouring of Your Holy Spirit on our Nation and leaders. I pray that not one of us will miss hearing Your voice today. I pray that we would not neglect to ask for Your wisdom. I pray that we would not make decisions without asking Your guidance. Will You go before and behind us? 
Will You give us our marching orders? In this hour of our great need, begin again to help us, as You have in years gone by. Father, You are the God who does immeasurably more than all we could ask or imagine. Today, give us the humility to ask for Your help, and the grand moral courage to be agents of change for the good of others and the honor of Your name. In Your powerful name we ask these things. Amen. 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. CONNOLLY led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
WELCOMING PASTOR BECKY TIRABASSI The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentleman from California (Mr. ROHRABACHER ) is recognized for 1 minute. There was no objection. Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, it is a great honor today to introduce to the House our guest chaplain, Becky Tirabassi, copastor of the Viewpoint Church in Newport Beach, California. Becky became a licensed pastor in 2014, when she and her husband, Dr. Roger Tirabassi, founded the Viewpoint Church. Today, she and her husband give spiritual guidance and personal counseling to members of the Viewpoint Church, but also to people throughout Orange County needing personal and spiritual encouragement. Becky was helping others even before she became a pastor. She is best known as an author of over 15 books, including the bestselling books, ‘‘Change Your Life’’ and ‘‘Little Changes Big Results for Crazy, Busy Couples.’’ She has appeared many times on national television and radio, and for over three decades has spoken before groups in nearly all 50 States, as well as internationally. In addition to her copastorate, she is president of the Becky Tirabassi Change Your Life, Incorporated. Becky and Roger have one married son, who is a grown man, and he has just completed a tour as a missionary in Uganda. For that safe return, we are all grateful. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in welcoming Pastor Becky Tirabassi, and thank her for offering today’s opening prayer in the U.S. House of Representatives. f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today alongside my good friend, Congressman MIKEJOHNSON , to recognize Dr. David Raines, a Louisiana legend in the field of gastroenterology. Dr. Raines has worked with patients across the United States, including a gastroenterology fellowship serving our Nation’s veterans at Walter Reed Army Medical Center here in Washington. Dr. Raines is a pioneer in the field of gastroenterology, and is almost single handedly responsible for bringing free standing endoscopy centers to Louisiana. Because of him, patients can get these important lifesaving procedures in costefficient and convenient outpatient facilities. Dr. Raines is admired among his peers, me being one of those and Congressman JOHNSON being another, not only for his professional accomplishments, but also for the way he has cared for others, including mentoring new doctors attending and entering his field. Congressman JOHNSON and I wanted to take a moment today to thank Dr. Raines for his career of service to patients throughout Louisiana. He has saved many lives, and our State is a better place because of him. 
TRUMP BUDGET AND RURAL AMERICA (Mrs. BUSTOS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, President Trump released his budget. And what he has shown is that rural America is just about at the bottom of his list. His budget is a killer for the Department of Agriculture. The cuts to the rural development program would mean fewer jobs in small towns that are already struggling. While he promised to ‘‘end the war on the family farmer,’’ President Trump slashes funding for the crop insurance program. And in Peoria, his budget would even close the Nation’s largest agricultural research lab, a place for ag innovation that is part of the solution for renewed ag economy. Time and time again, President Trump made a great big promise spelled out on his red ball cap. Now I am left wondering how a budget that would devastate Main Street and our family farmers would make anything great again. Mr. President, middle America is not just flyover country. We value those who look us in the eye, tell us the truth, and then do what they say they are going to do. So, President Trump, I ask you: Does your budget live up to what you spelled out on your ball cap? The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to direct their remarks to the Chair. f 
CONGRATULATING ANNIE RICHARDSON (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to express appreciation for Annie Richardson, press assistant of South Carolina’s Second Congressional District. A native of Alexandria, Virginia, Annie has called South Carolina’s Second Congressional District home since 2004. A distinguished graduate of Hammond School and Presbyterian College, Annie has faithfully served on the staff of the Second Congressional District. Her expertise in photography, graphic design, and videography has made a positive difference, and her sunny disposition is always recognized by constituents visiting the office. It is with mixed blessings, but great happiness, that I bid Annie farewell. She is moving on next week to serve as the digital assistant for the House Republican Conference; fortunately, to be working with conference chair CATHY  MCMORRIS RODGERS . I know she will do a remarkable job supporting the conference. I know her father, Phil, and brother, Emmett, join me in recognizing her achievements. She has served with distinction in the tradition of her late beloved mother, Holly Richardson, who will always be cherished as a devoted staff member of Senate President pro tempore Strom Thurmond. In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. We are grateful for the visit today in Washington of Medal of Honor recipient James Livingston, a Marine general from Mount Pleasant, South Carolina. 
RUSSIA INVESTIGATION (Mr. CONNOLLY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to demand that Congress get serious about the Russia investigation. 
In December, along with Mr. E NGEL  of New York, I introduced the SECURE Our Democracy Act that would sanction any foreign individual or entity found to have unlawfully interfered with our election process. That shouldn’t be a partisan issue, yet all of the bill’s 88 cosponsors are Democrats. I am also a cosponsor of the Protecting Our Democracy Act to establish an independent commission to get to the bottom of the Russia investigation. A recent NBCWall Street Journal poll conducted in April found that 73 percent of our fellow Americans want such an independent commission. They want to get at the truth. So do I. So should all of us. I have signed a discharge petition to get that bill to the floor. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support these two measures, and to bring them to the floor for consideration. It is our constitutional duty to provide oversight of any executive in any executive branch. The American people demand answers and accountability, not obstruction and intimidation. Appointing a special counsel, independent of the White House and the Attorney General, was one way to begin to restore credibility that has been badly tarnished. I urge us to proceed with the Russia investigation with all dispatch. 
FOSTER YOUTH SHADOW DAY (Mr. HILL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge the struggles that foster youth encounter, and to celebrate their perseverance and fortitude as they attempt to navigate this complicated system and transition to adulthood. In Arkansas, we have over 5,000 children currently in the State’s foster care system. I am proud to work with my colleagues on the Congressional Caucus on Foster Youth to shed light on the perpetuation of poverty and dysfunction our current system enables. And I stand proudly in support of House Resolution 314, recognizing May as National Foster Care Month. For the past 2 years, I have had the opportunity to have a former foster youth personally shadow me for a day. What a rewarding experience. This year, I am honored to host Starr Wilson, a former foster youth from my district. After spending 10 years in foster care, Starr, who is full of drive and passion, graduated with honors from the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff. Unlike Starr’s story, though, when many youth across America age out of the system, they find themselves with no place to call home, and they lack the encouragement and structure they need to pursue happiness. Therefore, I am proud to stand with the Congressional Caucus on Foster Youth in praise of the Sixth Annual Foster Youth Shadow Day here on Capitol Hill, which allows these youth to come across our country and share time with Members of Congress, and aspire to be the leaders of generations to come. f 
NATIONAL FOSTER CARE MONTH (Mr. MCNERNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MCNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I am going to follow up on the prior speaker. I rise in support of National Foster Care Month. This month, we renew our commitment to ensuring that the 420,000 youth who are in our Nation’s foster care system have a caring family and the opportunities they deserve. I am proud to be a member of the Foster Youth Caucus, which is devoted to highlighting the efforts of all those involved with improving our Nation’s foster care system. I also rise to celebrate Congressional Foster Youth Shadow Day. Today, more than 100 former foster youth from across the country are in D.C., paired with Members of Congress as we conduct the Nation’s business. I am privileged to host Shantell House and Jeremiah McWright from California. Shantell is currently a student at Mills College and is passionate about current and former foster youth. Jeremiah joins me from San Diego, where he is studying public policy and has the potential to become a great business leader, or even a politician. It gives me great pleasure to welcome Shantell and Jeremiah, along with all of the participants of the Congressional Youth Shadow Day, to our Nation’s capital. 
RECOGNIZING BRITNI BURLINGHAM (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a proud member of the Foster Youth Caucus, and also as part of a family that was involved in the foster care system. Today I have the opportunity to spend time with Britni Burlingham as part of the Annual Foster Youth Shadow Day. Britni is a social work major at Edinboro University in Pennsylvania. She is also a case aide for the Bair Foundation, a nonprofit organization that focuses on foster care and adoption. This profession is rewarding for Britni because she has a firsthand experience. She entered the foster care system when she was just 7 years old. Britni has said that being able to work with children who have had similar experiences to hers is lifechanging. She and her husband also provide a loving home to their two foster daughters. I am grateful that I can spend time today with Britni and hear about her positive experience with foster care. Her adoptive family built a strong foundation for her to achieve success in her own life. Mr. Speaker, this is what foster care is all about. I thank Britni for being here today, sharing her story and helping so many children overcome similar obstacles. Congratulations, Britni. We are all very proud of your success. f 
b1215 TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL BAHAR (Mr. SCHIFF asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Michael Bahar, who will be leaving the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, where he has served as general counsel since September 2012, and as staff director and general counsel since early 2015. Because of Michael’s commitment to always finding a way to ‘‘yes,’’ he has helped guide HPSCI to a run of remarkable legislative success over the past 2 years. In a city of tacticians, Michael’s great gift is his ability to look at things strategically, even while reacting in real time to emerging matters at hand. Under Michael’s leadership of the HPSCI Democratic staff, we have passed two successive bipartisan intelligence authorization acts, both of which received multiple and successively larger vote tallies each time they came to the floor. In June 2015, we passed the USA FREEDOM Act that ended bulk collection of telephony metadata under section 215 of the PATRIOT Act, replacing it with a new regime more protective of Americans’ privacy. And later in 2015, the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 was included as part of the 2016 omnibus spending bill. CISA, which encourages businesses and the Federal Government to share cyber threat information in the interest of national security, could not have been timelier. Neither bill would have been possible without Michael’s tireless efforts. He worked on a broad range of issues with a broad range of stakeholders, in and out of government, and these measures were necessary and effective in securing our liberties. Prior to joining the committee, Michael served with dedication in the Obama White House as Deputy Legal Adviser to the National Security Council staff. He is a Naval reservist supporting U.S. Special Operations Command. After a welldeserved vacation, Michael will embark on a new career as a 
lawyer here in D.C. On behalf of the entire HPSCI family, I want to wish Michael, his wife, Hannah, and their daughter, Rose, the very best, and thank him for his years of service to the Nation. 
CONGRATULATING AND HONORING MIKE FREMONT (Mr. CHABOT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate and honor a great Cincinnatian and avid marathoner, Mike Fremont, for accomplishing something pretty amazing. A little over a week ago, Mike set the world record for his age group at Cincinnati’s Flying Pig HalfMarathon. By the way, he is 95 years old. Thirteen miles at the age of 95. And he had previously held the world record for a 90yearold marathoner, which he set 5 years ago in Huntington, West Virginia. Mike’s passion for running and a healthy lifestyle kicked in when he was only 70 years old and given only 3 months to live after being diagnosed with an advanced form of cancer. I have known Mike since my time on the Cincinnati City Council back 30 years ago, including involvement with the Mill Creek Restoration Project. He is an amazing Cincinnatian and ought to be an inspiration to all who hear of his accomplishments. Congratulations, Mike. You have made all Cincinnatians proud. 
DISCLOSURE OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION (Mrs. MURPHY of Florida asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, the President recently disclosed highly sensitive information to Russian officials, information that had been entrusted to the United States by an ally. This incident has generated concern among national security professionals. Under current law, the President must keep the congressional intelligence committees informed of U.S. intelligence activities. Building on this general mandate, I am filing a bill that would require the President to notify the intelligence committees when a U.S. official, including the President, intentionally or inadvertently discloses topsecret information to a nation that sponsors terrorism or, like Russia, is subject to U.S. sanctions. My bill would deter unjustified disclosure of sensitive information to adversaries. It would also give the congressional intelligence committees an opportunity to examine the rationale for the disclosure, to assess any fallout, and to take appropriate action. My bill would simply provide Congress with the same information that was made available to other nations. I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will support this bill. f 
REFLECTIONS ON MEMORIAL DAY (Mr. DESJARLAIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. DESJARLAIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to reflect on what Memorial Day means to our country. Memorial Day truly is a special occasion in which we honor the brave men and women in uniform who made the ultimate sacrifice. Many from the Volunteer State died on the battlefield to defend our Nation. Because of them, and so many others from across our Nation, we enjoy our freedoms and many blessings. The debt we owe them is immeasurable. But we can honor their memory and make life easier for families of fallen heroes like Lance Corporal Andrew P. Carpenter, from Columbia, Tennessee, who died fighting in Afghanistan. Although his loan provider forgave his student loan debt, Andrew’s family owed taxes on the discharged amount. I introduced the Tax Relief for Our Nation’s Heroes Act to resolve this IRS oversight. Military families should have more peace of mind, which is part of my job on the House Armed Services Committee. I would like to thank all those who have worn the uniform of the U.S. military, and offer my prayers for the safety of thousands now serving in harm’s way. 
SALUTING FALLEN VETERANS ON MEMORIAL DAY (Ms. PLASKETT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of my family and staff, I want to salute and commemorate the fallen veterans of the United States Virgin Islands and throughout the United States as we prepare to celebrate or participate in this Memorial Day observance. Memorial Day is the day our Nation gathers to honor the many men and women who have selflessly defended this country and have paid the ultimate sacrifice in defense of the public and our democratic principles. The Virgin Islands proudly served and sacrificed its sons and daughters to American freedom, even before it was a part of this Nation. Our service history is rich and will continue. After becoming a part of this country 100 years ago this year, we lobbied, petitioned, for the responsibility to be a part of the draft. We shirk not from our duty. The Virgin Islands, along with the other territories, send more men and women per capita to serve in the U.S. military than anywhere in the United States, and have more fallen veterans per capita than anywhere else. I take this opportunity to thank and extend condolences to these men and women, their families, for their bravery, strength, sacrifice, and courage. We as citizens, and as a community, are forever indebted to our servicemen and women. Our resolve is that their sacrifice is not in vain as we continue to fight for liberty and justice for all, both home and abroad. Mr. Speaker, just as we vow to leave no soldier behind on the battlefield, we here in Congress will not forget any veterans when they return home. f 
MEMORIAL DAY (Mr. PITTENGER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PITTENGER. Mr. Speaker, this weekend, America pauses to honor the patriotic men and women who sacrificed their lives in support of our liberty. For many, perhaps, Memorial Day has become just another reason for a cookout. But for more than 11,000 families in North Carolina, Memorial Day is very real. Their son or daughter or spouse or parent is among the 11,000 North Carolinians who died during World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, or Afghanistan. Remembering the price of freedom makes me all the more grateful for the 17 students from my district who this year received appointments to West Point, the U.S. Air Force Academy, and the U.S. Naval Academy. These students, many of them at or near the top of their class, are volunteering to dedicate at least 9 years to defend America. They know the potential risks and the ultimate sacrifice required by many. To the families of those who died in service to our Nation, we extend our deepest sympathy and gratitude. May God bless you. 
HONORING REVEREND DR. WILLIAM J. BARBER II (Ms. ADAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, Walter Lippmann once said that ‘‘The final test of a leader is that he leaves behind him in other men the conviction and the will carry on.’’ Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a great leader, the Reverend Dr. William J. Barber II. As the president of North Carolina’s chapter of the NAACP, Reverend Barber has become a national icon and a champion of moral leadership. He is the founder of Moral Mondays. He has traveled to more than 20 States to train others on tactics in civil disobedience. And under his leadership, the NAACP fiercely fought against discriminatory legislation such as North Carolina’s HB2 and voter suppression tactics like voter ID laws. 
After 12 years as president of the North Carolina NAACP, Reverend Barber is retiring to lead a new campaign—a national call for a moral revival. This new coalition of spiritual leaders will push beyond politics to guide our Nation toward a path of increased equality and social justice. Reverend Barber’s leadership of the NAACP will be sorely missed, but I look forward to witnessing the many ways in which he will continue to impact lives and make America a more just and fair place. Thank you, Reverend Barber. Godspeed. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF DAVE SHAUL (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and memory of one of Illinois’ great journalists, Dave Shaul, who passed away this month at age 75. For decades, Dave provided countless central Illinois residents with their local news as an anchor, producer, and news director at WCIA in Champaign, Illinois. During his storied television and radio broadcast career, Dave covered the biggest local, State, and national news, including covering every Presidential election from 1964 through 2016. Dave was known for his honest and trustworthy coverage of local and national politics. Dave won a number of awards during his career as a journalist. In 1980, he won the UPI Best Television Sports PlaybyPlay Award for his coverage of Illinois basketball. And in 1999, he was honored with the Associated Press Mark Twain Lifetime Achievement Award, was named to the Eastern Illinois University Hall of Fame, and was designated a lifetime member of the Illinois News Broadcasters Association. Dave also received an Emmy Award for his career accomplishments in 2011. Dave leaves a long legacy as a trusted figure on the news and in the ChampaignUrbana community. His family and friends continue to be in my thoughts and prayers. 
MEDIA TARGET PRESIDENT TRUMP (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, from a recent Investor’s Business Daily editorial, a Harvard University study found that ‘‘During the first 100 days of Trump’s Presidency, TV networks CNN, NBC, and CBS provided negative coverage 93 percent, 93 percent, and 91 percent of the time.’’ Meanwhile, ‘‘The New York Times delivered 87 percent negative coverage, while The Washington Post 83 percent and The Wall Street Journal 70 percent were only a bit less negative.’’ ‘‘Trump’s overall score of 80 percent negative coverage during the start of his Presidency compares with Obama’s 41 percent, Bush’s 57 percent, and Bill Clinton’s 60 percent.’’ ‘‘Both the Post and the Times, for instance, have used unnamed sources and even the supposed content of documents that they have never viewed as the basis for major revelations about Trump in recent days. They have let their raw hatred get the better of them. ‘‘Such a media environment is dangerous for American democracy.’’ Expecting basic professionalism from the media, sadly, seems to be too much. f 
COMMUNICATION FROM THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following communication from the Clerk of the House of Representatives: 
PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1973, PROTECTING YOUNG VICTIMS FROM SEXUAL ABUSE ACT OF 2017; PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1761, PROTECTING AGAINST CHILD EXPLOITATION ACT OF 2017; AND PROVIDING FOR PROCEEDINGS DURING THE PERIOD FROM MAY 26, 2017, THROUGH JUNE 5, 2017 Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 352 and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: 
b1230 The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Colorado is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. SLAUGHTER ), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. 
Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Colorado? There was no objection. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the underlying legislation. This rule provides a structured process for debate. I want to highlight that this rule makes in order all amendments submitted to the Rules Committee, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, all of us in this Chamber today support the goals of this legislation. We can and we must do more to protect children from the plague of sexual assault and the prevalence of child pornography permeating society today. I am particularly glad to see such bipartisan support for H.R. 1973. The young athletes that represent the United States on the world’s stage at the Olympics must not be taken advantage of by predatory coaches and doctors who should be mentoring them. In fact, no child anywhere should be taken advantage of; but this bill makes some commonsense changes that strengthen the reporting of abuse and puts in place policies that prevent future violations, and I am hopeful it will become law. It staggers the mind to believe that this assault on those children had gone on for 20 years, and some 400 children were victimized for it, and not a single adult anywhere around ever brought attention to it. In fact, we owe a great newspaper in Indiana for telling us about it, so be sure to read a good newspaper every day. Mr. Speaker, there is a lot of agreement about the goals of the bills before us today, but that wasn’t the case 20 days ago when the majority rushed through its partisan, slapdash healthcare bill repeal to rip away healthcare from millions of people. They passed the bill without holding a single hearing, listening to any experts, or, most importantly, waiting for a score from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The Congressional Budget Office tells us what the bill will cost, how many people it will help, how many people it would hurt, something that, with healthcare, would have been vitally important. But while the lack of a score didn’t prohibit them from holding a vote, it did, apparently, prevent the majority from sending the bill over to the Senate. Mr. Speaker, this process is completely backwards and a major breakdown of the integrity of the legislative process. Most schoolchildren know that, when a bill passes the House, you send it to the Senate. You don’t hide it in a drawer for weeks until you finally get the information from the Congressional Budget Office that you should have had before you brought the bill to the floor for a vote. This is no way to develop a plan that will impact onesixth of the Nation’s gross domestic product, and the process has finally laid bare one of the biggest political hoaxes in recent memory: that notion of repeal and replace. How often did we hear that over the last 7 years? For the last 7 years, the majority voted more than 60 times to undermine the Affordable Care Act without having a thing in the world to replace it with, and now they are pushing the false notion that the Affordable Care Act is collapsing. The reality is that some States dealing with limited insurers never implemented the full benefits of the law or enacted the exchange under the Affordable Care Act, which would have cut their costs. Mr. Speaker, one of my proudest moments as a Member of Congress was chairing the House Rules Committee and bringing the Affordable Care Act to the House floor. Almost every President since Theodore Roosevelt had attempted to give healthcare to the American people. Millions of people are now waking up to the benefits of this healthcare, and our Nation’s uninsured rate is at its lowest level in more than 50 years. Why would you rip that away? For the first time in a generation, we are actually slowing the yearly growth of healthcare costs. A poll released just this last month found that 61 percent of the public supports keeping and improving the Affordable Care Act. That is in stark contrast to the 17 percent approval rating for the repeal bill that was voted on here several weeks ago. Mr. Speaker, I wish the majority would stop turning a deaf ear to the people it represents. The American people have been marching and calling and writing against this bill in numbers none of us have ever seen before. A bad process led to a bad product. Mr. Speaker, none of us believe that the ACA was perfect. I urge the majority to take the bill out of the drawer and shred it. Let’s get together, strengthen our healthcare system and the Affordable Care Act. It is exactly what our constituents deserve. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. BIGGS). Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the time, and I am grateful to be here with the gentleman. I want to speak to both of these bills rather than speaking to a different bill that was considered in this body. With regard to H.R. 1761, this bill became necessary because of the court imposed misinterpretation of a congressional statute with regard to the visual depiction, or live transmission, of a victim of child abuse, or sexually explicit conduct. This is important because it closes a loophole that otherwise would allow a perpetrator to walk free because of a lack of specific intent when recording images of the victim that they are victimizing. This bill is important because it closes the loophole and gets back to what the intent of Congress was when they passed legislation intended to protect children and criminalized the production of images of child sexual abuse. This bill does all we can at this point to protect our children from sexual predators. It is a moral necessity that we close this shameful loophole, created by a judicial opinion, to provide the appropriate punishment to those who look to harm minors. It won’t protect all of our children, but it will provide a significant deterrent to protect more of our children, and that makes this bill important, crucial, and necessary. With regard to H.R. 1973, Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse Act of 2017, this broadens the coverage of current laws that require reporting of child abuse, specifically with regard to those children who are participating in organizations that are organized for the purpose of helping—ostensibly helping—young athletes train for international competition. When you are a parent of an athlete, just like your child, you trust these coaches who are mentoring and working and interacting with your children not just for training these children and preparing them to be the best athlete they possibly can be, but you also entrust, many times, your children’s keeping to them. Gone are the days where kids were playing in Little League and saw their coaches for brief periods of time. In many instances, the children that will be protected by this bill are those elite young athletes who spend quite a bit of time actually away from their parents and in the care and custody of coaches, trainers, and other people associated with the program. As a father of athletes, it is important that I be able to trust that, if someone has been convicted or has had to report that, that information is available. And due to this particular 
legislation, the government will now be able to pursue cases that it would not otherwise be able to prosecute. This legislation specifies that national governing bodies are authorized to develop training oversight practices, policies, and procedures to prevent sexual abuse of amateur athletes. And then what is critical, it requires that it is necessary to assure child abuse is being reported by those who work with amateur athletes. Those reporting requirements are essential protective deterrences and provide assurances to all surrounding that young child and that athlete that they have the opportunity for safekeeping. Organizations must be taking action against coaches or other members when allegations are made against them to assure young athletes are kept safe. The safety of these young athletes must trump, in many cases, perhaps, their ability to develop their unique gifts and talents. Mr. Speaker, I am grateful that these bills are brought forward, and I support them. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Nearly 30 years ago, I held my son, Cody, for the first time. A couple of years later, I held my daughter, Kaitlin. I knew right then that these two children were the most important and cherished things in my life. They deserve the happiest childhood and the brightest future and the safest world. I imagine anyone who holds their child for the first time has the same thought. Until you become a parent, it is hard to describe the love you have for your children. b1245 Mr. Speaker, that someone would hurt a child simply perplexes me. Children are the most vulnerable, the most innocent in our society. They, most of all, don’t deserve the trauma and pain that accompany abuse. They don’t deserve to have their trust in adults or their trust in the world shattered at such a young age. They don’t deserve the ghosts of suffering that accompany abuse victims for the rest of their lives. Mr. Speaker, to commit a crime against children is to engage in the greatest of evils. It is to violate our moral order in the most egregious of ways. Our job in Congress is to debate and maintain that moral order. Thankfully, everyone in this Chamber can agree on the moral imperative to protect children. Our job today is to uphold our values through wellcrafted legislation. We are here today to pass laws that uphold our belief in the sanctity of innocence. We are here today for our children. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1973, the first bill in this rule resolution, strengthens the laws protecting child athletes. The bill requires coaches and adults involved with amateur sports organizations overseen by the U.S. Olympic Committee to report suspected child abuse to local and Federal authorities. Unfortunately, reporting isn’t always the standard under current law. Over the past 20 years, around 368 individuals affiliated with USA Gymnastics faced sexual abuse by adults affiliated with the organization, according to The Indianapolis Star. Sadly, some of the victims never saw justice. Their allegations remained unresolved, sometimes because coaches moved from State to State to avoid investigation. H.R. 1973 pulls additional adults into the mandatory reporting category, ensuring that those adults working with minors under the U.S. Olympic Committee’s jurisdiction must report instances of child abuse to local and Federal authorities. It further clarifies the sexual abuse reporting duties of national governing bodies, or NGBs. These organizations, supervised by the U.S. Olympic Committee, manage amateur athletic competitions. We need to promote a culture of reporting sexual assault among youth athletes. That culture needs to overflow into all parts of our society. We are not suggesting we toss out due process for the accused. The legislation at hand only requires the reporting and investigation of sexual abuse of children. Additionally, H.R. 1973 makes stronger the civil remedies that victims of sexual abuse may pursue. Mr. Speaker, the other legislation under this rule, H.R. 1761, goes after those who create child pornography. Just to utter those words is unbearable, but our job in Congress is to stop the unbearable. Under current law and due to the impact of the court ruling in United States v. PalominoCoronado, perpetrators of child pornography can sometimes evade prosecution for child pornography under a loophole. Under the precedent set in the case, even if perpetrators memorialize the sexual abuse of a child through images and video, they do not necessarily possess the intent or purpose to sexually abuse children in order to take a picture. In other words, they didn’t intend to violate title 18 of the U.S. Code, section 2251, which prohibits child pornography. We need to close this loophole. If evildoers are sexually abusing our children and photographing or filming it, they should be going to prison for a long time. This loophole was carved out by the judicial branch. It is time for the legislative branch to step in and tighten the statutory language to prevent the exploitation of this loophole and to prevent the exploitation of our children. The bills under consideration today serve two purposes. First and foremost, they provide a deterrent to criminals who would consider harming a child. We can’t preemptively stop everyone who plans to commit a crime against a child, which is why we must deter them with the threat of discovery, conviction, and jail time. These bills very practically make the exploitation of a child harder to get away with. They commission more wellmeaning adults to be on guard against the occurrence of sexual abuse. They allow victims to pursue even stronger civil penalties that will, hopefully, deter future criminals, and they strengthen the law itself to ensure that child pornographers face prosecution and appropriate punishment for their heinous crimes. The second purpose achieved today is to send a message. These bills signal to all of America that our society is serious about protecting children and that we are serious about catching child predators. H.R. 1973 specifically directs coaches and others to report sexual abuse. But these bills send a broader message: everyone in this Nation should join the fight against child exploitation. We have too many examples of well meaning adults remaining silent in the face of child abuse. This legislation is meant to push Americans to do what is right, even if it is not easy. We are all the guardians of our Nation’s youth. We all are responsible for their childhood. We are all proponents of their future. These are our children, our pride and joy. We must offer them the same vigilance and protection we offer our own children. The rule before us gives this House a chance to do just that. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important rule and the underlying legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, the majority of Americans want us to work together to improve upon the successes of the Affordable Care Act. We should be expanding access to care and implementing the kind of reforms that will keep American families healthy, not kicking millions of Americans off their insurance to fulfill a deceptive campaign promise, as the Republican healthcare repeal bill will do. Expanding paid sick leave to the 45 percent of American workers who don’t have access to it would be a great start. Each week, up to 3 million employees go to work sick, infecting their coworkers and customers and delaying their own recovery. The benefits of allowing working Americans to earn paid sick leave are undeniable. It slows the spread of disease, lowers healthcare costs, and increases productivity. If we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule that would allow us to also bring up Representative DELAURO ’s bill, H.R. 1516, which would allow Americans to have paid sick time. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the RECORD , along with extraneous material, immediately prior to vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from New York? 
There was no objection. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, it is clear after The Indianapolis Star uncovered the widespread abuse scandal that Congress must act to implement consistent, stricter laws governing the reporting of abuses to our Nation’s athletes and to all our children. Once again, The Indianapolis Star has shown us the importance of investigative journalism and a free press. Many of these athletes are too young and are not empowered to speak out against authority figures when they are hurt or abused by them. But each of us as Members of Congress is in a position to do something about it, and we must. Mr. Speaker, again, I urge my colleagues to listen to the voices of the American people before hurling our Nation further toward disaster with this dangerous healthcare bill. The majority hasn’t held any hearings or gotten input from experts, advocates, or patients. They are ignoring the opposition from groups like AARP, American Medical Association, March of Dimes, and American Hospital Association. The score later today from the Congressional Budget Office won’t change the underlying facts of this bill. It will gut protections for people with preexisting conditions. It will gut essential health benefits, kick millions of people off of health insurance, and place a crushing age tax on those aged 50 to 64 whose premiums will go up. It will also cut billions from Medicaid to pay for a major tax cut for the wealthy. That is $880 billion that they want to take away from Medicaid to give to the rich and corporations. This is so unAmerican, I stumbled over saying it. Mr. Speaker, a bad process has led to a bad bill. We should be doing what the American people want and improving the Affordable Care Act. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, we are here today for the children. In voting for the bill and the underlying bills, we are sending a message to the abuser of children: If you harm one of these little ones, you will be met with the full fury of the American justice system. You will be discovered and reported by your peers. You will face the threat of appropriately harsh demands. You will face the full force of the law if you visually depict child exploitation. We are sending a message to the bystanders: You have a solemn duty to protect these children. You have a duty to be their hope and happiness and their future when you step in and stop abuse. You have a duty to report the heinous acts committed by monsters. Lately, we don’t have many moments in Washington where both political parties can come together and reach a consensus, but the legislation we are considering today provides the perfect opportunity. These bills should not be controversial. They should draw the support of both sides, because protecting our children is a moral necessity for every American. That is, after all, the message these bills send. I thank Representative BROOKS and Representative JOHNSON for the hard work they have done on these bills, and I thank Chairman GOODLATTE for shepherding these bills through the Judiciary Committee and spending so much time in committee working on legislation to protect our children. Mr. Speaker, I urge members to vote ‘‘yes’’ on the resolution, vote ‘‘yes’’ on the underlying bills. The material previously referred to by Ms. SLAUGHTER is as follows: 
THEVOTE ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION : WHAT ITREALLY MEANS  This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the House of Representatives (VI, 308–311), describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.’’ To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition’’ in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R–Illinois) said: ‘‘The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.’’ The Republican majority may say ‘‘the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.’’ But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here’s how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ‘‘Although it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by voting down the previous question on the rule....  When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.’’ In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled ‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ‘‘Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon.’’ Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Republican majority’s agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous question. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. 
RAISING A QUESTION OF THE PRIVILEGES OF THE HOUSE Ms. SA´NCHEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise to a question of the privileges of the House and offer a resolution previously noticed. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the resolution. The Clerk read as follows: 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the President shall immediately release his tax return information to Congress and the American people. Whereas, in the United States’ system of checks and balances, Congress has a responsibility to hold the Executive Branch of government to a fair and equal standard of transparency ensuring the public interest is placed first; Whereas, according to the Tax History Project, every President since Gerald Ford has disclosed their tax return information to the public; Whereas, tax returns provide an important baseline of reasonable information including whether the President paid taxes, ownership interests, charitable donations made, and whether tax deductions have been exploited; Whereas, disclosure of the President’s tax returns could help those investigating Russian influence in the 2016 election understand the President’s financial ties to the Russian Federation and Russian citizens, including debts owed and whether he shares any partnership interests, equity interests, joint ventures or licensing agreements with Russia or Russians; Whereas, the President recently fired Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey, under whose leadership the FBI was investigating whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 election; Whereas, President Trump reportedly stated to Russian officials during a White House meeting that he fired Director Comey to ease pressure on the ongoing investigation of Russia’s influence in the 2016 election; Whereas, Senate Russia investigators have requested information from the Treasury Department’s criminal investigation division, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, which handles cases of money laundering, for information related to President Trump, his top officials and campaign aides. FinCEN has been investigating allegations of foreign moneylaundering through purchases of U.S. real estate; Whereas, the President’s tax returns would show us whether he has foreign bank accounts and how much profit he receives from his ownership in myriad partnerships; Whereas, Donald Trump Jr. said the Trump Organization saw money ‘‘pouring in from Russia’’ and that ‘‘Russians make up a pretty disproportionate crosssection of a lot of our assets.’’ Whereas, the White House will not confirm whether the President has filed a 2016 tax return; Whereas, Congress gave itself the authority to review an individual’s tax returns to investigate and reveal possible conflicts of interest of executive branch officials involved dating back to the Teapot Dome scandal. Whereas, it has been reported that federal prosecutors have issued grand jury subpoenas to associates of former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn seeking business records as part of the ongoing probe into Russian involvement in the 2016 election; Whereas, according to his 2016 candidate filing with the Federal Election Commission, the President has 564 financial positions in companies located in the United States and around the world; Whereas, against the advice of ethics attorneys and the Office of Government Ethics, the President has refused to divest his ownership stake in his businesses; and can still withdraw funds at any time from the trust of which he is the sole beneficiary; Whereas, the Emoluments Clause was included in the U.S. Constitution for the express purpose of preventing federa1 officials from accepting any ‘‘present, Emolument, Office, or Title . . . from any King, Prince, or foreign state’’; Whereas, the Chairmen of the Ways and Means Committee, Joint Committee on Taxation, and Senate Finance Committee have the authority to request the President’s tax returns under Section 6103 of the tax code; Whereas, the Joint Committee on Taxation reviewed the tax returns of President Richard Nixon in 1974 and made the information public; Whereas, the Ways and Means Committee used IRC 6103 authority in 2014 to make public the confidential tax information of 51 taxpayers; Whereas Director Comey has testified that tax returns are a common tool in investigations because they can show income and motives; Whereas, the American people have the right to know whether or not their President is operating under conflicts of interest related to international affairs, tax reform, government contracts, or otherwise: Now, therefore, be it: Resolved, That the House of Representatives shall— 1. Immediately request the tax return information of Donald J. Trump for tax years 2006 through 2015 for review in closed executive session by the Committee on Ways and Means, as provided under Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code, and vote to report the information therein to the full House of Representatives. 2. Support transparency in government and the longstanding tradition of Presidents and Presidential candidates disclosing their tax returns. 
b1300 The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does the gentlewoman from California wish to present argument on the parliamentary question of whether the resolution presents a question of the privileges of the House? Ms. SA´NCHEZ. I do, Mr. Speaker. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from California is recognized. Ms. SA´NCHEZ. Mr. Speaker, under clause 1 of rule IX, questions of the privileges of the House are those affecting the rights of the House collectively, its safety, dignity, and the integrity of its proceedings. I believe that the dignity of this institution is at risk each day that passes without this body exercising its statutory authority and constitutional duty to operate as a coequal branch of government. The legislative branch of government has the responsibility and authority to keep a proper check on the executive branch under section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code. Specifically, three committees have jurisdiction to request tax returns: the Committee on Ways and Means, the Senate Finance Committee, and the Joint Committee on Taxation. This provision has been part of our Federal Tax Code since 1924 to facilitate full and complete investigations into scandals that rise to the level of national importance. Nothing could rise to the level of national importance like the possible financial entanglements our President may have with Russian entities and individuals. This situation is truly unprecedented. It is our sworn duty to uphold the integrity of this institution and examine all the relevant details related to this issue. Each week we see yet another fact in the growing case of entanglements between our President, his campaign and closest advisers, and Russian officials. The most recent troubling report occurred just last week when we learned that the President himself reportedly made statements directly to Russian officials during an Oval Office meeting regarding the FBI investigation into his campaign ties with Russia. This is the same meeting where the President took it upon himself to reveal highly classified information to Russian officials. How long can this body allow these types of actions to go unchecked? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman is reminded the remarks must be confined to the question of order. Ms. SA´NCHEZ. I understand, Mr. Speaker. I promise that they relate to the question at issue. Mr. Speaker, further, the American people deserve to know if President Trump has exploited the Federal Tax Code for improper personal gain. The personal business endeavors of the leader of the free world should be exercised to the highest possible standard. Specifically, the President’s business dealings around the world make him more prone to potential conflicts of interest than any President in history. However, the President did not take adequate steps to mitigate any potential issues. He was advised by the Office of Government Ethics to divest himself of his business entanglements. The President chose to ignore this sound advice. It is now the duty of this body to restore integrity to the oversight process. Our democracy should be an example to the world. Today we have the opportunity to ensure that it is achieved through taking up this overdue investigation. It is only then we can restore the dignity and integrity of the House through exercise of our constitutional duty. For these reasons, this resolution raises a question of the privileges of the House and should be allowed a vote. Mr. Speaker, I yield back. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from California seeks to offer a resolution as a question of the privileges of the House under rule IX. As the Chair most recently ruled on May 17, 2017, the resolution directs the Committee on Ways and Means to meet and consider an item of business under the procedures set forth in 26 U.S.C. 6103 and, therefore, does not qualify as a question of the privileges of the House. Ms. SA´NCHEZ. Mr. Speaker, I appeal the ruling of the Chair. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is, Shall the decision of the Chair stand as the judgment of the House? 
Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion. The Clerk read as follows: 
Mr. Buck moves that the appeal be laid on the table. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to table. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Ms. SA´NCHEZ. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, this 15 minute vote on the motion to table will be followed by 5minute votes on: Ordering the previous question on House Resolution 352; Adopting House Resolution 352, if ordered; Suspending the rules and passing H.R. 2052; and Suspending the rules and passing H.R. 467.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1293) to amend title 5, United States Code, to require that the Office of Personnel Management submit an annual report to Congress relating to the use of official time by Federal employees, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 1293 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. ROSS) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. 
Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, H.R. 1293, to amend title 5 of the United States Code to require the Office of Personnel Management to submit an annual report to Congress relating to the use of official time by Federal employees. Mr. Speaker, I am here today to talk about a bill that would provide taxpayers with greater transparency of official time. ‘‘Official time’’ is that term that describes when Federal employees do union work on the taxpayers’ dime. The only standard provided by the statute authorizing official time is that the employees perform union work on official time in a manner that is ‘‘reasonable, necessary, and in the public interest.’’ Currently, Federal law does not require agencies to report, annually, on the amount of official time their employees perform. Until March of this year, the Office of Personnel Management had not reported on official time since fiscal year 2012. When the report was released in March, the data was out of date, containing information from fiscal year 2014. While the Office of Personnel Management may request that agencies provide data related to official time, OPM does not have any set of standards or procedures prescribing the collection of official time data. Considering the burden that official time puts on the taxpayer, more stringent reporting is necessary. The latest data provided by OPM shows that taxpayers paid $162 million for salary and benefits related to work done in official time in fiscal year 2014, up from $157 million 2 years earlier in fiscal year 2012. Agencies reported that bargaining unit employees spent a total of 3.5 million hours performing representational activities on official time. The current lack of stringent reporting requirements, as well as the broad interpretation of the statute’s sole requirement that official time be carried out in a way that is reasonable, necessary, and in the public interest, have clearly opened the door to abuse. The Committee on Oversight and Government Reform identified several cases where employees on official time engaged in all sorts of inappropriate activities while on taxpayerfunded time, including everything from leisure to criminal activities. With greater transparency, employees will be less likely to abuse the system, which will result in less waste of taxpayer dollars. It is by far time we require agencies to provide this information to Congress and to the public. Taxpayers deserve clear, reliable data on how many employees are performing union work on official time in lieu of their regularly assigned government duties. To accomplish this, H.R. 1293 requires agencies to provide more detailed information to OPM regarding what their employees are doing related to official time. Specifically, the bill requires agencies to report the total amount of official time granted to employees, the average amount of time each employee spends on official time, the specific types of activities for which official time was granted, and the impact official time had on agency operations. H.R. 1293 requires agencies to report the amount of compensation employees received in connection with the time they spent on activities in connection with official time. Finally, the bill requires agencies to report a description of rooms and spaces agencies use to conduct official time. H.R. 1293 will provide taxpayers with the transparency they deserve when it comes to official time. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I must say, Mr. Speaker, I originally rose in support of what I thought was a simple reporting bill. In listening to my friend from Florida, this is part and parcel of the negative narrative that is sent in all too frequently on the other side of the aisle about hardworking civil servants and Federal employees. They are not all somehow committing crime on official time. Official time, in fact, has been used to the benefit of the workforce and to the benefit of management. If this bill, H.R. 1293, is nothing but a precursor to further encroachment on the rights of Federal workers, then I will oppose this bill, and I will urge my Members on this side of the aisle to oppose this bill because, by voting for it, we are enabling something much worse to follow and have this thrown in our faces. So, Mr. Speaker, I regret that, under the circumstances, and with the message I have just heard, I can no longer support this bill. I can no longer urge my colleagues to support this bill, and we will, in fact, urge a negative vote on this bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I might just suggest to my good friend from Virginia that this is a reporting bill, that this is the same bill, as amended by their amendment, that was passed out of committee overwhelmingly, that I believe the gentleman from Virginia voted for. So there has not been any change. It is still a transparency reporting bill to make sure that we account for all the time spent in official time on the taxpayer dime. That is it. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. JODYB. H ICE). Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida for yielding this time. I agree with this great reporting bill. The American people have a right to at least have a reasonable expectation that the Federal Government knows what its employees are doing. Unfortunately, we all know that doesn’t always happen, particularly when it comes to the practice of official time. It is amazing to me how little information there is, particularly as it relates to the reporting aspect, as to what is happening under official time. For those who don’t know what it is, Mr. ROSS mentioned it well. Established under the Carter administration, official time allows Federal employee union members to conduct union activities during their workhours of the agency for which they were hired even if the union activity has nothing to do with their job description. Surprisingly, the Federal agencies are not required to report to Congress the amount of time that employees are spending conducting union business. Some of my colleagues may disagree about the value of official time. I get that. The gentleman from Virginia and I see differently on this. I certainly oppose the abuse of official time, so we see differently on this. But I think we can all agree that the American people at least have the right to know the extent to which official time is being used. So, although we may disagree somewhat on policy, I think we can certainly find common ground to promote accountability and transparency within the Federal Government. As Mr. ROSSmentioned a while ago, the OPM has come out with a study: 3.5 million workhours spent on official time. That is a lot if it was just dollars, but when you take 3.5 million workhours multiplied by dollars involved, this is a significant issue that needs to be addressed. This bill, H.R. 1293, grants the OPM the ability to get necessary information from Federal agencies so that we have a more comprehensive understanding of the official time usage. Currently, there are no standards for OPM to find that kind of information. 
So this bill does not eliminate, nor does it restrict, official time usage; it simply shines light on the practice. Again, I believe we can find common ground that the American people deserve to know how their tax dollars are spent. This is common sense. It is good governance. It is a bill that I believe we should all be able to get behind. I am pleased to support this bill. I am honored and pleased to do so in the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. I urge all our colleagues to support it now. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, my friend from Florida is my friend and he knows I respect him, but when you give an opening statement on a bill that goes far beyond a reporting requirement that we thought we were supporting and you use the occasion to disparage Federal workers and to characterize them in a decidedly negative way as if that somehow really described the average civil servant and what they are up to, then on this side of the aisle, we take exception. Then it is no longer a simple reporting bill; it is a precursor of bad things to come, and we are not going to be party to it. We are not going to enable that. That is why, reluctantly, I must now oppose this bill and urge my Democratic colleagues and those on the other side of the aisle who want to protect Federal employees and honor them and give them the dignity and respect they deserve also to oppose this bill. Mr. Speaker, I now am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON ), my dear friend. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from Virginia for yielding to me. You haven’t heard any discussion of abuse of official time because there is no record of abuse of official time. My colleagues on the other side simply want to get rid of official time, as they have wanted to do for decades. A little background: Federal employees have no right to strike, as they do in the private sector. In return, though, the timehonored right to organize and represent employees in their official capacity on matters relating to the workplace has always been in place under Republicans and Democrats alike. Remember, there is also no requirement to join a union in the first place; yet unions must represent all workers, regardless of their membership or not. The bill on the House floor, H.R. 1293, is unnecessary. Official time reports are already required. This is a redundant bill. If my friend is worried that these reports haven’t been timely, as he implied then he can do that administratively or do it in this bill. The reason he doesn’t do it in this bill is this bill is a cover. It is a cover for two pending bills which are already out of committee. I expect them on the floor any minute now, although, notice the sequence. b1415 Mr. Speaker, this seemingly vanilla bill, is going to be followed by the real bills that my colleagues are after. They are parallel bills. They essentially eliminate official time to represent workers. Now, why is official time important? They are important for the operation of the Federal Government itself. And why is that? Because there are always going to be disputes and contention between management and labor. Official takes away time that would otherwise be wasted and allows the parties to go to the table and work matters out. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, these two bills are a frontal attack on official time, but they actually stab federal employees in the back. One bill would make it virtually impossible for union members to volunteer their time unless they wanted to give up parts of their retirement benefits. What kind of quid pro quo is that? What do you want to do next? Reduce pay if a union rep uses official time? The next bill designates employees who cannot represent other employees. This bill looks like something you would expect from countries where there is no right to organize. This bill reduces the amount of dues unions can collect, even though they are collecting dues on their own time and not official time. This is a brazen attempt to eliminate the fairshare fee, nonunion workers pay for being represented equally with union members, and allow free riders to be served free of charge. This is the beginning of an outandout assault on the freedom of workers to organize. Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I want to be clear here, because I want to make sure that we are talking about the same bill. This bill doesn’t do anything about union dues. This bill doesn’t do anything other than require the transparency of reporting official time. And I would be delighted to engage my good friend from Virginia, whom I have a great deal of respect for, and I have worked very diligently on this committee with for some time, and inquire as to what transpired since this bill left committee until today that would cause him and others who were supportive of it in committee to now say that it is not? I don’t mean to misrepresent anything. While I might have opinions of what I believe, I can tell you factually that this bill is merely, and solely, and exclusively a reporting bill. If I were managing a company and I wanted to know where my resources were, I would want to make sure I managed those resources—including my human resources—so I would like to know where the time of my employees is spent. There is no prohibition of time being spent. There is no restriction of time being spent. It is merely a reporting bill. It is requiring reporting. It is something the OPM has done before. It was started under President Carter’s administration. Mr. Speaker, I inquire of my good friend if there is anything that has changed to make his opposition now come to the floor? Mr. CONNOLLY. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. ROSS. I yield to the gentleman from Virginia. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend because I am going to run out of time. I must say to my friend, my prepared remarks were designed to support this bill. Mr. ROSS. And I appreciate that. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I must say, the gentleman from Florida, who is an honorable man and a friend, and we have collaborated, but his own words transformed what this really was. They persuaded us that by voting for this, we are not voting for a reporting bill. That is just the beginning. My friend from Florida is the one who characterized criminal activity on official time, and unsavory things going on on official time, and allows that to dangle out there as if that characterizes Federal employees generally. I say to any friend—and I thank him for yielding—that has transformed our perception of this bill. This is no longer a simple reporting bill—although technically that is what it is. It is a precursor, apparently, to an assault of Federal employees—and on official time, specifically—and we cannot be partners to that. We cannot be enablers to that. Mr. Speaker, therefore, we must oppose this bill, in light of the context my friend from Florida himself said. Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, while I understand where my colleague from Virginia is taking my comments from, I must submit that at no time did I allege that the Federal employees, all Federal employees, are committing crimes on official time. I think just the opposite. A vast majority of our Federal employees are probably some of the best workforce that we have out there. I think that, in any workforce, you are going to have some people that don’t live up to the standards of their employment. So what I merely do in my opening statement is to say that there has been a need for transparency that includes the abuse of time by some, not by all. Again, the vast majority of Federal employees are exceptional employees, hardworking, and absolutely necessary to run this great country. Mr. Speaker, I ask my good friend from Virginia to please reconsider, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I am certainly gratified for the clarification of my friend. It now gives me great pleasure to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Massachusetts (Mr. L YNCH ), my good friend and a senior member of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia for yielding, and I join him in opposition to this bill. While originally my remarks would have been much kinder to the bill, and I may have considered supporting it, I did not consider it favorably in committee. I know we had a voice vote on that. But in light of the unfortunate remarks that imply that there was illegal activity going on by Federal employees, and that is why we need this bill that is before us right now, I do have to agree with the ranking member, the gentleman from Virginia, that this bill is, indeed, a part of the vanguard of legislation to severely restrict and eliminate the use of official time. Under the bipartisan Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, a Federal employees who serves as a union steward or union representative may be granted official time to perform activities that—and this is the important standard that is in the bill—the gentleman from Georgia indicated that we need this bill because there is no standard. The standard in the Civil Service Reform Act requires a number of things: It requires both labor and management to agree on the use of official time, and that official time be ‘‘reasonable, necessary, and in the public interest.’’ That is the standard today, and every single Federal workplace—management and labor—have to agree that the use of official time is reasonable, that it is necessary, and that it is in the public interest. That is a great standard, and that is what has been going on so far. While there are those who seek to curb or repeal the statutory right and may claim that it amounts to misuse of government resources, let me offer you another concrete example of why official time is critical to the Federal workplace and serves the interests of the American people and taxpayer. In the wake of the devastating terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, the Nation also endured a series of anthrax attacks perpetuated through the United States mail system against media offices in Florida, New York, and also Federal offices here in the Nation’s Capital. The affected facilities included the Brentwood Mail Processing and Distribution Center here in D.C., that is now named after two dedicated postal employees, Thomas Morris and Joseph Curseen, who lost their lives to anthrax exposure at that facility. This is immediately after September 11. They were postal workers. They died of inhalation of anthrax poisoning because of the jobs they were doing on behalf of this country. The risk of further anthrax attacks threatened the safety of our postal workforce. I had two sisters with young children at the time working at the post office, and I knew of this well. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to my friend from Massachusetts. Mr. LYNCH. It jeopardized the safety of our postal workforce and customers, as well as the free flow of information and commerce that the constitutional responsibility of the United States Postal Service requires. But rather than refusing to go to work in a dangerous workplace, by the use of official time, the management of the United States Postal Service, and the union representatives of the United States Postal Service sat down and worked out a measure where the union agreed to send their workers in, the mail kept running to every home and business in America, but the postal workers absorbed that danger on their own because they knew that steps were being taken to keep them and their families—because the threat was that anthrax would get on their clothes and they would bring that back to their own homes. We worked that out. That agreement would not have been worked out but for the use of official time—and a lot of official time that was used in that crisis. That is the responsibility that those union representatives had to the workers. They have to guarantee a safe workplace for those workers, and that is why we should vote against this bill. This is a wolf in sheep’s clothing, and we ought to vote this down. Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. If I might just, again, clarify for the record, this is a reporting bill. It is a transparency bill. The standard that my good friend from Massachusetts discusses, and that I agreed with, is not affected at all by this bill. I would have no doubt whatsoever that in similar circumstances that happened after 9/11 in those post offices, that those same employees, regardless of the risk, would do exactly what they did, because that is how valuable they are to the system. That is how valuable they are to this country. What I can’t understand is what has transpired between voting this out of committee to today that has changed the opinion. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. LAWRENCE ), my dear friend. Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman CONNOLLY . I rise today coming in saying I would support this bill. Many people know I served 30 years as a Federal employee working in HR, understanding labor relations, safety issues, environmental issues, diversity issues, and knowing clear well that the official time that is allotted to employees to sit down with their representative of the union to talk about if they feel like they are being sexually harassed, if they feel like they are in an environment that is not safe for them, official time is extremely necessary. What happens in official time? It allows a lot of grievances to be processed and resolved through communication between union and management. There have been several legislative reform proposals introduced to address the way union representatives are allowed to utilize official time. Now, I was taken back when my colleague said ‘‘criminal activities.’’ Mr. Speaker, criminal activity is something that is in a whole different venue. If you are a Federal employee and you create an illegal activity, you do not need official time to do that. I have never known, in the time that I served in HR, in labor relations, and served in all of the different capacities, have I seen someone doing criminal activity on official time. It would be a different thing if we were clear that this bill was about reporting the time, which I would not oppose. But when you present this scenario about official time, as it being something that is negative, something that is being used in a criminal capacity, that is totally something I would be opposed to. Let me tell you some examples of what representatives can use it for: If there is a whistleblower accusation, an employee would go to their union steward and ask for official time. If it was a grievance on behalf of the employee, they can use it. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from Michigan. Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, union representatives can also assist if it is an OSHA issue, if it is racial discrimination, or sexual harassment. Instead of allowing employees to complete nonpolitical activities, some of my colleagues seem more interested in preventing employees from doing their jobs by using official time. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleague to defeat senseless attacks against Federal employees’ official time. Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, might I inquire how much time is remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Florida has 91⁄2minutes remaining. The gentleman from Virginia has 8
1⁄2minutes remaining. Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN ), my friend. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the opportunity to discuss this bill, and I want to thank the colleague from across the aisle here who has illuminated the future as it relates to undertaking this whole issue. It is with that in mind that I want to speak to the value of the use of official time. 
b1430 While I am not concerned so much about the collection of the information as to what is happening, I am concerned with how it is being translated and will be used in the future. For decades, both Republicans and Democrats alike have strongly supported the use of official time because it streamlines the efficiency and quality of government. We should be thanking our union representatives who use official time to address workplace problems and operational issues within our government. Within our Federal Government, official time leads to swift conflict resolutions that would otherwise require costly litigation, improves the relationship between labor and management, and protects whistleblowers who have exposed government waste and abuse. In some cases, it has even saved lives, as in the issue of AFGE local president Kathleen Dahl, when there was a breakout of Legionnaires’ disease. Furthermore, official time costs one tenth of 1 percent of the cost of salaries and benefits for all Federal employees. That is a fraction of employee compensation. Ultimately, it saves taxpayers dollars and ensures transparency. So while we may be discussing today simply a bill that will record the time that is spent in such a noble and important function, it is simply a precursor to the disparaging of union workers and Federal workers as we move forward. Mr. Speaker, I oppose any movement in that direction. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. SARBANES ). Mr. SARBANES. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I came to the floor today expecting to support H.R. 1293, which has to do with the reporting of official time, but based on the negative commentary we are getting generally about official time and the knock against Federal employees we have heard here today, I am anxious now about supporting this bill because it appears that what is happening is our colleagues on the other side are setting the table for bringing other legislation eventually to the floor that is actually going to attack and undermine official time. My colleague earlier referred to a wolf in sheep’s clothing represented by this bill. You can look at it as the camel’s nose under the tent. Whatever it is, I am worried now that the agenda here is to undermine official time. Let’s remind ourselves of the various benefits of official time. It helps to resolve workplace disputes, which is really important. It helps to improve efficiency within the workplace. It is what leads to negotiating positive agreements between labor and management. It is how official time, when it is used wisely—and there is no evidence that it is not used wisely; there is no evidence of abuse or misuse of official time—and when it is used the way it has been used, it helps our Federal agencies help the American people. It helps these agencies function well. I hope that we can reject whatever is coming down the pipeline. I was cautiously optimistic when I came to support this bill that these other efforts that seem to be underway were maybe being put to bed, but now I am concerned that there is an agenda coming. So we will just have to see how it goes. I want to reiterate my strong support for the use of official time the way it is used by our Federal employees, which is in a very positive fashion, and I urge my colleagues on the other side to protect official time and all of its benefits. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I agree with my friend from Maryland. Official time is a very useful tool in the Federal workplace, both for management and for labor, and has proved its worth over the years. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. TAKANO ). Mr. TAKANO. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I had intended to support H.R. 1293, but after hearing the remarks from the chairman on the floor this morning, I am afraid that this bill is just a precursor for what the majority will try to do to our dedicated Federal employees. The sentiments expressed by the chairman are in line with the legislation that appeared before the Veterans’ Affairs Committee just this past week, legislation that would have undermined the use of official time for employees at the VA. So there are attacks happening in other parts of the House. The committee marked up H.R. 1461, the misnamed VET Protection Act. This bill would limit the amount of time VA employees can use for official time to improve working conditions for themselves and for their colleagues and, in turn, improve services for veterans. We considered this bill, despite the fact we didn’t have clear data on the impact of the bill on the VA’s HR capability. I realize this bill we are considering on the floor today is about that data, but the spirit in which it is being moved forward is not about trying to illuminate how official time has helped our veterans. There are 49,386 vacant positions at the VA. Rolling back the use of official time will only increase the demands on the VA’s human resources staff, making it harder to fill positions and recruit and retain quality providers. Official time benefits our veterans. In Pittsburgh, as was mentioned before by my colleague from New Jersey, an AFGE president used official time to press the VA to address a Legionnaires’ disease outbreak that killed 6 veterans and made 16 others sick. Her actions helped save veterans’ lives, and she used official time to do it. At the Phoenix VA there was a 29 percent turnover rate for licensed practical nurses. Union representatives used official time to improve working conditions and cut the turnover rate in half. Less turnover means better care for veterans. I warn my colleagues against this bill and future misguided legislation to undermine official time and the function of our Federal agencies. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. In attempting to summarize, Mr. Speaker, I do want to reiterate that my friend from Florida is an honorable man. When he says this is about one thing, I believe him. Perhaps in the introduction to this bill there was a characterization that was not intended, and I accept that explanation. Federal workers are hardworking civil servants. They serve the American people. I know my friend from Florida agrees. The overwhelming majority of them are dedicated. They seize a mission every day, whether it be at the VA, the Social Security Administration, or our Nation’s parks. They are dedicated to the proposition that they are there to serve the American people. It is important to honor their service, to respect their service, to not allow even the inference to be drawn that a negative example somehow could be construed as characteristic of the whole, for that is false. That is the narrative we Democrats and, hopefully, a number of Republicans want to change, because it is not true. We want to honor those civil servants. All too often, our civil servants have become pin cushions. Again, I know my friend from Florida does not intend that, but there are others who have intended that. That sparks something, certainly, on this side of the aisle and with this Member, who represents a lot of Federal employees and cherishes their service. For us, it is a very personal matter. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I appreciate the comments from my friend from Virginia, and I will reiterate my comments made earlier here on this floor that we are very grateful for the Federal workforce that we do have and that they are, by far, one of the best human resources in employment in the world. We are grateful for their service. As in any case, there might be some bad ones, but, more importantly, all this bill requests is that we just report the transparency of their services and official time. It is neither an indictment nor restriction on Federal time whatsoever, and, in fact, can be used as a tool for Federal employees to justify some of the official time they are doing for the benefit of not only their colleagues, but also this great country. Mr. Speaker, I would again request that Members of this House support my bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. ROSS) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1293, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER FRAUD PREVENTION ACT OF 2017 Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 624) to restrict the inclusion of social security account numbers on documents sent by mail by the Federal Government, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 624 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Social Security Number Fraud Prevention Act of 2017’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. ROSS) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. 
Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 624, the Social Security Number Fraud Prevention Act of 2017, introduced by my good friend from California, Representative DAVID VALADAO . I want to start by thanking Chairman BRADY and Subcommittee Chairman JOHNSON from the Ways and Means Committee for their assistance in getting this bill to the floor. Their work on addressing the unnecessary use of Social Security numbers is well appreciated by all Americans across the country and especially Members in this body. Mr. Speaker, we live in an interconnected world. Personal identifiers, such as Social Security numbers, are used for much more than just Social Security benefits. Social Security numbers are widely used to receive government services and to apply for services in the private sector, like opening bank accounts, credit cards, and even applying for college. The extent to which Social Security numbers are a de facto national identifier has heightened concerns about identity theft. In the wrong hands, a stolen Social Security number can be used for devastating effects. This bill helps move the government closer to the goal of minimizing unnecessary use of Social Security numbers. All entities in the Federal Government will be prohibited from sending a Social Security account number by mail, unless the head of the entity deems it necessary. The 24 major CFO Act agencies will also have to issue regulations specifying the circumstances under which inclusion of a Social Security number is deemed necessary. They will have to ensure numbers are redacted partially, where feasible, and to ensure no numbers are visible from the outside of a mail piece. Finally, agencies will be required to report to Congress on their progress in implementing the requirements of the law. Mr. Speaker, this bill is very important. The Social Security Administration alone sends 223 million notices containing a full Social Security number every year. We must take care to properly safeguard the personally identifiable information of American citizens. The consequences of failure can be dire. In 2015, the Office of Personnel Management experienced a major data breach where the personally identifiable information for 22 million Americans was compromised. The Oversight Committee majority staff report recommended Federal agencies reduce the collection of Social Security numbers and other personally identifiable information. Mr. Speaker, this bill is a step in the right direction. I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 624, the Social Security Number Fraud Prevention Act of 2017, as amended. Introduced by our colleague, Mr. VALADAO from California, this bill is a commonsense step to addressing an enormously growing problem of identity theft and protecting the personal information of every American. Each year, 18 million Americans become victims of identity theft. That is 18 million. A leading cause of this problem is the unauthorized acquisition of Social Security numbers by criminals. H.R. 624 would address this issue by restricting the instances in which agencies may include the full Social Security numbers on documents sent through the mail. The bill would prohibit agencies from including those numbers on mailed correspondence unless the head of an agency himself or herself determines that inclusion is absolutely essential. Agencies would be required to issue regulations delineating the situations in which Social Security numbers are necessary, and would be instructed to partially redact numbers wherever feasible. b1445 Agencies would also be expressly prohibited from making Social Security numbers visible on the outside of any mailed packages. 
In recent years, many agencies have taken steps to reduce their use of Social Security numbers, and this bill would simply codify some of those practices agencies have already adopted. For instance, the Social Security Administration itself no longer prints Social Security numbers on its annual costofliving adjustment notices or benefit checks, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is in the process of removing Social Security numbers from the Medicare cards issued to beneficiaries. These steps are critical to ensuring that the Federal Government adequately safeguards the personally identifiable information of individuals and does everything it can to protect Americans from identity theft. Although this bill helps provide a lot of protection, reducing the threat of identity theft by removing Social Security numbers from mailed items is not always as easy as it seems. Many agencies confront high costs when reprogramming outdated legacy information technology systems to allow mailings to be printed differently. Agencies across the Federal Government have been reluctant to retire those legacy IT systems because of funding constraints that limit IT investments, slow modernization, and force agencies to defer needed IT upgrades in favor of some more pressing, urgent problems. I would be remiss if I did not mention the important responsibility Congress has to fund these IT modernization efforts as it considers this bill. Mr. Speaker, the Social Security Number Fraud Prevention Act is a good, bipartisan bill that is necessary to protect the American public. I urge my colleagues to support its passage, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from California (Mr. VALADAO ), who is the author of this bill. Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of my bill, H.R. 624, the Social Security Number Fraud Prevention Act, legislation to protect Americans—especially children, veterans, and the elderly—from identity theft. Not long ago, I was approached by a constituent in my district who showed me a letter she had received from the Social Security Administration. The document she showed me contained the full Social Security number, name, and address clearly printed. Upon further investigation, we found that the Social Security Administration had also printed postcards which contained the full Social Security number of the intended recipient clearly visible on the exterior of the mailing. Even more concerning, the practice of printing Social Security numbers on government documents is not exclusive to the Social Security Administration, but occurs throughout every department of the Federal Government. In today’s digital age, we hear more and more about the importance of protecting our identity. Identity theft is one of the fastest growing crimes in the United States. It threatens the financial security of millions of Americans as well as the economic stability of the United States as a whole. In fact, every 2 seconds, another American becomes the victim of identity fraud. Even worse, these crimes tend to impact vulnerable populations, such as children, the elderly, and veterans, the most. Despite these alarming statistics, there is a high prevalence of needlessly printed Social Security numbers on documents issued by the Federal Government. My legislation puts an end to this unacceptable practice and limits when the Federal Government can mail documents that contain an individual’s full Social Security number. Social Security was established to provide older Americans financial security during their retirement years, not to jeopardize that security by negligently handling someone’s personal information. My bill, the Social Security Number Fraud Prevention Act, would prevent the Federal Government from mailing documents that contain full Social Security numbers unless absolutely necessary. This requires Federal agencies to partially redact Social Security numbers on the documents whenever possible. Please join me in supporting this commonsense legislation that will help all Americans avoid falling victim to one of the fastest growing crimes in the United States. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. COSTA ). Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia for yielding, and I also want to take this time to thank the gentleman from Florida and my colleague and good friend, Congressman VALADAO , for the introduction of this legislation, H.R. 624, which I support. Mr. Speaker, as we know, identity theft throughout the country is a very significant problem. It becomes even more compounded in this day of the internet when we have to deal with a whole host of issues that make the ability to steal one’s identity even more easily done. This measure attempts to try to address a part of that challenge by dealing with the issue of Social Security numbers. We all know Social Security numbers are key information used to identify ourselves, and we know that if they fall into the wrong hands, they can be used to commit identity theft. I think all of us remember when, at some point in our age, we got our Social Security number and we memorized it, and it is something that is very important in our society today. But many thieves find these numbers are incredibly valuable because they are a link that can connect a person’s information across a whole host of agencies, systems, and databases in this age of the internet. Criminals can use stolen Social Security numbers to file fraudulent tax returns, obtain loans, and commit other kinds of crimes. An estimated 13 million Americans experienced financial identity theft in 2014 alone, resulting in over $16 billion—with a B—$16 billion lost to fraud. In 2007, to combat these issues, there was an Identity Theft Task Force that made recommendations to the administration on ways to eliminate the unnecessary collection, use, and display— the display, which this legislation attempts to address—of Social Security numbers. Yesterday, the Government Accountability Office released testimony on these efforts by the Federal Government to reduce the collection, use, and display of Social Security numbers. In conclusion, the GAO testified that, until the Office of Management and Budget adopts more effective practices for guiding agency Social Security number reduction efforts, overall governmentwide reduction will likely remain limited and difficult to measure, and the risk of Social Security numbers being exposed and used to commit identity theft will remain greater than it need be. Again, this legislation attempts to help address that. The Social Security Number Fraud Prevention Act would enact measures to help protect American citizens, especially children, veterans, and senior citizens, from identity theft and fraud. It does so by reducing the number of mailed documents the Federal Government sends to individuals that include full Social Security numbers. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from California an additional 1 minute. Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia. In addition, it also takes steps to ensure that, if inclusion is necessary, the number is not visible from the outside of a mailing. I think, probably, many of us have received mail that, in fact, had our Social Security number there and identified. As I said at the outset, this is no silver bullet to stopping identity theft; it is a commonsense measure to reducing it. Social Security, as we all know, is a promise made to those who have worked hard throughout their lives to contribute to the system, to contribute to the American way of life. It also provides those seniors who are living on their Social Security the ability to have dignity and additional security during their golden years. As a result, Congress must do what it can to reduce the strains on the program, particularly from fraud and theft. For all of those reasons, I support this legislation, and I support Congressman VALADAO ’s efforts and my 
good friends from Florida and Virginia for bringing this commonsense measure to the floor. Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS). Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Florida, and I thank my colleague from Virginia for supporting this piece of legislation put forth by our friend and colleague from California, Congressman DAVID VALADAO . The Social Security Number Fraud Prevention Act is a bill that should gain unanimous support in this institution. According to the Justice Department, identity theft affects nearly 18 million people, costing more than $15 billion in 2014 alone. This represents roughly 7 percent of all Americans age 16 or older. In my home State of Illinois alone, in 2014, it was recognized that the FTC saw a 65 percent increase in identity theft. More than 14 percent of the victims are elderly. We all know that Social Security numbers are the link to a key piece of information criminals use to steal people’s identities. This commonsense piece of legislation takes a very important step to ensure that our Federal agencies, our government, funded by the hardworking taxpayers of this country, are not making this problem even worse. This bill, as you have heard today, would restrict the use of Social Security numbers on documents sent via mail by the Federal Government unless the head of a department or agency determines the inclusion of such number is necessary—which I can’t think of a single instance where that would be necessary, but I guess we have to put that in there anyway. This seems like a nobrainer, but we in this institution have to pass a bill to make sure that it happens, which is why I am a proud cosponsor of this bill. I want to thank Congressman VALADAO again. I also want to thank Congress’ newest father, our colleague from California, ERICSWALWELL , for being a cosponsor of this legislation, too. This bill will have a real impact on reducing identity theft in this country, and I want to commend, once again, everybody on the floor today for their support. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I think this is an important piece of legislation. This is one of the fastest growing crimes in our country: the diversion of Social Security checks and rebates. It is almost without any kind of corrective action. There are few prosecutions and even fewer convictions. So, if you are a criminal and you are looking for something that is relatively costfree for you, this is the way to do it. This bill would provide some important protections to the American public. I would hope that we build on this. My friend from Florida and I serve on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, and we have heard testimony about this crime as it has grown exponentially over the last 5 or 6 years. It is my hope that U.S. attorneys all across America will put more emphasis on this crime and use their resources to go after people who are predators of American taxpayers, especially many of our seniors who rely on these checks or these rebates to augment and supplement their income. So there are victims of this crime, and they are the American taxpayer. I think it is an important first step. I support the legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support it as well. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, we here have an obligation to provide for the common defense, and I would submit, Mr. Speaker, that includes that we provide to defend our citizenry from such crimes as identity theft. This bill is a step in the right direction. I want to thank my good friend from Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY ) for his efforts. I want to thank Mr. VALADAO from California for sponsoring this bill. This is a bipartisan measure that will allow us to address the concerns of modernday crimes of identity and of modernday crimes of privacy. It is a bill that moves in the right direction. While it is not the panacea, it is a good first step to protecting our citizenry. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption by my colleagues, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. ROSS) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 624, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ‘‘A bill to restrict the inclusion of social security account numbers on Federal documents sent by mail, and for other purposes.’’. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. YOHO). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Ohio? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 348 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 953. The Chair appoints the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. DUNCAN ) to preside over the Committee of the Whole. b1500 IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE  
Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill (H.R. 953) to amend the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to clarify Congressional intent regarding the regulation of the use of pesticides in or near navigable waters, and for other purposes, with Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina in the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the first time. The gentleman from Ohio (Mr. GIBBS) and the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. NAPOLITANO ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio. Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Chair, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. Today we are considering H.R. 953, the Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act of 2017, introduced to clarify congressional intent regarding pesticide use in or near navigable waters. The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, otherwise known as FIFRA, is the appropriate Federal statute to govern safety and the use of pesticides. FIFRA first passed in 1910, 62 years before the Clean Water Act was passed. In 2009, the Sixth Circuit Court decision, the National Cotton Council v. EPA, changed how this all works. For years before the Clean Water Act, pesticide use was regulated by the EPA under FIFRA. Under FIFRA, the EPA regulates and approves pesticides for safe use under the label, and they have full jurisdiction under FIFRA. The EPA previously ruled that using pesticides under FIFRAapproved use does not require a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System, otherwise known as NPDES, permit under the Clean Water Act. Because of this court decision in 2009, those who have been safely applying products to control pest populations now must comply with additional NPDES permitting. Some of my colleagues across the aisle have called this Groundhog Day in the past. I agree. Time after time, they have supported increasing the regulations just for regulation’s sake. They are even willing to risk public health and outbreaks of Zika and West Nile virus. The Sixth Circuit Court decision ignored the congressional intent when the FIFRA and the Clean Water Act were passed. The court ignored sensible agency interpretation, it ignored years of regulatory precedent, it expanded the clean water jurisdiction beyond the scope set by Congress and over areas already appropriately regulated. The court decision placed burden on the 
EPA, requiring a new and expanded NPDES permitting process for products already regulated. The EPA says there are about 365,000 pesticide applicators affected by this ruling. They would include State agencies, cities and counties, mosquito control districts, water districts, pesticide applicators, farmers and ranchers, forest managers, scientists, and even everyday citizens or homeowners. The EPA estimates $50 million in paperwork to comply alone every year with this new regulation. Federal, State, and local agencies are forced to spend taxpayer dollars in permitting, paperwork, and compliance. Private applicators, like farmers and ranchers, also face increased costs. This adds compliance costs, adds permitting costs, and it adds time and hurts productivity and efficiency. It does not add any new environmental protections. This bad court decision affecting the budgetary decisions from local agencies, I will give you some examples here: the Benton County, Washington, Mosquito Control District preserves 20 percent of its annual budget in case it is sued under the Clean Water Act. I think it is important to mention when the Clean Water Act was passed in 1972, it was set up with severe penalties to go after the polluters we had—I like to say the polluters of the 1960s—to clean up our waters, that we had severe problems. And when it did that, it also opened it up for citizens’ lawsuits and opens up the door for more litigation. The Benton County, Washington, Mosquito Control District, $37,000 in permit costs and paperwork they have spent. Benton County could have treated almost 2,600 acres for mosquito abatement or 400 lab tests for West Nile virus, or paid for three seasonal workers. In Gem County, Idaho, the Mosquito Abatement District’s staff spends 3 weeks a year tabulating and documenting seasonal pesticide applications related to permit oversight. California vector control districts have estimated that it costs them $3 million to conduct administration of the NPDES permits. They also have to spend 20 percent of their annual operating budget just to maintain the computer software related to the unnecessary NPDES permit. As a result of this court ruling, mosquito districts, State and local agencies, are now vulnerable to frivolous lawsuits for things like simple paperwork violations under the Clean Water Act. Fines for these paperwork violations, which obviously don’t have any affect on the environment, can be as much as $50,000 a day. For example, the Gem County, Idaho, Mosquito Abatement District was forced to spend $450,000 to resolve a lawsuit. In my home State of Ohio, the Mosquito Control District for Toledo is currently embroiled in a citizen’s lawsuit from a simple paperwork violation. The 2012 West Nile outbreak is proof NPDES permits and association costs are hindering the ability to protect the public. In 2012, the first year of the permitting requirement from the court case, West Nile cases jumped from 712 cases to almost to over 5,600 cases. That is nearly an 800 percent increase because of the unnecessary permit requirements. The States and communities affected by West Nile had to wait until after a public health emergency was declared. Only then could relief from the NPDES permit be approved. Only after the West Nile had spread could local agencies use lifesaving pesticides to kill mosquitoes carrying the virus. Keep in mind, when the local entity, municipality, declares an emergency, they don’t need to get a permit. They can spray. I like to say it is after the fact when the mosquitoes are out of control, then we do aerial spraying. Maybe we could have prevented it with surface spraying and be less harm to the environment. We shouldn’t have to wait until it becomes an emergency. H.R. 953 gets rid of the unnecessary red tape so communities can prevent outbreaks of diseases like Zika and West Nile. Cities that need to conduct the routine preventative mosquito abatement should not have to do it with one hand tied behind their back. H.R. 953 provides a narrow, limited exception from NPDES permit requirements for those pesticides already approved under FIFRA law and used in compliance under the label which is approved by the EPA. I think this is an important point to keep in mind: EPA already regulates these pesticides and approves them under FIFRA. It goes through rigorous testing and reporting requirements, and they set the label and make the determination. They approve how it is going to be used. If it is a restricted pesticide, they can also put more restrictions on the applicators and who the applicators are. Therefore, removing this redundant NPDES permit is appropriate because the EPA already has full control and can handle the situation like they did for over 60 years before this court case. The EPA has assisted in drafting H.R. 953, which does not roll back any environmental protections. It fixes the regulatory problem caused by the Sixth Circuit Court’s decision and maintains the EPA’s jurisdiction through FIFRA. Similar legislation has passed the House every Congress since the court’s decision, and I look forward to passing it again today, and then passing it in the Senate and have the President sign it into law. A list of organizations—this is a snapshot of the many organizations because I don’t have enough time to list all the organizations, but the American Mosquito Control Association supports it; the American Farm Bureau Federation; the National Farmers Union; the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture; the National Association of Wheat Growers; National Corn Growers Association; and United Fresh Produce Association. Those are just a few groups representing thousands of Americans who depend on commonsense EPA regulations for their livelihood. Mr. Chair, I include in the RECORD — and I want to talk about it here for a minute—I have a letter from former Secretary of Agriculture Vilsack. In 2009, he was Secretary of Agriculture in the Obama administration. When this court case happened, he sent out a letter to Lisa Jackson, the Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency. In his letter, he urges the EPA to consider the significant adverse effect of the Sixth Circuit Court’s 2009 decision, the National Cotton Council and EPA will have on American farmers and USDA agencies. He said in the letter: ‘‘By broadening the Act’s reach, the court burdens American agriculture with a newly minted NPDES permit requirement. . . .’’ ‘‘The Sixth Circuit’s decision encumbers the American farmers’ and the agencies’ ability to do business, while reaping little or no environmental benefit in exchange.’’ I want to repeat that. The Secretary of Agriculture in the Obama administration said that this court case has little environmental benefit, and it hampers American farmers to do their job to produce the most wholesome, safe, affordable food in the world. ‘‘Subjecting FIFRAcompliant pesticides to the additional regulatory regime’’—he goes on to say—‘‘of the CWA is duplicative and will not help protect the environment.’’ Mr. Chair, I include in the RECORD  this letter, dated March 6, 2009, from Secretary of Agriculture Vilsack and his opposition to the court case and, in his opinion, what this bill does. 
DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE , OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY , Washington, DC, March 6, 2009. Hon. LISAP. J ACKSON , Administrator, U.S. Environment Protection Agency, Washington, DC. Subject: The National Cotton Council of America, et al., v. United States Environmental Protection Agency, Nos. 06– 4630; 07–3180/3181/3182/3183/3184/3185/3186/ 3187/3191/3236 (6th Cir. Jan. 7, 2009). DEAR MS. JACKSON : The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit recently invalidated the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) Final Rule entitled, ‘‘Application of Pesticides to Waters of the United States in Compliance With FIFRA.’’ 71 Fed. Reg. 68,483 (Nov. 27, 2006) (Final Rule). A petition for rehearing or for rehearing en bane before the Sixth Circuit is due on April 9, 2009. I would very much appreciate your taking into consideration the significant adverse effect that the court’s decision will have on American farmers, as well as on U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) agencies, and therefore request that you seek further review of this decision by the Sixth Circuit. 
In its Final Rule, the EPA reasonably interpreted the term ‘‘pollutant’’ in the Clean Water Act (CWA) as generally excluding pesticides that are applied in compliance with the relevant requirements of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). The Final Rule established that the application of pesticides in compliance with FIFRA would not require a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit when they are applied directly into waters of the United States in order to control pests, or when they are applied to control pests that are present over waters of the United States, including near those waters, when a portion of the pesticides unavoidably will be deposited into the water in order to target the pests effectively. The EPA specifically concluded that the terms ‘‘chemical wastes’’ and ‘‘biological materials’’ in the CWA’s definition of pollutants do not encompass the types of pesticide applications addressed in the Final Rule. 71 Fed. Reg. 68,486. The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the Final Rule was contrary to the plain language of the CWA. Although the court agreed with the EPA that chemical pesticides applied directly to water to perform a useful purpose are not chemical wastes, it held that excess pesticides and pesticide residue meet the common definition of waste, and therefore are pollutants under the CWA. The court held that the EPA is required to regulate the residue of chemical pesticides when the pesticide is applied to land or air, and the residue finds its way into the navigable waters of the. United States, and when the pesticide is applied directly to the water and the residue has a lasting effect beyond its intended purpose. The court also found that Congress intended for ‘‘biological materials’’ to encompass more than ‘‘biological wastes.’’ The court held that all biological pesticides are biological materials, and therefore pollutants under the CWA. The court’s adverse decision will have profound implications for American farmers. The panel’s ruling effectively broadens the potential application of the CWA to reach agricultural activities that the EPA has never regulated under the provisions of the CWA. By broadening the Act’s reach, the court burdens American agriculture with a newly minted NPDES permit requirement for the application of all FIFRAcompliant biological pesticides whenever those pesticides might find their way into waters of the United States, and for all FIFRAcompliant chemical pesticides whenever the residues of those pesticides find their way into waters of the United States. The permit requirement could reach almost any pesticide application, requiring farmers to navigate a permitting system that is illsuited to the demands of agricultural production. Failure to obtain a timely permit for pesticide application could cripple American farmers’ emergency pest management efforts and hamper their ability to respond quickly to new pest infestations or threats of infestations, thus increasing the risk of crop losses. Additionally, several USDA agencies engage in the ground and aerial application of pesticides, and would be adversely affected by the panel’s decision. The Forest Service (FS) and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) now will be required to obtain NPDES permits, which could compromise the agencies’ ability to respond with efficiency and flexibility to emerging threats and emergency situations. The delay and expense associated with complying with the NPDES permitting requirement could substantially curtail the agencies’ use of pesticides. For the FS, this could result in diminished efforts to protect the National Forests from pest infestation and could potentially increase the risk and severity of wildfires. It could also significantly hamper aerial spraying programs such as APHIS’s Mormon Cricket and Grasshopper Program, undertaken in cooperation with western states. Additionally, research programs involving both the conventional and the experimental applications of pesticides undertaken by the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) also will be detrimentally affected by the panel’s decision. The timeconsuming and costly process of negotiating the NPDES permit application process will diminish the efficiency with which the ARS will be able to undertake its initiatives, and may, in some instances, curtail the agency’s projects entirely. The Sixth Circuit’s decision encumbers the American farmers’ and the agencies’ ability to do business, while reaping little or no environmental benefit in exchange. Subjecting FIFRAcompliant pesticides to the additional regulatory regime of the CWA is duplicative and will not help protect the environment. FIFRA mandates that the EPA approve and issue a registration for a pesticide product only after the EPA has determined that the product will not cause ‘‘unreasonable adverse effects on the environment.’’ The pesticide registration and reregistration process under FIFRA considers the effects of pesticides on both human health and aquatic resources. If the EPA has concluded that a pesticide satisfies FIFRA and will not have an ‘‘unreasonable adverse effect on the environment,’’ then it is reasonable to exclude the application of that pesticide from the permitting requirements of the CWA. In short, I am concerned that the court’s decision will compromise American farmers’ and USDA agencies’ ability to respond efficiently and effectively to emergency threats, while providing little or no additional environmental protection in return. Thank you for taking these issues into account as you consider seeking further review of this case. Sincerely, THOMAS J. V ILSACK , Secretary. 
Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Chair, I have nearly 120 organizations that support H.R. 953, representing a wide variety of public and private entities and thousands of stakeholders. I have a letter from the nearly 120. I listed some of those. Some of the additional names are Agricultural Retailers Association; American Farm Bureau Federation; American Mosquito Control Association; the Association of Equipment Manufacturers; CropLife America; Family Farm Alliance; National Agricultural Aviation Association; the National Alliance of Forest Owners; National Association of State Departments of Agriculture; National Farmers Union; National Pest Management Association; and the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association. I include that letter in the RECORD . 
MAY3, 2017. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , Washington, DC. DEAR REPRESENTATIVE : On behalf of the over one hundred undersigned organizations, we urge you to vote in favor of H.R. 953, the Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act of 2017. For almost forty years, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and pesticide applicators including public health agencies charged with mosquito control operated exclusively under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). In fact, EPA has testified to the adequacy of FIFRA’s comprehensive regulatory requirements including substantial enforcement mechanisms in pursuit of that goal. However, a 2009 activistinspired lawsuit resulted in a federal court decision identifying a technicality in the law that Congress had not properly clarified its intent that FIFRA should have preeminence over the Clean Water Act (CWA). This decision resulted in pesticide users being required to obtain a CWA National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit. These permits were originally created to address the discharge of waste by major industrial polluters, but now are mandated for mosquito control districts and others who are applying pesticides approved by EPA for use in the environment for their beneficial purposes of trying to prevent or control the spread of public health disease in the U.S. Though the NPDES permit burden lacks any additional environmental benefit under these circumstances, it does force substantial costs on thousands of small application businesses and farms, as well as the municipal, county, state and federal agencies responsible for protecting natural resources and public health. Further, and most menacing, the permit exposes all pesticide users—regardless of permit eligibility—to the liability of CWAbased citizen law suits. In a number of instances, applicators—that once conducted mosquito abatement applications for local governments and homeowner associations—can’t afford the costs or risk of frivolous litigation that accompanies NPDES PGPs and have refrained from conducting public health applications. H.R. 953 would clarify Congressional intent that federal law does not require this redundant permit for already regulated pesticide applications. In the 112th Congress, similar legislation (H.R. 872) passed the House Committee on Agriculture and went on to pass the House of Representatives on suspension. In the 113th Congress, the legislation (H.R. 935) passed both the House Committees on Agriculture and Transportation & Infrastructure by voice vote, and again, the House of Representatives. In the 114th Congress, the Zika Vector Control Act (H.R. 897) passed the House of Representatives yet again. With your help and support, H.R. 953 will also pass the House and hopefully become law. Since H.R. 897 passed the House last year, there has been yet another costly lawsuit against a mosquito control district, forcing the district to spend its funds fighting in court instead of protecting public health. Under these circumstances, NPDES permit requirements impact the use of critical pesticides in protecting human health and the food supply from destructive and diseasecarrying pests, and in managing invasive weeds to keep open waterways and shipping lanes, to maintain rights of way for transportation and power generation, and in preventing damage to forests and recreation areas. The time and funds expended on redundant permit compliance drains public and private resources. All this for no measurable benefit to the environment.

AMERICAN MOSQUITO CONTROL ASSOCIATION  STATEMENT ON NPDES B URDEN  
2017 From the perspective of the agencies charged with suppressing mosquitoes and other vectors of public health consequence, the NPDES burden is directly related to combatting Zika and other mosquitotransmitted diseases. For over forty years and through both Democratic and Republican administrations, the EPA and states held that these permits did not apply to public health pesticide applications. However, activist lawsuits forced the EPA to require such permits even for the application of EPAregistered pesticides including mosquito control. AMCA has testified numerous times to establish the burden created by this court ruling. The threat to the public health mission of America’s mosquito control districts comes in two costly parts: 
ONGOING COMPLIANCE COSTS  Though the activists contend that the NPDES permit has ‘‘modest notification and monitoring requirements’’ the actual experience of mosquito control districts is much different. Initially obtaining and maintaining an NPDES permit comes at considerable expense. California mosquito control districts estimate the NPDES compliance costs for their 64 districts to be approximately $4 million dollars over six years. These costs include; Initial amount spent by Districts determining waters subject to reporting. Total amount spent by Districts tracking treatments to Waters of the US Water Testing Consultants NPDES Administration/Regulatory Consultants Legal fees related to NPDES Physical monitoring of larvicides—not completed by consultants Completing annual reports In Wyoming, there are several issues that have impacted the mosquito districts; Record keeping requirements has redirected 2–5 % of District funds annually to permit fees and administrative costs. The cost for acre applications of both adulticide and larvicides has increased 5 to 10fold for some Districts. This is due primarily to the fear that local aerial applicators have regarding the citizen lawsuits. The local ag pilots have declined to fly for some of the mosquito districts in Wyoming, requiring them to go out of state to professional application companies. The City of Laramie which was able to treat for an estimated $1 per acre now pays an estimated $5– $10 per acre. This has greatly reduced the acres that can be treated with larvicide and adulticides. In Durango, CO, the Animas Mosquito Control District reported spending over $50,000 in GPS/GIS system, maintenance and upgrades purchased to comply with an unknown annual report requirement. They spent numerous hours conducting meetings, phone calls and on the computer to clarify the annual reporting requirements, the detail necessary in annual reports, and even where to send the information. The fact that the existence of the permit over the last 6 years has no additional environmental benefit (since pesticide applications are already governed by FIFRA) makes these taxpayer diversions from vector control unconscionable. In a survey of mosquito control programs, 71 reported (out of 734 nationwide) that their multiyear period expenses incurred due to the NPDES permitting including operational, permitting, reporting, monitoring and other administrative costs totaled over $4 million. (This survey does not include all of the 6year California estimate mentioned previously). HOW COULD $4 MILLION IN NPDES COSTS BE  
BETTER SPENT  Seasonal field workers ($11,000 for starter), 377 employees. Bti larvicide ($1.44/lb), 2,879,738 pounds. Acres of water larvicided aerially (10 lbs/ acre + $5.25 applicator cost = $19.65), 211,034 acres. Acres of water treated by ground crews (10 lbs./acre), 287,973 acres. West Nile virus—in house testing of adult mosquitoes (RAMP) $19.36, 214,195 tests. 30 second radio ads for public education ($40–$200), 103,671–20,734. Acres of aerial adult mosquito control ($.89 applicator fee + $.95 chemical), 2,253,708 acres. Evening ground spraying hours ($396/hr. for vehicle, employee, adulticide), 10,472 hrs. Every dollar spent on duplicative regulations is a dollar that could have been used towards Integrated Pest Management (IPM) activities that control mosquitoes and prevent mosquitoborne illness. Resources must not be diverted from these mosquito control activities in order to protect public health: Disease surveillance—trapping and testing adult mosquitoes, monitoring dead birds. Larvicides and adult mosquito control—reduce mosquito populations through targeted applications Habitat modification/source reduction— ditching/dredgers to permanently reduce mosquito oviposition habitats to reduce the need for chemical control measures. Monitoring invasive species of mosquitoes. Public education—publications on reducing backyard sources of mosquitoes, information on repellent and personal protective measures. Employees, training, and certifications. Programs that are most affected: Poorer, rural mosquito control districts Programs associated with small municipalities In the Western US, those associated with private aerial contractors concerned with taking on the added liability. Municipalities in the south looking to start Zika virus control efforts. Why would Congress approve $1.1 Billion to fight and explore Zika virus and then burden us with regulations that hinder our ability to control the vector of the disease? So, why would the activist organizations be so adamant that these permits be mandatory for public health pesticide applications ...?  
EXPOSURE TO ACTIVIST LITIGATION  Municipal mosquito control programs are vulnerable to CWA citizen lawsuits where fines to mosquito control districts may exceed $37,500/day. Under FIFRA, the activists would need to demonstrate that the pesticides were misapplied, that the product labels were not followed. Additionally, this is not a question of the applications causing harm to public health. The pesticides we use are specific to mosquitoes and are generally used in very low doses by qualified applicators). However, the CWA 3rd Party Citizen Suit Provision allows for any third party to sue for alleged violations of NPDES program requirements. Additionally, the CWA does not require actual evidence of a misapplication of a pesticide or harm to the environment, 
but rather simple paperwork violations or merely allegations in permit oversight. The Toledo Area Sanitary District is currently involved in a lawsuit that has already initially cost the mosquito control program more than $40,000 in legal fees, and the case has yet to go to court. This could lead to an injunction on the spray program and end up costing taxpayers $100,000+ dollars, even though the case has nothing to do with substantive water quality issues, but rather focuses on alleged administrative paperwork violations. Gem County Mosquito Abatement District (ID) was the subject of one of these activist lawsuits utilizing the 3rd Party Citizen Suit Provision. It took ten years and the grand total of an entire year’s annual operating budget ($450,000) to resolve that litigation against that public health entity. These ongoing compliance costs and threat of crushing litigation directly impact mosquito control districts. The existence of this unnecessary requirement for mosquito control activities is directly related to our ability to combat the vectors related to Zika. It diverts precious resources away from finding and suppressing mosquito populations. The American Mosquito Control Association urges Congress to vote ‘‘YES’’ on H.R. 953, the Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act of 2017. 
AMERICAN FARMBUREAU FEDERATION , Washington, DC, May 24, 2017. Hon. BILLSHUSTER , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. BOBGIBBS, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. MICHAEL CONAWAY , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. GARRET GRAVES , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARREPS. SHUSTER , GIBBS, CONAWAY AND  GRAVES : Later this week, the House is expected to vote on H.R. 953, ‘‘The Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act of 2017.’’ This legislation has previously passed the House of Representatives with strong bipartisan support, and the American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF) urges all members of Congress to vote in favor of the bill. H.R. 953 is narrowly crafted to clarify that lawful use of pesticides in or near navigable waters is not excessively covered under two statutes, the Clean Water Act and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act. In doing so, the measure simply codifies EPA’s longstanding interpretation of the law before it was thrown into confusion by a 2009 court ruling, which imposed an additional layer of needless red tape on pesticide applicators. H.R. 953 corrects the duplicative requirements associated with EPA’s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) pesticide permit by specifying that NPDES permits are not needed for the lawful application of EPAlabeled pesticides. This is an important fix that will reduce red tape and legal liabilities associated with the lawful use of pesticides in protecting public health and food security. We urge all members to vote in favor of the ‘‘Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act of 2017.’’ Thank you very much for your support. Sincerely, ZIPPY DUVALL , President. 
Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Chair, I also include in the RECORD a letter from the National Association of Counties. NACo recommends that Congress address some of challenges posed by the EPA’s Clean Water Act permit for pesticides to allow counties to more quickly respond to the mosquitobased public health threats. Counties have reported either significantly scaled back or discontinued mosquito abatement programs due to the additional, duplicative, and expensive paperwork and monitoring obligations required by the program. NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES , Washington, DC, May 21, 2017. Hon. PAULD. R YAN, Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. NANCY PELOSI , Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARSPEAKER RYAN AND MINORITY LEADER  PELOSI : As the U.S. House of Representatives moves forward with the ‘‘Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act of 2017’’ (H.R. 953), we would like to highlight the impact that U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Pesticide General Permit (PGP) program has on county governments’ ability to respond promptly and effectively to emerging public health threats. As the summer months approach and we enter mosquito season, counties are concerned about the health and safety impacts of mosquitoborne illnesses such as Zika. The Zika virus is an emerging mosquito borne illness, primarily stemming from the bite of infected Aedes mosquitoes, and there is no vaccine. Since mosquitos and their breeding habitats pose the largest threat to public safety, counties can play a major role in minimizing the potential spread of the virus and other mosquitoborne illnesses through public education and mosquito eradication. However, since EPA’s PGP program was instituted in 2011, counties have reported that they have either significantly scaled back or discontinued mosquito abatement programs due to additional, duplicative and expensive paperwork and monitoring obligations required under the permit. We recommend that Congress address some of the challenges posed by EPA’s PGP permit to allow counties to more quickly respond to mosquitobased public health threats. We thank you for your leadership on this issue. We look forward to continuing to work with you on issues important to counties. Sincerely, MATTHEW D. C HASE , Executive Director, National Association of Counties. 
Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Chair, I thank the Agriculture Committee chairman, MIKECONAWAY ; and the Transportation and Infrastructure chairman, BILL SHUSTER , who are the leadership on this issue. I want to thank the Agriculture Committee ranking member, COLLIN PETERSON , as well. Mr. Chair, I urge all Members to support this commonsense effort to reform this duplicative EPA regulation. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 953, Reducing the Regulatory Burdens Act. As I have noted before on similar bills in the past, I remain concerned that this bill would mean that no Clean Water Act protections would be required for pesticide application to water bodies that are already impaired by pesticides. The Clean Water Act in no way hinders, delays, or prevents the use of approved pesticides for pest control operations. In fact, the Clean Water Act permit provides a specific emergency provision to prevent outbreaks of diseases such as Zika virus. Under the terms of the permit, pesticide applicators are covered automatically under the permit and any spraying may be performed immediately for any declared pest emergency situations. In most instances, sprayers are only required to notify EPA of their spraying operations 30 days after the beginning of a spraying operation. Most pesticide applications in the United States are done in accordance with FIFRA, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act which only requires proper labeling on pesticide products regarding usage. However, FIFRA labeling is no substitute for ensuring that we understand the volumes of pesticide we seem to apply to our rivers, our lakes, our streams on an annual basis. b1515 According to a 2006 USGS report on pesticides, commonly used pesticides frequently are present in streams and groundwater at levels that exceed human health benchmarks and occur in many streams at levels that may affect aquatic or fisheating wildlife and also human life. In the data that the States provide the EPA, more than 16,000 miles of rivers and streams, 1,380 of bays and estuaries, and 370,000 acres of lakes in the United States are currently impaired or threatened by pesticides. The EPA suggests that these estimates may be low because many of these States do not test for or monitor all the different pesticides that are currently being used. I am very concerned of the effect these pesticides have on the health of our rivers, our streams, and especially the drinking water supplies for all our citizens, especially the most vulnerable, the young, the elderly, and the poor and disenfranchised people who have no representation. We have much cancer appearing, and we have no idea what it is. Adding pesticides is not helping. Mr. Chair, I include in the RECORD a Federal report on how pesticides in California are the leading cause of impairments to water quality. 
U.S. EPA R EPORT ON CALIFORNIA WATER  QUALITY ASSESSMENT  
REPORTING YEAR 2012  Pesticides are the Cause of water impairment in California for 4,534 miles of rivers and streams, 235,765 acres of lakes, ponds, and reservoirs, 829 square miles of bays and estuaries, 35 miles of coastal shoreline, 42 square miles of ocean and near coastal waters, and 43 acres of wetlands. 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Currently in California there are over 4,500 miles of rivers and streams, 235,000 acres of lakes and reservoirs, and 829 square 
miles of bays and estuaries in my State that are impaired by pesticides. This is a significant concern in my home State, where every drop of water has to be cleaned and needs to be conserved, reused, and cherished. We hear that pesticide application is already regulated under FIFRA and that the Clean Water Act review is not needed. I understand the concerns about the duplication of effort and the need to minimize the impacts that regulations have on small business or business at large. All the supporters are mostly farmers and other business entities. However, I am still very concerned that these pesticides are having a very significant impact on water quality and that, with this bill, we are creating the exemption from water quality protection requirements without considering the impacts to the waters that are already impacted by pesticides, as they are in California. This, in turn, costs our water users, our ratepayers hundreds of millions of dollars to filter these pollutants out of water before it is potable. This is something I deal with on an ongoing basis as the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment. We currently have aquifers that are contaminated by the continued use of pesticides and fertilizers. Millions of dollars have been spent on the 20plusyearlong cleanup effort of a Superfund site in my area that has pesticides as one of the contaminants. We cannot, and should not, take away one of the only tools available to monitor for adverse impacts of pesticides in our rivers, our streams, and our reservoirs. Over the past 6 years, this tool has been reasonable, has been workable to pest control operators and agricultural interests alike, and needs to be retained. I urge my colleagues on both sides to vote ‘‘no’’ on this bill. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chair, I rise today also in support of H.R. 953, the Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act of 2017. The House Committee on Agriculture, which I serve on, as does Chairman GIBBS, passed this bill out of committee every Congress since the 112th Congress. The bill language was likewise included in the 2012 farm bill, reported out of the committee, as well as in the 2013 farm bill the House sent to conference. It was also included in the committeereported text of the FY 2012 Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill. But it has never reached the President’s desk. For more than 100 years, the Federal Government has administered its responsibilities under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, FIFRA, to review and register pesticides in a responsible way that protects human health and the environment. Under the Clean Water Act, the EPA or a State authority issues a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit, NPDES permit, and that regulates the discharge of pollutants. NPDES permits specify limits on what pollutants may be discharged from point sources and in what amounts. Since the passage of the Clean Water Act in 1972, the EPA has interpreted its responsibilities related to pesticide use such that compliance with FIFRA would mitigate the need for duplicative permitting under the Clean Water Act. As litigation in the early part of this decade began to challenge this interpretation, the EPA ultimately responded with the promulgation of a regulation on November 27, 2006, to clarify how these two laws operated. Under the EPA’s final rule, the Agency codified its earlier interpretation that permits for pesticide application under the Clean Water Act were unnecessary where pesticides were used in accordance with their regulation under FIFRA. Following the finalization of this regulation, the rule was challenged in numerous jurisdictions. The case was ultimately heard in the Sixth Circuit wherein the government’s interpretation of the interaction of these two laws was not given the deference we would normally expect. The final court order nullified the EPA’s regulation and imposed what is viewed as a burdensome, costly, and duplicative permitting process under the Clean Water Act for literally millions of pesticide applications. This order has imposed a burden on the EPA, State regulatory agencies, and pesticide applicators, costing our economy in terms of jobs as well as severely threatening the already critical budgetary situation facing governments at all levels. It is particularly unfortunate that this court order imposed a new requirement that has imperiled our water resource boards, our mosquito control boards, and our forestry and agricultural sectors, yet has provided no additional environmental or public health protection. On the contrary, by imposing this costly burden on public health pesticide users, it has jeopardized public health as it relates to protection against insectborne diseases such as the Zika virus, West Nile virus, various forms of encephalitis, and Lyme disease. I recently heard from the Macon County Mosquito Abatement District in my district based in and around Decatur, Illinois. They can attest that the price of complying with NPDES permitting is very high. Though they had in place a reliable system of tracking chemical usage and treatment areas for years, the added burden of the NPDES requirements have caused them to spend a large portion of the district’s annual budget on software strictly just for compliance and reporting processes. The recurring yearly fees associated with the software are a neverending burden needlessly placed on abatement districts. The fear of litigation dictates the detailed tracking of EPAapproved products and diverts those funds from their actual purpose of controlling mosquitoes. The EPA has provided technical assistance to draft this very narrow legislation. The goal of this legislation has been to address only those problems created by the decision of the Sixth Circuit and to be entirely consistent with the policy of the EPA, as stated in their November 27, 2006, final rule governing application of pesticides to waters of the United States in compliance with FIFRA. I urge all Members to vote for this legislation. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. COSTA ). Mr. COSTA. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 953, Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act of 2017. This legislation eliminates the requirement to acquire two permits for the same pesticide application under two separate laws and, I might add, if you live in California, there is a separate requirement under the California Clean Water Act that requires an additional permit. That would still apply regardless if this legislation is passed. In order to be permitted to use a pesticide, that pesticide must be approved under FIFRA, which includes an analysis that must be performed that finds it will not generally cause unreasonable adverse effects to the environment or to the health. However, current law requires another permit to be acquired for the same action under the Clean Water Act if you happen to be close to a water body, and that is where the duplication occurs. Not only are these requirements redundant, they are expensive, and the cost of the individual Clean Water Act permit ranges from $150,000 to $270,000 and can take up to 2 years. No one wants to risk human health, not I, not anyone, but in my opinion this would not do so. We have Zika, we have West Nile, and we have a host of spreading of these diseases by mosquitoes in which this, in fact, can address those issues. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this bill in order to remove this unnecessary, unneeded regulatory burden and expense. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, we agree that no one thinks this bill is going to harm anyone. We are trying to look for commonsense provisions, and I am thankful to my colleague for making this a bipartisan solution. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. YOHO). Mr. YOHO. Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague for yielding me just a moment to speak on the absolute necessity of passing the Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act. The Sixth Circuit Court blatantly overstepped its authority in directing the EPA to establish a 
duplicative permitting process for pesticide use. The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, known as FIFRA, already requires the EPA to review the data and evaluate risks and exposures associated with the use of certain insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, and rodenticides. After the EPA evaluates the risk associated with the use of a given pesticide, FIFRA prohibits its use for any purpose not already approved by the EPA. Approved uses are clearly labeled. Requiring additional reviews under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System is simply unnecessary and burdensome. Furthermore, unless the body sets the record straight and overturns the Sixth Circuit decision, we will be opening a triedandtrue permitting process to numerous citizen lawsuits that will be bad for agriculture and, as all such bad decisions, result in increased costs paid for by the American consumers. I urge my colleagues to stand behind Mr. GIBBS and this bill, stand behind the science, and help him pass this. When he came, he started to work on this in 2010, his hair was brown. Now it is gray. So let’s help him get this bill passed. Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. PETERSON ). Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to support the Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act of 2017. This bill would restore congressional intent regarding the relationship between FIFRA and the Clean Water Act. Historically, Congress has viewed FIFRA as sufficient to protect human health and the environment. Until the early part of the past decade, even the EPA interpreted its responsibilities related to pesticide use as compliance with FIFRA would reduce the need for duplicative permitting under the Clean Water Act. If pesticides were used according to their regulation under FIFRA, then permits for pesticide application under the Clean Water Act were unnecessary. Unfortunately, this historic interpretation has been overturned by activist litigation. In 2009, a decision by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals upended the historic interpretation of the space between these two laws. The Sixth Circuit order created a new permitting requirement that provides no additional environmental or public health protection. The goal of this legislation has been to address only those problems created by the Sixth Circuit decision and to be consistent with congressional intent and the EPA’s longheld interpretation. It is a commonsense solution to a courtimposed regulatory burden that Congress never intended to be applied. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate my colleague and friend from Minnesota for his bipartisan support of H.R. 953. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. SCALISE ), the majority whip. Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Chairman, I want to first thank my colleague from Ohio for his leadership on bringing forth this important legislation to actually help us focus more resources on killing mosquitoes, especially as the mosquito season starts, as we see so many threats with Zika, with West Nile, just the damage that we see happening around our country from mosquitoes. We have decided we are going to put resources into killing mosquitoes, and then we come about and find out about these regulations that were imposed by the courts in a way that actually makes it harder for us to kill mosquitoes. b1530 What you hear so often from people around the country is: Why is it that you have got things happening out of Washington that make no sense? Congressman GIBBS identified one of those areas and said it really doesn’t make sense. We tried to work through a different remedy to try to get the administration to fix it, and they pointed to a court case that keeps them from fixing it. It is one of the big frustrations you have that it actually takes an act of Congress to bring common sense into the process of killing mosquitoes, for goodness sake. But here we are doing it. At least we are spending the people’s business doing something that actually injects common sense back into the things that people do in their daily lives. All across our community and across this country, you have local governments that are really the ones that focus on killing mosquitoes, and we started hearing about this problem. Of course, Mr. Chairman, we asked the EPA to identify just how much this is actually costing. So as everybody scrambles and fights and you hear agencies saying ‘‘I need more money to do this,’’ ‘‘I need more money to do that,’’ we need to be more responsible with the taxpayers’ money, and people are saying, ‘‘Live within your means.’’ And we have asked the EPA. The EPA, Mr. Chairman, told us that the cost of implementing these EPA regulations is an extra $50 million a year. Think of how ludicrous that is. Because of the way the EPA is implementing the law, as we are trying to kill more mosquitoes, it is costing $50 million a year to comply with burdensome, duplicative regulations—rather than killing mosquitoes. We should be spending that money, $50 million, killing more mosquitoes, not killing trees to comply with ridiculous regulations. So I want to commend my colleague from Ohio for bringing this back. The House passed this in a very bipartisan way last Congress. We didn’t get it all the way to the President’s desk. So this year, hopefully, we will get this bill not only passed through the House, but through the Senate and to President Trump’s desk, where he will sign a bill that injects common sense back into the process of killing mosquitoes. Let’s spend our money killing mosquitoes, not killing trees and having to comply with ridiculous regulations that come out of Washington and make no sense. Let’s pass this bill. Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DEFAZIO). Mr. DEFAZIO. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. Mr. Chairman, this is the fifth time the United States House of Representatives has considered this bill. Now, we have heard a lot of alternative facts today. Let’s have some real facts. Killing trees, well, first off, here is the extensive application. It is slightly over three pages long and it can be filed electronically, so we don’t need to kill any trees. Allegations that somehow this slows down control of mosquito abatement or Zika virus are absolutely false. Anybody can apply a pesticide in a public health situation. They have 30 days to file the paperwork online afterwards. It takes about 5 minutes. It has such technical things as your name and address, your pesticide applicator license verified with a certain State, where you are going to use the pesticide or herbicide. Now, why would we want to know that? Or maybe, why wouldn’t we want not to know that? Because that is what they are saying on that side of the aisle. There is nothing registered with the Department of Agriculture. Yes, we have FIFRA. These pesticides and herbicides have been registered. They have labels—it can’t be applied over water; it can’t be applied here; it can’t be applied there—and we trust the applicators to follow those rules. But when they actually use the herbicides and pesticides absent this form, this burdensome 3
1⁄2page form, we won’t know. Now, why would we care? Well, this is essentially the 20th anniversary of a massive fish kill in Jackson County, Oregon. In that incident, an operator applied an aquatic herbicide in an irrigation canal that, when it leaked into the nearby creek, killed 92,000 steelhead. Now, we kind of care about our steelhead in the Northwest, so that was a problem. So then the Federal agency said, Well, this is kind of a problem when someone does that, 92,000 steelhead. Plus, anybody who drank the water was poisoned, et cetera, et cetera. But we don’t want to know about that on that side of the aisle because Dow Chemical doesn’t like it because maybe it inhibits sales of some of these chemicals that cause these sorts of problems. Now, we have data now because of these forms, and we know about areas 
that are impaired. In my State, which is like the clean, green State, 825 miles of rivers and streams and 10,000 acres of lakes and ponds in the State of Oregon are impaired by pesticide contamination. That is something we should do something about. People are drinking that water; they are swimming in that water; their kids are bathing in that water. I think that is a problem. But we don’t want to know about that. This is just a horrible restraint on pesticide applications. Now, we heard a lot of other hooey here. It is like: This is so difficult; it is so difficult to do. I was talking to the ranking member of the Agriculture Committee. He said, well, farmers don’t want to file those forms. If they hired a pesticide applicator, that person could file the form for them. Or, yeah, maybe they are going to have to file the 3page form if it involves the waters of the United States of America. If it doesn’t involve the waters, you don’t have to file it. So this is really an incredible thing. Now, we have taken this up numerous times. It was the Pest Management and Fire Suppression Flexibility Act in the 109th Congress—the same bill, exactly the same bill. Then in the 112th and the 113th Congresses, it was the Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act. It still didn’t work. It didn’t become law then. Well, wait a minute. Let’s pass it on to public fears. Last Congress, it was called the Zika Vector Control Act in the 114th Congress. We just heard a lot of hooey about how this will inhibit killing mosquitoes, which, of course, is absolutely not true. But now we are back to here. So the Zika Control Act and the Pest Management and Fire Suppression Flexibility Act are now back to the Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act. Now, in the past 6 years, since this paperwork was required, or electronic work, do you know how many pesticide applicators have faced significant impacts because of these protections? None. Zero. Do you know how many applicators have raised problems with the Clean Water Act pesticide general permit to EPA? None. Zero. In fact, I specifically asked this question of the EPA’s head of water at a Transportation and Infrastructure subcommittee hearing. No specific instances where the clean water permit was causing problems or impacts on pesticide application. Yet here we are again, one more time, under the guise of reducing this horrible regulatory burden: name, address, phone number, what did you apply? Where are you registered to apply these sorts of permits? That is useful information. I had a couple more instances in Oregon. Tiller, Oregon, again, right in the same area where the steelhead were killed. That same creek was contaminated with atrazine in 2014. Local residents who drank the water complained, and they also complained of the overspray. Then, in 2013, a helicopter in Curry County, Oregon, oversprayed residents. Now, if they didn’t have to file these forms, we wouldn’t know who did it, when they did it, and what the chemical was. I guess that is kind of what the Republicans want. If someone oversprays your property and sprays stuff on you: ‘‘Geez, I don’t know. That was one of those black helicopters. We don’t know where it came from, or who that was. We don’t know what they dumped on you. Sorry.’’ That is burdensome paperwork. We wouldn’t want to require that kind of burdensome paperwork. So that is why we are here again today for the fifth time with the fifth remaining rationale for what we are doing here today, and it still fails the smell test. Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much time each side has remaining. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Ohio has 10 minutes remaining. The gentlewoman from California has 16 minutes remaining. Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I just want to make a few remarks on what my friend, my colleague from Oregon said. I call it the rest of the story. We talked about the fish kill in 1996 of the steelhead. I inquired of this tragic incident and came to the conclusion that NPDES permitting under the Clean Water Act would not have prevented the fish kill. In 2003, the EPA Office of Pesticide Programs published a report which looked at this potential risk posed by the herbicide that was used in the 1996 fish kill. The report stated: 
Where sufficient information has been provided, it appears that the fish incidents are as a result of misuse. The form of misuse is that water was released from the irrigation canals too early. In some cases, this was because the gate valves were not properly closed or that they leaked. In other cases, the applicator opened them intentionally, but too soon. In one case, boards that helped contain the irrigation canal water may have been removed by children playing. 
The EPA goes on in the report to address each of the various species of salmon and steelhead analyzed and repeatedly states: 
It is very unlikely the pesticide suspected to cause the Oregon fish kill would have affected the steelhead or salmon if it was used in accordance with the label requirements. Completing NPDES permit paperwork and paying a permit fee does not prevent fish kills, nor does it improve water quality. Pesticide applications in accordance with FIFRA pesticide labels will avoid adverse environmental impacts, including fish kills. 
If a pesticide is improperly applied, there are enforcement mechanisms in place to address this violation. In the case of the 1996 Oregon fish kill, I understand the party was subject to more than $400,000 in fines and reimbursements for the incident. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. ALLEN ). Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Ohio for his work on this important legislation. Today, I rise in support of H.R. 953, the Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act. This legislation will bring muchneeded relief to our American farmers. They put in a great deal of time and money to deal with duplicative regulations like the one we are addressing here today. This bill will take away needless provisions regarding pesticide regulations under the Clean Water Act. Pesticide applications are already federally regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act. This permitting was unnecessary and duplicative, punishing American farmers due to a misguided court decision. In my district in Georgia, farmers have to deal with a variety of environmental difficulties, like the devastating freeze just this last March. The Federal Government should not be adding redundant mandates to already overburdened farmers. The Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act has been passed out of the House Agriculture Committee five times. It is time for Congress to correct this mistake and give farmers and pesticide applicators muchneeded relief once and for all. Mr. Chairman, as a proud cosponsor of this bill, I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation. Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I include in the RECORD the following letters to be made part of today’s record: A letter from 46 national and State conservation and public health interest groups opposed to H.R. 953, and, secondly, a list of over 150 different organizations who oppose efforts to undermine the Clean Water Act protections for direct pesticide applications, including the Alabama Rivers, San Francisco, and the list goes on. And the organizations: Alliance of Nurses for Healthy Environments; from Alaska, the Alaska Community Action on Toxics; From Arkansas, the Earth Cause Organization; from California, Audubon and many others; from Alabama, Alabama Rivers; from Colorado, Colorado Riverkeeper; from the District of Columbia, Potomac Riverkeeper; from Florida, Emerald Coastkeeper; from Georgia, Altamaha Riverkeeper and Altamaha Coastkeeper; from Idaho, the Idaho Conservation League; from Illinois, the Illinois Council of Trout Unlimited; and from Iowa, Quad Cities Riverkeeper. And the list goes on, Mr. Chairman. 
MAY22, 2017. Re Oppose H.R. 953 (Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act of 2017). DEAR REPRESENTATIVE : On behalf of our millions of members and supporters nationwide, we urge you to oppose H.R. 953 (‘‘Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act of 2017’’). A 
more apt title for this damaging legislation is the ‘‘Poison Our Waters Act’’ because it would eliminate Clean Water Act safeguards that protect our waterways and communities from excessive pesticide pollution. The Pesticide General Permit targeted in this legislation has been in place for nearly six years now and alarmist predictions by pesticide manufacturers and others about the impacts of this permit have failed to bear any fruit. This bill is the same legislation that pesticide manufacturers and other special interests have been pushing for years. It has been opposed not only by the Obama Administration. but also more than 150 public health, fishing, and conservation organizations (see attached list). Contrary to earlier claims made by its proponents, this bill will not improve nor impact spraying to combat Zika virus and other human health threats. The Pesticide General Permit at issue already allows for spraying to combat vectorborne diseases such as Zika and the West Nile virus. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the permit ‘‘provides that pesticide applications are covered automatically under the permit and may be performed immediately for any declared emergency pest situations’’ (emphasis added). Further, the Clean Water Act has no significant effect on farming practices. The Pesticide General Permit in no way affects land applications of pesticides for the purpose of controlling pests (that is, spraying that doesn’t discharge into water bodies). Irrigation return flows and agricultural stormwater runoff do not require permits, even when they contain pesticides. Existing agricultural exemptions in the Clean Water Act remain. Repealing the Pesticide General Permit— as this damaging legislation seeks to do— would allow pesticides to be discharged into water bodies without any meaningful oversight since the federal pesticide registration law (the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA)) does not require tracking of such applications. Now that the Pesticide General Permit is in place, the public is finally getting information that they couldn’t obtain before about the types of pesticides being sprayed or discharged into local bodies of water. All across the country, pesticide applicators are complying with the Pesticide General Permit to protect water quality without issue, The Pesticide General Permit simply lays out commonsense practices for applying pesticides directly to waters that currently fall under the jurisdiction of the Clean Water Act. Efforts to block this permit are highly controversial, as evidenced by the attached list of groups opposed. Please protect the health of your state’s citizens and all Americans by opposing H.R. 953.

Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Chairman, there is one other thing that I want to bring to the attention of this committee. One of the potential human health applications related to unregulated discharges to water is drinking water. In May of 2017, the Natural Resources Defense Council released a report entitled, ‘‘Threats on Tap,’’ that documented potentially harmful contaminants in tap water in every State of the Union. This report, based on information obtained from State and local public drinking water utilities, documented tens of thousands of drinking water violations related to chemicals and other contaminants currently found in our domestic water supply. The report included a focus on synthetic organic compounds commonly found in a wide variety of products, from household cleaners to industrial, commercial, and agricultural products, including pesticides and herbicides regulated under FIFRA. b1545 According to this report, human exposure to these contaminants can lead to cancers—I repeat, lead to cancers— developmental effects, central nervous system, and reproductive difficulties, endocrine issues, or liver and kidney problems. According to an appendix of this report, which I include in today’s RECORD , in 2015, there were 6,864 drinking water violations associated with synthetic organic compounds, potentially affecting as many as 2.6 million drinking water users. Of these, a number were for direct, healthrelated violations affecting more than 300,000 individuals. This report documented ongoing drinking water violations for the worst of the worst pesticides in terms of human health effects, including, atrazine, chlordane, endrin, and glyphosate. Mr. Chairman, thanks to this report, we have more information on exactly where these drinking water violations are occurring and how increased use of pesticides on or near water increases the risk that humans will be exposed to these dangerous chemicals when they turn on the tap; which begs the question: Why the proponents of this bill want to reduce the public disclosure and monitoring requirements of the Clean Water Act relating to pesticide applications? Do these proponents want to let these pesticide applications and chemical companies go back in the shadows where information on the release of pesticides is no longer known? I include in the RECORD a list of chemicals and their potential health impact. 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Chairman, I just implore all our colleagues to take a good look at what this can have an effect on our general populace, I mean, the human impact, and I trust that they will vote ‘‘no’’ on this bill. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. In my closing, I just want to really reemphasize the importance to pass this bill and get it signed into law because the environment is at risk, human safety is at risk, human health is at risk. We have over 100 Zika outbreaks currently in the United States. We have hundreds of West Nile outbreaks. And what this bill does is it puts a tool in the toolbox for our mosquito control districts, an additional tool to help eradicate or control the mosquito population to prevent and protect human health around our citizens. There has been a lot of talk about pesticide chemicals in the water, and some of these chemicals that have been mentioned are what we call legacy chemicals that were used years ago. As a farmer, I can tell you some of the chemicals we used when I started farming in 1975 didn’t break down. They weren’t biodegradable. The industry has changed a lot. We have new chemicals, better chemicals, safer chemicals. Many of them are biodegradable. So these legacy issues are not—the contaminants in a lot of the 
water today isn’t from chemicals being used in today’s agricultural environment, but it is from past years because those chemicals last in the environment for many years. I think it is also important that the former Secretary of Agriculture—I stated earlier—Tom Vilsack, was very concerned about this, and he sent a letter to the EPA Administrator at the time, Lisa Jackson, that this court case doesn’t do anything to help protect the environment or protect water quality in the United States, and it adds additional costs and burdens to our agricultural producers in their efforts to produce the wholesome, safe, affordable food supply to feed the world. This is commonsense legislation, and I urge people to vote for H.R. 953. As has been said earlier, this bill has been up several other times in previous Congresses; it has had strong bipartisan support. Unfortunately, the Senate did not move on it and take action. Hopefully this time we will see that, especially with the outbreaks of Zika and West Nile and seeing the cost. It was mentioned earlier, too, about the cost of getting the permit. Obviously, doing the permit, actually applying it probably isn’t much costly, but to get all the stuff lined up, the consultants and all the paperwork they have to do to get the information there is quite costly. We had in previous committee hearings mosquito control districts coming in and talking about the cost. The thousands of dollars they are spending has blown their budget where they could be using that to spend on mosquito eradication. So, obviously, we have hundreds of groups around the country that support this legislation. It is needed, and I urge my colleagues to support it so we can move on and protect the environment, enhance the environment, and also human health and safety. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. YOUNG of Iowa). All time for general debate has expired. Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment under the 5 minute rule. It shall be in order to consider as an original bill for the purpose of amendment under the 5minute rule an amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 115–21. That amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be considered as read. The text of the amendment in the nature of a substitute is as follows: 
H.R. 953 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembed, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act of 2017’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. No amendment to that amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be in order except those printed in House Report 115–145. Each such amendment may be offered only in the order printed in the report, by a Member designated in the report, shall be considered read, shall be debatable for the time specified in the report, equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent, shall not be subject to amendment, and shall not be subject to a demand for division of the question. 
AMENDMENT NO . 1 OFFERED BY MS . ESTY OF  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 printed in House Report 115–145. Ms. ESTY of Connecticut. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
and apply for permits after the fact. The postpesticide application process is simple, and it works. The bottom line is that limiting the amount of pesticides that are sprayed into our lakes, rivers, and streams, into our drinking water supplies, is common sense. In my home State of Connecticut, pesticide contamination in residential drinking water has been a Statewide problem for a long time. Some of my constituents have gone for years living with stomach pain, hair loss, body numbness, skin rashes, not knowing the cause of their ailments. Test results have revealed pesticides were the cause. That is why I stand here today to offer an amendment that would ensure that we keep existing clean water protections in place so that we can protect our waters and agricultural lands in the long run. My amendment would retain existing Clean Water Act accountability for the most toxic chemicals and hazardous substances commonly used in pesticides today. Should we would try to find a way to streamline the application process for a pesticide general permit? Of course. But a blanket exemption with complete disregard for clean water, the ecosystem, and public health makes this underlying bill unwarranted and unwise. We must work together in this Congress to protect our waterways, ensure a healthy food and water supply, while also protecting our public health. Mr. Chair, I encourage all of my colleagues to support my amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Ohio is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Chair, a couple of points I would like to make. When my colleague from Connecticut talked about spraying chemicals, pesticides over water, the EPA has full authority, full jurisdiction to restrict those pesticides, how they are used, when they are used, and also who is using them; and they can restrict it to a manner where the applicator has to have specific training. And there is nothing to stop the EPA to say that if you are going to spray over a body of water, you have to notify the EPA. The EPA has that authority. They have the jurisdiction to do that. I think it is also interesting to mention when talking about spraying and getting a permit after the fact, yeah, that if the local entity declares an emergency, then they can go in. But my argument is that since this additional permitting requirement, this additional red tape bureaucracy is stopping the preventive programs, so we shouldn’t have to get to an emergency situation where we just spray and do the permit after the fact. But her amendment, H.R. 953 eliminates the duplicative, expansive, and unnecessary permit process, and helps free up resources for States, counties, and local governments to better combat the spread of diseases like Zika and West Nile virus. This amendment, in effect, undermines these efforts. The amendment intends to make the bill’s exemption from the Clean Water Act permitting ineffective by carving out from the bill those waters that may receive a discharge containing any one of several hundred listed chemical substances. The vast majority of substances referenced in this amendment are not even a pesticide and have nothing to do with the regulation of a pesticide. Additionally, a discharge covered under this amendment does not have to be related in any way to the use or application of a pesticide. The net effect of this amendment is to undermine the bill based on circumstances that have nothing whatsoever to do with the use of a pesticide. Further, the amendment would require a pesticide user to conduct extremely expensive and timeconsuming monitoring. This defeats the bill’s purpose of reducing the regulatory burdens. I urge Members to oppose this amendment. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. ESTY of Connecticut. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much time I have remaining? The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman has 1 minute remaining. Ms. ESTY of Connecticut. Mr. Chair, I yield the balance of my time to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. NAPOLITANO ), the subcommittee ranking member. Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. ESTY). The amendment would help ensure the protection of public health from discharges of toxic chemicals such as benzene, chlordane, and vinyl chloride. In my view, the protection of our families and children from seemingly limitless exposure to toxic chemicals in our air and our water and our neighborhoods should be paramount, yet here we are today considering legislation to waive the simple requirement that a chemical pesticide sprayer fill out an application providing notice of where he intends to spray known toxic chemicals, such as the ones I mentioned, all known to have toxic effects on humans. The amendment under consideration says that we should, at a minimum, disclose and monitor the dangerous chemicals for potential toxic effects. These are chemicals that Congress has already designated as ‘‘toxic,’’ ‘‘hazardous substances,’’ or ‘‘extreme hazardous substances’’ in Federal statute. As Congress, we should want to make sure that these dangerous chemicals do not wind up in our rivers and streams, potentially contaminating our local drinking water sources and leading to greater toxic exposure by our families and children. b1600 The level of protection is worth 10 minutes of time by a commercial pesticide applicator. Mr. Chair, I approve Ms. ESTY’s amendment. Ms. ESTY of Connecticut. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Chair, I just urge the Members to oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. ESTY). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Ms. ESTY of Connecticut. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Connecticut will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO . 2 OFFERED BY MR . HUFFMAN  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 printed in House Report 115–145. Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Nothing in this Act, or the amendments made by this Act, shall prevent the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency or a State from requiring a permit under section 402 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act for any discharge (as defined in such Act) that would have a negative effect on commercial, recreational, or subsistence fisheries, or on fisheries protected by Tribal treaty rights, as determined by the Administrator or the State, as applicable, based on the best available science. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 348, the gentleman from California (Mr. HUFFMAN ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chair, I appreciate the opportunity to offer this amendment and to speak against the underlying bill. Unfortunately, I wasn’t serving the House in 2011 when this bill was first brought to the floor. I was here in 2014, when the bill was brought up again, twice. I was here, also, in 2016, when it was brought up twice. This bill has gone through a number of name changes, but its intent remains the same, and that is, to allow the irresponsible application of pesticides into our Nation’s waterways. Undermining the Clean Water Act, as this bill does, means taking the EPA out of the picture, blocking them from weighing in on pesticides that are 
dumped into rivers, lakes, and streams, without regard to the impacts of human health, or to those who rely on recreational, commercial, and Tribal fisheries. We know, unfortunately, that despite efforts to regulate pesticides for public health and safety, these dangerous chemicals continue to be detected in surface and groundwater bodies at dangerous levels. Impacts to fish and wildlife have been significant, and have already been devastating in some instances. Oysters, shrimp, sea trout, and redfish—four of the most important species to food webs, fishermen, and the economy along the Southeast and Gulf Coasts—have shown effects ranging from impaired survival skills, to damaged DNA, to death as a result of exposure to pesticides that have been approved for agricultural use. In 2006, USGS released its review on pesticide occurrence and concentrations in streams and groundwater. According to this report, at least one pesticide was detected in water from all streams tested throughout the Nation. In addition, chemicals such as DDT, which has been banned in the U.S. for decades, were still showing up, found in fish tissues sampled across watersheds nationwide. We see a similar situation at the State level. In my State of California, pesticides are among the top sources of water quality impairments in the State. 437 waterbodies are impaired by 40 different categories of pesticides. That is why commercial fishing groups oppose the underlying bill. My amendment will ensure that we don’t deny either the EPA or a State their ability to require permits for pesticide use that could have negative effects on fisheries. Let’s make sure that streams and rivers that support fish are clean. Let’s make sure that the fish we catch, eat, and sell are free from toxic chemicals. America’s fisheries are a backbone of both sport fishing and commercial fishing industries. The recreational sector alone accounts for more than $115 billion of our country’s economy, and it employs more than 828,000 people. My amendment would protect these recreational activities, not only for current generations but for future generations of anglers to come. By accidentally contaminating our waterways, pesticides also exacerbate the precarious status of endangered and threatened species. In 1996, the death of over 90,000 steelhead fish, 100 coho salmon, and thousands of nongame fish resulted from an herbicide called acrolein that entered the waterways in Bear Creek, Oregon. Many wild salmon stocks are now on the brink of extinction on the West Coast, and losses in such sensitive populations make recovery efforts increasingly difficult. Pesticides can pose a dangerous threat to commercial fisheries. In 1999, a massive lobster dieoff devastated the lives and livelihoods of Connecticut and New York lobstermen along the Long Island Sound, producing a multimilliondollar settlement with pesticide manufacturers mishandling the chemical malathion. Similar concern has brought forth proposals to regulate methoprene and resmethrin in Maine in order to protect their commercial fishery, which is worth over $700 million. Mr. Chair, I have letters of support here for my amendment from the American Sportfishing Association, Trout Unlimited, the Columbia River InterTribal Fish Commission, the Karuk Tribe, the Winnemem Wintu Tribe, the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen’s Associations, Seafood Harvesters of America, and other organizations who are very interested in this amendment, and support it. 
MAY24, 2017. DEARREPRESENTATIVE : As the House considers H.R. 953, the Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act of 2017, we the undersigned groups representing millions of hunters and anglers across the nation, urge you to ensure that H.R. 953 does not negatively impact water quality, fish health and the recreational fishing industry by supporting Amendment #3, sponsored by Representative Jared Huffman. The Huffman Amendment protects fisheries and water quality by ensuring any pesticide spraying into or over waterways that would negatively impact our nation’s fisheries is properly monitored and permitted. The 47 million sportsmen and women that hunt and fish each year depend on strong Clean Water Act protections to ensure thriving fish populations that are safe to eat and the Huffman amendment would ensure it continues to do so. America’s hunters and anglers contribute more than $200 billion to America’s economy each year and this robust outdoor economy depends on healthy rivers, lakes, and streams. Nearly 2,000 waterways in the United States are known to be impaired because of pesticides, and, even at low levels, pesticides pose a particularly concerning threat to fish and wildlife populations. Without protective federal safeguards in place to regulate pesticides applied to our waterways, sportsmen and women will have access to fewer quality hunting and fishing opportunities. On behalf of our millions of members and conservationminded hunters, anglers, and wildlife enthusiasts, we urge you to support this commonsense measure to safeguard our water resources and outdoor heritage and support the Huffman amendment. Sincerely, BENJAMIN BULIS, AFFTA President, American Fly Fishing Trade Association. JOHNW. G ALE, Conservation Director, Backcountry Hunters & Anglers. ADAMKOLTON , Vice President, National Advocacy, National Wildlife Federation. STEVE MOYER , Vice President, Government Affairs, Trout Unlimited. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , MAY23, 2017. Washington, DC. DEARREPRESENTATIVE : On behalf of thousands of tribal, commercial, and recreational fishermen who depend on healthy fisheries for their subsistence, traditional cultural practices, businesses, and recreational enjoyment, we write to urge you to vote YES on the Huffman amendment to H.R. 953. The amendment would ensure that existing Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA) permitting requirements for point source polluters remain in place when science clearly indicates they are needed to protect fisheries. Under §402 of the FWPCA, the Administrator of the EPA may issue permits for point source discharges of approved pesticides, herbicides, and fungicides into navigable waters, which are also inhabited by many important and valuable fish species that are worth billions of dollars to fishermen and anglers each year. H.R. 953 would eliminate the EPA’s permitting authority for approved pesticides, herbicides, and fungicides discharged into navigable waters. Many of these chemicals, despite their approval for agricultural use, are known to be seriously harmful to iconic fish species including salmon and trout, jeopardizing their survival and posing a risk to the food supply. Congressman Huffman’s amendment to H.R. 953 would simply leave EPA permitting requirements in place for the dumping of pesticides, herbicides, and fungicides into our streams and rivers when they are known to pose a significant risk to fisheries. We ask that you support this amendment in order to keep America’s fisheries and strong fishing traditions alive, safe, and prosperous. If you have any questions, please call Noah Oppenheim, Executive Director of the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen’s Associations. Sincerely, Noah Oppenheim, Executive Director, Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen’s Associations; Leaf Hillman, Director, Department of Natural Resources, Karuk Tribe; Caleen Sisk, Chief, Winnemem Wintu Tribe; Robert Vandermark, Executive Director, Marine Fish Conservation Network; Kevin Wheeler, Executive Director, Seafood Harvesters of America; Roger Thomas, President, Golden Gate Salmon Association; Bob Rees, Executive Director, Association of Northwest Steelheaders; Linda Behnken, Executive Director, Alaska Longline Fishermen’s Association; Grant Putnam, President, Northwest Guides and Anglers Association; Benjamin Bulis, President, American Fly Fishing Trade Association; Lyf Gildersleeve, Owner, Flying Fish Company; Kevin Scribner, Chief Executive Officer, Forever Wild Seafood; Cynthia Sarthou, Executive Director, Gulf Restoration Network. 
COLUMBIA RIVER INTER TRIBAL  FISHCOMMISSION , Portland, OR, May 23, 2017. Hon. PAULRYAN, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. NANCY PELOSI , Democratic Leader of the House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR SPEAKER RYAN AND DEMOCRATIC  LEADER PELOSI : On behalf of the Columbia River InterTribal Fish Commission (CRITFC) and our member tribes—the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, the Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation of Oregon, the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, and the Nez Perce Tribe, I 
would like to share our support for the amendment offered by Mr. Huffman to H.R. 953—Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act of 2017. The amendment specifically preserves the ability of the EPA Administrator or a State to require permits necessary to protect fisheries including Tribal treaty fisheries from harmful discharges of FIFRA approved pesticides. Tribal members are justifiably concerned about the impact of water quality on the natural resources of the Columbia River system. Our member tribes’ right to abundant, healthful fish is guaranteed by the 1855 treaties with the United States. A century’s worth of federal court decisions has established beyond dispute that these treaty fishing rights are permanent in nature, and that they secure for the tribes the right to take all species of fish found throughout their reserved fishing areas for subsistence, ceremonial and commercial purposes. Tribal treaties are the supreme law of the land, and federal agencies and States must interpret designated uses to include subsistence fishing and must protect fishable waters. Pesticides can wreak havoc on the health of the habitat and associated food webs that support our fisheries. They can disrupt water quality conditions and the availability of natural riparian and aquatic vegetation cover as well as the abundance of aquatic invertebrates and fishes that support the growth and maturation of salmonid species. Our tribes recognize that the health and future of our tribal fisheries require clean, cold water that is free of contaminants. Regulations should be efficient, just, and effective, and necessarily must provide the EPA and States with the authority to protect the unique habitat and food web system that is essential to the health of our tribal fisheries. Thank you for your consideration of these comments. If you have any further questions please contact me or Dianne Barton, PhD. Sincerely, JAIME A. P INKHAM , CRITFC Executive Director. 
AMERICAN SPORTFISHING  ASSOCIATION , Alexandria, VA, May 23, 2017. Hon. JARED HUFFMAN , Washington, DC. DEARCONGRESSMAN HUFFMAN : On behalf of the nation’s recreational fishing industry, the American Sportfishing Association (ASA) would like to be on record as supporting your amendment to H.R. 953. This amendment leaves EPA permitting requirements in place for the dumping of pesticides, herbicides, and fungicides into our streams and rivers when they are known to pose a significant risk to fisheries. America’s fisheries are an economic powerhouse and the backbone of the sportfishing and commercial fishing industries. America’s recreational anglers generate more than $48 billion in retail sales with a $115 billion impact on the nation’s economy; creating employment for more than 828,000 people. Our industry depends on clean water for continued healthy and abundant fisheries. There are certain chemicals used for various onland industry operations that are known to be incredibly harmful to fish development and survival when released into waterways. The Administrator of the EPA currently enforces permitting requirements for the disposal of these chemicals into our streams and rivers. Your amendment would ensure that existing Federal Water Pollution Control Act permitting requirements for point source polluters (§402) remain in place when science indicates they are needed to conserve fisheries. ‘‘The Huffman amendment’’ is needed because the original legislation, H.R. 953, would eliminate this permitting authority for all approved pesticides, herbicides, and fungicides discharged into streams and rivers; even when they are known to pose a significant risk to fisheries. We appreciate your leadership and understanding of the importance of clean water to fishing and the outdoor recreational economy. Sincerely, SCOTT GUDES , Vice President of Government Affairs. 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I prefer butter on my lobster rolls, not toxic pesticides. Let’s make sure that States maintain their authority to prudently protect their economies and public health from pesticide impacts. I urge an ‘‘aye’’ vote on this amendment. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Ohio is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Chair, well, that was a lot of drama. Let’s not lose sight that what we are trying to do in H.R. 953 is to free up the resources so States, counties, local governments can fight the mosquito population, fight Zika, fight the West Nile virus, and let our agricultural producers have the most efficient way to protect the environment, and also produce a safe, wholesome food supply. This amendment undermines the base bill. The amendment intends to carve out from the bill those waters that have a discharge of any type. That means the way this amendment is written, any type of discharge—even if it is not a pesticide—any type of discharge, a nutrient discharge, anything would fall under this and undermines the bill. This amendment covers all types of discharges. I think that is important to mention. In addition, most waterbodies in this country are fishable, and, therefore, subject to this amendment’s carveout. As a result, the types of discharges and waterbodies in question under this amendment do not need to be related at all to the actual regulation of a pesticide. Further, the amendment would require that a pesticide user conduct extremely expensive and timeconsuming monitoring. Moreover, the amendment’s standard of any negative effect is vague and subjective and could include an effect that has nothing to do with a pesticide. Registered pesticides already take into account aquatic species’ and fisheries’ health into consideration during the registration process. I think it is important that they go through a rigorous testing process, and more testing, and the EPA has full control. They can reject that. If they determine that a pesticide is environmentally harmful, or potentially harmful, they can pull that product off. They can also restrict the product even more so, and restrict who the applicators are, and there is nothing to stop the EPA or the State EPAs to say: Before you apply a pesticide over a waterbody, you need to tell us first before you do it. There is nothing to stop the EPA from doing that. So all this amendment does, it defeats the bill’s purpose, reducing the regulatory burdens, and I urge my Members to oppose this amendment. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chair, I just want to point out that some States may want to put their efforts into protecting water quality and the health of their fisheries and their ecosystems, rather than just carpetbombing waterways with pesticides. This amendment says, those States have the authority to do that if they choose to. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. NAPOLITANO ), the ranking member of the subcommittee. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California has 15 seconds remaining. Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chair, I yield 15 seconds to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. NAPOLITANO ). Mrs. NAPOLITANO. I totally support the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. HUFFMAN ). If this amendment is adopted, it would maintain the existing Clean Water Act general permit requirements to protect commercial, recreational, and subsistence fisheries, and Tribal treaty obligations. I support the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman from California has expired. Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Chair, I will just say that the comment about this amendment would allow States to do it, I don’t think there is anything to stop the States from doing it now. If States want to do more to protect water quality in their States, I think they have the right to do that. Under the Clean Water Act, what it says is: The States will implement and enforce the Clean Water Act under the guidance of the Federal Government, but they have to be, at the least, a standard of the Federal Government. They can exceed that standard if they want, so I don’t think there is anything stopping that. I urge my colleagues to defeat this amendment and support the underlying bill. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. HUFFMAN ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California will be postponed. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, proceedings will now resume on those amendments printed in House Report 115–145 on which further proceedings were postponed, in the following order: Amendment No. 1 by Ms. ESTY of Connecticut. Amendment No. 2 by Mr. HUFFMAN of California. The Chair will reduce to 2 minutes the minimum time for any electronic vote after the first vote in this series.

Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Chairman, as the cochair of the bipartisan Congressional Soccer Caucus, along with my cochairs, Representative DON BACON , D ARIN LAHOOD, and E RIC SWALWELL , I am pleased to inform the House that last night a group of bipartisan Members came together to play in the fifth annual Capital Soccer Classic, a charity benefit for the U.S. Soccer Foundation and children in underserved areas across the country. The U.S. Soccer Foundation transforms abandoned fields and vacant lots into stateoftheart soccer fields to create safe places where kids can play. The U.S. Soccer Foundation also partners with our local communities back home for free afterschool programs to help kids establish healthy habits: put the cellphones aside, turn off the TV, get outside, and learn good sportsmanship. The Republican team was very tough: Congressmen DON BACON , D ARIN LAHOOD, GUSBILIRAKIS , STEVE KNIGHT , ERIK PAULSEN , and D AVID VALADAO , who scored for the Republican team. We had a number of outstanding congressional staff and former professional soccer stars as well, but they were not enough for the Democratic team. The Democratic team notched a 5–3 victory to deliver this trophy for America’s blue team. Great fun was had by all. We would like to invite you to join us next year because the real winners are the kids across the country and the opportunity to be healthy and well. Mr. BACON. Will the gentlewoman yield? Ms. CASTOR of Florida. I yield to the gentleman from Nebraska. Mr. BACON. Mr. Chairman, it was an honor to be able to have a bipartisan game out there and have a good time. Soccer keeps children in shape. Thousands and thousands of our kids get to play this every year. We also stay in shape. It also teaches them teamwork and how to follow the rules, and they become better citizens. I had to do an ibuprofen this morning. Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman.

b1645 Mr. O’HALLERAN changed his vote from ‘‘no’’ to ‘‘aye.’’ So the amendment was rejected. The result of the vote was announced as above recorded. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment in the nature of a substitute. The amendment was agreed to. The Acting CHAIR. Under the rule, the Committee rises. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. HULTGREN ) having assumed the chair, Mr. YOUNG of Iowa, Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 953) to amend the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to clarify Congressional intent regarding the regulation of the use of pesticides in or near navigable waters, and for other purposes, and, pursuant to House Resolution 348, he reported the bill back to the House with an amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is ordered. The question is on the amendment in the nature of a substitute. The amendment was agreed to. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. 
Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill? Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I am opposed to the bill in its current form. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to recommit. The Clerk read as follows: 
Mr. McGovern moves to recommit the bill H.R. 953 to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure with instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith with the following amendment: At the end, add the following: 
This Act, including the amendments made by this Act, shall not apply to the discharge of a pesticide if the manufacturer or distributor of the pesticide has made a political contribution to the President or to any Federal official charged with registration, regulation, or approval of the use of the pesticide. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Massachusetts is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended. Mr. Speaker, I regret to say the Republicans are again bending over backwards to help corporations and the wealthiest among us while ignoring science and leaving hardworking American families to suffer the consequences. This administration’s decisions have placed special interests and their financial contributions ahead of 
the health and the safety of our citizens, and this Republicanled House has been complicit. Earlier this year, a toxic chemical manufacturer convinced the Trump administration to discard decades of scientific research just so they could continue to profit off of chlorpyrifos, a pesticide that has been proven to be harmful to human beings, especially infants and children. The pesticide was well on its way to being banned by the EPA, which said, in 2015, that it could not be declared safe for human health and for the environment; but the pesticide manufacturer wrote a check for $1 million to President Trump’s inaugural committee, and just weeks later, the proposed ban on the pesticide was magically reversed. It is amazing how that worked out. What I am wondering is: Did President Trump and the Republicans in Congress think we wouldn’t notice? Did they think the American people would be okay with them knowingly allowing a dangerous pesticide to be used on farms and affect our food supply? Republicans should be ashamed of this blatant disregard for the health of the families they were elected to represent. In 2000, the EPA banned most home uses of the chemical, citing risks to children, yet it continues to be used in agriculture production across this country. Does this really sound like something that should be used on the food we feed our kids? On the campaign trail into the White House, President Trump has made clear that he will always side with deeppocketed polluters and corporations over the health and safety of families. In January 2017, Dow Chemical was reported to have contributed $1 million to President Trump’s inaugural committee. The CEO of Dow Chemical was a frequent guest of Presidentelect Trump, including at an appearance at a postelection rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan. In March 2017, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt signed an order reversing the ban on the pesticide. Also in March 2017, Scott Pruitt signed an order reversing the ban on this pesticide suggesting, in a statement, that ‘‘by reversing the previous administration’s step to ban one of the most widely used pesticides in the world, we are returning to using sound science and decisionmaking rather than predetermined results.’’ Public health advocacy groups strongly disagreed, not to mention conservation organizations. Mr. Speaker, you know what? I think I trust public health experts when it comes to protecting our families over Administrator Pruitt, who sued the EPA at least 14 times as Oklahoma’s attorney general opposing important protections for our air and our water. Talk about the fox guarding the henhouse. Mr. Speaker, we were not sent here to auction off the health and safety of millions of Americans to the highest bidder. Every day the Trump administration gets more brazen with their giveaways to special interests, raising serious questions about corruption and conflicts of interest. Donald Trump promised to drain the swamp. He has created a cesspool. We are talking about people’s lives here, Mr. Speaker. This pesticide has been shown to harm women, children, and families. It has no place on our farms or in our food system. Our health should not be for sale. It isn’t hard to connect the dots here. The EPA abruptly reversed its efforts to ban a toxic chemical just weeks after the chemical’s manufacturer made a political contribution to the newly elected President. And we know their decision wasn’t based on science. The former head of the EPA’s Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention suggested that the Trump EPA is ‘‘ignoring the science that is pretty solid’’ and putting farmworkers and exposed children at unnecessary risk. Now, I can see how people might start to wonder whether this administration is on the side of special interests or the American people. This amendment fights back against the corrupting influence of political contributions from pesticide companies. It would ensure that existing science based protections for our families and our environment cannot be overturned by a welltimed contribution to President Trump or to those in his administration charged with implementing the law. The American people deserve to know that their leaders will stand up to protect their health and their safety rather than protecting the bottom line of wealthy special interests. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to do the right thing and adopt this amendment and show the American people that our government is not for sale. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Ohio is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, this motion to recommit is unnecessary and aims to undermine the purpose of the bill. The underlying bill, H.R. 953, eliminates the duplicative, expensive, and unnecessary permit process that helps free up the resources for our States, counties, and local governments to better combat the Zika, West Nile virus, and other diseases; but this motion, in effect, aims to undermine the bill. In this motion, the bill says it will not apply to anybody who makes a discharge of a pesticide if they made a political contribution to the President or to any Federal official charged with registration, regulation, or approval of the use of a pesticide. That is utterly absurd. You can’t make political contributions to regulators at the EPA. Let’s keep in mind that the EPA has full authority to regulate these pesticides, pull pesticides off the market, and regulate who applies them, and they have full authority to protect our water and our human health. This amendment simply aims to gut the bill. It is unclear how it ever would work. We need to stop creating unnecessary roadblocks to the use of products that stand to protect public health and feed the Nation. H.R. 953 is a good bill that will help protect public health and the environment and stop mosquitoes from spreading Zika and the West Nile virus and other diseases to our vulnerable populations. Mr. Speaker, I strongly oppose this motion and urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’ Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to recommit. There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it. 
Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote. A recorded vote was ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XX, this 5 minute vote on the motion to recommit will be followed by a 5minute vote on passage of the bill, if ordered.

OUR VETERANS ARE REAL HEROES (Mr. BISHOP of Michigan asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank our brave servicemen and women who have put their lives on the line every day to protect us. Since the founding of our Nation, millions of Americans have proudly served and sacrificed in preservation of our democracy. Our veterans have paid a tremendous price to defend our freedom, yet leaving the battlefield does not always mean their battles are over. It is, therefore, our duty as a nation to ensure that our servicemembers are properly and respectfully cared for when they return home. Our veterans are reallife heroes living quietly among us. They are the patriots who were willing to give up everything—everything they had—for their God, their country, and for one another. The Holy Scripture tells us, in John 15:13: ‘‘Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.’’ This weekend, let’s call to mind all those who have made the ultimate sacrifice. It is because of their valor, strength, and bravery that I stand here before you today. They selflessly put their lives on the line to fight for us, and I am proud to continue fighting for them. Our men and women of the military represent the very best of America. On behalf of Michigan’s Eighth Congressional District, we are eternally grateful for their service. Happy and safe Memorial Day weekend. b1715 PRESIDENT TRUMP’S BUDGET (Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, it has been said that a budget is more than a series of statements or line items. It is really a statement of your values and of your priorities. If that is true, then Donald Trump’s antiworking families budget shows he doesn’t understand the challenges facing honest, hardworking Americans. Let’s be clear: the Trump budget was written by some of the wealthiest Americans for the benefit of the wealthiest Americans. This budget is a major setback for the middle class, and it makes life even harder for anyone who is trying to punch a ticket to the middle class. This budget eliminates hundreds of millions of dollars for job creation, it zeros out funding for workforce training and goodpaying manufacturing jobs, and it makes it even harder for young people to succeed by cutting teacher training, eliminating afterschool programs, and making it harder to pay off student loans. The American people deserve better. This is not a budget that any Member of Congress should be comfortable supporting. Democrats are speaking out today against the Trump budget. It is time Republicans do the same. 
RECOGNIZING PASTOR TIM BURT’S RETIREMENT (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Pastor Tim Burt on his retirement. Pastor Burt has a long record of service to his community. He founded American Infant Care Products, which came up with the fold down infant changing tables found in many restrooms today, helping families of all sorts by providing a convenient way to care for their children. But he also has now served as associate pastor at Living Word Christian Center in Brooklyn Park since 1989, establishing a small group ministry. In this capacity, Pastor Burt oversaw visitor and public relations, pastoral care, and leadership and volunteer departments. His dedication to our community has certainly inspired many Minnesotans over the years. Pastor Burt also served as the Minnesota State director for Christians United for Israel, where he developed a statewide network of leaders passionate about Israel, and has led a trip of fellow pastors to that country. Mr. Speaker, as we recognize Pastor Tim Burt’s retirement, we are extremely grateful and proud of the work he has done. I wish he and Renee the very best in their future endeavors. 
HOUR OF MEETING ON TOMORROW Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House adjourn today, it adjourn to meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. MITCHELL ). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Maine? There was no objection. 
NATIONAL DRUG COURT MONTH (Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, today I stand to support the lifesaving work of drug courts and veterans treatment courts during this National Drug Court Month, and to honor a constituent of mine with an incredible success story. These courts are an indispensable resource to law enforcement and other community stakeholders impacted by the opioid epidemic, claiming the lives of 91 Americans each and every day. Timothy Wynn is a veterans treatment court graduate from my district, whom I had the honor of meeting today. When the decorated marine returned home from Iraq in 2003, he turned to alcohol and other substances to ease his transition back into society. His substance use escalated. He found himself arrested seven times, and spent a year of his life in prison away from his young family. After his final arrest, Tim found the Philadelphia Veterans Treatment Court, where he was given the accountability he needed while also connecting him to the services he had earned. Today, Tim is reunited with his family and continues his mission as the mentor coordinator for the court where he once stood as a participant. There are drug court and veterans treatment court graduates just like Tim across the Nation. I call on my colleagues to support these graduates and the good work of drug courts and veterans treatment courts. 
ABILITYONE PROGRAM (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the AbilityOne Program and its countless contributions to our communities and to people with disabilities. Through this important program, communitybased nonprofit agencies across the Nation have employed more than 45,000 people who are blind or differently abled. The AbilityOne Program harnesses the purchasing power of the Federal Government to buy products from these agencies, which have made it their mission to employ and train the blind and disabled. Established in 1983, the program continues to empower those with disabilities by providing gainful employment to a segment of our population who typically experience one of the highest rates of unemployment in the Nation. These critically important employment opportunities have led to increased independence and enhanced quality of life for scores of disabled Americans. Recently, I had the opportunity to tour an AbilityOne participant in the 22nd District of New York: Human Technologies Corporation located in Utica. This facility employs nearly 600 people on an annual basis. As a critical part of our community, I am honored to serve this AbilityOne agency and their team of dedicated employees, who continue to make a significant economic impact on our region through the creation of quality products and services to government agencies across all sectors. f 
REMEMBERING RICHARD COLLINS (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, over the weekend, a young man in my district was killed in what appears to be a vicious crime, probably motivated by hate. U.S. Army Second Lieutenant Richard W. Collins, III, was just days away from graduating from Bowie State University. Richard stood on the threshold of what promised to be a life of service to his country. He has been remembered by family and friends as a kind soul, an angel, and a national treasure. All of us across Maryland were shocked and devastated when we learned of the attack that took his life—an unprovoked attack at a bus station waiting for an Uber to pick him up. An individual came along and asked him to step left—whatever that meant. He said: ‘‘No, I won’t.’’ And he was stabbed in the chest. We were deeply alarmed to learn that the suspect in Richard’s murder belonged to an alleged online White supremacist group. Richard was African American. Richard’s murderer must be held to account under the full weight of our laws, and, hopefully, he will be. His life is a reminder of everything that makes our Nation extraordinary. His death is a painful reminder that our work in overcoming hatred in this country is far from over. I have been keeping Richard’s parents and family in my thoughts and in my prayers this week, and I will continue to do so. Mr. Speaker, I rise with a very heavy heart to mourn the loss of a young man in my district who was killed over the weekend in a possible hatecrime. U.S. Army Second Lieutenant Richard W. Collins III was just days away from graduating from Bowie State University College of Business when he was stabbed by an assailant while waiting at a bus stop in College Park on the campus of the University of Maryland. He was there to visit friends and celebrate his having been commissioned as an officer in the Army just two days earlier. At age twentythree, Richard stood on the threshold of what promised to be an exciting life of service to his country, and the Army was fortunate to have such a driven and talented young person so eager to be a part of defending our nation. Richard represented the best of the Fifth District, the best of Maryland, and the best of America. All of us across the region were shocked and devastated when we learned of the attack that took his life. We were deeply dismayed as well to learn that the suspect in Richard’s murder belonged to an alleged online white supremacist group with references in its name to Nazism and to the socalled ‘AltRight’ movement that espouses xenophobia and racial hatred. The FBI is now investigating, and Richard’s murderer must be held to account under the full weight of our laws. In viewing this tragedy, it is easy to get caught up in the details of who perpetrated the crime and why. But the real story I wish to share with my colleagues is Richard’s story. The story of a young man who was so proud to put on his Army uniform and had diligently drilled as a member of the ROTC in college. He has been remembered by family and friends as a ‘kind soul,’ an ‘angel,’ and ‘a national treasure.’ The loss of this outstanding young Marylander and young American diminishes us all. I have been keeping Richard’s parents and extended family in my thoughts and in my prayers these past few days, and I will surely continue to be inspired by his memory for a long time to come. His life is a reminder of everything that makes our nation extraordinary His death is a painful reminder that the work of banishing hatred from our midst is far from over and will require each and every one of us to share in the task. May God bless the memory of Second Lieutenant Richard W Collins III and watch over his family and his community in this hour of their grief. 
PROMOTING FREEDOM, ANTICORRUPTION, THE RULE OF LAW, AND AN INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY SYSTEM IN NICARAGUA (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, today, the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee passed a bill that I authored, the Nicaraguan Investment and Conditionality Act, the NICA Act. I thank Chairman DUNCAN and Ranking Member SIRES for working with me to pass this important bipartisan measure that seeks to promote freedom, anticorruption, the rule of law, and supports an independent judiciary system in Nicaragua. This measure sends a strong message of support to the people of Nicaragua that they are not alone. We in the United States Congress recognize their plight and aspirations for a better future of freedom and opportunity. We share their values of a free and fair electoral system, of justice and liberty 
for all Nicaraguans, and we support their pursuit of a more open and democratic society. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP’S BUDGET (Mr. PANETTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my concern about the President’s budget, and, in particular, the $610 billion in proposed cuts to Medicaid over the next 10 years. In my district on the central coast of California, Medicaid provides healthcare to over 280,000 people. These are people that need it the most, including lowincome families, children, disabled, and pregnant women. Clinics and hospitals, particularly in rural communities like my district, rely on Medicaid to provide patients with mandatory and preventative services. Employees from the number one industry in my area—agriculture—rely on those health clinics so that they can stay healthy and ultimately contribute to our economy and our culture. If Medicaid is cut, as desired in the President’s budget, it will hurt not just my community, it will hurt our country. Throughout our Nation, millions would lose healthcare, healthcare clinics would close, and many insurance companies who partner with Medicaid would see cuts in their reimbursement rates substantially. I realize that many of us in Washington have not been on Medicaid, but many of us need to realize that Medicaid benefits many of the Americans that sent us here. The least we can do is support them and their families by fighting against the President’s budget and fighting to keep funding for Medicaid. 
MARCH DEFICIT AND BALANCING TRADE (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, President Trump recently told The Economist that he is ‘‘absolutely a freetrader.’’ Ohioans would be the first to tell you that free trade and fair trade do not mean the same thing. Our trade deficit ballooned to $43.7 billion in March of this year—more red ink and more lost jobs. That skewed gap is even more pronounced with NAFTA nations, where we have a huge negative imbalance, totaling over $16 billion with Mexico and nearly $7 billion with Canada. That yields over 115,000 more forfeited jobs in our country. Yes, trade deficits translate into lost jobs and lower wages for our workers like steelworkers that have been battered in Lorain, Ohio. We must stop these trade practices that snuff out our jobs and hurt our communities. That is why tomorrow I will be reintroducing the Balancing Trade Act. This bill requires an actual U.S. policy that takes the trade deficit seriously. It provides real achievable steps to balance our trade deficits with countries with which we hold a deficit of over $10 billion for three consecutive years. I urge President Trump to support this measure as a reasonable step forward. Let us help heal heartland communities, many of which elected him. Let us seek trade solutions that lift up our people and create new jobs on all sides of North America’s borders, but starting here in the good old USA. f 
PRESIDENT TRUMP’S BUDGET The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to be here this evening, and I am delighted to be hosting the Progressive Caucus Special Order hour. We have a number of Members who are going to join us to discuss the President’s budget proposal, which appears to have been written at Trump Tower, primarily for the benefit of people spending the weekend at the Mara Lago Club in Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. POCAN ), to kick off our analysis of the Trump budget. b1730 Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate this opportunity. I would like to thank the gentleman from Maryland. The Progressive Caucus has its own version of a budget which we have discussed on the floor of Congress previously that we will be glad to put exactly next to the budget that has been produced by this President, because our budget takes a completely different course than the budget that has been put forth by the Trump administration. We can tell you, now that we have seen the budget from the Republicans, it hits every fear that we thought was going to be in it. There are very few winners, and there are an awful lot of losers in the budget, and that is what we are going to try to show today, just who some of the winners are and who some of the losers are, just to give you a visual display of exactly what is in this Trump budget. So what people need to know is that this is a budget that is not for the average person across the country. In fact, the average person will be hurt in multiple ways by the cuts that are in this budget. There are very few in this country who are going to applaud this, but it is very few because this is a budget that only benefits a very few. And we, in the Progressive Caucus, are going to do everything we can to fight this, tooth and nail, to make sure this doesn’t become law. Let me just show a few of the winners that we have on this. One of the winners are the wealthiest Americans. This is going to reduce trillions of dollars in taxes that are primarily paid by the wealthy. So clearly, the wealthy are going to do well. Another group that does well is Wall Street and Big corporations. This budget slashes regulations for Big banks that caused the great recession, and it defunds the agency that is charged with protecting consumers. Another beneficiary is defense contractors—a $54 billion boost in defense spending at the expense of nearly every other program. That will increase money that will purchase unnecessary new weapons. The border wall. This is going to put down a $1.6 billion downpayment to build a wall across the Mexican border, something that truly is not necessary and not asked for. And finally, the last beneficiary is polluters. This is going to roll back environmental regulations that protect our air and water. So those are the winners on the Trump budget. But if you look on the other side of the equation, there are a whole lot more losers. Let’s start right up here with our friend, Big Bird. PBS funding. The Trump budget would cut funding for children’s shows like Sesame Street. Social Security. The Trump budget will get rid of the insurance to help people with disabilities. Meals on Wheels. You know, I have had the great fortune of doing Meals on Wheels delivery in Madison, Wisconsin, which is in my district. And not only is it often the only meal, the healthy meal that that person is getting delivered who often can’t leave their homes, but it is also that daily checkin to make sure that person is all right. I just met with someone who works with Meals on Wheels, and they said that there is not a week that goes by that they don’t find someone who has fallen in their home and needed that person to come by for help. Well, the Trump budget eliminates funding for programs like Meals on Wheels. The children’s health insurance and Medicaid funding specifically for kids is cut. He cuts dental care for kids, cancer care for kids, access to inhalers, and access to vital medical devices for children. He cuts nursing home care. Families are going to be forced to pay more out ofpocket for nursing home care. The school lunch program. Now, I understand, everyone may not love everything on their tray at lunch, but this is cutting funding for subsidized lunches, causing kids literally to go hungry in this country. It has education cuts to school and literacy programs, to teacher training and classsize reduction. Over 20 programs are going to be cut. Even Special Olympics gets a cut in this budget. Today, we had Secretary DeVos at the Appropriations Subcommittee for 
the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies, and, unfortunately, she couldn’t make a case for any of these cuts, which is truly disappointing, because they are going to add hundreds of millions of dollars to give money to people who have children attending private schools, but we are going to be slashing the very programs that make our public schools so strong. They slash programs for the Department of labor for job training. There is a $6 billionplus cut to the National Institutes of Health that works on lifesaving research for diseases like Alzheimer’s and ALS and diabetes. And it cuts another billion for cancer research, specifically, in this budget. Loan repayment programs. This is going to end the loan repayment programs for police officers, nurses, and teachers who work in a public setting. This has massive cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency that protect our air and water, and it guts general funding that provides that clean air and water programs that are going to affect people across the country. It cuts funding to prevent major outbreaks for diseases like Ebola and Zika by cutting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention program budget. Opioid addiction, something that this Congress has, in a bipartisan way, found ways to find additional funding for; in this proposal by the Trump administration, it leaves families that are dealing with addiction on the hook for the cost of treatment in many cases. Border funding. It is not just that they are building a wall, but this also ramps up funding for deportation task forces which are going to tear families apart in this country; and it adds money to build more detention centers. This budget will allow the government to sell off swaths of public land that is going to open up our national parks and public land to oil and gas development, including fracking operations. And this budget, when it comes to women’s healthcare, will go after protections in funding for women’s healthcare by cutting Planned Parenthood. Finally, for veterans, it makes it harder for veterans and lowincome families of veterans to find housing. That is just some of the losers, but we want to show the difference in the balance of the very few who benefit and the whole lot of people—and there is a whole lot of other areas that are going to be cut by this budget. Now, the contrast really is the Progressive Caucus budget that we put forward that we will have a vote on, on this floor of Congress, where we do a completely different approach. Gone are the winners and losers of this case. And the winners would be a big category, being the American people, and the losers really being those, I think, who have abused the system for all too long. We have a $2 trillion investment in infrastructure that puts money into our roads and bridges, our schools, our waterworks, our broadband, and really makes sure that those are familysupporting jobs that people can get back to work and will create millions of new jobs, according to the Economic Policy Institute. We make sure that we move forward in affordable healthcare by making it so we can negotiate for prescription drug prices and bring those costs down, as well as allow States to get closer to a singlepayer system. We specifically have comprehensive immigration reform that recognizes those who are aspiring Americans, not by building walls and more detention centers but really providing a path to citizenship so that we can find a way to still protect our borders, but also make sure that we have got a path for people who have lived here for so very long. We close corporate tax loopholes and make sure that working families are getting the stronger benefit. We have an investment to make sure that we can have universal child care for all families in this country, not like the proposal that President Trump has put forward that takes care of, quite honestly, President Trump and people like him and the wealthiest in this country, but making sure that every family will never pay more than 10 percent of their income to have child care for their family. And on and on and on is what our contrast is. So as someone who has been very active in the Progressive Caucus, someone who comes from America’s heartland in Wisconsin, we wanted to show the winners and the losers but, more importantly, to show the different path forward the Progressive Caucus is going to put for a vote on the floor of Congress. And I think if you get a chance to compare and contrast these budgets, you can see there is an alternative. We don’t have to slash funding for all sorts of programs just to get $54 billion of new spending for defense. We can actually invest in America, invest in healthcare, invest in our schools, make sure that college is affordable, all the things that we offer in our contrast budget. It is the only budget that is out there right now, so we would love to be able to show that contrast. But we ask people to take a look at this, and then you decide what is best for your family. I think you are going to decide the Progressive Caucus puts a positive path forward that will make your family prosper and won’t just support a very few in this country. I thank the gentleman from Maryland. I appreciate this opportunity to have this time. Mr. RASKIN. Thank you so much, Congressman POCAN from Wisconsin, a distinguished leader in the House of Representatives, and the new cochairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Mr. Speaker, a budget, as we like to say, is not just a bunch of numbers, but it is an ethical document. It is a reflection of our values, and it is a plan of action for investment of our energy and our resources into the future. The Progressive Caucus has drafted The People’s Budget based on the actual needs of American society. So we have looked out, and we have seen that the great American infrastructure is ailing; it is crumbling. The bridges are falling down. The roads and the highways need repair. The transit systems are under tremendous stress, including the Metro system here in the Maryland, Washington, Virginia area. The cybersecurity system is compromised. Our airports, our port structure, our water systems, like in Flint, Michigan, need desperate intervention and rescue and help. We propose a $1 trillion plan of investment in the American infrastructure to create millions of jobs, putting people to work on restoring the strength and the vitality of America’s basic institutions, the infrastructure that supports a strong and flourishing economy. So that is the heart of it. But we are also working to defend the gains we have made in healthcare, to extend healthcare so that all Americans are included in our health insurance system so we can squeeze out the bureaucratic bloat and the money that is wasted on insurance bureaucracy and red tape. We are also working for investment in quality child care so working families are not spending 30 or 40 or 50 percent of their family budgets on trying to just pay for babysitters and piece together a system. America is the wealthiest society on Earth, and this is the wealthiest moment in our history. We can provide healthcare for everyone. We can create a childcare system that works for working families in America. We can reinvest in American infrastructure. But right now, there is no leadership, and there is no vision. We are so disappointed that the White House did not come forward with a plan, a bipartisan plan, to try to reinvest in American infrastructure, which everybody says he or she supports so we could get behind that, but we don’t see anything. Proverbs says that where there is no vision the people will perish, and so we have offered a vision. And instead, they have come with a plan that lacks all vision, lacks any plan for reinvesting in American infrastructure, lacks any investment in the vital services that people need and, on the contrary, works to dismantle healthcare services, Medicaid, education, community development grants, senior workforce, jobs training, you name it, the Peace Corps, National Endowment for the Arts, National Endowment for the Humanities; slashed $6 billion from NIH in order to undermine scientific research and medical progress on colon cancer and breast cancer and Alzheimer’s disease and asthma and bipolar disorder. We have been making progress on all of these things, and, for some reason, 
the Trump administration says they want to pull the plug on it and slash $6 billion from NIH and all of the institutions around the country that NIH supports. Well, we have invited Congressman ROKHANNA to be with us tonight. He is a leading expert on the economy and on the manufacturing sector, and we have asked him to talk about investment in infrastructure and manufacturing, what we need and what, instead, we have gotten from the Trump budget. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. KHANNA ). Mr. KHANNA. Thank you, Congressman RASKIN , and thank you for your leadership with the Progressive Caucus and in articulating a positive vision of what the American people need with a budget. I want to address the issue of manufacturing because this President went around the country campaigning on bringing manufacturing jobs back. And there is a simple philosophical difference in what the Progressive Caucus believes and the President’s budget. If you believe, as the Republicans do, that we need to cut taxes and have less spending, you would be for this President’s budget. But if you believe, as we do, that the big issue facing this country is good paying jobs and higher wages, you would be for the progressive budget. b1745 Let me give you a concrete example. One of the programs that the President cuts in the name of less government and lower taxes is the Manufacturing Extension Partnership. Now, what does this do? What does the Manufacturing Extension Partnership do? It actually works with small and mediumsized manufacturers across this country, many in the Rust Belt, to help them be competitive, to help them compete against currency manipulation, against unfair trade deals, to help them compete against lower cost labor. How does the program do this? It partners them with leading technology companies to say, look, if you are a small or mediumsized manufacturer, maybe you should have cloud technology. Move your technology off the factory floor and use the cloud to be more costcompetitive so that you can compete. Basically, the program helps to bring and keep manufacturing jobs in the United States. Now, here is the irony. You would think, oh, is this a liberal idea? Is this the idea of Democrat, or a liberal Democrat? The irony is this was Ronald Reagan’s idea. It was actually a program instituted by President Reagan in 1988 to help American manufacturers compete for the 21st century, and every administration has supported it. One would think this President who ran on bringing manufacturing jobs would say, okay, let’s quadruple funding for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership. Instead, he zeroed it out, zeroed out the funding for manufacturing programs. The progressive budget says we want to increase our investment in manufacturing. We want to actually help the small and medium sized manufacturers create jobs in the United States. I have one more concrete example before I hand it back over to my colleague, Mr. RASKIN . The Appalachian Regional Commission invests in helping to create jobs across the parts of this country that most need that investment. I was down in Appalachia visiting HALROGERS ’ district, a distinguished Republican who chaired the Appropriations Committee, and we saw the Appalachian Regional Commission’s investment in helping coal miners’ kids get jobs. This Republican budget, this administration zeros out the funding for the Appalachian Regional Commission. Instead, we ought to be increasing funding in programs that are going to help transition folks from the industrial to the digital economy. I think my colleague, Congressman RASKIN , will explain that the Progressive budget is not just a moral document. It very much is, and it keeps our commitment to seniors and to those in need, but it is also a blueprint for job creation and good wages and for creating jobs in precisely the places that need them most. This is the big division in this Congress. Do you believe that the big issue is that we need more tax cuts for the investor class, that we need simply to cut government, or do you believe we need government to partner with local leaders, with businesses, to create jobs and better wages? If you believe the latter, I urge you to take a look at the Progressive budget and see our vision for job creation and higher wages. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman KHANNA for that excellent discussion. You would think, with all of the domestic budget of the country being dismantled and slashed and reduced by the Trump administration that we would end up saving money, but they don’t in any way at all because the money is just being shifted over to the Pentagon. So the proposal is to slash $56 billion from things like Meals on Wheels, NIH research into eating disorders and asthma and Alzheimer’s disease and heart and lung disorders and breast cancer and colon cancer, and environmental cleanup like the Chesapeake Bay cleanup, which they want to zero out, and then to shift the money over to the Pentagon at a time when the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform received a report and had a hearing on a McKinsey report which showed that there was $125 billion in immediate savings available at the Pentagon in waste, fraud, abuse, and contractor overruns. So, at a moment when the Pentagon is drowning in money that they don’t know what to do with and all of the beltway bandits are buzzing around in order to get their slice of the pie, President Trump decides it is a good moment to try to dismantle services for the elderly and to stop job training for young people, to stop job training in location for retired citizens, wipe out funding for the Chesapeake Bay cleanup, and roll back or abolish preschool development grants to the States. The litany of attacks on the American people is really quite astounding, and I invite everybody just to go and read the specifics of this budget, which can be read as nothing more than an assault on the health and the well being and the security of the American people. For example, the Department of Education budget proposes to cut $578 billion in title I, part A to support services for disadvantaged students. It reduces IDEA funding by $113 million, seriously jeopardizing special education services for students with disabilities all across the country. It eliminates title II, part A, which provides Federal funding for teacher support and class size reduction. It eliminates or reduces more than 20 additional programs promoting literacy in our communities. It cuts Perkins Career and Technical Education funding by 15 percent. That is just on the education side. Department of Health and Human Services, it eliminates the Community Services Block Grant. It eliminates the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. It cuts the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health by 40 percent. It reduces funding for Child Care and Development Block Grant programs by tens of millions of dollars. It reduces support for Federal job training for adults by 40 percent, job training for dislocated workers and youth. It ends the Senior Community Service Employment Program, an excellent program that has located work, meaningful work, for tens of thousands of older Americans. It closes Job Corps centers. It eliminates funding to counter the worst forms of child labor through the Bureau of International Labor Affairs. It eliminates $11 million in OSHA safety training grants for high hazard industries. You have got to read it to believe it, but the amazing thing is, despite pulling the plug on all of these essential domestic programs that have been proven to work, it doesn’t save us any money because the money is just thrown at the Pentagon and is being saved to throw up the wealth ladder in the country, send it up the wealth ladder through tax cuts to the largest corporations and the wealthiest Americans. That is the name of the game. Everybody understands it, which is why this is the good news. At least we are hearing from both sides of the aisle that the President’s budget written in gold 
at Trump tower for the people at Mar aLago is DOA, dead on arrival. Everybody is saying it, that there is no way that America could absorb the shock of letting this budget come anywhere near to reality. But the message that we get from President Trump and his administration is very simple: Let them eat emoluments. Let them eat emoluments. Now, of course, we don’t get them; he gets them. But the American people are left emptyhanded at the end of this. We don’t get any meaningful investment in the infrastructure of the country. There is no jobs program that is in here. There is no attempt to guarantee the solvency and the strength and the resilience of the Social Security program. We have got that as part of our plan in The People’s Budget for the Progressive Caucus. It is far from trying to stabilize and strengthen Medicare and Medicaid, those two great victories of the Great Society. There is an attempt to undermine and ravage Medicaid and Medicare, again, to send all of the wealth up the income ladder, all of the wealth to the people who need it the least in the country, pulling the plug on everybody else. Well, our hope is that we are going to be able to organize people to stop it, but the tragedy here is that there are so many needs in America that need to be addressed. Working people have seen a major erosion in their living standards over the last several decades. Working people have lost pension security. Working people need to have retirement sources stabilized. We have got to use Social Security as a way to make sure that everybody can experience a decent and dignified retirement. Social Security is a great accomplishment, maybe the greatest antipoverty program ever created in the history of the Earth. It lifted millions of senior Americans out of poverty; and despite the opposition of the GOP at the time, now everybody concedes that Social Security was a brilliant idea with administrative bureaucratic overhead less than 1 percent, and it lifts millions of seniors to a state of at least a modicum of dignity in retirement. And there are millions of children who are on Social Security because of survivors benefits and disability benefits. So we need to strengthen the Social Security system. We need to reinvest in it, and we need to expand it, because it used to be that there were supposed to be three pillars for people’s old age: one was Social Security, another was a defined pension, and another was personal savings. But the pensions from private employment are increasingly gone. They have been scattered to the winds. And people’s personal savings have been eroded by the dramatic increase of economic inequality in the country and the erosion of the living standards of working people. Tens of millions of Americans are relying exclusively on Social Security now, so we have got to reinvest in Social Security and make sure it works, and we have got plans for doing that, too. But the point is that the real problems of the country have been ignored. There is no vision. There is no program. There is no policy for reinvesting in America coming from the MaraLago set, from this Cabinet of billionaires. We are not getting any of it. Instead, we get an almost laughable, comical, cartoon version of rightwing GOP economics, which proposes to slash everything and to uproot the basic programs that the American people rely on for a civilized society. We can do better than this. I see I have been joined by my very distinguished colleague who will pursue the discussion. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. ELLISON ). Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, I just want to say thank you to Congressman RASKIN for holding down this Special Order. You do such an excellent job, you and PRAMILA JAYAPAL , and we are grateful for it. Mr. Speaker, here are just a few headlines from the budget that the Trump administration just released: ‘‘Trump Budget Leaves Working Class Base Behind’’; that is the Detroit Free Press. ‘‘Meatloaf Again: Christie Meekly Accepts Trump’s Medicaid Cuts’’; that is the New Jersey StarLedger. ‘‘Trump Budget Replicates Disastrous Kansas Approach. This Won’t End Well’’; that is the Kansas City Star, Mr. Speaker. ‘‘No Help from Trump’’; that is the Houston Chronicle. ‘‘Trump Meets the Pope While His Budget Threatens the Least of Us’’; that is The Sacramento Bee. ‘‘The Harsh Budget Americans Voted for’’; that is the Charlotte Observer. ‘‘Another Bad Budget from Trump Targets the Poor,’’ The Washington Post. ‘‘Trump’s Assault on Working Voters’’; that is the Baltimore Sun. ‘‘Surprise, Surprise: Trump’s Budget Punishes the Sick and the Poor While Rewarding the Wealthy’’; that is the LA Times. ‘‘A SlashandBurn Budget,’’ New York Daily News. ‘‘Budget Cuts Include U.S. Heart’’; that is northjersey.com; The New York Times: ‘‘A Budget That Promises Little But Pain.’’ Bloomberg View: ‘‘Trump’s Budget is a Waste of Everybody’s Time.’’ Financial Times, no beacon of liberalism there, Mr. Speaker: ‘‘Trump’s Implausible Plan for the U.S. Budget.’’ So whether you are talking about conservative instruments in the news or more liberal ones or more middleof theroad, it is really kind of amazing: Everyone seems to share one feeling about the Trump budget. We all hate it. It is bad. It is not a good thing, and there are plenty of reasons why people don’t like it. And so I just want to add that the OMB is led by one of our former colleagues, Mick Mulvaney, and I think Mick is a nice guy. I can’t tell people that I personally dislike Mick. He is nice to me. But that is not what this is about. b1800 This is about how we are operating in our public lives. In our public lives and discharging our public responsibility, I have to quote the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. He says: Meals on Wheels sounds great. We’re not going to spend money on programs that cannot show that they actually deliver on promises that we’ve made to people. I will submit to you that Meals on Wheels is a very meritorious program, it costs very little money, and it allows vulnerable seniors and people with disabilities to live at home. Deep cuts. Actually, Mick said as well: Deep budget cuts are actually one of the most compassionate things we can do. I wonder, Mr. Speaker, compassionate for who? Maybe those billionaires at Mara Lago—maybe they need a little love, too, sometimes—or the people who occupy Trump Towers. Regarding HUD, or Housing and Urban Development, he said: It doesn’t work very well. Tell that to the people who rely on lowincome housing tax credits, section 8 voucher programs, and all types of housing programs that allow people to afford their housing. On the issue of school nutrition programs, he says: Guess what. There’s no demonstrable evidence that they’re actually doing that. There’s no demonstrable evidence that we’re actually helping kids to do better in school. This is about school nutrition. Here is another one: We can’t ask single mothers to continue to pay for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Well, single moms might rely on the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to help their kids learn how to read. I think that Sesame Street is a pretty good outfit. That might be their only avenue. Here is another one: If you ask, 999 people out of 1,000 would tell you that Social Security disability is not part of Social Security. It is an oldage retirement that they think of when they think of Social Security. Quite the contrary. People do think of Social Security disability when they think of Social Security. Here is another quote: ‘‘Are there folks on SNAP who shouldn’t be?’’ That is the question. So we are, again, trying to focus on fraud in SNAP, rather than worrying about hungry Americans. Here is another quote: ‘‘Maybe it’s reasonable to ask if there are folks who are on there that shouldn’t be. That is a reasonable question to ask.’’ 
You know what? I think it is focusing on the wrong part of the problem. Hunger, Mr. Speaker, is the problem in the richest country in the history of the world. At its richest point in its own history, we are being told by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget that we cannot afford SNAP, Meals on Wheels, and public broadcasting. Amazing. I think that, honestly, Mr. Speaker, it is often said that you should speak truth to power. I think we must speak truth to power. I think the gentleman from Maryland would agree with me that we have got to speak truth to power. But it occurs to me, Mr. Speaker, that the power knows exactly what the truth is: this budget is going to hurt hungry children. The budget is going to cut seniors. It is going to cut veterans. It is going to cut public broadcasting, which is one of the major ways people get news in South Dakota and rural America. It is going to cut the Appalachian Regional Commission. It is going to leave devastation almost everywhere. It is going to cut the EPA by a third. The power knows—and I am talking about Trump and his administration— the devastation that they are going to inflict on people. In fact, that is why they are doing it. They just don’t believe the government has any role in helping to make Americans lives better. Their idea of freedom, Mr. Speaker, is a billionaire being able to pollute anywhere and everywhere he wants. Their idea of freedom is amassing great fortunes at the expense of everyone else, all the while relying on our Nation’s military, our Nation’s police, the road system; all the while relying on clean water, clean air; all the while relying on public schools to educate their workforce. They say: I did it all by myself. Yet everything they have done has been with the help of the government of the people of the United States of America. It is really outrageous, Mr. Speaker. I think that we are in a moment when we have got to speak truth to each other, Mr. Speaker. We have got to go all across this Nation and talk to people in the barbershops, the VFW halls. We have got to talk to people in the church basement, the mosque basement, the synagogue basement. We have got to talk to people on the corners and tell them about this budget. If they hear about this Trump budget, they will be outraged. Nobody can support this budget, not even a millionaire or a billionaire, unless you believe that you are not your brother’s keeper, that you have no obligation to other people around you, that everything around you should be amassed to accumulate wealth for yourself. That is the only possible way anybody can stand next to this budget. I really do hope that the Republican caucus puts this budget up for a vote. I want to see who is going to stand next to this monstrosity of a budget. I am curious to see who, representing southern Ohio, Kentucky, or Tennessee, is going to vote to zero out the Appalachian Regional Commission; who, representing a northerntier State, is going to cut, zero out, LIHEAP. I want to see the Republican who is going to do that. I think that will be a pretty gutsy move. I guarantee you, your constituents will know exactly what you did. They are watching, Mr. Speaker. People watch C–SPAN and they read the news. They read the headlines that I read off, Mr. Speaker, and they are aware of what is happening in the people’s House at this very hour. I want the people to know that it is the government’s responsibility to take care of the least of these. If you are too poor, too old, or too sick to work, we should help people. We should do it. I believe it is the right thing to do. Mr. Speaker, I don’t care if they call me a bleeding heart liberal—they can call me anything they want—but I am going to be there for lowincome people who are too old, too sick, or too young to work. I am going to be there to make sure that people who are out of work but who are ablebodied have the support that they need to get to work, to have clean air, to have clean water, to promote jobs and infrastructure. We are going to be there to do those things, Mr. Speaker, because we believe in them. Do you know what else, Mr. Speaker? We don’t believe ‘‘tax’’ is a fourletter word. It is actually a threeletter word. It is not a bad word at all. In fact, it is the dues that you pay to live in a civilized society. If you think tax is some kind of a curse word, you can move to Somalia, because they don’t have many there. Here, we have the protection of our police. We have the protection of our courts. We have the protection of our Nation’s military. We have the protection of people who inspect the meat, the water, the air, and everything else, and these people look after us as they discharge their public responsibility and they get paid in our tax money. There is nothing wrong with it. We stand on that. I believe there has got to be a few Republicans who agree with what I just said. I believe there has got to be a few Republicans who believe that it is a good idea for the public to spend money on figuring out the vexing diseases that are ravaging people all over America, like ALS, Parkinson’s, and Alzheimer’s. We should research these diseases. And if we need public money to do it, Mr. Speaker, we should spend that money. But I don’t think this Trump budget reflects that. I want to see my friends on the Republican side of the aisle join us and say we should not cut the Corporation for Public Broadcasting; we should not cut critical programs that help people; we should not cut supplemental assistance programs, SNAP, and food stamps for hungry Americans; we should not cut Medicaid, leaving families on the hook to pay more for the care of their loved ones with disabilities. I don’t believe they believe these cuts are right. I just think that it is going to take a lot of political courage to stand up and say: You know what? Sometimes the government does good for people—we have spent decades saying the government is the problem— and now people actually believe it sometimes, except they don’t believe it when you are cutting their healthcare, basic research, cutting money for our parks, and literally cutting everything, except the military. Oh, by the way, I am the proud father of a military son. My son is a veteran. He just finished 4 years of service in the United States Army, Mr. Speaker. He was a combat veteran. My whole family is proud of him. But I am going to tell you one thing: the money didn’t go to him. He made less than $25,000 a year. He didn’t mind. He is serving his country. Where is all this Big Money going to go? Who is getting it? I don’t know. People who make the machinery, the weapons industry, they are going to make out like bandits, you better believe that. At the end of the day, Mr. Speaker, even the money that they are asking us to spend is going to hurt veterans. I know they are trying to plusup a little on the VA, but there are a whole lot of other services that veterans benefit from, and they are going to get hurt. Mr. Speaker, this Trump budget is wrong, and I believe that every Democrat knows it is wrong, and I even believe a few Republicans know that it is wrong. We should stand up and say that it is wrong. It is wrong to slash the earned income tax credit and child tax credit by $40 billion. This is money that goes to people who actually work for a living. I heard one of our Nation’s leaders in the administration say: Oh, you are crying about these people who are going to get cut. What about the people who pay all the taxes? Mr. Speaker, if we would raise the minimum wage, you would have more people paying taxes, because people’s pay would be higher. It is no comfort to say that half the people don’t pay taxes. They do pay taxes. They pay payroll taxes, they pay sales taxes, they pay property taxes, they pay all kind of taxes, Mr. Speaker. It is wrong to try to imply that they are freeloaders because they don’t pay income taxes. They would be glad to pay those income taxes if their income were higher, which it would be if we invested in America, which this budget does the opposite of. It divests America. I just want to say to you as we begin to wrap up that our Nation is the greatest Nation in the world not because of bombs and guns and military. It is the greatest Nation because we believe in liberty and justice for all, and not just a millionaire’s and a billionaire’s liberty to pollute all they want, 
escape taxes all they want, do whatever they please, without any ramifications. Mr. Speaker, justice is also a part of that equation. Justice means doing right by people. Justice means being fair to people. This budget is the exact opposite of it. This budget leaves out people like our veterans. It cuts almost a billion dollars from housing assistance programs to keep a roof over people’s heads. It cuts Social Security by $72 billion by restricting enrollment in disability insurance programs. It hurts our national security. It spends over $2 billion to build an unnecessary border wall. Oh, this wall. Mr. Speaker, in his campaign, the wall was among the most offensive things, because what it really said is we don’t really want folks from south of the border around here. That is what it said. That is how they felt. Yet here we are spending money to prove that point. It cuts the State Department and USAID by almost 32 percent. Generals will tell you that it is better to talk it out than to shoot it out. Yet here we are cutting down our ability to talk it out. What an outrage. It eliminates international family planning. Let me wrap up by saying this. I was talking to some of my Republican friends—and I do have many, and I am proud to say so—and one of them said to me: KEITH, this thing probably is never going to see the light of day. I said: Maybe it will and maybe it won’t. But this Trump budget is a direct reflection of what he would do if he could do it. And that is scary. Mr. RASKIN. I thank Congressman ELLISON for his eloquent remarks and extraordinary service as cochair of the Progressive Caucus. He has been replaced this week by Congressman POCAN , who we heard from earlier this evening, but it was in deference only to the busyness of his schedule, since he has also become, in addition to the distinguished Congressman from Minnesota, the vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee. Let’s begin to wrap this up. Let’s review some of the extraordinary assaults on the health and the wellbeing of the American people that are embodied in this atrocious budget. First, the President says: let’s cut children’s health insurance by more than $600 billion. This would strip countless children of dental care, asthma treatment, and other medical visits. It eliminates over $190 billion to the SNAP program, a supplemental assistance program that is the food assistance program which helps prevent 42 million working families from going hungry in America. It calls for billions in cuts to Medicaid. It, unbelievably, in the middle of an opioid crisis across the country, would reduce access to drug addiction treatment and drug prevention services with a $1.2 billion cut to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. b1815 At a time when we need to be doubling down on investment in drug prevention and drug treatment and dealing with the opioid crisis, the Trump administration simply hides under the bed. The budget would cut the Department of Labor’s job training programs by an astonishing twothirds—that is job training for our people at a time when we are going through dramatic structural shifts in the nature of the economy with robots and mechanization, and they want to cut by 65 percent the Department of Labor’s job training programs. They want to sell off our national parks and public lands for oil drilling, gas exploration, and fracking. They want to sell the land of the American people—the trust that we have had for centuries—that a great Republican President, Teddy Roosevelt, once insisted on. They want to sell it off to their friends at Exxon Mobil and the frackers across the country. They have spent $10 billion building their stupid wall—a 14th century answer to a 21st century problem. Maybe they will have a moat and some alligators to go with it. But didn’t I hear somebody say on the campaign trail that Mexico was going to pay for that wall? I heard millions of people chanting that at rallies, and the President was saying: Mexico—you can believe me—Mexico is going to pay for it. Already they are putting $2 billion in our budget while they are stripping schoolchildren of their lunches. While they are slashing scientific and medical research in the country, they want to put $2 billion into a wall that nobody needs at a time when illegal immigration from the southern border is at a decade’s record low. They want to take $2 billion and put it into that. They want to cut billions of dollars from afterschool programs, from teacher training, and from student loans. They want to eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood, which millions of women and men depend on not just for family planning but also for basic medical attention, purely out of animosity toward Planned Parenthood which has not received one penny for abortion services in many decades. They just want to dismantle it. They would destroy it if they could, despite the fact that millions of Americans depend on Planned Parenthood. They want to cut Social Security— which they promised not to touch—by $72 billion by restricting enrollment in the disability insurance program—and on and on. You name your favorite, most important Federal program, and I guarantee you, unless you are a Big Business beltway contractor defense bandit, it is going to be cut in this budget. You can go and check it out. Now, if a foreign power—a foreign repressive power—like Putin’s Russia or Duterte’s Philippines or Orban’s Hungary set out to injure and demoralize the American people, they could not have done better than the budget which President Trump sent to Capitol Hill this week. This is a budget that is drafted seemingly by an enemy of the American people. It is not the media that is the American people’s enemy, as the President insisted, it is whoever drafted this budget. That is the enemy of the American people. Let them eat emoluments, they are telling us with this. Let them eat emoluments. They have got all the emoluments. They are the ones taking the money from the foreign governments. But they are saying, Let them eat emoluments, because the American people have been robbed by this budget if it were ever to see the light of day. Mr. Speaker, a great Republican President once spoke of government of the people, by the people, and for the people. Abraham Lincoln was a Member of this body. He sat where we have the honor of sitting in this body, and he talked about government of the people, by the people, and for the people. This is a budget of the super rich, by the super rich, for the super rich. It was drafted by a Cabinet of billionaires for the people who are lounging at Mar aLago today, and they give the finger to the rest of the country. That is what this budget says. If my friends on the other side of the aisle are smart—and I know they are— and they know what is good for them— and I know they do, Mr. Speaker—they will say immediately this document is DOA and they have got nothing to do with it and very quickly distance themselves from it. We need to return to that great vision of a government that is of the people, by the people, and for the people. That is who we are as a country. The government right now is experiencing a hostile takeover by a tiny elite, and that is what is taking place around the world today. If you look at Putin’s Russia, if you look at Orban’s Hungary, if you look at Duterte in the Philippines, if you look at what they tried to do with Le Pen in France, there is a new model, my friends, all over the world. Government is a moneymaking operation for a tiny elite in each society. They want to go back to something like kings and queens where the government serves the tiniest portion of the people. They might get elected spouting populist rhetoric and slogans, but the minute they get in, Wall Street takes over. We have got a President who campaigned against Goldman Sachs, and his Cabinet is dominated by Goldman Sachs. How long are people going to fall for that magic trick? Not very long if anybody still believes in it out there. I don’t think anybody’s faith or confidence in this President as a populist will survive this budget—what a joke, and what an insult to the great populists of American history like the populist movement in William Jennings Bryan, that they would dare to associate themselves with populism. 
This is a budget that is based on elitism and class warfare, topdown class warfare: the richest people in this country against everybody else. That is what this budget represents. That is what it embodies. So check out the Progressive Caucus’ People’s Budget. It is a real reinvestment in the infrastructure of the country: our bridges, our roads, our highways, our transit systems, our port systems, our airports, and cybersecurity—where America really needs investment, not stealing from poor people, not stealing from the working class, and not ripping off NIH and the Centers for Disease Control in order to put money in the Pentagon for a bunch of beltway bandits and defense contractors who have so much money they don’t know what to do with it anymore. That is not what we need. We need a real investment in America. This budget is an affront, and it is an insult to the American people. We should reject it immediately. I call on all of our colleagues, Mr. Speaker, to repudiate this document in a bipartisan fashion, and let’s get down to work for the American people. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
MEMORIAL DAY The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. BIGGS) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the topic of this Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Arizona? There was no objection. Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, on Monday we observe Memorial Day to honor members of America’s Armed Forces who have died in service to our Nation. For those who have lost a loved one, a friend, a neighbor, or a comrade, this day has added significance, remembrance, and sadness. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON ). Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, many of us in this House will attend Memorial Day ceremonies over the weekend as we honor those who have died in the service to this great Nation. Certainly, in this office, one of the more difficult but one of the most honored opportunities is to be at the grave site of our fallen heroes as they are laid to rest and that American flag, which flies over our Capitol, is draped over their coffin. On this Memorial Day, I really want to highlight my brotherinlaw, Larry Emerman, who in the fall of 1980, in the service of this country as a pilot in the United States Navy as a lieutenant commander, lost his life in the service of our Nation. Memorial Day is observed on the last Monday of May. Memorial Day is one of America’s most solemn occasions. The tradition of Memorial Day dates back to 1864 in Boalsburg, Pennsylvania, which is considered to be the birthplace of Memorial Day. Three ladies decorated the graves of fallen Civil War soldiers, and the custom has continued every year since then. It was an early fall day, in 1864, when Emma Hunter and her friend, Sophie Keller, picked flowers and went to the old cemetery to lay them on the grave of Emma’s father, Reuben Hunter. Dr. Hunter was a young Boalsburg doctor at the time of the Civil War. When he volunteered to serve with the Army of the North, he was assigned to the hospital in Baltimore. In addition to attending the wounded soldiers, he also cared for the men who had contracted yellow fever while fighting in the southern swamplands. Dr. Hunter became ill. He died of yellow fever, and his body was buried in the Boalsburg Cemetery. On their way that day in that early fall, the two girls met Mrs. Elizabeth Myers, whose young son, Amos, had been killed the last day of the Battle of Gettysburg and was also buried in the old cemetery. Learning where the girls were going, Mrs. Myers asked to join them. They shared the flowers, and they placed them on both graves. It was decided then and there that they would meet the following year with flowers for all who had died in the Civil War. The three young women told their friends of the plans, and when the day came around, most of the villagers joined them. From that simple beginning came the observance of Memorial Day in Boalsburg, Pennsylvania. Every year since then, the people have met on the Diamond in Boalsburg Square for the walk to the old cemetery to lay flowers on the graves of all the soldiers dead. They are led by a hometown band. All ages join in the walk and participate in the simple service of remembering. I have been proud to participate in that tradition which has spanned more than 150 years. Boalsburg still puts on a traditional Memorial Day celebration complete with a parade, a community walk to the cemetery, speeches, military reenactments, and much more. On Memorial Day, communities across the country will pay tribute to our fallen veterans who never returned home. Many of us will gather with family members, friends, and neighbors as we keep those we lost in our hearts. Unfortunately, for many of our Nation, Memorial Day has become a day of picnics and family gatherings, which is not a bad thing, but we must always remember truly where Memorial Day came from and its purpose, that we not forget those sacrifices. So as we raise the Stars and Stripes and as we lay wreaths at the monuments, memorials, and cemeteries, let us remember that our freedom is thanks to those who have died in sacrifice. We celebrate Memorial Day in honor of so many who are no longer with us. May God bless them, and certainly God bless the United States of America. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arizona for his leadership and putting this opportunity today for us to gather on the floor to speak on the topic of not just Memorial Day but the service and the sacrifice that warranted its origination. Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER ). Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Memorial Day on May 29, 2017. On this day, Americans across our Nation pay respects to and honor members of the U.S. Armed Forces who have sacrificed their lives defending the freedoms that we so gratefully enjoy. The decision to leave families and friends, travel to a land that is utterly unfamiliar, and risk their lives protecting the lives of others is among the most selfless acts one can make. Roughly 1.5 million Americans are currently serving in one of the five branches of the Armed Forces. Of these Americans, nearly 90,000 are assigned to one of Georgia’s numerous military bases which are scattered throughout our great State. Georgia’s First Congressional District that I have the honor and privilege of representing is particularly important to our Nation’s Armed Forces as it includes Fort Stewart Army Base, Hunter Army Airfield, Kings Bay Naval Base, and Moody Air Force Base. The service provided by our Nation’s armed services is invaluable. Throughout our history, millions have paid the ultimate price for freedom—they have given their lives in order to save ours. I ask that you please keep these brave men and women in your prayers, not only on Memorial Day but every day. It is an honor to represent a State and a district with such a strong tie to our Nation’s defense. I ask that you pray for our troops, and I ask that you pray for our Nation. God bless each and every one of you as we observe this great Memorial Day. God bless America. b1830 Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield to my colleague from North Carolina (Mr. HUDSON ). Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because this week is All American Week, the annual celebration of the 82nd Airborne Division’s mission and the paratroopers who serve to uphold it. Based in my district at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, the 82nd Airborne Division is the Nation’s Global Response 
Force and can mobilize, load, and strike in a moment’s notice. These rapid reaction forces put the ‘‘air’’ in airborne and are absolutely vital to our national security. This year marks the division’s 100th anniversary, and it is a special time for us to celebrate its incredible history as America’s Guard of Honor. Since its inception, the 82nd Airborne Division has played a role in every major U.S. conflict around the world. It was nicknamed the ‘‘All American Division’’ because of the unique and diverse group of soldiers who came together to form the division from all across the United States. As the Representative of Fort Bragg in Congress, I am so proud of the 82nd Airborne’s legacy, of our paratroopers and their families. They put country before self, and we are so grateful. I will continue to work to ensure this critical installation remains the epicenter of the universe and the tip of the spear guaranteeing our national security. As we celebrate All American Week this week, I ask my fellow Americans to join me in praying for servicemembers stationed at Fort Bragg who are currently deployed and for their families here at home. We also remember our veterans who served in the 82nd Airborne Division, particularly those who made the ultimate sacrifice. Today’s paratroopers stand on the shoulders of these giants. Airborne, all the way. Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, each Memorial Day, a newspaper in my State, the Arizona Republic, publishes one particular letter to remind its readers of the sacrifice our soldiers made in defense of their country. The letter is written by Sullivan Ballou to his wife on July 14, 1861. Sullivan was a major in the Union Army, 32 years old, and about to enter the first battle of Bull Run. A little more than a week later, almost 3,000 Union soldiers had perished, including Sullivan. Major Sullivan’s letter reads as follows: ‘‘My very dear Sarah: The indications are very strong that we shall move in a few days—perhaps tomorrow. Lest I should not be able to write again, I feel impelled to write a few lines that may fall under your eye when I shall be no more. . . . ‘‘I have no misgivings about, or lack of confidence in the cause in which I am engaged, and my courage does not halt or falter. I know how strongly American civilization now leans on the triumph of the government and how great a debt we owe to those who went before us through the blood and sufferings of the Revolution. And I am willing—perfectly willing—to lay down all my joys in this life to help maintain this government and to pay that debt. ...  ‘‘Sarah, my love for you is deathless. It seems to bind me with mighty cables that nothing but omnipotence could break; and yet my love of country comes over me like a strong wind and bears me unresistibly on with all these chains to the battlefield. The memories of the blissful moments I have spent with you come creeping over me, and I feel most gratified to God and to you that I have enjoyed them for so long. And hard it is for me to give them up and burn to ashes the hopes of future years, when, God willing, we might still have lived and loved together, and seen our sons grow up to honorable manhood around us. ‘‘I have, I know, but few and small claims upon Divine Providence, but something whispers to me—perhaps it is the wafted prayer of my little Edgar—that I shall return to my loved ones unharmed. If I do not, my dear Sarah, never forget how much I love you, and when my last breath escapes me on the battlefield, it will whisper your name. ‘‘Forgive my many faults and the many pains I have caused you. How thoughtless and foolish I have oftentimes been. How gladly would I wash out with my tears every little spot upon your happiness. . . . ‘‘But, O Sarah, if the dead can come back to this Earth and flit unseen around those they loved, I shall always be near you; in the gladdest days and in the darkest nights . . . always, always, and if there be a soft breeze upon your check, it shall be my breath, as the cool air fans your throbbing temple, it shall be my spirit passing by. ‘‘Sarah, do not mourn me dead; think I am gone and wait for thee, for we shall meet again.’’ So closes Major Ballou’s letter. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield to my colleague, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. BRAT). Mr. BRAT. Mr. Speaker, first I would like to thank my very good friend from Arizona (Mr. BIGGS), first of all, for his moving testimony on behalf of the greatest folks who ever served our Nation and for arranging this Special Order to honor the valiant men and women that serve our country every day. While most of America views Memorial Day, rightly, as the official start of summer vacations and cookouts, which we all enjoy, I hope we also do not forget to pause and remember the men and women who give the full, last measure of devotion serving our country. It is a day to remember those who died defending the freedoms we hold dear and acknowledge the debt of gratitude we owe to our servicemembers and their loved ones. This weekend, we stop to mourn so many of our heroes who served: brothers and sisters, fathers and mothers, aunts and uncles who never came home. National cemeteries often serve as the final resting place for those who served our country. Founded by President Lincoln and enacted by Congress in 1862, today you can find these cemeteries tucked away in communities across America. Too often the history and stories they hold remain untold or forgotten. In 1867, Culpeper National Cemetery was established and is located in my congressional district. Earlier this month, a 23yearold young man was laid to rest there. U.S. Army Sergeant Cameron Thomas grew up in Ohio, but his family later made Culpeper, Virginia, home. I was proud to see so many members of the Culpeper community lining the streets holding American flags to honor Sergeant Thomas. At the age of 19, Sergeant Thomas became one of the youngest soldiers to ever earn the Ranger designation. On his fifth deployment, he was killed in action on April 27 in Afghanistan during a night raid on a remote ISIS stronghold that resulted in killing the head of ISIS in Afghanistan. Family members and friends described him as a man who lived with intention and determination. He believed anything worth doing was worth overdoing and that moderation is for cowards. He was a man who knew his mission and served our country with distinction. Sergeant Cameron Thomas represented the best of our armed services. He loved his family, passionately served his country, and will be a soldier we honor and cherish for the rest of our Nation’s history. Mr. Speaker, I want to again thank the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. BIGGS) for doing this service for our country. Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I am going to take a moment to give recognition to a special veteran from my district who is 90 years old and is a World War II veteran, who worked in the U.S. Navy during World War II and saw many trips across the Pacific Ocean and endured the life of a sailor, sometimes monotonous and sometimes under very perilous circumstances, including at least one attack by kamikazes of his ship and convoy. I pay special tribute at this time to Wayne Whitlock, who has persevered for many years after service to his country in that great war. Mr. Speaker, I am also reminded tonight of President Abraham Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address. As President Lincoln looked out on a battlefield that had experienced almost 50,000 casualties, he said: ‘‘The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us—that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion— that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain—that this Nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom—and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the Earth.’’ 
b1845 THE SCOURGE OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. FITZPATRICK ). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. POE) for 30 minutes. 
Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the topic of this Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, this coming Monday, May 29, marks the 2 year anniversary of the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, called the JVTA. Democrats and Republicans in the House of Representatives and the Senate worked together in a bipartisan manner to write this comprehensive, massive law to fight human trafficking. Basically, we said in this legislation that modernday slavery will not be tolerated in the United States, and that message was made loud and clear when the law was signed 2 years ago. Since that time, there have been wonderful successes by providing victims with help and services that they need to recover, and by capturing and charging both the traffickers and the buyers according to our law. DEBBIE ’S STORY  
Mr. Speaker, Debbie grew up in an idyllic American neighborhood. The middle child of a closeknit military family living in the suburbs, Debbie could have never imagined that she would be forced into sex slavery. One cool Phoenix night, Debbie’s mother thought nothing of letting her young daughter meet a friend in their front yard one night to play. Busy with dishes and other children inside, her mother didn’t realize that her young daughter, clad in her cartoon pajamas, was being abducted by two men in front of their house. These deviants threw Debbie in the car, drugged and gang raped her. They held a loaded gun to her forehead and threatened to pull the trigger if she ever tried to escape. For 60 days she was forced to have sex with countless men. Thankfully for Debbie, a lucky anonymous tip led police to a hotel room where they found Debbie tied up and stashed under a bed. 
Cheryl Briggs grew up in an abusive home, sexually and physically abused by her father. Her mother left when Cheryl was very young to escape the abuse. At the age of 12, Cheryl didn’t know what else to do to get away from the father she feared, so she ran away. She began hitchhiking with truck drivers and anyone who would take her. This led her to a ride with a motorcyclist and into human trafficking hell. He took her to a biker club filled with men who took advantage of her. He became her trafficker. She was forced to dance at a strip club by day and sold on the streets at night. She was trapped in the world of human trafficking. Cheryl didn’t know how to get help. She had no one to call and no one to provide for her. No one came to rescue her. That is until a patron at a strip club found out that she was only 15 and helped her escape. 
In her formative years, Lena wore turtlenecks and baggy clothes to school every day. Why did she do so? To hide the bruises that covered her entire body. When her abusive foster mother lost custody, Lena ran away. She was just 13 years old. After bolting from the front lawn at the Houston middle school, she ran into a friendly looking stranger. This man offered to look after her, protect and love her. Human traffickers manipulate the vulnerabilities of their victims, he knew that Lena would do anything to feel loved. For the next 3 months, Lena was trafficked to countless buyers. He kept her on the move, switching from motel to motel to evade detection. Finally, after tracking a BackPage advertisement her trafficker posted, police located Lena. They arrested her trafficker in the hotel next door. With her help, the police ultimately charged her trafficker. Debbie, Cheryl and Lena are all human trafficking survivors. The things they had to endure are more horrific than most of us can even imagine. But they survived, they overcame this tragedy. It was for survivors like these women that CAROLYN MALONEY and I drafted the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act two years ago. This farreaching legislation, led by Senator JOHN CORNYN and Senator R ONWYDEN in the Senate, made it clear that Congress would no longer turn a blind eye to this scourge in our society. We wanted to ensure that victims were treated like victims, given the care and help they needed to overcome the evil inflicted upon them. We also wanted to make sure that the traffickers and the buyers were both brought to justice. 
This past February, my hometown of Houston, Texas, hosted the 51st Super bowl. For most Americans the Super Bowl is a fun filled day spent with friends and family cheering on a favorite team. But for trafficking slaves and potential trafficking slaves, if can be a very dangerous time. Studies show that big events like Super Bowls create large upticks in the trafficking and purchasing of sex trafficking victims. In order to counteract this, The Department of Homeland Security, as part of its Blue Campaign Initiative, began preparing months in advance. DHS agents came to Washington, DC and briefed me and other members of the Texas Delegation on their antitrafficking strategy for super bowl weekend. Through the Blue Campaign, DHS raises public awareness, forges antitrafficking partnerships and brings suspected human traffickers to justice. I commend the Blue Campaign for collaborating with local, state and federal law enforcement agencies in preparation for the Super Bowl. As a direct result of this large multiagency operation, over 750 people were arrested across 15 different states. At least 86 victims were rescued, and many more were likely spared being forced into the trafficking industry. 
Having personally worked closely with the Blue Campaign on this, and many other operations, I see firsthand the important role DHS has in fighting the scourge of human trafficking. This DHS Blue Campaign Authorization Act will ensure that this critically important program continues to provide safety to victims and justice to their traffickers. 
Over the last two years, more than 65 defendants have been charged with federal human trafficking violations. Of those, 10 were buyers. Without demand, there would be no market. JVTA gives law enforcement the critical tools it needs to capture and prosecute criminals who purchase sex from minors or trafficking victims. Long gone are the days where buyers could anonymously purchase sex from trafficking victims and simply return to their normal lives. JVT also allows a federal judge to impose an additional assessment of up to $5,000. This money then goes into the Domestic Trafficking Victims’ Fund. This fund provides victims with increased access to services and resources. It forces the criminals to pay the rent on the courthouse, forces both the buyer and the trafficker to pay for the system they created. They inflicted pain and suffering on innocent people, they should be the ones to pay. JVTA also clarified that the U.S. Marshals Service can assist local, state and federal law enforcement in the search and rescue of missing children. Since the implementation of JVTA, U.S. Marshals have helped rescue 102 children. As JVTA continues to be implemented, and prosecutors and judges are trained on the new tools it offers them, we will continue to see more and more traffickers and buyers held accountable for their crimes. We will also see a system that treats victims like victims, providing them with the care and support they need to become survivors. And that’s just the way it is. Mr. POE of Texas. Tonight we have this Special Order, and we have several Members who are going to speak on this. The first Member who will speak is Representative WAGNER . She has served in the House since 2013, and she has, herself, worked extensively on human trafficking issues. She is a cosponsor of the Shame Act that I have sponsored, and we have worked together. I am honored to introduce her as our first speaker on this very important issue of the human trafficking after 2 years of the legislation being signed. I yield to the gentlewoman. Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman very much for the opportunity to colead this Special Order with my dear colleague, Congressman TED POE, for Human Trafficking Awareness Week. I was thrilled, Mr. Speaker, that yesterday the House passed my legislation, the Put Trafficking Victims First Act. Together, we can get victims of trafficking out of dangerous and abusive situations and create better, more accessible traumainformed services. Victims don’t just need to be rescued. They need opportunities to rebuild and sort through trauma and to live well. My bill advances a survivorcentered approach to addressing human trafficking that ensures the safety, confidentiality, and the wellbeing of victims. It encourages stakeholders to recognize symptoms of trauma and coping mechanisms that may impact victims’ interactions with law enforcement, the justice system, and service providers. One of the key ways we can address the upsetting realities of human trafficking in the U.S. justice system is by giving victims a pathway to vacate and expunge their criminal records for offenses that they were forced to commit. I have met with many survivors in my home State of Missouri and across our great country who struggle to rebuild their lives because they are trailed by criminal records. Traffickers and pimps intentionally push victims to commit crimes as a means of control. My heart breaks for these women who have suffered horrendous abuse and bear the mark of a record on top of it. Criminal records make it difficult for survivors to get jobs, medical care, education, and even housing assistance. These records haunt survivors and can even lead to revictimization. Mr. Speaker, if we are serious about giving survivors of trafficking a second chance, we must enact serious, foolproof vacatur laws that erase the collateral consequences of treating trafficking victims like criminals. This is why I introduced, along with the support of many of my colleagues, the Trafficking Survivors Relief Act. This bill would give victims of trafficking relief from Federal or D.C. criminal convictions or arrests. We know well that Federal courts are not—and I underscore ‘‘not’’—infallible, and that many victims are trafficked within the District. These women don’t deserve criminal records. They deserve restitution, civil damages, and the empowerment to walk with their heads held high. I am adamant that these women get a second chance at life, that they find housing, therapy, jobs, new friends, and new chances. I am adamant that the United States of America will no longer punish people for trauma that most of us cannot even imagine. I am adamant that the United States Congress will have the moral aptitude to enact the Trafficking Survivors Relief Act. I am adamant that not one more victim of trafficking will be mistreated in our criminal justice system. Mr. Speaker, I am adamant that we pass this bill into law. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman. I would like to ask a couple of questions if she doesn’t mind. I know she has other appointments, but I wanted to ask her a couple questions. I would like to know how has the trafficking situation in her home State of Missouri decreased, or how has this legislation helped? Mrs. WAGNER. Well, I will tell the gentleman that the legislation that he and I have worked on for a number of years and that he has spent the better part of a lifetime as a judge and as a legislator on is saving lives; but, sadly, my hometown of St. Louis, Missouri, would be ranked in the top 20 counties or cities in the Nation for human trafficking. So the problem is prevalent. It exists still. What breaks my heart most of all are those children who have been victimized, whether it is by online predators or other means, those who are the most vulnerable in our society. We have been able to work with many of the safe houses, with our prosecutors, with our law enforcement, with our advocacy groups. As Congressman POEand I both know, we can’t always legislate all the ills of society away. What I appreciate about the work that we do is not only passing laws and legislation to help those victims, but also the education and awareness that is so very important. So anything that we can do to lift those advocates up, to bring a spotlight to this modernday slavery is so very important. I commend the gentleman from Texas for his work and for the Special Order here tonight. I look forward to a day when this heinous crime, this modernday slavery no longer exists in the United States of America. Mr. POE of Texas. I thank the gentlewoman for her comments. I also wanted to compliment her on her tenacious work of going after backpage.com and making that resource unavailable for those traffickers and those buyers. I want to commend her for that. Mrs. WAGNER. I thank the gentleman. I would say, Mr. Speaker, that these online predators are the bane of our existence. It is a dark underbelly of the human trafficking and sex slavery trade that is out there, and it is absolutely unconscionable that crimes can be committed online that would not be allowed to be committed offline. We are going to go to the heart of the Communications Decency Act with my next piece of legislation that so many attorneys general and States and prosecutors and law enforcement and advocacy groups are begging for Congress to act to make sure that there is clarity so that States and the Federal Government can prosecute, and to make sure that we make the changes that are necessary in a very specific and narrow way to make sure that those online predators are not victimizing the children, women, and young boys of our land. I look forward to working with the gentleman and my colleagues on much more work in this arena. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman being here and making such powerful comments. I yield to the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Ms. GABBARD ). She is an Iraqi war veteran and a former member of the Hawaii House of Representatives. She is working specifically, among other things, in the area of the juvenile justice system, trying to reform that. 
Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague for his leadership on this and many other issues, really taking up this cause and being a champion for the voiceless. Last month I was in my district in Hawaii, and we traveled all across the State, on every island, holding townhall meetings on a variety of issues, but one of the meetings and forums that I participated in was at the University of Hawaii at Hilo, and it was specifically around this issue of human trafficking, of sex trafficking. In this small community in Hawaii, many people had gathered—it was a full room—trying to increase their own awareness and share more information about the prevalence of this issue, not just in places in other parts of the world, but in our communities right here at home. I think that is something that surprises a lot of folks that I talk to, is you can read about these human trafficking problems in cities in Asia or other parts of the world, but very rarely do people think that it is happening in their own backyard, in their own hometown, when the reality is that this is a very real issue that exists in far too many of our hometowns and our communities all across the country. In my own home State of Hawaii, girls as young as 11 years old have been recruited from schools, from beaches, from malls through an intricate network of sex traffickers. In 2016, last year, 30 cases of human trafficking were reported to the human trafficking hotline in Hawaii. Almost all of them had to do with the exploitation of women for sex and labor, and in 10 of these cases the individuals targeted were minors. Now, what we know and what is terribly disturbing is how underreported this actually is, that these numbers are not at all representative of the reality that exists in our community because trafficking is more common than the number of cases reported. Now, too often those who are victims of and those who are forced into trafficking are charged as criminals and are forced to live with this criminal record for the rest of their lives, never being able to escape the shackles of nonviolent crimes committed in the course of their being victims of human trafficking. This often inhibits them from getting the care and assistance that they really need, to be free, to be able to move on with their lives. Our current criminal justice system is broken in so many ways, and in so many ways perpetuates a cycle of crime, exploitation, and poverty, stripping the most exploited and vulnerable individuals in our society of a fair chance for a new life and healing from unimaginable abuses perpetuated by truly evil criminals. Now, at the local level in States like Hawaii, we have passed legislation that bans sex trafficking and classifies it as a class A felony, but that is not enough. That is why I am so proud to be a cosponsor of the Trafficking Survivors Relief Act, because it creates this promise of freedom for those survivors from the shackles of their past. It establishes a process to vacate convictions and expunge arrests for those charged with criminal offenses related to human trafficking, finally putting survivors on a path to rehabilitation and healing rather than a life of continued exploitation and abuse. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues to get this legislation passed and actually enact this change so it helps those in our communities who need it the most. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Hawaii for her work on this. As you can tell, this is a bipartisan effort. When we took this legislation 2 years ago and brought it to the House, there were 11 bills that came to the House of Representatives, and they almost all passed unanimously. Then they were sent to the Senate, and the Senate combined them into two bills. The same over there, almost unanimous; and then back over to the House, and the final passage was almost unanimous once again. It is a bipartisan effort, and I thank the gentlewoman from Hawaii for her work on this and her service to our country. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. SMUCKER ). He is one of our newest, if not the newest, Members of Congress. He served in the Pennsylvania State Senate for a good number of years. Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I thank Judge POEfor the work that he is doing this evening to bring attention to a critical problem that desperately needs our attention and needs our solutions, that of human trafficking. The three largest international crime industries are drug trafficking, arms trafficking, and human trafficking. It is uncomfortable to talk about, but we can’t shy away from talking about the fact that in the world today, young boys and girls are being sold across the globe for an average price of $90. It is not just in remote parts of the globe. More than 14,000 people are trafficked into the United States each year. It is happening all across America, and in Lancaster, Berks, and Chester Counties, the district that I represent in Pennsylvania. b1900 Four out of five people trafficked in the world today are trafficked for sexual exploitation. Eighty percent are female and half are children. Antitrafficking groups gather in our churches, restaurants, and schools all across Pennsylvania and across the country. Those individuals, and the victims of trafficking, should know that they have allies in Congress. My office has been in contact with organizations in my district like Safe Berks, the Chester County AntiHuman Trafficking Coalition, and law enforcement officials to discuss ways that we can work together to help victims. I am also very pleased to cosponsor the bipartisan Trafficking Survivors Relief Act, introduced by my colleague ANNWAGNER , who was here with us this evening, from Missouri, a leader on this issue. Victims of trafficking are forced to commit crimes like prostitution, drug dealing, and money laundering. We cannot punish these victims for crimes committed because of coercion and under the threat of violence or death. We must ensure that we are doing all we can to help victims recover from these unthinkable experiences. This legislation will help to do that by providing more judicial discretion for victims to clear their names of any wrongdoing. I am proud to stand with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this legislation that helps end this barbaric practice. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for his comments, and now for his work on this issue of trafficking. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. YOHO), another Ted here in Congress. TEDYOHOis serving Florida’s Congressional District 3. He is vice chairman of the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee, and the chairman of U.S. House Asia and the Pacific Subcommittee. He has supported many bills on this issue of trafficking and has worked very hard in his home State of Florida to bring awareness to this. Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I thank Judge POEfor his tireless work on this issue. And I appreciate the leadership, and LLOYD SMUCKER . And as he has talked about, this is a bipartisan issue. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call attention to modernday slavery, because that is what this is, in the form of human trafficking. Most people believe human trafficking only occurs at home. It is a foreign crime that would never happen in our community, let alone their own backyard. To that I say: Let me tell you about human trafficking in rural America. I come from a district that is very rural. We had several summits on this issue. We talked to the local sheriffs and to the local police departments, and they said: Do you know what, we don’t have that problem here. We are okay. We invoked the help of the Department of Homeland Security, and they have got a great campaign called the Blue Campaign. We encouraged these officers to show up. And I am happy to say that most of the people that we talked to—the counties and the sheriffs—showed up. And it wasn’t more than about 2 weeks that I started getting calls from the sheriffs. And they said: Do you know what, that is happening right here. It is an awareness campaign. And Ms. GABBARD from Hawaii mentioned how underreported it is. Of course, it is, if 
people aren’t aware of it. But when you bring awareness through campaigns like the Department of Homeland Security’s Blue Campaign, people wake up to this issue. And I love their motto: If you see something, say something. Let people know this is going on. So let me tell you about our home community. In March of this year, a special needs student in Jacksonville, Florida, was kidnapped. Her captors placed her under house arrest, basically. They incarcerated her for human trafficking. They placed an advertisement online offering her sexual services, which is quite possibly the only reason the police were able to find her. These people were advertising on the internet. Also, in March of this year, 15 men were arrested in my hometown of Gainesville, Florida, on child solicitation charges. These men were discovered as part of an undercover operation that led them to believe they were communicating with young girls. The men believed the girls’ guardians were allowing them to commit sexual acts with underage girls. Only 2 months prior to this arrest, a Gainesville man was sentenced to 25 years in prison for sex trafficking an adult. A month prior to that, Polk County— another rural county—detectives arrested 114 suspects in a human trafficking and prostitution ring. At least four of them were immediately identified as human trafficking victims. And merely 3 months later, an additional 104 were picked up in a second sting for human trafficking, including those soliciting sex from minors. These are but a few examples of human traffickingrelated crimes that have occurred in my community in the last 6 months. Florida is estimated to have the third highest rate of human trafficking in the country, following only behind California and New York— third in the Nation. That is not something any State wants a designation for. All three of these States are ideal because of their access to ports and interstate highways, allowing victims to be transported across State lines easily. And it is estimated today—and I, again, sit on the Foreign Affairs Committee with Judge POE, and we have seen these numbers too often. It is estimated that 21 million people are trafficked around the world, resulting in an estimated $150 billion in profits— profits from the sale of a human individual that goes to the traffickers who are often drug smugglers or terrorist organizations. The 13th Amendment to our Constitution abolished slavery in this country. However, it still exists, and it is right in our own backyard. Because of this, we need to do all that we can to eradicate this. The runaway child is picked up within 48 hours and forced within the sex trade. This is something that, if you believe in the 13th Amendment, we all need to stand up, take an active role in this, and we do this by the legislation that is up. Mr. Speaker, I thank the Judge for being a strong advocate and always being there for this. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, how many minutes do I have remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 8 minutes remaining. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. MOORE ). She, like the women in Congress, who I have given a lot of credit for all of this trafficking legislation, is very concerned about victims of family and domestic violence. Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise as an original cosponsor of the Trafficking Survivors Relief Act of 2017, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this truly bipartisan piece of legislation. We have come a long way in this country in recognizing and acknowledging the problems of sex trafficking; and not just laying the blame at the seat of a socalled prostitute but understanding that this is a crime where the persons being trafficked, as you have heard my colleagues say, are imprisoned in sex trafficking. And why is it? You heard them talk about the $150 billion impact that this has. There is a huge incentive to sell these women over and over and over and over again. Because unlike drugs, you can resell these products of these victims again. Survivors of sex trafficking can’t just walk away. They are in prison. They endure violent beatings, brainwashing, sexual assault, psychological control, and control of their purses and their identification. But then they find themselves arrested and convicted for prostitution, labeled as sex offenders, and then just revictimized by a system that doesn’t understand that they were prisoners of this lucrative operation. These survivors face longterm negative consequences. They are denied access to employment, housing resources, and student financial aid that is needed to develop a sustainable safe and stable life. The Trafficking Survivors Relief Act offers survivors postconviction relief from criminal charges stemming from nonviolent offenses committed as a direct result of being a victim of human trafficking. Mr. Speaker, believe it or not, an estimated 300,000 children become victims of sex trafficking every year through fraud, force, and coercion. Many of them think, You know, I am going to be taken out to dinner by someone who loves me, and find themselves imprisoned at that very moment. Many of them are then arrested for these crimes that they are forced to commit. In my State of Wisconsin, 79 percent of human trafficking cases reported in Wisconsin occur in my district, I am ashamed to say. In the city of Milwaukee, last year, as an example, Mr. Speaker, two sisters, ages 16 and 17, were rescued during the FBI’s Operation Cross Country. They told an undercover Federal agent that their mother had forced them into prostitution. Had they been arrested, instead of recovered from their mother, who imprisoned them, would they have deserved to be branded for life with a criminal record? Imagine every time that they applied for housing or for financial aid or for a job, that they would be denied on the basis of their criminal record; and they were coerced into this act as minors by their own mother. Imagine the retraumatization and further devastation that repeated denial would have caused them. It just makes these people so vulnerable, and it deserves a legislative solution that we are proposing here today. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her strong comments. I know where she stands on the issue of victims of violence. Mr. Speaker, the 2year anniversary of the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act will be Monday. As a former judge and cochairman of the Victims’ Rights Caucus, with JIM COSTA from California, this is an important issue. I bet most Americans have never heard of the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act because it was passed with bipartisan support, overwhelming support. Things like this don’t make the news because we are not fussing and feuding between the two sides. But it is a very important piece of legislation for our country. It goes after the trafficker. It makes sure they get arrested, and they go to prison where they belong. It also goes after the buyer, the person who hides and tries to buy young children on the marketplace of sex slavery. But it rescues victims and turns them into survivors. That is why this legislation is important. The average age of a trafficking victim in the United States is 13. That means some are younger than 13. And it is a menace and a scourge that we, in the House of Representatives, along with our friends in the Senate, are going to make sure that the legislation is appropriate to solve this epidemic. That is why we are reminding individuals that we have this piece of legislation that is passed, and other pieces of legislation as well. The last thing I wanted to mention is part of the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act allows Federal judges to impose a fee on the trafficker or the buyer, and that money goes into a fund that helps victims of trafficking. That is a great idea. Make the criminals pay the rent on the courthouse by this type of restitution program. I want to thank all of the people who helped out tonight. There is a lot more to be said about the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act. We are going to continue to bring awareness of it to the American public. 
I can tell you one thing, though, traffickers and buyers know about this legislation. With the help of local and State and Federal law enforcement, we are going to stop this sale of our children and adult women here in the United States for money. And that is just the way it is. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, this week, as the House of Representatives considers human trafficking legislation, I am proud to continue working with colleagues from both sides of the aisle to raise awareness on the heinous practice of human trafficking and to work together to eradicate it from our communities. I thank my friend and classmate, Congresswoman ANNWAGNER of Missouri (MO–02) for organizing tonight’s Special Order Hour. Human trafficking—where people profit from the control and exploitation of others—occurs both here at home and abroad on a daily basis. In fact, the International Labour Organization estimates that there are 20.9 million victims of human trafficking globally—68% of them are trapped in forced labor, 26% of them are children, and 55% are women and girls. And in my home state of Ohio, human trafficking for sex and labor is on the rise. According to recent reports from the Polaris Project, a nonprofit that tracks trafficking in the U.S. and abroad, 375 Ohio trafficking cases were reported from 1,352 calls to the National Human Trafficking Hotline in 2016. In 2015, there were 289 cases based on 1,070 calls. The 2016 numbers reflect a nearly fourfold increase over the Ohio figures from 2013. While the overall increase in reporting can be partly attributed to greater awareness of the national hotline, we know, and officials confirm, that trafficking is, unfortunately, chronically underreported. We must do more to help trafficking victims and to encourage people when they see something that looks like an individual is being trafficked, that they say something. Victims of human trafficking often live in the shadows of our society, so it is up to all of us to help identify and rescue victims of trafficking. While human trafficking spans all demographics, there are some circumstances or vulnerabilities that lead to a higher susceptibility to victimization. Runaway and homeless youth, as well as victims of domestic violence or sexual assault, are frequently targeted by traffickers. Men and women, boys and girls, who are all alone, abused, and often believe they have nowhere to go. Well, we can help. We must do more to assist victims of trafficking and provide them with the services and treatment necessary to regain control of their lives. We must also ensure the investigation and prosecution of human trafficking crimes is focused on the traffickers, the people assisting the traffickers, and the purchasers—the individuals who are the real criminals in the enterprise. Almost two years ago, the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act—or the JVTA—was signed into law. The JVTA is helping to update efforts to combat the scourge of human trafficking and provided essential resources to survivors and law enforcement officials. I am proud to have had a provision included in this comprehensive legislation and to have taken part in its drafting, passage, and enactment. Mr. Speaker, since the JVTA’s enactment, we have witnessed important achievements, but we cannot stop here. We must continue to work together to eradicate human trafficking and support the victims. Tonight, I pledge to continue to working with my colleagues to raise awareness and fight back against human trafficking, because as we all know, one victim of human trafficking is one too many. f
