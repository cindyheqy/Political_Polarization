Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, today we honor Amy Kurland, founder of the Bluebird Cafe´, pioneer of ‘‘in the round’’ acoustic sessions, and gatekeeper to Nashville songwriters. Born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and transplanted to the midSouth, Ms. Kurland followed her instincts and in 1982 opened ‘‘the Ellis Island of Nashville’’—a cozy, 100seat venue for the unheard and unsigned songwriters in the heart of the music industry. Her intuition and influence pioneered a listening room template used worldwide and featured in books, movies, and television. Her solid reputation as an advocate and ‘‘den mother’’ of songwriters launched careers and collaborations. Her keen ability to recognize and execute opportunities enabled the Bluebird to sponsor nationwide tours, host charity benefits, and develop partnerships with travel destinations. A series of bold and audacious decisions have only escalated the venue’s visibility and success. After 25 years, Ms. Kurland entrusted the Bluebird Cafe´to the folks at Nashville Songwriters Association International and devoted her attention and expertise to philanthropic pursuits in education, leadership, social justice, and alcohol and drug recovery. We honor Amy Kurland with a SOURCE Award, recognizing her vital contribution to the success of Music Row and the Nashville entertainment industry. f 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, today we honor Martha Moore, multimarket media force, Nashville PR queen, and goto expert on independent public relations.

Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate John Schultz on his recent retirement after 44 years at UPS. John has been delivering packages to families, individuals, and businesses in Elkhart since 1973.

Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, today we honor Lula Clay Naff, America’s First Lady of theatre management, innovative booker and 35–year manager of the historic Ryman Auditorium. Born in 1875 in Fall Branch, Tennessee, Mrs. Naff almost singlehandedly elevated the Ryman as the mustsee, mustdo Nashville venue for musicians, speakers, and actors. She rose to prominence as a young, widowed mother, years before the 19th Amendment granted women the right to vote, let alone oversee a 2,360seat event space. Her remarkable decisionmaking skills and bold instincts shifted a religious setting to an entertainment destination. Her shrewd booking acumen filled pews with some of the biggest names in music, theatre and public speaking. She was a trailblazer for working women and a visionary for performance arts. As Mrs. Naff widened the Ryman’s roster, the venue grew in respect and prestige. The Grand Old Opry’s 31year run on the Ryman stage was her swansong and a showcase for her influence. She retired in 1955 at the age of 80 as Manager Emeritus, having elevated the Ryman through a halfcentury of diverse, cultural events. In 2015, the Ryman opened Cafe ´ Lula to commemorate Mrs. Naffs legacy and longevity in shaping one of Nashville’s greatest event destinations. We honor Lula Naff with a SOURCE Award, recognizing her vital contribution to the success of Music Row and the Nashville entertainment industry.
