Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Michael J. Keenan, who is retiring having served the interests of Arizona’s working men and women with distinction since the mid- 1970s. Upon graduating from the University of Ari-zona, Mike attended Georgetown Law School. Not forgetting his working class roots or union family heritage, Mike returned to Arizona to join the union-side law firm then known as Ward and Contreras. Through the years, Mike provided wise counsel to Arizona unions, ena-bling them to defend the rights of the Arizona workers to fair wages and safe working condi-tions. He also has represented well various trust funds which provide health insurance and retirement benefits for Arizona union mem-bers. By advancing the interests and protecting the dignity of Arizona union members—often during challenging times—Mike earned a rep-utation as not only a zealous and highly effec-tive advocate, but also as a highly ethical law-yer. Through his hard work and dedication, Mike immeasurably improved the lives of Ari-zona working men and women. It is now time for Mike to enjoy a long retire-ment with his wife, Becky, his sons Jimmy and Joey, his daughter Katie and his grand-daughter Avery. On behalf of our great state’s workers, I thank him and wish him all the best.

RECOGNIZING THE 27TH ANNIVER-SARY OF ‘‘BLACK JANUARY’’ 
HON. STEVE COHEN 
OF TENNESSEE  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, January 20, 2017 Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 27th anniversary of ‘‘Black Jan-uary’’ in Azerbaijan, a day that commemorates Azerbaijan’s stand against Soviet soldiers for independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity over all lands under Azerbaijani jurisdiction, and freedom from communism and dictator-ship. On the evening of January 19, 1990, the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet Presidium backed by then-President Mikhail Gorbachev declared a state of emergency in response to the grow-ing national independence movement in Azer-baijan. In response to the Azeri people’s stand against Soviet aggression, Soviet troops stormed the Azerbaijani capital city of Baku and indiscriminately fired on peaceful dem-onstrators, including women and children. That night, more than 130 people died with over 700 injured, 841 arrested and five going miss-ing. While Soviet invaders attacked peaceful protestors, they also targeted critical infra-structure and workers. According to a report by Human Rights Watch entitled Black Janu-ary in Azerbaijan, ‘‘among the most heinous violations of human rights during the Baku in-cursion were the numerous attacks on medical personnel, ambulances and even hospitals.’’ Additionally, the Soviet attack served as an act of intimidation for all then-Soviet countries with independence ambitions. The Human Rights Watch report concluded that, ‘‘indeed the violence used by the Soviet Army on the night of January 19–20 constitutes an exercise in collective punishment. The punishment in-flicted on Baku by Soviet soldiers may have been intended as a warning to nationalists, not only in Azerbaijan, but in other Republics of the Soviet Union.’’ Azerbaijani citizens, however, refused to succumb to Soviet aggression. Instead, the in-vasion gave new life to their nationalism and fight for true independence. In the days after the invasion, thousands of Azerbaijanis sur-rounded Communist Party headquarters de-manding the resignation of the republic’s lead-ership, the Baku City Council demanded that Soviet troops withdraw from Azeri territories and the legislature in Azerbaijan threatened to call a referendum on secession unless Soviet troops were withdrawn within 48 hours. Soviet troops eventually withdrew and Janu-ary 20th became known as ‘‘the Day of the Nationwide Sorrow.’’ It would not be for nearly two years, however, before Azerbaijan gained political control from the Soviet Union. In Octo-ber 1991, Azerbaijan’s parliament—the Na-tional Assembly—declared its independence. While Azerbaijan still faces challenges from its neighbors, today, Azerbaijan has developed into a thriving country with double-digit growth, in large part due to a freely elected president and parliament, and free market reforms led by the energy sector that helps support energy security in Israel and Europe. I ask my col-leagues to join me in recognizing the tragic events of Black January that precipitated the independent Republic of Azerbaijan and the fall of the USSR.

TRIBUTE TO FRANK TAYLOR 
HON. PETER T. KING 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, January 20, 2017 Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an extraordinary public servant and a dedicated leader of the U.S. In-telligence Community (IC), Brigadier General (Retired) Francis Xavier Taylor, the Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis at the Department of Homeland Security. Brig Gen Taylor came out of retirement in 2014 when the President nominated him to be the Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis (I&A) at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). After nearly 40 years of honorable service to our nation, Under Secretary Taylor will retire again on Friday, January 20, 2017. Under Secretary Taylor applied his knowl-edge and experience from his 31 years in the United States Air Force, his service at the U.S. Department of State as an Ambassador for Counterterrorism and head of Diplomatic

Security, and as Vice President of Security at General Electric. Applying his decades of ex-perience and innovative thinking, Under Sec-retary Taylor rolled up his sleeves and got to work. Due to Under Secretary Taylor’s leadership, I&A is much further along on its vision of driv-ing information sharing and delivering intel-ligence and analysis to operators and deci-sion-makers at all levels. One of Under Sec-retary Taylor’s first actions at I&A was to guide the organization through a transformation. He removed internal I&A stovepipes and realigned the organization to ensure DHS-collected in-formation now forms the basis of the majority of I&A production. Under Secretary Taylor also ordered that finished intelligence include State and local data. Under Secretary Taylor also worked tire-lessly to mature and strengthen the Depart-ment’s relationship with the state and local fu-sion centers and make information sharing a priority. In FY2016, 62 percent of I&A’s fin-ished intelligence products were disseminated at the SECRET level or below to best serve those who protect our borders, critical infra-structure and communities. Under Secretary Taylor also took to heart the need to invest in the workforce and ad-dress extremely low employee morale. He spent a great deal of his tenure fine-tuning the organization, restructuring and rebalancing the workforce. He drastically reduced the ratio of supervisors to workers, reducing the amount of bloated management and replacing it with what he called ‘‘seed corn’’—young, junior people brought in to rejuvenate the organiza-tion and help develop a truly homeland-fo-cused workforce. Our Nation owes this public servant a tre-mendous debt of gratitude. I wish to thank Under Secretary Taylor for his decades of ex-ceptional service to our country and to wish him and his wife Connie the very best in the days and years ahead. Under Secretary Tay-lor can now enjoy his three grandchildren Ava, Aaron and Alexander, while taking in some more games under the Golden Dome at Notre Dame.
