Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, in recognition of International Women’s Day, I would like to acknowledge the efforts of two women from Cincinnati. Long ago, Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote ‘‘Uncle Tom’s Cabin’’ in Cincinnati. When she later met Abraham Lincoln in the White House, he reportedly said: ‘‘So you are the little woman who wrote the book that started this great war.’’ More recently, Elina Govil, a high school student from Indian Hill, is fighting to provide atrisk girls in conflict zones with access to a proper education. To assist Elina in her efforts, as a senior member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, I introduced the Protecting Girls’ Access to Education Act, bipartisan legislation that could help millions of young girls across the globe. Children who are denied an education, because they live in an area that is torn by chaos and war, have little chance of ever attaining a stable existence. Girls, in particular, are subject to exploitation and the pitfalls of human trafficking, violence, and poverty. Thank you, Elina, for helping girls everywhere to have the opportunity to reach their fullest potential. f 
INTERNATIONAL WOMEN’S DAY (Mr. CAPUANO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. CAPUANO. Mr. Speaker, I, too, am here to recognize International Women’s Day. We all know that women have made some progress over the years: the Family and Medical Leave Act, the Lilly Ledbetter Equal Pay Act. We have made progress, but we know there is more to do. This Congress and this President have to improve the Family and Medical Leave Act. We have to make sure the laws that we have are enforced, equal pay is made, and equal actions happen in the workplace. We are not doing it, and we all know that. And the truth is—when I am home— I tell people, when you look to Congress to lead, it is always a mistake. Most of the progress in this country comes from the bottom up. We are almost always last. I will give you an example. Years ago, George Bush vetoed the Family and Medical Leave Act four times. I was the mayor of my city, we did it on our own. The Federal Government didn’t make us do it, and the State didn’t make us do it. So I am here today to simply ask all Americans, at every level, to do what you can to equalize opportunity and treatment in this world. We don’t have to wait for our government. There are people like me, ROSA DELAURO , and others who are going to continue to push, and we will make progress. But we all have our own individual responsibilities, and I call on all Americans to do that. 
REMEMBERING TOM BERNS (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise, today, to remember Tom Berns, a friend and respected community leader, who passed away last month. After graduating college, Tom established the firm Berns, Clancy and Associates, which has grown into one of today’s premier engineering firms in the area. Over the course of his career, Tom was considered by many to be an expert in civil engineering. He found great joy in his profession and shared it with others through teaching. However, Tom is, perhaps, most known for his impact on the community. He was a member of over a dozen clubs, boards, and civic organizations, many of which he served as president or chairman. He served as village engineer for five different central Illinois towns throughout his lifetime and was also actively involved in his congregation, St. Patrick’s Roman Catholic Church, for over 50 years. In 2000, Tom became a Member of the Illinois House of Representatives, where he represented Illinois’ 104th House District. Tom knew what it meant to serve. He lived his life in a way that put others before himself, always looking for ways to help, to get involved, and to improve his community. I am inspired by the legacy of Tom Berns and the numerous lives he touched throughout central Illinois. I pray for his wife, Jeannie, and their family during this difficult time. 
HONORING DORIS A. DAVIS (Ms. BARRAGA´N asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. BARRAGA´N. Mr. Speaker, on this International Women’s Day, I rise to honor the life of the Honorable Doris A. Davis, who passed away last month, after providing decades of public service to the city of Compton. After serving as Compton’s first AfricanAmerican city clerk, Ms. Davis then went on to become the first AfricanAmerican mayor of a major metropolitan city in the country. During her time in office, Mayor Davis worked tirelessly to increase tax revenues and job opportunities in Compton. Upon leaving office, she founded the Daisy Child Development Centers, a nonprofit organization that provided assistance to single parents and families in and around Compton. Mayor Davis was always an active participant in our community—belonging to over two dozen organizations, including the NAACP, the Urban League, and the League of Women Voters—and her legacy of public service will live on. ESTABLISH A UNIFORM RULE OF NATURALIZATION (Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, this morning, I wish to commend Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the Trump administration for finally taking action against California’s lawlessness on sanctuary cities and immigration practices. California is clearly violating Federal immigration laws. States don’t get to dictate to the Federal Government when and where these laws are enforced. California needs to be held accountable for their willful defiance of Federal immigration law and its sanctuary State insurrection. Several laws have been passed by the Federal Government over the years on immigration. Actually enforcing a law on the books, arresting and deporting illegal immigrants shouldn’t be shocking. The Supreme Court has held that immigration regulation was a Federal responsibility exclusively in 1876. Under the Obama administration, Arizona, in order to try to fix the immigration problem in this country, passed a bill called S.B. 1070, but the Supreme Court ruled that they couldn’t enforce the border themselves. Now we have California going the other direction, trying to cause no enforcement to be done on immigration in our State. The Federal Government is ruling and working to overcome that as well. So I commend Attorney General Sessions for taking action on California’s lawlessness. 
HONORING DR. GEORGE NIELD (Mr. BRIDENSTINE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BRIDENSTINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my friend, Dr. George Nield, on the occasion of his retirement as the FAA Associate Administrator for Commercial Space Transportation. Dr. Nield has been a tireless advocate for a commercial space industry that is more robust than ever and has been a great partner for those of us on the Hill who have worked to create an environment where the commercial space industry can thrive. Dr. Nield is a graduate of the United States Air Force Academy, and his time in the Air Force included assignments as an engineer at the Space and Missile Systems Center and Air Force Test Center, and as an assistant professor at the Air Force Academy. He later held many roles at NASA, managing the Flight Integration Office for the Space Shuttle program, and later working on the International Space Station program. Prior to coming to the FAA, Dr. Nield was a senior scientist in the advance programs group of Orbital Sciences Corporation, now Orbital ATK. George Nield has long understood the important role space plays in our country and dedicated his career to ensuring that the United States is the world’s preeminent spacefaring nation. For the past 10 years, he has devoted himself to an industry that helps the United States Government complete its missions, grow our economy, and improve the quality of life for all Americans and those around the world. Our country is losing an important advocate for space. I wish him well in his retirement. f 
SENSE ACT WILL HELP RESTORE PENNSYLVANIA LANDS (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Satisfying Energy Needs and Saving the Environment Act, also called the SENSE Act. The SENSE Act will have a tremendous impact on the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Decades of historic mining has left behind piles of coal refuse or waste coal, which is essentially a worthless material, but its presence has led to environmental degradation in many cases. Today, the coal refusetoenergy industry uses waste coal to generate affordable energy. This means hundreds of goodpaying jobs and remediated waste coal piles across the Commonwealth. Pennsylvania is home to 14 of the 19 coal refusetoenergy plants in the United States. And we have already seen enormous environmental and economic benefits thanks to this industry. We are keeping Pennsylvanians employed and working to restore our beautiful streams and countryside. Mr. Speaker, onesizefitsall government regulations do not work. The SENSE Act crafts responsibly tailored regulations to address the application of an EPA rule for electric generating units that utilize coal refuse to generate electricity and serve critical environmental cleanup and remediation purposes. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense legislation. 
SATISFYING ENERGY NEEDS AND SAVING THE ENVIRONMENT ACT Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 762, I call up the bill (H.R. 1119) to establish the bases by which the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall issue, implement, and enforce certain emission limitations and allocations for existing electric utility steam generating units that convert coal refuse into energy, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois). Pursuant to House Resolution 762, the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the Committee on Energy and Commerce, printed in the bill, shall be considered as adopted, and the bill, as amended, shall be considered read. The text of the bill, as amended, is as follows: 
H.R. 1119 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Satisfying Energy Needs and Saving the Environment Act’’ or the ‘‘SENSE Act’’.

(B) MEASUREMENT .—An emission standard described in subparagraph (A) shall be measured as a 30 boiler operating day rolling average per coal refuse electric utility steam generating unit or group of coal refuse electric utility steam generating units located at a single coal refusefired facility. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill, as amended, shall be debatable for 1 hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce. The gentleman from Illinois (Mr. SHIMKUS ) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. TONKO ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous material on H.R. 1119. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Illinois? There was no objection. Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, coalfired electric generation has been the subject of many costly regulations, and we are already seeing an economic impact on conventional coal facilities. But, today, we are focusing on a relatively small number of very unconventional facilities that take environmentally damaging waste coal, burn it to produce electricity, and then use the resulting ash to remediate the land. The more you learn about H.R. 1119, the Satisfying Energy Needs and Saving the Environment, the SENSE, Act, the more you will agree that these facilities are worth saving, which is what this bill does. I thank my colleague, KEITH ROTHFUS from Pennsylvania, for sponsoring this innovative measure, and I urge all of my colleagues to support it. Decades of coal mining in Pennsylvania, and other States, have led to a legacy of massive piles of waste coal that contributes to water and air pollution in communities where they are located. b0915 The cost of eliminating this waste coal has been estimated at $2 billion for Pennsylvania alone, so absent a massive new program, it almost certainly won’t get done. Fortunately, coal refusetoenergy plants have been developed and built in several communities with waste coal. These plants burn waste coal to produce electricity, and the resulting ash is then used to remediate the land. Thus far, these plants have eliminated 214 million tons of waste coal and restored thousands of acres and 1,200 miles of rivers and streams. The electricity and the jobs created by these plants are really just a bonus compared to the tremendous environmental benefits; nonetheless, coal refusetoenergy plants are now under threat. Although these plants utilize a specialized process, EPA has decided to treat them no differently than conventional coalfired power plants. As a result, the Agency has jeopardized the continued operation of these facilities by setting standards that are not appropriate for them. The SENSE Act addresses the problem by providing an alternative compliance mechanism for the compounds regulated under the Mercury and Air Toxic Standards, which is commonly known as the MATS. The bill still requires stringent emission reductions at these waste coaltoenergy plants, but ones that are achievable at these facilities. I should note that earlier versions of the SENSE Act also included changes to the CrossState Air Pollution Rule, or CSAPR, but those provisions have been taken out of the version we are voting on today. The result of this bill would be that these coal refusetoenergy plants can continue operating, which would be a big win for the environment as well as for jobs in the communities in Pennsylvania and other States where they are located. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1119, the Satisfying Energy Needs and Saving the Environment, or SENSE, Act. The SENSE Act continues the theme of the floor this week, giving unnecessary preferences to a handful of special interests at the expense of clean air and people’s health. The SENSE Act would weaken requirements of EPA’s Mercury and Air Toxic Standards, or MATS, for power plants that burn waste coal by enabling a weaker compliance option for hydrochloric acid and sulfur dioxide 
emissions. To make matters worse, the bill prevents EPA from strengthening these standards for waste coal pants in the future even if pollution control technologies become significantly better or less expensive. I think we are all proud of the record of the Clean Air Act. As a nation, we have made significant progress since the 1970s, reducing air pollution while growing our economy. This bill is against the spirit of the Clean Air Act and the bipartisan amendments that have followed. We should not lock in an insufficient standard when progress is still possible. Polluters should be pushed to do better, especially when comparable facilities are meeting those given standards; but instead, these power plant owners would prefer to get special treatment and a pathway for meeting the weaker standards for many, many years to come. All the while, these plants will produce harmful air pollution. This is not only dangerous but unnecessary. The health risks of these pollutants are well documented, and it is, in fact, possible for waste coal plants to meet EPA’s MATS. A number of waste coal units have achieved the standards, and pollution control technologies exist that would enable noncompliant facilities to meet them, too. EPA’s MATS have already been examined by the courts, which would not grant an exclusion for waste coal utilities. The courts did not agree with waste coal plant owners that these standards were impossible to meet. EPA established that 8 out of 19 waste coal units nationwide could meet the rules’ acid gas standard or alternative sulfur dioxide standard already. So now those companies are coming to Congress to circumvent the court process. Last year, every Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee opposed this bill. Those members understood that this bill is simply not fair. It picks winners and losers in States with waste coal plants, it disadvantages traditional coalfired power generators, and it will allow for more hazardous air pollution. That isn’t a good deal for the power generators that are already compliant with the standards, and it is a terrible deal for the people who have to live with more dangerous air pollution. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to vote ‘‘no’’ on the SENSE Act, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. ROTHFUS ), the author of this legislation. Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman SHIMKUS for leading and his help with this important legislation. This is going to be an interesting debate. This is a debate about one size fits all coming out of Washington, D.C., and the failure of folks in this town at regulatory agencies to not appreciate the nuance of what is going on in the rest of the country. I have been on these waste coal piles of western Pennsylvania. I have seen streams that are dead. I have seen hillsides scarred. I have seen restoration. I have seen streams come back to life. I have seen hillsides come back to life. This Satisfying Energy Needs and Saving the Environment, SENSE, Act, makes sense for those who live outside the Capital Beltway. The SENSE Act is a vitally important effort that I have championed in various forms throughout my time in Congress. The bill recognizes the huge success that the coal refusetoenergy industry is making in Pennsylvania, and especially my district, to make it a healthier and cleaner place to live. Without the SENSE Act, five coal refusetoenergy facilities in western Pennsylvania and West Virginia will close, and their environmental remediation efforts will end. Despite what the bill’s opponents say, the SENSE Act is, first and foremost, a proenvironment bill, but it is also a projobs bill, a prounion jobs bill, because it is union workers who are going to be thrown out of work when these plants close. And it is a protaxpayer bill because the environment is being cleaned up without a contribution from the taxpayers. The coal industry has a long and storied history in Pennsylvania. Not only has it been an important part of the economy for generations, but Pennsylvania coal helped the U.S. and our allies win two world wars. Historic mining activity, unfortunately, left behind large piles of coal refuse. These piles consist of lower quality coal mixed with rock and dirt. For a long time, we did not have the technology to use this material, so it accumulated in large piles outside of cities and towns, close to schools, neighborhoods, and in fields across coal country. This has led to many environmental problems that diminished the quality of life for people in these areas surrounded by these piles. Vegetation and wildlife have been harmed, the air has been polluted, and acid mine drainage has impaired nearby rivers and streams. I have seen these sites firsthand, as I said, and the environmental danger they pose. Coal refuse piles can catch fire. Think about that. They can catch fire with no limitations at all. It is an unmitigated disaster when these things catch fire—uncontrolled air pollution. Many are already smoldering, giving off toxic emissions, again, without any controls whatsoever. Runoff from these sites literally turn rivers orange, leaving them devoid of life. The cost to clean up all of this is astronomical. Pennsylvania’s environmental regulator estimates that fixing abandoned mine lands could cost over $16 billion, over $2 billion of which would be needed for coal refuse piles alone. We needed an innovative solution to this tough challenge, a commonsense compromise. This was necessary to get the job done and to protect the environment. That is where the coal refuse toenergy industry comes in. Using advanced technology, this industry has been able to use previously worthless material to generate electricity. This activity is what powers remediation efforts and has successfully removed over 200 million tons of coal refuse, reclaiming polluted sites across Pennsylvania and other historic coal regions. Thanks to the hard work of the dedicated people in this industry—again, many union workers in this industry— landscapes have been restored, rivers and streams have been brought back to life, and many towns have been relieved of hazardous waste coal piles. Here is an example of what this industry has been able to do. Here you have an abandoned waste coal pile, but through the restoration efforts, the countryside has been reclaimed. This is a picture of success done without taxpayer money, improving the environment. I want to highlight again private sector leadership on this issue that has saved taxpayers millions of dollars in cleanup costs; and if the SENSE Act becomes law, taxpayers will continue to save millions. I should also note that the wasteto energy industry pays millions in tax dollars, too, something that my colleagues should be mindful of, because many of the plants in these areas are areas where there is still a struggle economically. Multiple groups have previously endorsed the SENSE Act, including Pennsylvania’s abandoned mine reclamation groups and clean water advocates. Unfortunately, intensifying and, importantly, inflexible EPA regulations threaten five plants in western Pennsylvania and West Virginia. This would leave hundreds of millions of dollars of vital cleanup unfinished, lead to job losses, and leave many localities exposed to the harmful conditions waste coal piles pose. Mr. Speaker, we are talking a handful—a handful—of plants. The sky is falling. The catastrophic scenario the opponents of this legislation are arguing about, they don’t appreciate the nuance of what we are trying to do here. The SENSE Act, as it has been amended, addresses a significant challenge arising from the implementation of the existing rules, including those under the Mercury and Air Toxic Standards. Importantly, these plants comply with mercury emission standards. There is an issue with how they deal with HCL, hydrogen chloride, and sulfur dioxide, SO2. This is a targeted piece of legislation, a customization, as it were, to recognize the important and vital work that this industry has been doing. Contrary to what critics allege, the SENSE 
Act simply provides operators with additional alternative MATS compliance standards, but it is still strict and it is still achievable. Despite opponents’ claims, this bill is not a sweetheart deal for the coal refusetoenergy industry. This bill only prevents a few plants from being regulated out of existence. This industry represents a tiny fraction of the energy industry, but it provides enormous environmental benefits. Again, this legislation brings a stark contrast to the difference between elites in this town and what is out there in flyover country, that you cannot even go in and see the specific issue and that you have to apply this one size fits all because you are operating from some ideological framework. It is really unfortunate, because it is the environment that is going to hurt; it is jobs that are going to be lost. The industry works with the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection to identify especially dangerous piles and prioritize remediation. Mr. Speaker, the amended version of this bill accurately reflects the spirit of previous SENSE Act versions, and I thank my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee for their work on it. It is my hope that we can continue to build support for this bill, especially in the Senate, where Senators TOOMEY  and CASEY , Republican and Democrat, have previously offered a bipartisan amendment relating to it in the past. Despite that prior bipartisan Senate support, previous efforts have failed to achieve the supermajority necessary to pass, but I am hopeful that the SENSE Act can win enough support to pass both Chambers. What we are looking to achieve today is this: a narrow and limited addition to existing rules for a very small but proenvironment industry. This should not be a controversial or partisan issue. We want to hold this industry to high standards, but to standards they can actually reach. But for the EPA emission extension that expires in 2019, current regulations discount the environmental remediation benefits this industry provides. b0930 My bill will help keep the coal refuse industry in business so that local communities, economies, and the environment will continue to reap the benefits. The people who live near coal refuse piles and all of the communities downstream of these hazards expect us to find a solution. Many workers at the endangered power plants, folks throughout the supply chain, and their families, are counting on us to protect their livelihoods. We owe it to them to pass the SENSE Act, including people like Bill Turner. Bill is a shift supervisor at the Colver refuse facility in Cambria County. He has worked at Colver for over two decades. He has also lived close to coal refuse piles. Bill and his colleagues at Colver are proud of the reclamation work they do. He has put three kids through college thanks to his job. I know I have said this before, but his children even played soccer on a field reclaimed from a coal refuse pile because of this industry. Bill said it would be a travesty if the coal waste toenergy industry disappeared. Another industry worker is Dennis Simmers. He is an engineer at Colver. For him, this issue is personal. He said three generations of his family lived in the shadow of a large coal refuse pile. Unfortunately, his relatives died without ever seeing this environmental catastrophe corrected. He said: ‘‘There is a real shot now that I will see it in my lifetime.’’ Finally, I would like to recognize Vince Brisini, who testified at the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee hearing last fall. Vince not only worked for the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, but he also lives next to a waste coal pile. Like Bill and Dennis, he has devoted so much of his time and energy, both professionally and personally, to solving this problem. Madam Speaker, we owe it to the environment to keep these five endangered plants open. We owe it to people like Dennis and Bill and Vince to see if we can solve the waste coal problem during this generation. The SENSE Act will help ensure that that remains a probability. I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense, proenvironment bill. Mr. TONKO. Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. MICHAEL F. D OYLE ), a longtime member of the Energy and Commerce Committee and a thoughtful and passionate voice for the greater Pittsburgh area, and for that matter, all of Pennsylvania and our Nation. Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the SENSE Act. This bill is an unnecessary and permanent carveout for waste coal plants that forfeits scientific and industrial progress. Waste coal plants may be unfamiliar to many of my colleagues here in Congress because the vast majority of them are located in my State, Pennsylvania. These plants take waste coal left over from mining anytime before the late 1970s and use it as fuel. You see, these areas were mined before laws required reclamation or remediation of mine damage. I would just like to remind my colleagues who rail against government regulation all of the time, that the reason we have this environmental catastrophe is because there were no regulations before the late 1970s. This is what happens when we have industry, no government regulations, we get environmental catastrophes and now we are left to clean up the mess. These piles of waste coal have sat covering hundreds of thousands of acres in my home State of Pennsylvania for decades because there was no regulation. Many don’t realize, Pennsylvania has produced more coal than any other State. Our mines powered the country while our steel mills built it into the world’s greater industrial nation, the arsenal of democracy through two world wars. But now my home State remains saddled with the leftovers, the legacy of nearly 200 years of unregulated mining. These piles can directly affect people’s health, their communities, and their environment. These abandoned sites can contaminate local water sources with harmful runoff, or combust and release toxins into the air at eye level. Now, I have seen mining sites reclaimed because of these plants, and the turnaround is remarkable. Over decades of operating, they have cleaned up about 4 to 6 percent of the total affected lands across our State, and they have dramatically improved the land at those sites. They are an important but minor accessory to the use of abandoned mine land reclamation funds. Let me provide some context to that. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection estimates that, using abandoned mine land reclamation funds, the State and outside organizations have reclaimed 70,000 acres in my home State. The most recent industry estimate I have seen on waste coal plants reclaims approximately 200 acres a year. Now, let’s hear the arguments in favor of this bill. Waste coal plants help facilitate remediation of abandoned mine sites. Some plants say they are having a hard time meeting clean air standards, so let’s loosen those standards forever. But my problem is, we know plants can meet these Clean Air Act protections. Many already are. The scientists at EPA have determined this, and the Federal courts have upheld the EPA’s ruling. In fact, the largest plant in Pennsylvania can meet the standards that this bill undermines. I understand it can be difficult to upgrade emission controls technologies in current market conditions. I understand that, with the many issues that are at the nexus of the energy versus environment debate when one side wins and the other side loses. But coal refuse plants present us with an exciting opportunity to have a true winwin. This bill does not. This bill says, let’s sacrifice our air quality and the air quality of States downwind, and let’s give these plants a pass. Let’s sacrifice progress for a few companies’ convenience, and let’s stick it to those companies that have already invested in upgrading their plants, and let’s do this forever. I believe the environmental issues and the energy challenges our country and the planet face will be solved through technological progress and innovation, through scientific advancement and thoughtful policy. For that reason, I oppose this bill. 
Let me be clear. Pennsylvania has inherited and shoulders a debt, the collective legacy from our Nation’s unregulated industrial past. This debt is levied on our land, our children, and our communities. We need help, and we deserve help, to continue righting this wrong. That requires strong environmental stewardship, increased abandoned mine land reclamation funds. The RECLAIM Act would provide greater R&D into making fossil fuels cleaner, and the list goes on. I want to applaud my colleague on the other side of the aisle for highlighting the importance of this issue. This legislation, however, is not the answer. It is still not the answer, and I urge my colleagues to vote against it so that we can try a different, smarter approach. I think we can make great progress on this issue in the coming months. I would welcome cooperation and input from colleagues on both sides of the aisle in doing so. Let’s do this the smart way, the right way. Let’s not penalize companies that are spending the money to comply, by helping a few companies that claim they don’t want to. Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume before I yield to Mr. ROTHFUS  just to get things straight here. Let’s see. We can remediate environmental hazards by private sector dollars. I think that is good, saving the AML for other sites that can’t use private sector dollars. We have a revenue stream to pay for that remediation. We have goodpaying jobs and, as my colleague said, union jobs. I am from a coalproducing State everyone knows, deep southern Illinois. We have a local tax base to protect. Again, it protects the abandoned mine funds. When I was a young boy, I had a motorbike, and one of the places to ride which kind of scared me—I did it a couple of times—was on what we would call a slag hill. What is a slag hill? A slag hill is an abandoned mine refuse pile. So many of us have lived in and around these sites. This opportunity to take this and turn it into this, without taxpayer dollars, is a win. And the gentleman stole my line. The SENSE Act does make sense for jobs, for a tax base, for remediation, both in land and water, and protecting the abandoned mine funds to go to those sites that don’t have a reclamation facility that can produce power and put it on the grid. So I am pleased to be down here and fighting with my colleague, Congressman ROTHFUS . Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. ROTHFUS ). Mr. ROTHFUS. Madam Speaker, I would like to make a couple of points here. Without this relief, the plants are going to close. This is not a broad based industry carveout. This is for a subset of plants. When you look at the economics of running a plant, you are looking at income, you are looking at cost. The fact is, we are seeking a nuanced approach to recognize the environmental benefit that these plants have provided, the hundreds of jobs, familysustaining jobs that are at stake. It is just frustrating to hear my colleagues just insist on this onesizefitsall, seemingly we are incapable of appreciating a nuance. We don’t rail against regulation. We rail against overregulation. Regulation is important. It is necessary. It should be responsible. It should be prudent. It should meet a costbenefit analysis. I talked about right regulation, not deregulation; right regulation. You pick the regulation to fit the circumstance that you are in. A picture paints a thousand words. That paints a thousand words right there, and the EPA has even recognized the benefit of this industry here. A quote from the EPA: ‘‘Coal refuse piles are an environmental concern because of acid seepage and leachate production, spontaneous combustion, and low soil fertility. Units that burn coal refuse provide multimedia environmental benefits. . . . ’’ Let me say that again. The EPA said: ‘‘Units that burn coal refuse provide multimedia environmental benefits by combining the production of energy with the removal of coal refuse piles and by reclaiming land for productive use. Consequently, because of the unique environmental benefits that coal refusefired EGUs provide, these units warrant special consideration....  ’ ’  Let me say that again. The EPA said: ‘‘These units warrant special consideration,’’ because of the unique environmental benefits they provide. That is what the SENSE Act is about. Up in Cambria County, where they have a number of these piles, there are streams that flow into the Conemaugh River, that flows into the Kiskiminetas River, that flows into the Allegheny River, that flows into the Ohio River. This industry is cleaning up those tributaries, preventing acid seepage into the Conemaugh, into the Kiskiminetas, into the Allegheny, and the Ohio. This bill makes sense, and I would urge my colleagues to seriously consider it because this is an area where people can come up out of their trenches and find common ground, something that makes common sense, reaches common sense. It is proenvironment. The sky is not falling, as some of the opponents might say. And it saves jobs and union jobs. Mr. TONKO. Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. M ICHAEL F. D OYLE ). Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, let me just say to my friend—and he is my friend— that none of us have a problem with these plants. They are providing an important service. The largest one in our State is complying. What I don’t understand is, when the majority of these plants can comply and are in the process of complying, why do you want to pass a law that would exempt them from having to do that? b0945 It seems that when we have this debate, we only define ‘‘burden’’ as one way. When I hear my colleagues talk about the burden, it sort of has a singular dimension: money, dollars and cents on a business, on an individual, on a taxpayer. What about the burden of lower air quality? Is it not burdensome to the health of our students, the elderly, folks with asthma to breathe in higher levels of particulate matter? What about those folks? When we have an opportunity and we have the technology to have these plants continue to remediate sites, but to do so in a more environmentally friendly way, why would we not want to do that, especially when there are only 14 of these sites in Pennsylvania, and the majority of them are in the process of complying or are complying? You know, this bill is the same bill you brought here last year that didn’t pass the Senate. This bill is not going to become law either. I would just encourage my friend to sit down with members of the Democratic Party, sit down with these stakeholders, and let’s work on a solution that is futuristic, not one that takes us back to the past. Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. The EPA quote that Congressman ROTHFUS mentioned about they should deserve special consideration was not this EPA. In fact, it was authored by, in 2011, an EPA under the Obama administration, and the Administrator at that time was Lisa Jackson. So we are not, in today’s world, saying these plants should have special considerations. We are in the last administration’s world. And we just believe that that is correct. We believe that we have got to consider the benefits, and the benefits are remediation of these slag mounds, restoration of land, sometimes for recreational activities, protecting our water supply. Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. ROTHFUS ), author of the bill. Mr. ROTHFUS. Madam Speaker, I want to talk about some burdens, burdens like uncontrolled release of toxins into the air when these piles catch fire, uncontrolled seepage into rivers. This subset of plants, my colleague from Pennsylvania makes the point about some of these plants are in compliance. There is such a thing as economies of scale. And when any business is in operation, you are looking at costs 
and expenses. You are looking at revenue. And when the costs and expenses exceed the revenue, you go out of business. Unless we are able to do a customization for these handful of plants, they will close. Hundreds of people will lose their jobs. The cleanup they are doing will stop. While some other plants may continue to operate and continue the good work, that is great, but it is going to go at a slower pace. It is going to cost taxpayers more because less will be cleaned up. This industry, so far, has cleaned up 200 million tons of waste coal in Pennsylvania, and that is just the start of the work that needs to be done. My hope is that it is all going to be cleaned up in our lifetimes. So, no, this isn’t forever. This isn’t forever. This, again, is taking a look at a situation we have in Pennsylvania, that we want to recognize the good work that is going on there and, again, when you look at the EPA under the Obama administration, talking of the unique environmental benefits that these plants provide and that they warrant special consideration. Again, I just urge my colleagues to come up. Let’s get out of our trenches. Let’s take a look, meeting, you know, in the middle here. Support this legislation. Save these jobs. Save these union jobs. Let these plants stay open, and let’s continue to clean up western Pennsylvania. Mr. TONKO. Madam Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. MICHAEL F. D OYLE ). Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, let me just say to my friend that at the rate of 200 acres a year, it will be well into the year 3000 before we reclaim all these sites. So when I say, ‘‘forever,’’ there is not going to be any of us sitting here today around to see it, nor will our children, nor will our grandchildren, at that rate. And, by the way, the quote you give from the EPA regarding that was under a different rule, not the rule that we are talking about. This boils down to companies that are already spending the money and complying. Where is the fairness to those companies, their bottom line, their workers, when they are complying with this rule? And then you want, literally, a handful of companies not to comply? And when you talk about customizing a solution, what you are talking about is no rules. I mean, you are basically saying they don’t have to comply with anything. So the answer to these 19 plants that operate in the entire United States, of which better than half are in the process or already complying, is to tell the ones that aren’t complying there are no rules. Every year, our technology gets better. Every year, technology gets cheaper. Why would we want to give a lifetime exemption to a handful of companies that are reclaiming 200 acres a year? And at that rate, we are going to be into the year 3000. Why would we say you never have to comply with any rules, when most of those companies are? It just doesn’t make a lot of sense to me. No one is saying anything bad about these plants. They are providing a valuable service. They can do it in a much more environmentally friendly way because technology is allowing that to happen. And all the EPA and their scientists who study this and the Federal courts, which upheld their decision, are saying is let’s make the environment even cleaner. We have seen what happens to our State when there is no regulation. It is called ‘‘environmental catastrophe.’’ Let’s not go back to saying no environmental regulation to this handful of companies that aren’t complying. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. CHENEY). Members are reminded to direct their remarks to the Chair. Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. ROTHFUS ), the author of the language. Mr. ROTHFUS. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I wonder if my friend from Pennsylvania has really taken a look at the legislation, because there are rules that apply. The entire bevy of environmental rules apply to these plants, and the SENSE Act is going to leave those in place, all the rules. What the SENSE Act does is take a look at two factors—two factors—hydrogen chloride and sulfur dioxide. That is it. And it says, if you are in compliance with hydrogen chloride, you will be deemed to be in compliance with sulfur dioxide, or, conversely, if you are in compliance with sulfur dioxide, you will be deemed in compliance with hydrogen chloride. Everything else is applicable. Everything else is applicable. This is why I talk about a customization for a small handful of the plants. The group that represents these plants supports this legislation. The workers in these plants support this legislation. The people who live next to these coal piles support this legislation. But to suggest that this legislation means no rules for these plants is just not accurate. All the rules apply to these plants. We are seeing a small tweak because, again, when you look at the economics of running a business, running a plant, you are looking at cost; and if you are going to impose the cost to put the additional mechanics within the plant, it is not going to happen. Those plants are going to close. That is what we are looking at. So, again, I would appreciate if folks who take a look at this legislation understand that these plants are still subject to strict regulation both at the Federal and State level and that this is a minor tweaking of one rule. While the EPA may have been discussing the benefit of these plants in the context of another rule, the fact remains the same: these units warrant special consideration. If it is true under one rule, it is going to be true under all rules because of, again, the unique environmental benefits that these plants provide. Mr. TONKO. Madam Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. MICHAEL F. D OYLE ). Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. At the risk of beating this horse to death—and this will be my final remarks—I would just say to the Speaker that there are many of these plants that are complying with this rule, and I commend those plants that are doing that. It is not fair to those plants that are complying that we exempt those plants that aren’t complying or don’t want to comply because they don’t want to spend the money to do so. The idea that all of these plants are going out of business if they are forced to do that is simply not based in any reality. I would encourage the gentleman and the Speaker to reconsider this bill, which is going nowhere. It may pass the House, but it is not going any further than that. Let’s sit down and work together on a bipartisan basis to come up with a rule that utilizes the best and latest technologies, that continues to improve and get cheaper, help work with these companies that may need a little assistance in complying and help them comply, and then we truly do have a winwin situation. Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I believe I have the right to close, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. TONKO. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I have no other speakers. I just would make mention that some 18 groups that are public interest groups have joined together in a letter opposing this legislation, suggesting and indicating strongly that it pits waste coal burning plants against coalburning plants, that it creates a public health situation that is an outcome that is negative for our constituents, and it basically cites that the courts have reviewed some of the requests made earlier and denied those requests because they felt that technology was available. I include the letter in the RECORD . 
MARCH 6, 2018. DEAR REPRESENTATIVE : On behalf of our millions of members, the undersigned organizations urge you to oppose the amended Satisfying Energy Needs and Saving the Environment Act, or SENSE Act (H.R. 1119). This bill would weaken health safeguards for Americans on behalf of special interest groups and result in more toxic air pollution and health hazards. The SENSE Act would provide a giveaway to power plants that burn waste coal under EPA’s Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS). The bill favors waste coalburning power plants at the expense of other instate coal power plants and the public through blunt political favoritism. 
Specifically, the SENSE Act would permanently exempt power plants that burn waste coal from having to meet certain pollution limits. Power plants, including waste coal plants, are already meeting these standards—passing this bill would be a free giveaway to polluters, and nothing more. And the courts agree. When waste coal plant owners filed lawsuits challenging the MATS standards in the first place, they claimed it was ‘‘virtually impossible’’ to meet the acid gas and sulfur dioxide limits set in MATS. The court rejected the plants’ arguments. The judges pointed to clear evidence that waste coal plants already were meeting these limits. EPA had evidence demonstrating that 8 out of 19 waste coal units nationwide already could meet the rule’s acid gas standard or alternative sulfur dioxide standard. In fact, the court noted that not only were the plants meeting these supposedly ‘‘impossible’’ standards, but some of these plants were ‘‘among the best performers’’ in achieving hydrogen chloride reductions among all coalburning units under the rule.’’ Doomsday claims to justify this bill are just that. Waste coal plants have already had more time than other power plants to come into compliance with MATS. Rewarding laggards who continue to drag their feet, even after already getting special treatment, would undermine all pollution reduction programs and disincentivize compliance. Were this bill to become law, the result will be dirtier air for communities. Indeed, the SENSE Act drags health standards down to the level of the laggards—resulting in greater harms for Americans living in states with waste coal plants as well as in their downwind neighboring states. This bill is not only bad policy—it is unjustified. It favors the very dirtiest of polluting facilities at the expense of Americans, air quality, and responsible power plants who have already taken steps to clean up their air pollution. Worst of all, it will lead to greater toxic pollution and health harms to Americans. We urge you to oppose the SENSE Act. Sincerely, Center for Biological Diversity; Clean Water Action; Climate Hawks Vote; Earthjustice; Environment America; Environmental Defense Fund; Friends of the Earth; GreenLatinos; Hip Hop Caucus; Interfaith Power & Light; League of Conservation Voters; Moms Clean Air Force; National Parks Conservation Association; Natural Resources Defense Council; Power Shift Network; Public Citizen; Sierra Club; Southern Environmental Law Center. 
Mr. TONKO. Madam Speaker, much like the bill considered by the House yesterday, the SENSE Act would provide socalled relief to a handful of companies by shifting the burdens of pollution onto the public. Congress should not be in the business of putting the profits of polluters before the health of our constituents. The reality is, by allowing these plants to pollute more, we would be doing just that. It will result in greater harm to Americans living in States with waste coal plants as well as in their downwind neighboring States, such as my home State of New York. EPA’s MATS are achievable and provide considerable health benefits. Why shouldn’t waste coal plants have to comply? The courts think they should. We shouldn’t have to choose between a giveaway to a couple of special interests over clean air. Again, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill, Mr. Speaker, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to close. This has been a great debate. We don’t have debates on the floor too much. I want to thank my colleague from Pennsylvania. He is a good friend. I think it was well conducted. Just to close, these are specialized plants for twofold purposes. The first purpose is to clean up coal refuge sites, which are all over, again, and it keeps them from having the piles on the ground. And if they catch on fire, there is no controlling technology for that. It keeps them from leaching into our streams, as Congressman ROTHFUS said numerous times, which is why EPA, again, has said these units warrant special consideration. That is what this legislation does. Again, not a Trump EPA, but an Obama EPA made that statement. b1000 If that 200 acres is in your backyard, that is an important 200 acres to clean up. Mr. ROTHFUS brought this down. If those 200 acres are here, you want this? This is a pretty good deal—paid for not by the taxpayers, but paid for by this industry that is using this technology to take the coal refuse and create electricity. As I said once before in this debate, if you have remediation of environmental hazards, if you have a revenue stream to pay for it, if you have goodpaying jobs, you create a local tax base, and you protect the Abandoned Mine Land fund, this SENSE Act makes sense. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, ask anyone who lives in or near communities with waste coal piles from abandoned mines and they will tell you that they can be a significant environmental hazard. They can leak acidic water into rivers and streams. They can sometimes catch fire, burn uncontrollably for months and result in both damage and heavy emissions. And they can be an economic drag on any community that has to deal with them. The good news is that a process exists that can take this byproduct and use it to produce electricity. The result of that process is an environmentallysafe ash that can be used to remediate the land from which the waste coal was taken. It has worked well, and there are numerous examples of contaminated lands and streams being restored because of these coal refusetoenergy plants. Given the substantial environmental benefits of coal refusetoenergy plants, I believe we have an obligation to work to keep them open. That is why I urge support for H.R. 1119, the SENSE Act. Unfortunately, these plants are at risk of being tripped up by EPA regulations aimed at conventional coalfired power plants. Specifically, EPA’s Mercury and Air Toxics standards did not distinguish between conventional coal fired plants and these coal refusetoenergy plants that operate very differently. The EPA’s standard as written for one of the targeted compounds, hydrogen chloride, or HCL, would be difficult for these facilities to consistently meet. The bill before us today, H.R. 1119, the SENSE Act, addresses these concerns and provides an alternative compliance mechanism for HCL that still requires substantial emissions reductions, but one that is achievable for these facilities. By finding a use for potentially dangerous and damaging coal refuse piles, coal refuse toenergy plants provide affordable energy and a tremendous environmental benefit. The SENSE Act is commonsense, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill that benefits both consumers and the environment. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1119, the ‘‘Satisfying Energy Needs and Saving the Environment Act’’. The SENSE Act continues yesterday’s latest effort by Republicans to undermine the commonsense protections found in the Clean Air Act in order to give special breaks to polluters at the expense of public health. The winner of today’s Republican special breaks are power plants that burn waste coal. The SENSE Act would give power plants that burn waste coal for energy a free pass on critical public health protections that keep dangerous toxins out of the air. It does this by giving waste coal power plants a carveout from the pollution control requirements of EPA’s Mercury and Air Toxic Standards—or MATS Rule. This rule represents the first national standards to address power plant emissions of toxic air pollutants like mercury, arsenic, dioxin, sulfur dioxide and hydrochloric acid. The SENSE Act provides a weaker compliance option for MATS that would give waste coal facilities license to pollute more than they should. And, the bill would lock in this weaker standard for the foreseeable future. That means a small number of waste coal units would be allowed to avoid controlling harmful pollution in perpetuity, regardless of any subsequent developments in control technologies, or new information on the health effects of their pollution. Passing this bill means waste coal power plants would never have to clean up their act, putting the health and safety of those nearby and downwind in jeopardy. So, why are we even discussing such a ridiculous sweetheart deal? Because the waste coal industry says they need, and deserve, a legislative earmark, just for using the coal that wasn’t good enough to burn in other power plants. But that claim doesn’t pass the smell test. EPA determined, and the D.C. Circuit Court agreed, that since emissions from waste coal units are no different than emissions from other coalfired power plants, there is no justification for special treatment. Many of the waste coal plants already meet the requirements of the MATS rule, because in reality, waste coal plants are among the best performing coalfired power plants in the country. I see no justification for giving waste coal plants the ability to pollute more than other facilities, as the SENSE act would allow. These special breaks are especially offensive to me since I represent a downwind state. Pollution generated west of New Jersey moves into our air shed threatening the public health and welfare of my constituents. It also increases the burden on New Jersey businesses that would ultimately be required to do 
more and spend more to compensate for the extra pollution generated by these plants. The Republicans claim that EPA is overregulating business. But, time and again, the courts have found that EPA is actually failing to regulate pollutants known to cause harm. This Mercury and Air Toxics rule has been in development and litigation for nearly 20 years—the time it takes for a child to reach adulthood. That’s more than enough delay, enough mercury, and enough toxic air pollution. It’s time to clean it up. Republicanled attacks on clean air protections will not create jobs, nor will they magically build infrastructure. All a Yes vote on this dirty air bill will do is boost profits for Republican allies, and make it easier for corporate polluters to contaminate the air in our neighborhoods. Meanwhile our children’s health is threatened and their future is sold out, all in the name of more corporate profits. I strongly oppose the SENSE Act, and urge all of my colleagues to join me in voting No. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. WOMACK ). All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 762, the previous question is ordered on the bill, as amended. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. 
Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill? Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I am opposed. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to recommit. The Clerk read as follows: 
Mr. Kildee moves to recommit the bill H.R. 1119 to the Committee on Energy and Commerce with instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith, with the following amendment: At the end of section 2, add the following new subsection: (c) LIMITATION .—This Act does not apply with respect to any coal refuse electric utility steam generating unit associated with air pollution that— (1) harms brain development or causes learning disabilities in infants or children; (2) increases the risk of cancer; (3) causes respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses and deaths, including cases of heart attacks, asthma attacks, and bronchitis; or (4) increases mercury deposition to lakes, rivers, streams, and other bodies of water, that are used as a source of public drinking water. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Michigan is recognized for 5 minutes in support of his motion. Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended. Mr. Speaker, this bill is the latest attempt by Republicans to undermine the Clean Air Act and give breaks to special interests, this time to power plants that burn waste coal. The bill undermines the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, the MATS rule, one of most important protections for public health from toxic air pollutants from waste coalburning power plants. Simply put, the bill would mean more pollutants being put into our air and our water by waste coal power plants. And on that point, there is really no disagreement. That is the point of the legislation, to allow more pollutants to be put into the air. But not only would this bill give waste coal power plants permission to pump more pollution into our air, it also prohibits higher standards from being enacted, even if future technologies are invented to help control toxic pollution emissions better. My motion would protect public health and prevent more pollutants, toxic substances like mercury, sulfur dioxide, and other hazardous particles, from being released into the air and into the water. These harmful substances impact brain development. They cause cancer. They harm respiratory systems. They pollute our lakes, our streams, our rivers, where people get their drinking water. As this body has heard me discuss many times, I know firsthand what happens when we fail to protect our environment and when we fail to protect our water supplies. We know what happened in my hometown of Flint, a city of 100,000 people, including thousands of children, poisoned by lead in their drinking water because of callous decisions by government that put the balance sheet approach, the dollars and cents that would accrue in this case to an operator, ahead of the interests of health. For 4 years, the people I represent have not had access to safe drinking water because of decisions that were made by government that allowed the water to be contaminated with high levels of lead, a dangerous neurotoxin with irreversible and damaging effects on children. America is the wealthiest, most prosperous country in the world. It is a shame that the people of my hometown can’t turn on their taps and trust the water coming out. What happened in Flint is the result of policymakers, again, putting the balance sheet ahead of the interests of people. We can’t measure every question on the ledger of a corporation. We have to think about the health of our people. Just looking at those shortterm effects can lead to really bad choices. What happened in Flint is absolutely tragic. We ought to take that lesson and make sure that we do everything we can to prevent the consequences of ignoring environmental protections, the consequences on people. Flint is not an anomaly. Flint is a warning. What happened there could happen to lots of people all across the country if we don’t take care to ensure that we protect public health and strike a reasonable balance between the interests of the companies that are, unfortunately, unwilling to comply as other companies have, as other operators have, with existing standards. The public interest has to come first. We should be protecting our constituents from pollutants, not enacting law that explicitly allows for more pollutants to go into our air and water. It is the wrong direction for us. As my colleague Mr. DOYLE said, Democrats and Republicans can figure out solutions to these problems, but the solution is not to take a step back and pass legislation that rather than empowering organizations and communities to protect air and water says these rules are too hard for some to adhere to; and because they are unwilling to spend the resources necessary to protect public health, we just say: Well, then it is okay. We know what happens when government takes that approach. There are human consequences—consequences that we can’t ignore, consequences that are made clear by the experience of my hometown. I don’t wish that on anyone in Michigan or Pennsylvania, or anyone else. Mr. Speaker, this Congress ought to do what it can to protect people from that ever happening to them. I urge my colleagues to support this motion to recommit, stand up for kids, stand up for the people who live in those communities who breathe that air, who depend on clean water. Support this motion to recommit. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Illinois is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, this is really a great debate, and I appreciate my colleague coming down here to offer this. I am not sure he was here for the whole debate, but these coal refuse sites sometimes catch on fire. And you want to talk about pollution and hazards? These power plants clean those up. Some of these coal refuse sites leach into the groundwater, the streams, the tributaries, so that the water is yellow. These power plants clean them up. The Obama administration, under Lisa Jackson, said that these units ‘‘warrant special consideration.’’ Why? Because they are remediating all of these environmental hazards. They are not like a typical power plant. They are meeting environmental standards, as the author has said. This bill is supported by the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council, the Eastern Pennsylvania Coalition for Abandoned Mine Reclamation. Actually, the abandoned mine reclamation is not on the taxpayers’ dollar, it 
is on the power plants’ dollar. We are saving money in the Abandoned Mine Land Fund. And the Western Pennsylvania Coalition for Abandoned Mine Reclamation. So, you see, the eastern and the western side of Pennsylvania. It is like the Phillies and the Steelers. Right? There is always going to be a divide there in Pennsylvania. Cambria County Conservation District, the Blacklick Creek Watershed Association. Here is a watershed association supporting this piece of legislation. The Anthracite Region Independent Power Producers Association. As I have said a couple of times during this debate, this is what this is about: You remediate environmental hazards, and you take land like this and turn it into land like this at no government cost. That is why this is the step forward. This is the reasonable approach. The revenue stream is paid for by corporate America. You have got goodpaying jobs. You have got a local tax base. Some of these power plants, if this power plant leaves a county, that is their major employer. That is their major tax base. What are they going to do? Raise local taxes to meet their schools’, counties’, and municipal’s obligations? The SENSE Act makes sense. This motion to recommit is trying to obviously defeat this bill. This is a sensible bill. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to vote against the motion to recommit, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to recommit. There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XX, the Chair will reduce to 5 minutes the minimum time for any electronic vote on the question of passage of the bill. The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were—yeas 181, nays 225, not voting 24, as follows:

b1044 Mr. LOEBSACK changed his vote from ‘‘aye’’ to ‘‘no.’’ So the bill was passed. The result of the vote was announced as above recorded. The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ‘‘A bill to establish the bases by which the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall issue, implement, and enforce certain emission limitations for existing electric utility steam generating units that convert coal refuse into energy.’’. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. Stated against: Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, during rollcall vote No. 101 on H.R. 1119, I mistakenly recorded my vote as ‘‘yea’’ when I should have voted ‘‘nay.’’ Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained and so I missed rollcall vote No. 101 regarding the ‘‘Satisfying Energy Needs and Saving the Environment Act’’ (H.R. 1119). Had I been present, I would have voted ‘‘no.’’ 
Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, I was at a medical appointment with my son and was unable to vote, had I been present, I would have voted ‘‘nay’’ on rollcall No. 100 and ‘‘yea’’ on rollcall No. 101. 
LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCARTHY ), my friend, for the purpose of inquiring of the majority leader the schedule for the week to come. (Mr. MCCARTHY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, on Monday, no votes are expected in the House. On Tuesday, the House will meet at noon for morning hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business. Votes will be postponed until 6:30 p.m. On Wednesday and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning hour and noon for legislative business. On Friday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business. Last votes of the week are expected no later than 3 p.m. Mr. Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next week, a complete list of which will be announced by close of business tomorrow. One worth highlighting is H.R. 4909, the Student, Teachers, and Officers Preventing School Violence Act, sponsored by former sheriff, Representative JOHNRUTHERFORD . Mr. Speaker, all Members of this House were saddened and horrified by the tragic events in Parkland, Florida. Sheriff Rutherford’s bill will provide local communities with critical resources to upgrade our schools and keep our children safe. I look forward to the House speaking with one bipartisan voice next week and passing this important bill without delay. Mr. Speaker, the House will also consider several bills from the Financial Services Committee. This includes two bills sponsored by Representative SCOTT TIPTON : H.R. 1116, the TAILOR Act; and H.R. 4545, the Financial Institutions Examination Fairness and Reform Act; as well as H.R. 4263, the Regulation A+ Improvement Act, sponsored by Representative TOMMAC ARTHUR . Taken together, these bills will consider House Republican’s work to create an economic environment that is both procompetition and smart and balanced in its regulatory approach. Finally, Mr. Speaker, additional legislative items are possible, including potential legislation making further appropriations for FY 2018. I will be sure to inform all Members as soon as any additional items are added to our schedule. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the majority leader for that information. Mr. Speaker, throughout the last year, we have continually run up against deadlines on how we were going to keep the government of the United States operating properly. The omnibus is currently being discussed. The negotiations for the omnibus were made possible by the fact that a significant number of Democrats voted for it, while a significant number of Republicans voted against it. It was a bipartisan statement proceeding. That omnibus needs to be passed by March 23. We are not scheduled to be here, Mr. Speaker, on March 23. That does not mean that we might not go over, but it means that it needs to pass the House and the Senate and be sent to the President prior to or on March 22. Negotiations are, unfortunately, not proceeding as effectively as I would hope they would. I am hopeful that there will be a clean bill from either 
side without any riders that would lead either side to oppose that bill. Mr. Speaker, let me talk about an issue. First of all, let me say that the leader has announced a number of bills for consideration next week. I venture to say that an extraordinarily infinitesimal amount of the American people have any ideas what those bills do or are urging those bills to be passed. I do not mean that they are without substance. I mean that they are not the issues on the mind of the American people. This is the people’s House. Mr. Speaker, the Speaker appeared on television at a townhall on CNN some 14 months ago. He made a promise at a CNN townhall to a Dreamer that asked him a question. House Speaker PAUL RYAN strongly suggested to that young woman that ‘‘revocation on protection for the Dreamers brought here as children will not be carried out.’’ Notwithstanding that, the President of the United States put that Dreamer and hundreds of thousands of other Dreamers—indeed, close to 2 million Dreamers—at risk by withdrawing their protections, which Speaker RYAN indicated would not happen: ‘‘Will not be carried out.’’ That was some 6 months ago, Mr. Speaker. Not the CNN; that was 14 months ago. I have talked to the Speaker, I have brought it up continuously on this floor, and I have been told by the Republican leadership: Don’t worry, we have got until March 5 to do something. I was told that in October, I was told that in November, I was told that in December, I was told that in January, and I was told that in February: Don’t worry, we have got until March 5. March 5 came and went. No action. None. That Dreamer to whom the Speaker spoke is still at risk, still worried, and still twisting in the wind. Eightysix percent of the American public, Mr. Speaker, say that that young woman should not be kicked out of the country that she knows: brought here as a child, went to elementary school, middle school, high school; some to college, some practicing medicine, some practicing law, some being social workers, many being teachers. I was told: Don’t worry. They were told: Don’t worry, March 5 is a long way away. It has come and gone. And we are told this week that we will consider H.R. 1116, the TAILOR Act. I am not sure that any of my constituents have talked to me about the TAILOR Act. H.R. 4263, the Regulation A+ Improvement Act, I doubt that a single one of my constituents has talked to me about that act. They are fillers, Mr. Speaker. They are fillers while we fiddle, while Rome burns. I have asked, Leader PELOSI has asked, frankly, and leaders of the Catholic Church and other denominations have asked to put the Dreamer bill on the floor in the people’s House. The Speaker of this House, when he became the Speaker, said: We will not duck the tough issues. We will take them headon. Don’t worry, we have got until March 5. March 5 is behind us, and we consider these bills, which I think are filler bills, and controversial bills at that. We have asked, Mr. Speaker, that the majority party put on the floor three bills on an issue of vital importance to the American people, that every American knows about, that the people’s House ought to have the right to speak on, and express the views of the American people and establish policy they support—86 percent of them. So I will, again, ask the majority leader, Mr. Speaker, to put the Dream Act on the floor; to put Mr. GOODLATTE ’s bill on the floor; to put the bipartisan bill, sponsored by Mr. HURD from Texas and Mr. AGUILAR from California; put them on the floor. b1100 Take the issues. I know they are tough. The Speaker said he wants to take the issues headon, Mr. Speaker, not duck. Show some political courage. And not only that, respect this institution and every Member in it who wants to express their opinion on this legislation of critical importance to at least 1.8 million Americans, vital to their future, to their life. And 86 percent of Americans believe they ought to be protected, just as Speaker RYANpledged they would be 14 months ago when he said revocation of protection for the Dreamers brought here as children will not be carried out. Mr. Speaker, that bill ought to be brought to the floor to carry out that representation and that assurance. I have been patient. I have talked. I have worked. I have come to meetings. I met with the President of the United States, Mr. Speaker, with my colleague and friend, the majority leader, and Mr. DURBIN and others, 25 of us sitting around the Cabinet table, Mr. Speaker, when the President said we will take care of DACA, and he said: You send me a bill; I will sign it, and I will take the heat. He was not telling the truth, Mr. Speaker, because we had a bill, called the commonsense crowd, about 25 United States Senators brought a bill to the floor. It took care of a couple of the things the President wanted to take care of, but it wasn’t good enough for him, notwithstanding the fact he said: You send me a bill. You decide, i.e., the Congress, the coequal branch of government that now stands suppliant in the face of saying we will pass something only if the President will sign it. That is not what the framers meant, Mr. Speaker. We are a coequal branch, not a subservient branch of the government of the United States. Mr. Speaker, if we brought those three bills to the floor that I just referred to—the Dream Act, cosponsored by ILEANA ROSLEHTINEN , a Republican, and LUCILLE ROYBAL ALLARD , a Democrat; and the Goodlatte bill, sponsored by the chairman of the Judiciary Committee; and a bipartisan bill sponsored by many Republicans and many Democrats, Mr. HURD, a Republican from Texas, and Mr. AGUILAR , a Democrat from California—if we brought those bills to the floor, the problem is they know the HurdAguilar bill would pass, which would reflect the views of 86 percent of the American people. No, Mr. Speaker, notwithstanding the fact that the American people are overwhelmingly for that, we are going to be considering H.R. 1116, H.R. 4545, H.R. 4263, ignoring that 1.8 million people, ignoring that promise that the Speaker made to that young woman that she would be protected. The Speaker has told me over and over again: Oh, I want to do this. I want to do that. I am going to have some task force. I am going to do this, that, and the other. March 5 has come and gone. Nothing has happened. I used to be the majority leader. I could bring a bill to the floor. If I said something was going to happen, I tried to make sure it happened. If I sound angry, it is because I am angry. If I sound frustrated, it is because I am frustrated. The people’s House ought to be given the opportunity to express the will of the American people on this issue. There is another issue, and we do have a bill, the socalled Rutherford bill that we are bringing to the floor on suspension. We are probably all going to vote for the Rutherford bill. But we are going to ignore a bill, as we have been ignoring for years under Republican leadership, a bill that is supported even more than the DACA, Dreamer bills, and that is comprehensive background checks, which clearly will save lives, which will close the loopholes, which will make sure that those with criminal records don’t get guns, will make sure that those with mental health issues don’t get guns, will make sure that terrorists who can’t fly on airplanes can’t get guns. Mr. Speaker, we have been urging and pleading for that bill to be brought to the floor over and over and over again. The National Rifle Association is not for that bill. I can’t understand why. Rather, we bring a bill to the floor that will help schools—I think that is positive—do what they can do right now. Should we help them? Of course. But we ought not to pretend that we are doing something to make our children safer in their schools, to make concertgoers safer at their concerts, to make churchgoers safer in their church, to make people who go to a nightclub safer in that nightclub, to make people who go to shopping centers safer in those shopping centers. We ought not to pretend the Rutherford bill is going to do that. 
Will comprehensive background checks do it all? It will not. There are other things I think ought to be done. But at a minimum, the American people think that we ought to make sure that everybody who purchases a weapon has a background check to make sure that they are not a criminal, somebody with a substantial mental health problem that makes them unsafe to own a gun, spousal abusers. Mr. Speaker, the bills we are going to consider next week I am sure have some merit from some perception, from somebody’s perception, but the two bills that I have just discussed are on the minds of the American people, and millions are at risk if we do not pass legislation dealing with that issue. I do not criticize the Rutherford bill, but it will not solve the problem, and everybody knows it will not solve the problem; nor, frankly, will universal background checks in and of itself solve the problem, but experts say it will save thousands of lives over time. It would have saved lives in Charleston, South Carolina, the nine people killed in Mother Emanuel Church in Charleston, South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I like to work in a bipartisan way, but that requires respecting one another. My Republican friends wrote a book in which they were very critical of the way we ran the House because it wasn’t open and transparent. I would ask them to reread that book. I have read it. My friend is smiling. In that book, they really wanted to change the way this House runs, make it open and transparent, take the tough issues headon. That is what the Speaker said. Mr. Speaker, they are not taking the tough issues headon. They are hiding from the NRA. They are hiding from some of their hardline people who want to kick people out of America, who want to take that lamp that the Statue of Liberty holds high and bring it down. Yes, I am disappointed. Yes, I am angry. Yes, I am frustrated. I came to this body to express my opinion on the important issues confronting my country and to try to make it better. Mr. Speaker, I would plead with the majority leader to perhaps delay those four bills. Rutherford’s could be on suspension. It won’t take much time. Delay those three bills that a miniscule amount of Americans, there may be 100, there may be 200 Americans who would be concerned those bills aren’t brought forward, and put on the floor the three bills I referred to—the Dream Act, the Goodlatte bill, and the Hurd Aguilar bill—and let the people’s House express its opinion. That is not an unfair request. And let the background check, universal background check bill come to the floor, and let the House vote. I know that there are some Republicans who don’t want to vote on that bill because the public is so overwhelmingly for it and they may upset the NRA. That is what this business is about, Mr. Speaker, expressing openly and clearly what we think the policies of our country ought to be to make our public better, to make our country safer. Mr. Speaker, I would end on those two issues, and I yield to my friend, the majority leader. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. BIGGS). Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I have great respect for the gentleman, and there were a lot of questions inside there, I believe. Out of my respect for the gentleman, I am quite concerned that if he is fact checked, he is going to get quite a few Pinocchios, so let me walk through, first, how he started the debate. The gentleman started and the first question was concerning government funding to March 23. He then felt that work was not being done, and he used the phrase—and I may get it a little incorrect, but he said we only were able to pass a budget agreement because of the majority of the Democrats, and not the majority on the Republican side, passing it. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time to just make a correction. I said a significant number of Democrats voted for it and a significant number of Republicans voted against it. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California. Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. So I think it would just be helpful on the record to actually state what the vote was. There were 167 Republicans who voted for that budget agreement, 67 who did not. There were 73 Democrats who voted for it, but the majority of Democrats, 119, voted against it, which Mr. HOYER was in that group, as well, voting against it. So I would make one point, and that is 71 percent of Republicans voted for this budget agreement. And just to make the facts correct, Mr. HOYER ’s concern about the appropriations process, this House passed all 12 appropriations bills, and we did it on time and we sent it over to the Senate. In the meantime, the Democrats shut the government down before we could ever get there. So I think history should actually play to facts. Yes, I am concerned about the March 23 deadline, but I am pushing hard. I would actually like to take those bills up next week. And as Mr. HOYER  knows, being a member of the Appropriations Committee as he was in the past, when you get to this point where we already have the numbers set, it is really what is called a four corners, the four leaders. Now, the committees are all working through it. They are actually making great progress. There are a few things left to actually close out. I would like to get it done a week ahead of time, and I hope Mr. HOYER ’s side would as well. So let’s walk through some others. First of all, I was a smallbusiness owner. The idea is having a bill on this floor that creates more jobs, that brings more access to capital. Mr. Speaker, I heard from the other side, the leader, she thought crumbs was the idea of Americans getting $1,000 in a bonus. That is about equal to what I am hearing, and I am offended by it. It is not insignificant that someone wants to create a job and have access to capital. The gentleman is wrong about that. Then the gentleman talks about our Speaker. Our Speaker has worked a great deal, and, yes, he has kept his word. Mr. HOYER was in that meeting with me when we were in the White House. Before we left that bipartisan, bicameral meeting with the administration, we agreed to work on this issue in four areas, and we have had numerous meetings in my office about that as well. b1115 I don’t know, maybe you forget to state that we are a rule of law Nation. In doing so, that is why we are in this position we are today, because there was a past executive branch that thought they were a legislative branch and they did something that everyone would agree they do not have the power to do. So the current President said to move it to the legislative branch like it should be because there are court cases coming. In doing so, that is what we are working on. The courts have now come back, giving further time. The Supreme Court has now given a timeline that wants to make sure the Ninth Circuit before there—so this gives us time to solve the problem. I am more concerned about solving a problem than just passing a bill for some political favor. I do not want to be back at this place in another 2 years and having kids sitting here who are questioning where they are going to go. I know you raised some issue about individuals. Not one person is in jeopardy that is registered within DACA. You have been in meetings where you heard that from the Secretary of Homeland Security, where you heard that from the Chief of Staff to the President as well. The President even went further than talking about DACA to even making the point solving, but he also had three other pillars. As you know, we need a secure border. You also know the current law does not treat everybody equally who comes here illegally, so you are going to perpetuate the problem if you maintain the current law. Thirdly, the idea that we want to make sure the nuclear family is closer together sooner—you have got a 30 year wait when someone wants to come in and petition a brother and sister. Why don’t we help them be able to bring their children and their spouses in together? 
That is one of the proposals as well. Then the whole concept of merit. Those are all common sense. I think they could be bipartisan. And the sooner we solve that problem, we will solve it for a long term. So on this side of the aisle we want to get this job done long before the courts even have to act. I think that would be the proper thing to do. So, yes, that is what we have been working upon. Now, another issue you brought up was about guns, and you talked about this Congress. I first want to give you a few little facts. I appreciate that you always mention my book. That is why I smile. We don’t get any royalties from it, but the veterans do, so please mention it as much as you like. If I take—and let me just give you the numbers. Quorum does this. Some bright kids out of Harvard created a company and it is all about data. There are more bills out of committee, 643 in this Congress; and there are more bills out of this House, 558, than any Congress in the last 25 years. And in that meantime, we also passed tax reform that hasn’t been done in three decades. I know some people on your side of the aisle refer to it as crumbs or Armageddon, but I will tell you, to those families out there that got extra money, that are actually fixing their car or actually paying their hospital bills, or those 1.2 million people who just work at one company that now have a longer maternity leave, they don’t think it is crumbs, and they don’t think having a bill on the floor that let more people take a risk and create a small business is insignificant. Now let me talk to you about what we did because we believe background checks are important as well. Let me give you a little background. The background check is only as good as the database of what you have. The National Instant Criminal Background Check System, referred to as the NICS database, is currently administered by the FBI. If the NICS check indicates a person as being in a prohibited category, the FBI will signal a deny on the firearm transfer. However, the NICS database is incomplete and outdated. For example, on November 5, 2017, a mass shooting occurred at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. Devin Patrick Kelley murdered 26 and injured 20 others. Kelly was prohibited by law from purchasing or processing firearms or ammunition due to a domestic violence conviction in a court martial while in the United States Air Force. However, the Air Force failed to record the conviction in the FBI NICS database. That is why this House, this Congress, this majority acted. We put the Fix NICS bill in December—it is sitting in the Senate—which would strengthen our background check system and make it more accurate. It would require Federal agencies to certify twice per year that they are uploading criminal record information to NICS, requiring agencies to establish an implementation plan to ensure maximum coordination and reporting of records. Now you are on record to voting against that. We have another bill on the floor from a former sheriff from Jacksonville, Florida. He is looking at school violence. Let me walk you through that one. As I mentioned, Congress will vote next week on the STOP School Violence Act. This bill is proudly supported by Sandy Hook Promise, who note that it will ensure that millions more schools will be trained in prevention and lives will be saved. Now, this isn’t the only thing we are doing. Just this week, we are having oversight. We took the Oversight and Government Reform Committee in this Congress and the Judiciary Committee in this Congress this week, and brought the FBI in, and they will come back again; because there is not one person in America who wants to see what happened in Florida to happen again. But let’s walk through this situation, because I think it is important that we examine it because we want to solve these problems. There were multiple red flags that were raised to the FBI about the behavior of Nikolas Cruz. The very first red flag: On September 25, 2017, a YouTube channel host took a snapshot of a comment under his video that said: ‘‘I am going to be a professional school shooter.’’ He sent that comment to the West Virginia FBI tip center, where all tips are supposed to go, which deemed it a credible threat and opened an investigation. FBI agents searched for files on Nikolas Cruz, but they were unable to identify the individual and did not even reach out to YouTube in an attempt to recover records on Cruz, so on October 11, 2017, the FBI formally closed the inquiry. That was one red flag, but that is not where it ended. A second red flag: On January 5, 2018, a second tip came via a phone call to the FBI from a concerned family member. They described in detail problems with Cruz he was showing with regard to social media, cruelty to animals, school trouble, and dealing with a recent death in the family. When the FBI searched the database again for Nikolas Cruz, the previous tip popped up. However, despite the call from a family member, from a previous red flag, from a YouTube comment from the individual himself that he wanted to be a professional school shooter, they closed the investigation. The shooting happened on February 14, 5 months after the first tip. This House has not stopped to act. This House acted in December. The background checks have to be fixed. That is why we passed it and put it into the Senate. That is why we are taking up more action now for the schools and adding that to what we already took up in this House. Those aren’t insignificant. I believe there is a path forward. Just as we did all appropriations bills, just as we have been through numerous meetings when it comes to DACA, there is not one child in jeopardy today. The only jeopardy that we will have is if we don’t get together and solve the problem. We have narrowed it to four areas. You and I know what has been said in those meetings. You and I know where it is. We can find compromise. We can solve this problem. But let’s make a pledge to the American public that we don’t do a bill for the sake of something politically. We create law that solves something so we are not back here in a future Congress taking up the exact same issue putting other people in jeopardy. That is my promise, and that is what I will continue to work for. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to direct their remarks to the Chair. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, the majority leader talked about a lot of issues, one of which was NICS. What he didn’t say was they put a poison pill in the Fix NICS bill, which is why so many of us voted against it on concealed carry. There is a disagreement in this House on that. We disagree, for the most part, on that provision. We don’t think that makes America safer. There are differences of opinion on that. My suggestion to the majority leader is, the Rutherford bill is on the floor. By unanimous consent, let’s put the Fix NICS bill in the Rutherford bill without the poison pill in it. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman to see if he will be agreeable to doing that. Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. That would be the same outcome that is already sitting in the Senate. The Senate has the Fix NICS bill now. We will add more to it. I hope you are just as frustrated with the Senate as I am. Why can they not pass something? Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, my question was, will you agree—you talked a lot about NICS and where it is failing, and we can fix it. We agree with that. So what I am asking you—you put the Rutherford bill on. I think most of us are going to vote for the Rutherford bill. Maybe all of us will vote for the Rutherford bill, which says let’s help schools make themselves more safe. Why should anybody be opposed to that? What I say to you is: you just spent a significant amount of time talking about how we could make the NICS process work better, but that many of us voted against it and it hasn’t moved in the Senate. I guarantee you—I don’t know that I can guarantee you, but my thinking is: if you do the Rutherford bill, and if you add in the Fix NICS bill—not with concealed carry, but the Fix NICS bill that you talk about in the Rutherford bill— 
I will work with you to get that passed in the United States Senate, and I think we will be successful. My question to the majority leader: Will you agree to a unanimous consent request to add the Fix NICS bill into the Rutherford bill on the suspension calendar? Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are again reminded to direct their remarks to the Chair. Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding. Let me give the gentleman a few facts. There are 426 bills that have passed this House that sit over in the Senate. Of those 426, there is less than 10 that are partisan. The rest of them all have bipartisan votes. There are more than 200 votes on bills that sit over in that Senate that were passed here by voice unanimously. So I am not one to do something politically just so somebody else feels better that now they can vote for something because they voted against it before. I am for making law and saving children. So from this point, we are going to pass the STOP School Violence Act. We are going to send it to the Senate, just the way they already have our Fix NICS bill over there. And let’s have the Senate—and I will take you up on this. Let’s work together right now to get that bill back over here. Mr. HOYER. The answer is no, Mr. Speaker. The answer is no, because we want to continue to have that on which we agree defeated by that on which we do not agree. That is the pattern. And when the gentleman says all those bipartisan bills, there were some, obviously, Democrat votes on many of those bills, I am sure. Mr. Speaker, I didn’t hear a word about a bill that has the majority’s support on the floor of the House of Representatives that I spoke about, and that is HurdAguilar. Mr. GOODLATTE , the chairman of the Judiciary Committee said if Goodlatte was put on the floor, it will lose 50, 60, 70 Republicans. Mr. GOODLATTE said that, and that was passed out of the Judiciary Committee. It hasn’t been brought to the floor because it would fail. HurdAguilar, which has not been considered by the committee, but which has the majority of votes on this floor, that bill has not been brought up; just as the bill that passed the United States Senate 5 years ago, to deal with so many of the problems that immigration confronts us with, including security at the border, 5 years, has not been brought up. March 5, nothing happened. Come and gone. The majority leader spent a lot of time, Mr. Speaker, talking about things that are important but were not on the subject because he doesn’t want to deal with the subject. Apparently the Republicans don’t want to deal with the subject and they won’t put it on the floor. They are obstructing the will of the American people and they are putting thousands and thousands and thousands of people at risk. The majority leader, with all due respect, is wrong. All of the DACA recipients are not protected, and many of them are not signing up again because they are afraid their government will come after them. They feel they were flimflammed. I disagree with the majority leader, Mr. Speaker. Many of us believe what the President did is absolutely legal. It is consistent with what Ronald Reagan did, with what George H.W. Bush did, with what Bill Clinton did, and what George W. Bush did. b1130 Every President, since I have been serving here, has modified immigration consistent with their executive authority. There was nothing mentioned about the quote of the Speaker that was clearly directed at this young woman to say that revocation of protections for the Dreamers brought here as children will not be carried out. Nobody can sign up for DACA protection now under the court order—nobody. You can reup, but you can’t sign up—1.8 million. The President of the United States, Mr. Speaker, sent a message down here, or maybe he tweeted it, they would agree to 1.8 million and a pathway to citizenship, parenthesis, if you agree with this, if you agree with that, if you agree with the other. That is not what was said at the White House, Mr. Speaker. I agree with the majority leader. He brought up some other points, said we need to agree to discuss those. I agreed to discuss them. I didn’t agree to agree to them, nor did anybody else in that room. And the President of the United States, 25 Members of the House and Senate sitting around the Cabinet table, said: Are we agreed that we are going to solve the DACA issue first? Not a single Member demurred. Not a single Member said no—not a single one, Mr. Speaker, yet we can’t get that bill to the floor. And the majority leader says: Oh, well, we are bringing up a bill that will create jobs. I am for doing that. And, frankly, if we do that the week after or the week after that—frankly, I don’t know the bills well enough to be speaking about them with much depth of information as to how they were voted on in committee, but my inkling is that the majority Democrats—I don’t know what is in there, in these bills—may well have voted against them. Most of those bills coming out of committee are pretty partisan. We didn’t discuss the three bills that I brought up. The majority leader didn’t mention them. They have bipartisan support on two; and one, the chairman of the committee admits, does not have the votes on this floor. He would get no Democratic votes, and he would lose a substantial number of Republican votes, and the majority leader knows that, Mr. Speaker. And we talk about NICS. I want to fix NICS. I don’t want concealed carry to be part of that. And I regret that the majority leader would not agree to let’s fix NICS and put the Rutherford bill through. That would pass the Senate, but he has got a bill over there he knows won’t pass the Senate but maybe it makes a good talking point. Mr. Speaker, I don’t know what we have to do. We have been waiting a long time, not just the 6 months since September, waiting for March 5 to come and go. We have been waiting for a long time to have bills on the floor with an open amendment process so we can, in fact, do the people’s will on immigration and on protecting our students and our families and our citizens from the irresponsible use of guns. We are not against the responsible use of guns. We believe the Second Amendment protects people on owning handguns and hunting guns; but the Supreme Court, in the Heller decision, said there are things that the community could do. There are things that the government can do to protect its people and to make sure that gun use, within the framework of the Second Amendment, is responsible. I don’t know what we have to do, Mr. Speaker. I don’t think anybody doubts that the HurdAguilar bill has the majority votes in this House. I would urge people to, if they believe in this issue, sign a discharge petition. They refused to bring the ExportImport Bank bill to the floor for 11⁄2or 2 years. Some of the leadership weren’t for it. As a matter of fact, the two highest weren’t for it. But 127 Republicans to 117 Republicans, they were for it, and over 300 votes were for it, and they would not bring it to the floor short of a discharge petition. That is not transparency; that is not openness; that is not taking the tough issues head on. That is obfuscating. That is undermining democracy in the people’s House. If the gentleman wants to respond, I will yield to him. If not, I will yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I actually have the same question. I don’t know what we have to do. You know, we come here quite often to have these colloquies. They are supposed to just be for what is happening the next week, but we talk about more issues. For a long time, I heard: What about the Children’s Health Insurance Program? You know what, this House brought it up early. We tried to work through committee. The Speaker knows how many times I went on the other side. They wouldn’t even let their committee work on it. So what did we do? We took the ideas that the Democrats had, we put it in the bill; we passed it bipartisan; they still said no. They didn’t say no once, they said it numerous times to the Children’s Health Insurance Program. And I sat here wondering: What more do we have to do? 
Disaster relief. I know, Mr. Speaker, the heart of the minority whip. We went together to Puerto Rico. We went together to the Virgin Islands. We went to Florida. What more do we have to do? Then we brought it to the floor, and he still said no. But you know what? We still got it done. Government funding. He started this whole discussion about government funding. He misspoke and said it was because of the Democrats that we were able to make this plan. He said a majority of them; and it was not a majority, it was a minority. Mr. HOYER. I did not. Mr. MCCARTHY. It was a majority of the House. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time. With all due respect, Mr. Speaker, I indicated to the leader what I said, and I knew what I said, and I know what the facts are. The Republicans could not pass that bill on their own. There were over 60 Republicans who voted ‘‘no’’ on that bill, and they got 167. You may have given me—or 170. That is, Mr. Speaker, almost 50 short of passage. Mr. Speaker, I will tell you, when I was majority leader, we didn’t get much help from the other side, and we always had 218 to pass what we wanted to pass on our side. Seventy three of our Democrats voted for it, which is why it passed. Not the majority, because the majority of us were so frustrated. Again, the majority leader has not spoken to the bills. He has spoken about what we have passed. And the CHIP bill, by the way, was brought up weeks after its authority expired. Weeks after it expired. Mr. MCCARTHY. Legitimately, may I respond? Mr. HOYER. He says it was because of our committee. I will tell you, Mr. Speaker, we can’t stop anything in committee. They have a majority on every committee and can bring a bill up tomorrow—the next hour if they decide to do so. Mr. MCCARTHY. May I ask the gentleman: Are you stating that we brought CHIP up just weeks before it expired? Mr. HOYER. No, after. Mr. MCCARTHY. After? Mr. HOYER. It expired on September 30. You didn’t bring it up until weeks after that. Mr. MCCARTHY. With all due respect, I think you might want to ask your staff before you put that on record, with all due respect. Well, I am not sure you are correct because we brought it, and it passed this House. Mr. HOYER. I have consulted with the staff person for whom you have great respect and affection, and she says that I am right. Now, she is my staffer, so maybe she is somewhat biased, but I will tell you that we believe we are right on that. But that is not the point, Mr. Speaker. The point is not what we have done in the past—particularly what we have done. And we all are for CHIP. That is not the point. The point is we have two critical pieces of legislation this House must address and that the overwhelming majority of the American people think we ought to address and think we ought to pass and are for. And I don’t mean 51 percent or 52 percent of them. I mean 86 percent of the people or more. It is not a close question. And rather than talking about, well, we did this, we passed 5,950 bills, I am not talking about those bills. I am talking about bills we haven’t brought to the floor, Mr. Speaker, that we haven’t allowed the House to consider; that we have hundreds of thousands of kids, young people who we respect and who are teachers, are doctors, are workers in our factories making a difference, working in restaurants and hotels. I was with the Chamber of Commerce in Maryland just the other day, and three different CEOs came up to me and said: We have got DACA people working for us and doing an excellent job, and they are worried that they are going to be kicked out of the only country they know. But we talk about NICS, and we talk about this, that, and the other. Bring those bills to the floor. That is what we are asking for. We want that respect. We want that respect for this institution. Mr. Speaker, I am going to yield to the majority leader again. It is those two bills that we believe would pass with significant majorities in this House—the three bills, and we can choose between them. We have offered the queen of the hill, with the explanation for those who may be watching and not bored stiff. One of those three bills that I have mentioned, one a Republican bill, the other two bipartisan bills, RosLehtinenRoybalAllard bill and the HurdAguilar bill, both of those bills are bipartisan. Certainly one of those will get a significant majority of this House, and I am not denigrating the bills. I may or may not be for them that are on the schedule, but there are no issues that the country feels are more important right now than background checks, and there is no issue more timely than fixing—as the Speaker pledged to do 14 months ago, putting at risk that young woman and hundreds of thousands of other individuals in our country similarly situated. That is what we ought to be doing. Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend. Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I know you reclaimed your time the time before, but let me finish what I was saying. With all due respect, what do we have to do? Yes, we have Fix NICS sitting over in the Senate. And, yes, we are going to add to it for school violence. We know that it does not have to be partisan, but the background check system is broken. Let’s not make it partisan. Let’s get it done. When it comes to the challenge for DACA, we are just down to four items. Border security. Not one person in here would probably argue against that. And I know my friend across the aisle, Mr. Speaker, I know his heart. He is a good man. He was, as he stated earlier, majority leader. They had the majority here. They had 60 votes over in the Senate. They had a lot of Members in the Senate, and they had the Presidency. Same problem at that time, too. They did not fix it. I don’t want to be in that same place in the future. My commitment is to fixing this problem. So let’s sit down. Let’s talk about border security, but let’s make sure our borders are actually secure. When I look back—and people talk about that Gang of Eight bill—you put more money in there for border security than was even being requested today. But people still, on the other side, say no, Mr. Speaker. But the other point, too, is, if somebody comes from Mexico or Canada and illegally comes across the border, why are they sent back to their country but everybody else is not? Let’s secure the border correctly. Then, when it comes to really protecting the nuclear family, why don’t we make it a little faster that you could have your children and your spouse with you? And do you know what that would do? I think that would make everybody a little stronger. When it comes to the idea of coming to America, should it just be the luck of a lottery, or should it be merit? I think merit is a fairer process for everybody’s opportunity. Now, I don’t think anybody out there that is listening or can hear this later would say those are partisan ideas. But when we sat in the White House and we discussed it and we said let’s narrow it to those four items, I know the way our government is designed. b1145 It is not designed that one person gets all their way. It is based upon compromise. This city, our capital, was because of a compromise. The creator of the banking system, Alexander Hamilton, made this our capital. George Washington, our first President, never served here. He was sworn in on Wall Street and served his second term in Philadelphia. As my good friend knows, Mr. Speaker, when a bill comes out of committee, it gets worked on, then it is brought to the floor. That is exactly what is happening with Mr. GOODLATTE today, so we can bring something to the floor and pass it, that everybody, hopefully, can vote for. This Congress has acted on so many items, but so many times this year it has felt like the election has never ended. I know the heart of many of the Members on the other side. They wanted to vote for disaster relief. They were so frustrated that they shut the government down. 
Do you know what? We have all learned from that lesson before. It is not productive. I also watched people when they talked about health facilities. They wanted that funding, but they couldn’t vote for it. Then they said the whole problem was, when we brought all 12 appropriation bills to the floor, that they couldn’t vote for them because they needed a budget agreement. They needed more money. So, yes, it took a long time to work that out because you want to hold that with other issues as well. Finally, after the shutdown, that was able to be broken apart. But when we finally got that budget agreement that really is negotiated by both sides, even the individual on the other side of the aisle, Mr. Speaker, came to the floor and said she was going to vote ‘‘no,’’ but she negotiated and wanted to tell how she got victories inside the bill. That is not compromise. You can’t sit in a room and say, ‘‘Okay, I will give here and you give there,’’ and based upon the formation of our government, with the Senate as well, we come to an agreement. Mr. Speaker, I don’t know what goes on in people’s minds and why they wanted to be there. I will make this promise to the American public: I will stay in the room, I will take the ups and downs, but at the end of the day, I want to solve a problem. I don’t want a political bill. I will tell you this, Mr. Speaker. I have been in the room many times with this President. He said on this very floor, he went beyond DACA. For those in the American public must understand. It is a much higher number. And for him to find that compromise, he just asked for three other things. That doesn’t mean we are going to get them all, but that does mean we could find compromise in those three. Mr. Speaker, the one sad part, if we had this debate with the American public, they would find compromise with those three items. They would probably find it very fast. They would want their borders secure; they would want the nuclear family closer together sooner; and they would probably want to see some merit. So I know there are times here that we get heated, but the majority of bills that pass this floor are bipartisan. As I stated earlier, more than 200 of those more than 400 bills that are sitting in the Senate passed by voice, all the Democrats and all the Republicans. We are going to differ on some items, and that is right. I want you to keep your principles. But there is a window, and there is an opportunity. And I know, as the days get closer, the election will be sooner, but let us make a promise to one another. Let’s keep that election on the outside, and let’s find solutions on this side, in this House. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, the leader spoke in a very calm and reasoned way. I will do the same. As an aside, I will tell you the CHIP bill passed on November 3, over a month after its authorization expired. Mr. Speaker, the majority leader talks about coming to compromise. I went down to the White House. Mr. DURBIN and I talked about whether we would go to the White House. We went to the White House out of respect for the Presidency, out of a hope that the discussions that we had at the White House would lead to resolution of a serious issue threatening hundreds of thousands, indeed, close to 2 million individuals who know America as their country and who 86 percent of Americans think ought to stay here in America. In that meeting, Mr. Speaker, the President of the United States said— and he said it on television. You don’t have to take my word. There is a video record of what the President said. What he said is we would take care of the DACA issue, consistent, Mr. Speaker, with what Speaker RYAN said to that young woman when he said that the revocation of protections for Dreamers brought here as children will not be carried out. There was no parenthetical addition, if we do X, Y, Z, A, B, C, D, W. There was no parenthetical phrase. He said: We will not put you at risk, young woman, and those similarly situated. We have a bipartisan coalition on this floor, but the leader speaks about going into a room—if you want to have a pejorative, a back room, privately— to try to resolve issues not directly related to the DACA protectees. They are here. The President said they ought to stay here. And the President made a representation, Mr. Speaker, that if we passed a bill, he would sign it. But as the Senate considered a compromise piece of legislation, agreed to by Republican Senators and Democratic Senators, just a few hours before it was brought to the floor, the President said he would veto it. That was not what he said on television in the White House. He said that he would take the heat, if heat there is, and sign the bill that we sent down. Now we have a Speaker of the House and a majority leader of the Senate who say we won’t send something down to the President unless he agrees to sign it, meaning that the House and Senate will not act independently of the President’s imprimatur. How sad a position it is that the people’s House and the United States Senate have subjugated themselves to the President of the United States. I presume, Mr. Speaker, that prolonging this discussion apparently will make no difference. But, Mr. Speaker, our side of the aisle represents just short of 50 percent, maybe 48 percent, of the American people. Mr. Speaker, we are saying let us consider. Let us have on this floor—not in a back room, not in somebody’s office, not somewhere privately—on the House floor, the people’s floor, let us vote. Let the American people see who raises their hand ‘‘aye’’ and ‘‘nay’’ on propositions that have been worked on in committee, the Goodlatte bill, and for months between Republicans and Democrats, bipartisan bills. Let the people speak through their Representatives. Don’t bottle it up in somebody’s office. Let the people’s House work its will. Have the courage to pursue that which you said you would do and take the tough issues headon, not duck them. Mr. Speaker, I would hope, on behalf of that 86 percent of the American people who support the Dreamers, and even more who support comprehensive background checks, that we have the ability to consider those bills and consider them next week. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. f 
HOUR OF MEETING ON TOMORROW, AND ADJOURNMENT FROM FRIDAY, MARCH 9, 2018, TO TUESDAY, MARCH 13, 2018 Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow, and further, when the House adjourns on that day, it adjourn to meet on Tuesday, March 13, 2018, when it shall convene at noon for morninghour debate and 2 p.m. for legislative business. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. MITCHELL ). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. 
PAYING TRIBUTE TO BOONE COUNTY DEPUTY JACOB PICKETT (Mr. ROKITA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. ROKITA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a Hoosier hero who paid the ultimate sacrifice. Deputy Jacob Pickett of the Boone County Sheriff’s Office was killed in the line of duty on March 2, 2018. Jacob was a 5year veteran in law enforcement and served as the leader in the department’s K–9 unit. He held the ranking of sheriff deputy in Boone County. One of Indiana’s finest, Jacob is a hero and acted selflessly on the day that took an unexpected and fatal turn. But he died doing what he was trained to do: protecting the thin blue line and keeping the community he loved safe from harm’s grasp, and he did that that day. Boone County citizens and all Hoosiers mourn over the loss of Jacob, who was known as a man of integrity and compassion. Jacob leaves behind his wife, Jennifer, two young children, and his K–9 partner, Brik, to carry on his legacy of service to fellow Hoosiers. His sacrifice will never be forgotten. As the Gospel of Matthew says: 
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God. 
PERSONAL EXPLANATION Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, on March 5 and March 6, 2018, I was unavoidably detained attending to representation duties, and I would like to indicate how I would have voted had I been present. On rollcall vote No. 92, I would have voted ‘‘aye.’’ On rollcall vote No. 93, I would have voted ‘‘aye.’’ On rollcall vote No. 94, I would have voted ‘‘aye.’’ On rollcall vote No. 95, H.R. 4607, the Comprehensive Regulatory Review Act, I would have voted ‘‘no.’’ 
PERMISSION FOR MEMBER TO BE CONSIDERED AS PRIMARY SPONSOR OF H.R. 40 AND H.R. 1498 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that I may hereafter be considered to be the primary sponsor of H.R. 40, the Commission to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for AfricanAmericans Act, and H.R. 1498, the End Racial Profiling Act, bills originally introduced by Representative Conyers of Michigan, for the purposes of adding cosponsors and requesting reprintings pursuant to clause 7 of rule XII. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Texas? There was no objection. 
THE NICS FIX AND DACA (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I could not help, as I listened to the colloquy of my two friends, to recognize that the key element is saving lives, saving lives from the pillage and the murderous acts that are done with guns. The NICS fix is crucial. The banning bump stocks is crucial. The expanded waiting period is crucial, and banning of AR–15s. But if we can move the issue of the NICS fix, if we can move the issue of expanded background checks, we can lose the taint of not doing anything since Las Vegas, not doing anything since Sandy Hook, Mother Emanuel, or, tragically, Florida. It is imperative that we save lives. Now, let me speak very clearly to DACA. I invite my ICE officers to stand with me on Sunday in Houston and tell my thousands of DACA young people that they will not raid their homes, they will not jeopardize their lives, and that they are, in fact, statused individuals who can go about their daily business. Join me Sunday and announce it to them. And I ask ICE officers to join the Members of Congress across the Nation, because these young people are scared to death, and I would ask that we recognize that. Mr. Speaker, I intend to honor the late Council Member Larry Green with a statement in the RECORD acknowledging the very fact of his great leadership and the fact that he has passed. 
b1200 WASTEFUL SPENDING (Mr. GAETZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. GAETZ. Mr. Speaker, we sure find a lot of ways to waste money in this town, but the EPA may have just reached a new low. We are spending $5 million on a study to forcefeed rats lard and coconut oil until they are morbidly obese, then we pump their enclosures full of exhaust until they die. Then the EPA measures the amount of toxins in the fat cells of the rats as opposed to their skinny counterparts. So we are borrowing money from the next generation so that we can fat shame dead rats that we ourselves have poisoned in the government. I would invite my colleagues to join me in fighting against this and so much other wasteful spending that we seem to find in Washington. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF KERI GALVAN (Mr. KIHUEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Keri Galvan. Keri attended the Route 91 music festival in Las Vegas on October 1. She was a mother of three and a wife to her husband, Justin Galvan. She worked as a cocktail server at Mastro’s Steakhouse, where she worked for almost a decade. She was known by her friends as supermom, and was always there for anybody. Keri never forgot anybody’s special occasion and constantly made sure everybody was okay. She is remembered for being a devoted wife and mother who put others before herself. I would like to extend my condolences to Keri Galvan’s family and friends. Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada, and the whole country grieve with you. 
AMERICAN DOLLARS FOR AMERICAN INFRASTRUCTURE (Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I just introduced legislation that would require all federally funded transportation and infrastructure projects to use materials made right here in America. The Buy America 2.0 Act would bolster American manufacturing and create quality, familysustaining jobs right here in our country. Democrats have been long fighting for these policies, but this effort should be bipartisan. American infrastructure projects should start supporting American workers. This is a wonderful opportunity to create millions of jobs right here at home while investing in critical infrastructure needs that have been long neglected. Mr. Speaker, I encourage all Members of this House, both Democrats and Republicans, to cosponsor my Buy America 2.0 Act. Let’s put the American people back to work. f 
NO HELP FOR DREAMERS (Mr. NORCROSS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Speaker, March 5, the President’s selfimposed deadline, has come and gone, and there is still no solution for Dreamers. We know them as Dreamers. The President knows them as human bargaining chips. They make up the fabric of our country. They sit next to our children in classes. They are our neighbors, our friends, and our families. I am here to tell a story about my family, one you may not know. My son joined the Army and was stationed in South Korea, where he met a lovely young lady. He finally and she finally got together, and they were married and stationed at Fort Hood, Texas, together, where my granddaughter was born. It was a very proud day. Later that same year, I got a call in the middle of the night from my son, who was crying, saying that his wife was going to be deported. I said: Deported where? Apparently, some misfiled paperwork had shown up. My daughterinlaw is a Dreamer. She served our country and would give her life up. Pass the Dream Act now so the current generation of Dreamers can obtain the same thing as my daughterinlaw did. 
THE SECOND AMENDMENT The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GALLEGO ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN ). Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I wanted to bring the good news to Congress about where we are on the gun violence debate because I know there have been a lot of accusations flying back and forth. I want us to look for the common ground. I want to bring the good news today. 
The good news is that we actually have an overwhelming policy consensus in America as to what we need to do about gun violence, and we have an overwhelming—indeed, a unanimous— judicial consensus about what is constitutional to do. I want us to focus on that, and then that will allow us to isolate what the problem is in dislodging the paralysis in Washington today. But let’s start with the overwhelming policy consensus that has emerged in the wake of a sequence of massacres, and it is enough to invoke their names to remind people of the bloodshed that is engulfing our society in Parkland, Florida; in San Bernardino, California; in Las Vegas; in Texas; at Virginia Tech; at Sandy Hook in Newtown, Connecticut; and so on. In the wake of all these massacres, America is demanding action. But here is the good news. Everybody has agreed. As close to a unanimous agreement as you are ever going to find in the United States of America has emerged: 97 percent of the American people favor a universal criminal and mental background check on all firearm purchases in America. That is the overwhelming majority of Democrats, the overwhelming majority of Republicans, the overwhelming majority of Independents, the overwhelming majority of gun owners, and the overwhelming majority of nongun owners. Almost everyone in America, 97 out of 100 people—and if you take the margin of error, it might be 99 out of 100 people—agree that firearms should not be sold without a background check so that criminals, gang members, and terrorists can’t go to a gun show and acquire a weapon of war and then use it in our schools, in our movie theaters, in our churches, and in the public square. So we have got virtually unanimous public consensus on that. Every public opinion poll is showing the same thing, except the numbers continue to go up. Now, some people will say in response to this: Aha, but the Second Amendment won’t allow us to do anything. There are a lot of people in this debate who are now wrapping themselves in the flag of the Second Amendment and saying that the Second Amendment prohibits us from implementing this overwhelming public mandate for a universal criminal and mental background check; but they are wrong, and we know that they are wrong. The Supreme Court, in 2008, in the District of Columbia v. Heller case, interpreted the Second Amendment definitively for us, at least sufficiently for us to understand that a background check is perfectly constitutional. In the Heller case, the Supreme Court first divided over the question of whether or not the Second Amendment confers a collective militiabased right or an individual right. Four Justices said that the text of the Second Amendment means that you only have a right to a firearm in connection with militia service, which today we would call National Guard service. You will recall the language of the Second Amendment is: ‘‘A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.’’ Four Justices suggested that your right to bear and keep an arm is tethered to service in the militia. But that view lost. Five Justices took the individual rights view that the socalled prefatory clause just announces the purpose of the Second Amendment, but it defines an individual right. But nine Justices, the entire Supreme Court, agreed that, whether the right was collective or individual in nature, that right is subject to reasonable regulation by Congress and by the States. Of course, that has got to be right. Every right, all fundamental rights, are subject to reasonable regulation by the government. Think about the First Amendment, which guarantees the right of free speech. It gives you the right to go out and march in front of the White House, but does it give you the right to march in front of the White House at 2 o’clock in the morning with bullhorns and to wake up the President’s family? Of course not. The First Amendment is conditioned on reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions the Supreme Court held in a case called Ward v. Rock Against Racism, where the Court said it was perfectly fine for New York City to turn the sound down when they have a concert in Central Park because there are other social activities taking place. The Second Amendment is the exact same way, said the Supreme Court. You have the right to possess a handgun for selfdefense. You have a right to possess a rifle for purposes of hunting and recreation. You don’t have a right to a machine gun. There is no constitutional right to carry a sawed off shotgun. There is no constitutional right to carry weapons of war in public places. There is no right to carry a firearm in public buildings, said Justice Scalia, into public schools and into the U.S. Congress. There is no constitutional right for that, and there is certainly no constitutional right for anybody to access a weapon without passing through the regulatory screen that the government sets up. That is the common sense of the American people, too. Thomas Paine, who wrote the pamphlet ‘‘Common Sense,’’ said that common sense is essential in a democracy because it is the sense that we have in common. The sense that we have in common today about guns that we need a universal criminal and mental background check is something that is nearly unanimously held, and it is something that clearly passes constitutional muster according to the Supreme Court’s decision in the District of Columbia v. Heller in 2008. So we have got a public policy consensus, a popular consensus, and a constitutional juridical consensus about the right thing to do and the constitutional thing to do. Yet what do we have here in Congress? We have got paralysis. We have got absolute inaction in defiance of the public will. Why? Nobody really says. The GOP leaders, Mr. Speaker, simply refuse to bring a universal background check bill to the floor of Congress. They won’t even permit a hearing in the House Judiciary Committee about it, despite the fact that that is what everybody wants and that is what the times demand right now. Why? Have we become a failed state? b1215 Are we unable to govern? Does democracy not work anymore? Is that what we are saying? I hope not. I hope we have not become a failed State. I hope we are able to address the public safety needs of the people. I hope we are able to address the democratic will of the American public. I hope we are able to effectuate the majority will of Congress, because we know that, forced to a vote, a majority of Congress would support this. So what is going on? Well, James Madison, in Federalist Paper No. 10, predicted it well when he talked about the problem of faction. He talked about a minority of people animated by some passion or some common interest that goes against the rights of the rest of the public and against the common good, against the general interest of the people. But our institutions have got to be set up to legislate over the demands of one small faction, the 2 or 3 percent of the people who don’t want to see a universal background check because they spread the mythology that any gun safety regulation will lead to a confiscation of people’s firearms, which is utterly absurd and ridiculous and demonstrably false. Yet, that tiny group of people, that tiny faction, has been allowed in this Congress to control the public agenda and to dictate to everybody else, when we have tens of thousands, and soon, on Saturday, March 24th, hundreds of thousands of young people marching for the most elementary rights of life in a civil society. And what is that? The right to security and safety—the whole reason we have got a social contract. If you read your Thomas Hobbes, you read your John Locke, you read your JeanJacques Rousseau, the whole basis of civil society is that we will be safer entering into the social contract than we would be if we stuck it out in the state of nature, which John Locke and Thomas Hobbes described as a war of all against all, where life is nasty, poor, brutish, and short. So we are asking for the leadership in Congress simply to act. Let us bring this bill to the floor of Congress, and 
stop with the distractions and the deflections and the diversions. They can bring up 50 other things. The people of America know, with our common sense, that we need a universal criminal and mental background check for everyone. Mr. Speaker, I would love it if someone could explain why that legislation is not allowed to see the light of day on the floor of the House with not even a hearing or a vote in the House Judiciary Committee. This is a public emergency. The young people of America, beginning with the heroic kids, the survivors in Parkland, Florida, will not let us off the hook. One of them was asked the question: Well, why suddenly have you unleashed this revolution across the country against one minor faction control of all of Congress? Why did it happen now, but it didn’t happen back at Sandy Hook? One of the young leaders said: ‘‘At Sandy Hook, they assassinated first graders with an AR–15 at pointblank range; but in Parkland, Florida, they assassinated high school students. We are more educated and we have a voice and we know how social media works.’’ There is no putting the genie back in the bottle. There is going to be no avoiding this question. At the very least, we must have a vote on a universal criminal and mental background check for all firearm purchases in the United States of America. The people want it. The Supreme Court has made it clear that such legislation is constitutional. In Maryland, in 2013, we passed not only fingerprint licensing and universal background checks, we passed a ban on militarystyle assault weapons, a ban on highcapacity magazines. These are bans that are, again, favored by more than twothirds of the American people. It was challenged in Federal district court in Maryland and it was upheld against Second Amendment attack. They appealed to the Fourth Circuit of Appeals. It was upheld against Second Amendment attack. They went to the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court let it stand. So within the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, within our circuit, we have already got all of the legislation upheld as constitutional, which some people are saying you can’t do because of the Second Amendment. Stop hiding behind the Second Amendment. Stop hiding behind it. The Second Amendment is just like every other amendment. You can pass a reasonable regulation, as long as you don’t destroy the underlying right itself. Nobody is trying to take away anyone’s handgun for selfdefense. No one is trying to take away anyone’s rifle for hunting and recreational purposes. But you don’t need an AR–15 in order to go hunting. Any real hunter will tell you. You certainly don’t need to allow the sale of firearms in the United States of America to criminals and terrorists and gang members in order to support the Second Amendment. That is ludicrous. It is absurd. We should stop spreading that propaganda. I think it is just so important that we get this message out to the American public. Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to say that, for 242 years, whenever and wherever America’s freedom has been threatened, we called in the Marines. A Marine Corps infantry platoon is trained to close with and destroy the enemy by firearm and maneuver. That is what we do. That is our purpose. Marines kick in the door and kill the bad guys. Period. I know because that is what I had to do in Iraq. My platoon fought doortodoor against deadly insurgents. For this mission, the Marine Corps issued me an M–16 A4. The M–16 is a weapon designed with exquisite precision for the singular purpose of killing as many people as possible in the shortest amount of time. It is not for deer hunting. It is for killing people. The original M–16 was relentlessly refined to take enemy lives in combat. But you might know the version available in stores called an AR–15. Republicans and their bosses at the NRA believe almost anyone should be able to carry this weapon of war. That is right. Republicans honestly believe that this killing machine has a place in our communities. They think that a weapon very similar to one I carried in Al Anbar belongs on the streets of Phoenix. That is idiotic, and I will explain why. Republicans aren’t just ignoring the voices of the thousands of victims. They are also denying basic physics. Because a round from an AR–15 is larger and leaves the muzzle traveling faster, it will impact the body without about three times more energy than a bullet from a handgun. Surgeons treating the Parkland victims described organs that looked like ‘‘overripe melons smashed by a sledgehammer.’’ They talk about exit wounds as big as oranges. They recount opening bodies of these children, hoping to stem the bleeding, and discovering that, as one doctor put it, ‘‘there was nothing left to repair.’’ And here is the thing: that is not an unexpected outcome. Delivering fatal wounds that no surgeon can fix is the whole point of these weapons. That is precisely why they were given to us in combat. The AR–15 also has a standard magazine of 30 rounds. Those 30 rounds are necessary if you are putting down suppressive fire or engaging insurgents. They are not very useful when you are hunting deer. Mr. Speaker, I can confidently say that if you need more than a handful of shots to put down the deer, you are probably the problem, not the weapon. In addition, the AR–15 has a significantly faster effective rate of fire than a boltaction hunting rifle or a handgun. That means you can shoot more people in less time. That means police officers responding to the scene of a shooting will be outgunned and outmatched. That means more children will die in the classrooms before help can arrive. I went through literally thousands of hours of training to become a marine. It was arduous and grueling. I was taught how to clean and care for my weapon. I had to pass a rigorous marksmanship test. I was only armed after I earned the privilege and responsibility for that weapon. In contrast, my Republican friends think anyone should be able to walk into a sporting goods store anywhere in America and walk out with an AR–15. When children are slaughtered in their classrooms, we respond with thoughts and prayers instead of smarter policies or stronger laws. We are asked to simply accept this bloodshed as an unavoidable fact of American life. Not anymore. How about this? Let’s reform our background check system. Let’s ban assault rifles and keep weapons of war out of our communities. Then, if people are truly desperate to fire those types of weapons, they can do what I did: go to www.marines.mil and enlist. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

HONORING THE LIFE OF MARVIN ‘‘CY’’ MEYERS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the life of Marvin ‘‘Cy’’ Meyers and recognize his lifelong service to the United States Military and to his community of Winlock and across Lewis County. Born during the Great Depression and from a military family, Cy grew up poor, but he had an abundant love of family. In the summer of 1943, Cy joined the Marines and served in World War II, where he fought at Iwo Jima. After his service in the military, Cy came home to the Pacific Northwest and met the love of his life, Bonita. A friend of Cy’s started an egg farm in Winlock and asked him to work delivering eggs, a job Cy maintained for 20 years. Cy and Bonita bought a home in Winlock, where they settled for the remainder of their lives and raised their four children. Cy was a cornerstone community member. Everyone in Lewis County knew him. He served on the city council, Educational Service District 113 Board, Civil Service Commission, Board of Adjustment, and the Washington State Republicans Executive Board. Cy also served as mayor of Winlock for 6 years. Please join me in honoring the selfless and passionate dedication of Marvin ‘‘Cy’’ Meyers and his legacy that will remain with us all, as this was the week that he left this world for the next. We love him. We are grateful to him and his family for his service, and we will remember him. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. f
