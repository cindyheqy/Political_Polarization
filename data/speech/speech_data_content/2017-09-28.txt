Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today especially pleased to have had my personal pastor, Todd Mullins, give our opening prayer this morning to the House of Representatives. I am honored to welcome Pastor Mullins onto the floor of the House of Representatives as our guest chaplain this morning, and I thank him for sharing those very important words with our colleagues and that scripture as well. Todd Mullins is the senior pastor of Christ Fellowship in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, where he served since his father founded the church in 1984. I can say a great deal about my friend, Pastor Todd Mullins, but the most important thing that I could say about him is that he is a man of God, and that he works every single day to try to help and change lives. I think that is the most important thing any one of us can do. That is why I am so proud to call him a friend. He is a person who has devoted his life to working on the lives of others. f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to join my colleagues in calling for a vote on H.R. 3440, the clean Dream Act, a bipartisan, bicameral bill with 200 cosponsors in the House. It builds upon the great success of DACA, which opened the door for nearly 800,000 DREAMers who had come forward, passed background checks, and have been granted permission to live and work legally in America without fear of deportation. They kept their promise to the Nation they know and love, and our government must honor its commitment to protect them. The faith community and business leaders are imploring Congress to pass the Dream Act. Polling shows that the American people strongly believe and support the DREAMers. Eightysix percent of Americans support a right to residency for undocumented immigrants who arrived in the United States as children, according to a recent ABC News/Washington Post poll. Mr. Speaker, as a proud nation of many immigrants from around the world, the Dream Act honors our history and our heritage. I thank my Republican colleagues who have signed on, and I urge all others to join us. It is the right thing to do for our young people, especially our country. Support H.R. 3440, the Dream Act. 
RECOGNIZING HOPE THAT BINDS (Mr. COMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Hope That Binds, an organization based out of Carlisle County, Kentucky, that aids in domestic and international adoption services. The organization was recently recognized as a 2017 Angels in Adoption honoree. Wendy DavisWilson, Jeff and Benita Davis, and Brooke Kelly have all dedicated their time to bridging the gaps in the complicated adoption processing. Wendy and Brandon, adoptive parents themselves, have a sincere passion for ensuring resources are available for families wishing to adopt. Through Hope That Binds, a network of loving families is growing and expanding constantly. To date, more than 40 families have been assisted through the organization’s fundraisers and grant programs. In addition, I would like to recognize Josh and Mandy Thurman, who were also selected as Angels in Adoption honorees. After a 2year adoption process starting in 2013, the Thurmans brought their son, Townes, home to Simpson County from Ethiopia. Families like the Davises and Thurmans make a major difference in the lives of children who need loving families. On behalf of the First District of Kentucky, I congratulate both families in their efforts to make the dream of a family a reality for children in need. f 
ZERO MAJOR LEGISLATIVE ACCOMPLISHMENTS (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, here we are 9 months into the year, and the Republicanled Congress has zero major legislative accomplishments to show for it. While Democrats continue to offer an agenda that gives Americans a better deal, really a better life, Republicans are continually obsessed with their Republican healthcare bill, this repeal and replace. Recently, they have had to pull back again from their GrahamCassidy approach to this. Why? Because it means less care, less coverage, higher premiums, higher copays. It is bad policy. We ought to be focusing on what we need to do to make it right to fix the problems we see in healthcare, not this obsession to check a political box and repeal healthcare for the American people. Meanwhile, there is no infrastructure plan. America’s roads and bridges are falling apart. There is nothing on the floor of the House to address that— something the American people all agree we need to do. There has been nothing done to make sure that 800,000 DREAMers are not deported away. They have a tax plan that rewards 5,400 American families with a quarter of a trillion dollars in tax breaks. This is the wrong direction for America. 
RECOGNIZING BICENTENNIAL OF PETERSBURG, INDIANA (Mr. BUCSHON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of a notable Hoosier milestone, the bicentennial of the city of Petersburg, Indiana. Located in Pike County, this southern Indiana community was settled on land donated by Peter Brenton in 1817, and was established just 1 year later after Indiana had become a State. From its earliest days as a pioneer settlement near the Buffalo Trace and the White River, Petersburg is today a vibrant commercial and residential community and the seat of the county government. Blessed with an abundance of natural resources, it is a leader in Indiana’s power generation industry. While rightfully proud of its favorite son, baseball great Gil Hodges, Petersburg is squarely focused on a promising future. It boasts wonderful, new downtown housing, a new county public library, and just dedicated its new fire department. It looks forward to exciting development opportunities along I– 69. I proudly salute the city of Petersburg; its mayor, R.C. Klipsch; and its loyal citizens on this historic occasion. f 
SENIOR PROTECTION BILL (Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of bipartisan, commonsense legislation to help protect our seniors from elder abuse, fraud, and neglect. The Senior Citizen Protection Act would create a national registry of convicted elder abusers that accredited healthcare providers, and the public could check before hiring employees who will work with seniors. While some States already have created elder abuse registries, there is currently no nationally searchable database of the Statelevel data. As our population ages, the problem of those who seek to take advantage of vulnerable seniors continues to grow. Families deserve the peace of mind that their parents and loved ones will receive the best possible care at senior facilities and nursing homes from qualified staff. I urge my colleagues to join me and the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN ) on this senior protection legislation; and I urge them to continue to support Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid programs that millions of seniors depend on to live out their retirement years with dignity and security. 
RECOGNIZING MIDDLETOWN POLICE OFFICER MEGAN FREER (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, over the course of several weeks this summer, our Nation focused on my district as the tragic news of missing teenagers led the news. My heart goes out to the families of those boys and our entire community touched by this tragedy. In that darkness, we saw the best of our community shine through: neighbors in prayer; local businesses engaged in investigation efforts; and through it all, the commitment and the dedication of our local law enforcement officers. One such officer, Middletown Township Police Officer Megan Freer, was recently recognized at the National Liberty Museum in Philadelphia for 
her investigatory work. Middletown Police Chief Joe Bartorilla noted well: Megan exemplifies our law enforcement who are committed to doing the very best job they can, day in and day out to protect and safeguard our citizens. Mr. Speaker, I am proud of Officer Freer and the entire law enforcement community in Bucks County, to include District Attorney Matt Weintraub, who committed to this investigation. Through their efforts, our community can begin to heal from this terrible tragedy that we suffered. 
b0915 HEALTHCARE CRISIS (Mrs. BUSTOS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, we are here, almost 10 months into this congressional session, and what has been accomplished? While TrumpCare supporters have gone back and forth on a plan that would take healthcare away from millions of Americans, raise out ofpocket costs for people with preexisting conditions, and force too many rural hospitals to close their doors, they have completely missed a real healthcare crisis that is coming tomorrow. That is when Federal funding runs out for thousands of community health clinics and for millions of lowincome children and for pregnant women across our country. For years, community health clinics and the Children’s Health Insurance Program have enjoyed strong bipartisan support from both sides of the aisle here. So why aren’t we voting to protect these critical programs right now? Mr. Speaker, we were sent here to help the hardworking families that we serve and offer them a better deal. Now that the TrumpCare package has thankfully failed again, I hope we can start doing that. 
SUPPORTING DACA (Mr. RUIZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, the decision to end DACA goes against the very core of our American values of the American Dream. The future of 800,000 young people who study, serve in our military, and contribute to our economy, and who serve and protect America is at risk. DREAMers are understandably worried, anxious, depressed, petrified, and terrified about what will happen 6 months from now. DREAMers like Juan in my district who was brought here at a young age is a medical student and wants nothing more than to be a doctor and save lives—even your life. For Juan and nearly 1 million DREAMers like him, we must act. That is why I have joined House and Senate leaders to demand a vote on the bipartisan Dream Act. Mr. Speaker, put politics aside and bring the Dream Act to the floor for a vote as soon as possible. Rather than ending the DACA program and tearing families apart, instead, let’s work together toward comprehensive immigration reform that will secure our Nation’s borders, keep our citizens safe, help our economy, and fix our immigration system. f

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. ALLEN ) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia. 
Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on S. 1866. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia? There was no objection. Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 1866, the Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria Education Relief Act of 2017. Mr. Speaker, September has been a difficult month for many students and families in areas such as Texas, Louisiana, Florida, Puerto Rico, and even my State of Georgia, just to name a few. We have all seen the truly saddening images of families who have been impacted by the likes of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, and now we must come together as a nation to help our fellow Americans recover from these lifechanging storms. These storms have left many Americans with questions on how to continue living their daily lives as they try to return to a sense of normalcy, and students are no exception. Hundreds of thousands of students have been impacted by these storms, and the Federal Government must be ready to address the needs of students, as well as their institutions of learning, so that their education may continue. The Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria Education Relief Act of 2017 allows the Department of Education, as well as other Federal entities, to use the emergency tools at their disposal to immediately assist students impacted by the storms of this past month without the need of additional appropriations from Congress. First, the bill equips the Department of Education with temporary authority to waive certain rules governing campusbased aid programs for those institutions impacted by recent hurricanes. Second, the legislation ensures students and teachers at private schools receive services under the Project SERV grant program. This program helps school districts and institutions of higher education reestablish a safe learning environment after a violent or traumatic crisis. The program has issued grants to school districts, State educational agencies, and institutions of higher education after natural disasters, including Superstorm Sandy. These funds have helped reopen schools or, in some cases, provided resources to operate a school at an alternative site while the original site is being repaired. Mr. Speaker, Congress has the power to use its resources to help students and families return to a sense of normalcy after these terrible storms, and we should do everything within our authority to help students remain on a pathway to success even in the aftermath of these storms. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support S. 1866, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 1866, but I also stand concerned about the humanitarian crisis going on in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands in the wake of Hurricane Maria and also the other hurricanes that have been in the area. More than 3.4 million people reside in Puerto Rico alone—U.S. citizens who are in need of full support of the Federal Government. This is more than the population of Wyoming, Vermont, North Dakota, and Alaska combined— U.S. citizens, yet they have no voting Members of Congress. U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands serve in our military. In fact, Puerto Ricans serve in our military at a rate twice the general U.S. population, and they are hurting. They are fighting to survive, and they are in desperate need of food, clean water, medical supplies, and security. Hurricane Maria essentially wiped out ports, roads, electricity, communications, water supply, crops, and many homes. Today, 97 percent of Puerto Rico’s residents are still without power, and 40 percent do not have access to clean drinking water. So Americans in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands are now homeless, displaced, and without food, water, fuel, and medication. Congress and this administration have an obligation to act swiftly and to act boldly to ease the suffering of our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. This bill, the Hurricane Relief Act, is wellintentioned and a good starting point. But make no mistake, the limited flexibility offered to those affected by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria in this bill will be helpful, but the bill does not go far enough to provide the kind of relief that is needed in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. These Americans do not have voting representation in Congress that allows their representatives to most effectively advocate on their behalf. Therefore, it is incumbent on all of us to stand shoulder to shoulder with our fellow citizens and provide them with the support that they desperately need. This is a lifeanddeath situation, and any further delay for aid will lead to unnecessary tragedy. So I urge this body to bring a full emergency supplemental bill to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands to a vote. The citizens affected by the hurricane are running out of time. Mr. Speaker, I ask that we pass the bill, but, after we pass it, get right to work on a full relief bill for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to add that this legislation does not call for additional appropriations on the part of Congress and provides the Department of Education with limited authority to act until it has sufficiently assisted the students and families of these impacted regions. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation for the people impacted by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of S. 1866, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. ALLEN ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 1866. 
The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
CONTROL UNLAWFUL FUGITIVE FELONS ACT OF 2017 Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 533, I call up the bill (H.R. 2792) to amend the Social Security Act to make certain revisions to provisions limiting payment of benefits to fugitive felons under titles II, VIII, and XVI of the Social Security Act, and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 533, the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the Committee on Ways and Means, printed in the bill, is adopted and the bill, as amended, is considered read. The text of the bill, as amended, is as follows: 
H.R. 2792 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Control Unlawful Fugitive Felons Act of 2017’’. 
SEC. 2. REVISIONS TO PROVISIONS LIMITING PAYMENT OF BENEFITS TO FUGITIVE FELONS UNDER TITLE XVI OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT. 
(a) F UGITIVE FELON WARRANT REQUIRE MENT .—Section 1611(e)(4)(A)(i) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1382(e)(4)(A)(i)) is amended— (1) by striking ‘‘fleeing to avoid’’ and inserting ‘‘the subject of an arrest warrant for the purpose of’’; (2) by striking ‘‘the place from which the person flees’’ the first place it appears and inserting ‘‘the jurisdiction issuing the warrant’’; and (3) by striking ‘‘the place from which the person flees’’ the second place it appears and inserting ‘‘the jurisdiction’’. (b) PROBATION AND PAROLE WARRANT REQUIREMENT .—Section 1611(e)(4)(A)(ii) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1382(e)(4)(A)(ii)) is amended to read as follows: ‘‘(ii) the subject of an arrest warrant for violating a condition of probation or parole imposed under Federal or State law.’’. (c) DISCLOSURE .—Section 1611(e)(5) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1382(e)(5)) is amended— (1) by striking ‘‘any recipient of’’ and inserting ‘‘any individual who is a recipient of (or would be such a recipient but for the application of paragraph (4)(A))’’; and (2) by striking ‘‘the recipient’’ each place it appears and inserting ‘‘the individual’’. (d) EFFECTIVE DATE.—The amendments made by this section shall be effective with respect to benefits payable for months that begin on or after January 1, 2021. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from South Dakota (Mrs. NOEM) and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. DANNY K. D AVIS) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from South Dakota. 
Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the bill currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from South Dakota? There was no objection. Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2792, the Control of Unlawful Fugitive Felons Act of 2017. In 1996, Congress and President Clinton worked together to reform welfare and reignite the American Dream for families in need. Aligned with this goal was a provision prohibiting a range of welfare benefits—including Supplemental Security Income—to fugitive felons and violators of probation and parole because safety net programs need to be protected from abuse so they can remain in place for those individuals who need them. Individuals who evade justice violate the social contract that grants them this safety net. Simply put, it is incoherent and selfdefeating that a nation of laws would pay a wanted person and prolong their flight from justice. Unfortunately, due to a number of factors involving the courts, these provisions have been watered down in recent years and rendered ineffectual. Through the CUFF Act, Congress can stand up, once again, on behalf of our communities and affirm what every participant in our society should understand: if you have an outstanding warrant for your arrest, you have an obligation to face justice or clear your name. This legislation not only stops benefits from going to those who are not following the law, but it also helps law enforcement apprehend those suspects. A 2007 report by SSA’s inspector general found that this policy aided law enforcement in apprehending almost 60,000 individuals who were evading arrest for outstanding warrants. In fact, law enforcement thinks this policy is so effective that the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Sheriffs’ Association, and the South Dakota Sheriffs’ Association have expressed support for the CUFF Act. Unfortunately, despite the fact that this commonsense bill is endorsed by law enforcement and has a proven track record of success, I anticipate that my colleagues across the aisle may try to convince you otherwise. I have heard many of their arguments when the Ways and Means Committee considered this bill and when the Rules Committee also considered this bill. So let’s take each of those concerns in turn. Some may say that this is an old, failed policy. In reality, this policy has a long track record of success. In 2015, the Social Security inspector general said, at a hearing, that this bill would stop hundreds of millions of dollars in payments to individuals with felony warrants. Some may say this bill targets people with outdated warrants. In reality, SSA already has a wide authority to exempt individuals if the alleged offense is nonviolent and not drug related. b0930 Some may say that this bill would throw beneficiaries off the rolls with no warning. In reality, the SSA provides beneficiaries advance notice of 35 days before suspending SSI benefits, and there is a robust appeal process for recipients who have had their benefits suspended. Some may say that this policy is burdensome to law enforcement. In reality, this bill is supported by the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Sheriffs’ Association, and the South Dakota Sheriffs’ Association because it helps them do their job to locate individuals. Finally, some may raise concerns that it targets minority populations caught up in overcriminalization or overly harsh sentencing. To those concerns, I say that these issues are absolutely important, and I look forward to us having those conversations about criminal justice reforms here in Congress. However, that conversation is outside the scope of the legislation that we have before us today. My legislation does not speak to the content of a warrant, just the fact that one exists. The decision to grant a warrant is made by a judge in a court of law, not by the Social Security Administration. It should not be the duty of the American taxpayer to subsidize individuals who are wanted by the police. Simply put, Mr. Speaker, if an individual has an outstanding warrant, it must be addressed and cleared. This bill does nothing to change that. Under my bill, nobody will lose their SSI benefits because of misdemeanor offenses such as merely having a parking ticket, petty theft, or even driving under the influence. This bill stops payments to individuals who have outstanding warrants for felonies. These are crimes like murder, rape, and kidnapping. It also stops payments to individuals with probation and parole violations, limiting their ability to evade arrest. Supplemental Security Income is a lifeline to those who are in need. We must ensure we are not further facilitating criminal activity in communities that are all too often already struggling. Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the time that we are spending to consider this important legislation, and I appreciate the opportunity to stand in support of my bill today. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, my mother used to say: Right is right if nobody is right, and 
wrong is wrong if everybody is wrong. H.R. 2792 is wrong. It is cruel. It is discriminatory. I strongly oppose this Republican effort to strip lowincome seniors and those with severe disabilities of Supplemental Security Income benefits, or SSI. I join in opposition with over 110 civil rights, disability, and aging advocates who have warned that H.R. 2792’s harsh cuts will discriminate based on age, race, ethnicity, ability, income, and will further criminalize poverty. I also strongly oppose the majority’s decision to condition the reauthorization of our successful home visiting program on this bill’s harm to the elderly and infirm. SSI is only available to people who are elderly, who are severely disabled, and who have little or no assets. The typical SSI recipient lives on less than $750 a month. So, by design, H.R. 2792, will only harm very poor, elderly, and disabled people. Within the population of adult recipients of SSI, approximately 83 percent are disabled, one third are age 65 and older, and two thirds are age 50 and older. I reject proponents’ claims that this bill will only target fugitive felons. In reality, current law terminates benefits for fugitive felons. This bill strikes the current restriction against fugitive felons and, instead, expands the benefit cutoff beyond those who are actually fleeing and encompasses everybody who had some unresolved runin with the justice system based on allegation, not conviction. I reject proponents’ claim that only individuals charged with violent crimes or costly financial theft are affected by this bill. By undermining the constitutional presumption of innocence and depriving individuals of due process adjudication in a court of law, H.R. 2792 magnifies the deep inequities in our criminal justice system based on race, ethnicity, and income. As an AfricanAmerican man, I am very familiar with the decades of research documenting the racialethnic discrimination in our justice system. As an advocate for criminal justice reform, I know the dozens of studies documenting the faulty criminal justice data system on which benefit terminations will pivot solely because this bill removes due process by adjudication. I reject proponents’ claim that no one who has a misdemeanor or minor offense will be harmed. No uniform threshold for a felony exists. Indeed, four States—Florida, Massachusetts, Virginia, and New Jersey—have the lowest thresholds in the country, defining felonies as losses of $300 or less, which is vastly different than the $2,500 threshold set in Texas and Wisconsin. This bill cuts off an elderly or disabled person’s lifeline benefits for a decades old offense of $300. Also, we know that courts across the country are criminalizing poverty and raising revenue with fines and fees. Individuals on probation for misdemeanor offenses like vagrancy, shoplifting, and traffic violations get probation and fines or fees. When poor people can’t pay these fees, arrest warrants are issued for a violation of their probation. As in the past, H.R. 2792 clearly terminates SSI benefits for such alleged violations without any due process. I urge my colleagues to do what they know is right: stand up for our most vulnerable citizens, honor their most fundamental rights, and oppose H.R. 2792. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD two letters of support. One is from the over 330,000 members of the National Fraternal Order of Police, and the other is from the National Sheriffs’ Association. 
NATIONAL FRATERNAL ORDER OF POLICE , Washington, DC, June 29, 2017. Hon. KRISTI L. N OEM, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. SAMUEL R. J OHNSON , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR REPRESENTATIVES NOEM AND JOHNSON: I am writing on behalf of the members of the Fraternal Order of Police to advise you of our support for H.R. 2792, the ‘‘Control Unlawful Fugitive Felons (CUFF) Act.’’ In August 1996, President Clinton signed the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act into law, which restricted the eligibility of fugitive felons, and probation and parole violators for Social Security benefits. The Social Security Administration’s Office of the Inspector General (OIG) reported that this law has contributed to over 59,000 arrests since the inception of the program in 1996. However, three different court decisions have eroded the law’s effectiveness and the original intent of Congress, allowing fugitives to continue to collect benefits while on the run. This legislation will restore the original intent of the law by prohibiting an individual who is the subject of an outstanding arrest warrant for a felony or parole violation from receiving Social Security benefits. The legislation will apply only to felony charges and amend the Social Security Act to make clear that the suspension of benefits is not just in cases of ‘‘escape, flight to avoid prosecution, or confinement, and flightescape.’’ The American taxpayer should not be forced to support those who are evading justice. On behalf of the more than 330,000 members of the Fraternal Order of Police, thank you for your support for law enforcement. If I can be of any further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me or Jim Pasco, my Senior Advisor, in my Washington office. Sincerely, CHUCK CANTERBURY , National President. 
NATIONAL SHERIFFS ’ ASSOCIATION , Alexandria, VA, June 20, 2017. Hon. DAVEREICHERT , Chairman, Subcommittee on Trade, Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARCHAIRMAN REICHERT : On behalf of the National Sheriffs’ Association, I write today to endorse H.R. 2792, the ‘‘Control Unlawful Fugitive Felons (CUFF) Act.’’ Too often, criminal felons receive federal benefits they are not entitled to collect. We believe this clarifying legislation will help remediate this recurring problem and strike the right balance. The bill does a number of important things including: amending the Social Security Act to prohibit an individual who is the subject of an outstanding arrest warrant for a felony or parole violation from receiving Social Security Benefits; restoring the original intent of the 1996 law, revising current law to discontinue benefits for individuals who are ‘‘the subject of an arrest warrant . . .’’ compared to the previous language of ‘‘fleeing to avoid’’ arrest, which was the main legal challenge; and applying only to felony charges, or a crime carrying a minimum term of one or more years in prison. This policy does not intend to punish individuals convicted of misdemeanors, such as outstanding parking tickets, as some have alleged. Like you, I believe this is a commonsense bill that will give more Americans piece of mind in knowing that tax dollars aren’t supporting criminal activity through continued benefits to those breaking the law. I applaud your efforts on this issue and look forward to working with you to ensure the passage of this key legislation. Sincerely, JONATHAN F. T HOMPSON , Executive Director and CEO. 
Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DOGGETT ). Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his leadership. Mr. Speaker, this bill is all about Republicans refusing to pay for an important public service that they know works. It is about their meager 6 percent solution, where they decline to extend services that empower families, that support young children and their parents, to extend that to the other 94 percent of eligible Americans, despite the fact that there is evidencebased indication that these services perform so well, and in one area, helped to prevent child abuse. It is about their refusal to respond in a fiscally responsible manner to support this program, despite what their own experts say about the effectiveness of the program. So, instead of providing a reliable source of necessary funding for public services, Republicans insist upon being willing to remove lifesustaining resources from some of our country’s most vulnerable citizens. It is really a punitive, meanspirited effort to demonize the poor. Let’s look at who will be hurt by this retread proposal, because they tried this a few years ago and it was rejected. SSI, or Supplemental Security Income, is an initiative to help some of our most disadvantaged Americans. The SSI program pays modest cash benefits that can be obtained only by, essentially, showing that you have got nothing—well, not exactly nothing. You can have total assets other than your home of $2,000. You can’t have more than $735 a month in income. If you are younger than 65, you must be disabled, perhaps a victim of cancer, chronic heart failure, or blindness. 
There is strict enforcement of these standards, with over 70 percent of those who apply being denied. What kind of person will they finance this child abuse prevention program from? Well, the 50yearold man who had an arrest warrant—this is a true case—that had been issued when he failed to show up for court. Why did he do that? Shouldn’t he be punished? Well, it turns out he was in a coma at the time that the arrest warrant was issued. He was unable to breathe without a long plastic tube surgically inserted in his throat and connected to an oxygen tank on his wheelchair. By the time his case was resolved before a judge, the medical supply company was taking away the breathing equipment. Or Rosa Martinez, who got confused with another Rosa Martinez, and she had to go to court even though she wasn’t the person being accused. Each of these people and so many others, like those suffering from dementia in a nursing home and who may never have been convicted of anything, are the type of people from whom they will take resources in order to fund a necessary program. Republicans on our committee are so motivated by their rigid ideology that they would not even permit a discussion with our staff of how to move forward on this initiative unless we committed to funding every dollar by taking it away from some other vital social service program within our committee’s jurisdiction. It ought not be necessary to rob Paula in order to provide valuable services to little Pauline. Even when they know how much is at stake, such as child abuse and disadvantaged children, and even when we have a way to address those problems and prevent that abuse, they won’t add a single dollar of additional revenue. Mr. DAVIS and I offered a variety of different ways to pay for this program and to actually see it serve more than 6 percent of eligible people. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. ROGERS of Alabama). The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds. Mr. DOGGETT. You don’t have to raise taxes. For one of those different ways, just enforce our current law. If someone receives an alimony payment, require documentation so they will know and the IRS will know that that money is due. That will raise a significant amount of money that would fund much of this reauthorization. But because they are so opposed to adding a dollar to serve even an effective program, they take from the person with dementia at the nursing home. It is wrong. It demonizes people who deserve to be treated fairly. We should reject this bill. Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I want to clarify exactly what this legislation does. This legislation will take SSI benefits from individuals and stop those payments to those who have felony arrest warrants or who have violated their probation and parole. I want to go through the process so that everybody recognizes that there is plenty of time for individuals to go through the appeal process. Notice is given if there is a warrant that they need to get rectified with the jurisdiction that has authority. So let me step through this process. Step one is through the Office of Inspector General. Law enforcement agencies give OIG information about individuals who have outstanding felony arrest warrants or who are violating conditions of probation or parole. Then OIG compares this information to its computer files of individuals receiving these dollars or serving as representative payees. If there is a match, OIG verifies the identity of the individual, ensures that the warrants for the individual are still active, works with local law enforcement to attempt to locate the person, and then OIG refers the cases to SSA to begin the suspension process. When this process gets to the Social Security Administration, SSA sends an advance notice to the individual. This notice proposes the suspension of benefit payments and informs the individual of their right to appeal the suspension decision, payment continuation, and the timeframe to take such actions after receiving the advance notice. b0945 This notice includes why the SSA is suspending benefits and where, why, and when the warrant was issued. If SSA finds out, through a data match, 35 days is given for the individual to protest. If the individual protests, SSA will not suspend benefits until it figures out if the individual qualifies for a good cause exception. If the individual does not appeal his or her advance notice, then the SSA will suspend the benefits. If the individual does appeal and gives his or her advance notice and provides evidence for the payment continuation, the SSA verifies the evidence and then continues the payments. Other things that we should know about this legislation and what this includes is that warrants may only be resolved in the issuing jurisdiction. Grounds for dismissal of a warrant include identity theft, administrative error, and the individual’s own move from the jurisdiction, especially if low income. Warrants for misdemeanors remain warrants for misdemeanors and cannot become felonies. There is also latitude for the Commissioner to make decisions in special areas where there may be something to be considered, such as dementia or lowincome abilities. Mr. Speaker, this bill has been thoroughly vetted. We are making sure that the only people who are denied their SSI benefits are those who have felony warrants for their arrest or have violated probation or parole and have not gotten straight with law enforcement and rectified that past infraction. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. LEWIS), an icon for human rights. Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this bill. For many years, I have been a proud member to serve on the Ways and Means Committee, the oldest committee in the U.S. Congress. Our committee has a responsibility to put people before politics. We have a commitment to act in the best interest of all, not just a select few. Most importantly, we have a duty to protect and preserve the United States Constitution. Today, Mr. Speaker, it hurts my soul that our committee will pass a bill that attacks the constitutional principle that you are innocent until proven guilty. Where is the reason? Where is the compassion? What is the purpose? How can you gamble with the livelihood of those who are most in need? How can we punish the sick, the disabled, and the elderly? How can we pass a bill that targets Latinos, African Americans, and Native Americans? Mr. Speaker, how can you rob Peter to pay Paul? Mr. Speaker, I urge each and every one of my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this mean and spiteful bill. It should never have seen the light of day. The American people deserve better, much better. We can do better. This bill should not be on the floor of the House. It is not worthy of the paper that it is written on. Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I live in the State of South Dakota. I have some of the poorest counties in the Nation in my State, and they happen to be my Native American Tribes. They face 80 to 90 percent unemployment, poverty like no other place in the country, and they are isolated. They also have very high drug and crime rates. In fact, we have seen a record number of murders in these communities, especially on the Pine Ridge Reservation, in this calendar year, and it is deeply discouraging and disheartening to me to think of someone who could have committed a murder in one of my communities in the State of South Dakota, that there is a felony warrant out for their arrest, and that we may not be able to find them. This bill will fix that situation. If that individual is receiving SSI payments, that helps law enforcement locate those individuals who have gone out and committed crimes against innocent people. Rape, murder, kidnapping, they all happen in my Native 
American Tribes, and this helps law enforcement find them and bring them to justice. It is one of the important things that this legislation will help us do in some of our most vulnerable communities. I also recognize that the previous speaker talked about the fact that we need criminal justice reforms, and that is a very good debate that we should be having in Congress. But this is not the bill to talk about criminal justice reforms because this is not germane to the discussion that we are having today. I wanted to speak for a minute on what is good cause because there is latitude for good cause within statute today, and I think there is some confusion as to exactly how this bill would be interpreted when it is signed into law. In some cases, the SSI will not suspend or seek an overpayment of payments for good cause exceptions. There are two types of good cause exceptions that already exist in statute. The mandatory good cause exception is the SSA cannot suspend payments if a court has found an individual not guilty or has dismissed charges. If a court has vacated the warrant or issued any similar exoneration, then they cannot suspend payments. They also cannot suspend payments if there is a mistaken identity due to identity fraud. The other exception in statute today is discretionary good cause exceptions. The SSA may suspend benefits for mitigating circumstances under two options: Option A is the individual must prove that the criminal offense was nonviolent and not drug related. We also have that the individual has not been convicted of a felony crime since the warrant was issued, and the other point is that the law enforcement agency that issued the warrant reports that it will not act on the warrant. That is other exceptions for good cause. Option B, the individual must prove all of these factors: if the criminal offense was nonviolent and not drug related; the individual has not been convicted of a felony crime since the warrant was issued; the warrant is the existing warrant and was issued 10 or more years ago and the individual lacks the mental capacity to resolve the warrant, which includes those living in a nursing home or mental treatment facility. So as we have listened to opponents of this bill talk, they have discussed all of these issues as to how these benefits could be taken away from individuals that are clearly covered by good cause exceptions that are already in statute, and those situations are not relevant to the debate that we are having today. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. JUDY CHU). Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, MIECHV Program is an effective evidencebased program that I am proud to support because I know it results in healthier families and stronger communities, but I am shocked at the way Republicans are choosing to pay for it. Instead of enacting commonsense tax changes that could easily raise the needed revenue, Republicans have reached to the bottom of the barrel to find vulnerable people to harm. In order to come up with a way to pay for this important bipartisan program, they are choosing to take Supplemental Security Income away from vulnerable seniors, lowincome individuals, or those with disabilities; and they are doing it by maligning them as fugitives and felons just because they have an outstanding warrant. But the truth is a very different story. The people who will be hurt by this bill are not hardened criminals. They haven’t even had their day in court yet. In fact, many may not even know about the warrant because the police have decided that it is not worth pursuing. That is because the warrants are for small issues like writing a bad check or failing to appear for a hearing many years ago. Worse, these individuals are elderly, poor, or sick. They deserve support and help, not to be treated as a piggybank. Actually, piggybanks generally indicate savings. This is a policy equivalent of reaching into a couch cushion for change. We are talking about individuals who have a warrant from when they were a teenager or somebody with a mental illness who may not even remember the incident in question. This is cruel and unbecoming of this Congress. I know because we have tried this before. The last time this penalty was used, it meant catastrophe for very lowincome people with disabilities and for seniors. It hurt people like J.H., a Californian with an intellectual disability and other mental impairments. J.H. had his SSI benefits stopped because of an Ohio warrant issued when he was 12 years old and running away to escape an abusive stepfather. This 4 foot7inchtall, 85pound boy was charged with assault for kicking a staff member at a detention center where he was being held until his mother could pick him up. Many years later, he had no recollection of the incident or the charges, but his SSI benefits were stopped nonetheless. Is that really how we want to pay for home visitations: Impoverishing one person to help another? That is why I worked to curb this bill’s negative effects, by offering amendments that would protect those with dementia or keep it from increasing homelessness. Unfortunately, Republicans rejected both my amendments on a party line basis, so now we are stuck with this overly broad punitive bill that I cannot support. Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, taxpayers should not be subsidizing those who have felony warrants for their arrest or violating parole and probation. I wanted to remind everyone today that in 1996, the same provision was amended into other programs that we have at the Federal Government level. Temporary Assistance for Needy Families—cash welfare—has these same provisions included in that program. Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program—SNAP or food stamps—has these same provisions in the program. Housing programs, such as public housing, Section 8 vouchers, projectbased Section 8, all have these same provisions in that program. In addition, there are similar provisions added to Social Security disability and retirement programs, and the Department of Veterans Affairs benefits has this same provision that we are putting back into statute today when it comes to SSI payments. Mr. Speaker, you can clearly see that this is bringing this program up to the same level of accountability to taxpayers and not subsidizing those who commit crimes against innocent individuals, and is an entirely appropriate debate here today. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time I have left? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Illinois has 15 minutes remaining, and the gentlewoman from South Dakota has 18 minutes remaining. Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. NADLER ). Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 2792, the hopelessly misnamed Control Unlawful Fugitive Felons Act. As has become sadly routine in this Chamber under Republican rule, this bill considers those merely accused of a crime as if they were convicted felons without bothering with little niceties like due process. Having dispensed with basic constitutional protections, the bill then cuts off vital government assistance to some of the most vulnerable people in our society. Under current law, the Social Security Administration helps law enforcement track down individuals with an outstanding arrest warrant for an alleged felony or an alleged violation of probation or parole. Those who are actively fleeing law enforcement can also have their Supplemental Security Income, or SSI, benefits terminated. Under this bill, however, SSI benefits, which serve as a lifeline for lowincome seniors and people with disabilities, would be terminated, whether or not people are actually attempting to evade justice. The mere issuance of a warrant or an alleged parole violation with no arrest, 
no trial, and no conviction would be enough to cut off vital benefits to the neediest among us. This is not just unconstitutional, it is inhumane. The bill would ensure that many lowincome seniors and people with disabilities will lose their benefits unfairly and unnecessarily. The vast majority of people affected by this bill have outstanding warrants that law enforcement chooses not to bother serving, often because they are for very old or minor offenses. Many people do not even know that an arrest warrant has been issued for them, but this bill would consider them as felons fleeing justice. Many warrants are issued on the basis of mistaken identity, inaccuracies, or paperwork errors. It can take months to resolve such errors, which might involve traveling to a distant jurisdiction, hiring an attorney, and working through an overloaded court system. And supporters of this bill expect people living on less than $750 a month to do all of this: to go to a different jurisdiction, to hire an attorney, to do all of this while the benefits they rely on to subsist are cut off? That is outrageous. b1000 We heard from the gentlewoman from South Dakota about various exceptions to the bill, you can go through this process and that process. With what attorney? With what money? Does this bill have an appropriation in it to supply attorneys for people faced with this cutoff, people who, by definition, are the poorest people, who can’t afford an attorney? This legislation is a blatant violation of due process, and it will cause untold suffering to the people who need our help the most. At a time when Republicans are unveiling their proposal for massive tax cuts for the wealthy, this bill is a shameful illustration of the majority’s priorities. It is also a shameful illustration of something we have seen on this floor too often, and that is the assumption that anyone accused of something is guilty and that we don’t have to bother with a trial, we don’t have to bother with proof, and we don’t have to bother with due process. That eviscerates much of the reason for the existence of this country, to vindicate due process, to give people rights and not to assume that anyone who a judge or someone thinks may have committed a crime is automatically guilty. We believe in due process in this country. Mr. Speaker, I urge this bill’s defeat. Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. SMITH), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Human Resources. I thank him for his leadership on this issue. Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2792 and to thank the gentlewoman from South Dakota for her tremendous effort on this piece of legislation. This is a good bill which improves existing law and sends an important message: taxpayers should not provide benefits to individuals wanted by the police under outstanding warrants or parole violations for felonies or other serious crimes. Let me say that again. This improves existing, actually, bipartisan law, and it is not a new concept. It only applies to individuals with outstanding warrants for serious crimes. The bill provides 4 years for the Social Security Administration to implement this law and to ensure benefits are not unfairly or improperly discontinued. It also provides a process under which SSA notifies beneficiaries of issues with an outstanding warrant or parole violation and provides time for them to address the concern with law enforcement. In addition, SSA is empowered to provide compassionate allowances for those with serious disabilities or medical concerns who are unable to clear their warrant in a timely fashion. Mr. Speaker, this is a narrow bill which protects both lawabiding beneficiaries and taxpayers. It is important that we have these funds to help the needy families who are benefiting from the MIECHV program, the home visitation program, a unique Federal program that actually shows that it makes a positive difference in the lives of young people and young families. Mr. Speaker, it is important that we look at the entire issue in a fiscally responsible way, where we have the funds through this bill to pay for the needs among needy families across America. Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. LEE). Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, first, let me thank the gentleman from Illinois for yielding and for his tireless leadership for families everywhere. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 2792, the socalled Control Unlawful Fugitive Felons Act. This cruel and misguided bill would terminate Supplemental Security Income benefits for vulnerable seniors and people with disabilities who have an outstanding warrant. Let me be clear. This is a horrible bill. It is meanspirited and it is unfair. Despite this bill’s misleading title, Americans who would be harmed by this bill are not felons and they are not fugitives. In reality, this bill would rip benefits from individuals who haven’t been arrested, tried, or even convicted. They have only been accused. This violates the basic principle of innocent until proven guilty, and it would terminate benefits without due process. What is worse, most of these outstanding warrants are decades old and involve minor infractions when people are unable to pay for court fines and fees. This is awful. This bill criminalizes families living in poverty, and it disproportionately harms communities of color. One in five SSI recipients are African Americans. Without this critical program, believe you me, African Americans will struggle even more. Make no mistake; cutting off SSI benefits would put all families at risk of being unable to keep a roof over their heads, put food on the table, and meet other basic needs. And for what? To pay for the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting program. We know that this is an important program and helps millions of struggling families, but we cannot afford to rob Peter to pay Paul. Lives are at risk here. This is as sinister as it gets. Taking an ax to these lifesaving benefits is cruel and heartless. That is why 120 civil rights, disability, and retirement organizations oppose this, including the NAACP, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, the League of United Latin American Citizens, the National Council of Churches, and the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentlewoman. Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, this should really be a wakeup call to this Chamber to defeat this bill immediately. Instead of ramming through a bill that would push more people into poverty, we should be working to create good paying jobs and expand opportunities for all. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this meanspirited and heartless bill. Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I just want to remind everyone that the bill we are debating here today would suspend SSI benefits for those who have felony warrants for their arrest and those who have violated probation or parole. That is the discussion that we are having here today. And let’s go back over, in summary, what the policy actually does and says. This policy should not be thought of in isolation. This is part of a larger effort to reauthorize the evidencebased, outcomefocused Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting program. H.R. 2824, which passed this Chamber on Tuesday, will be joined with this bill upon passage. It helps to improve the lives of families in atrisk communities, focusing on the first years of a child’s life. Unlike most Federal social programs, MIECHV funding is tied to real results, which ensures limited taxpayer dollars are actually delivering the intended results and helping those that are most in need. Under current law, the program is 100 percent federally funded, but H.R. 2824 introduces a Federal match similar to what States must already do in other social programs, such as foster care, 
Medicaid, child support enforcement, childcare, and others. The rest of the package ensures this program remains a shining example of evidencebased policy by expecting the program to continue to demonstrate effective outcomes. That reauthorization is fully offset by the bill that we are considering here today, H.R. 2792. Instead of focusing on our Nation’s debt, we should be doing more of what we are doing right here in these bills: prioritizing Federal spending and focusing on what works by improving the integrity of one program to provide funding for another. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON  LEE). Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman from Illinois for yielding and the gentlewoman from South Dakota for managing this bill. The crux of this bill, however, is, again, to support and fund the multitrilliondollar tax cuts that have just been introduced, that will give millions, if not billions, if not trillions, to the richest of Americans, and that is a very sad commentary. I oppose the Control Unlawful Fugitive Felons Act because it is not that. It will terminate essential benefits for poor people, deprive poor people of due process, and increase mass incarceration. If the Rules Committee had simply taken my amendment, it would have remedied these criminal justice defects, which struck the arrest warrant language because it recklessly targets vulnerable people. This bill deprives citizens of due process, particularly where many poor individuals are completely unaware of a pending warrant. Let me be very clear. What you have is a situation where you may have a mentally ill individual in a nursing home who now has a warrant that they are not aware of. You will then cut off their benefits. What does that do to those families. Prohibiting SSI payments to individuals with an outstanding warrant or parole or probation violation without due process is simply inhumane. This bill would terminate those benefits from very lowincome seniors and people with disabilities. They may not even know that they have these warrants. Now, I am a strong supporter of the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting program, and I tell you that the Democrats on the Ways and Means Committee had an amendment to pay for a 5year reauthorization of that program, doubling the funding, by closing a tax loophole. They were not allowed to even vote on that amendment. What does that say? This is a conspiracy. There are 110 organizations that are against this, including the Alliance for Retired Americans, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Hand in Hand: The Domestic Employers Network, and the Coalition on Human Needs. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  a document with the names of all of these organizations. 
JUNE26, 2017. DEARMEMBERS OF CONGRESS : On behalf of the 119 undersigned organizations, we urge you to oppose efforts to cut Supplemental Security Income (SSI) to offset the costs of the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program (MIECHV program). H.R. 2824 would reauthorize the MIECHV program, which funds voluntary, evidence based home visiting programs for atrisk pregnant women and parents with young children up to kindergarten entry. The current MIECHV program has demonstrated beneficial outcomes associated with improved maternal and child health, including increased access to screening and early intervention for childhood disabilities. Unfortunately, H.R. 2824 proposes to pay to extend this valuable maternal and child home visiting program by cutting off SSI entirely for certain adolescents and adults with disabilities, as well as seniors. H.R. 2824 would revive an old, failed policy that had catastrophic effects for many people with disabilities and seniors, employing procedures that did not withstand judicial scrutiny. The Social Security Act currently prohibits SSI payments to individuals fleeing from law enforcement to avoid prosecution or imprisonment. The existing system is already working to ensure that those who shouldn’t be paid SSI benefits don’t receive them. The proposed cut, Section 201 of H.R. 2824, would bar payment of SSI benefits to people with an outstanding arrest warrant for an alleged felony or for an alleged violation of probation or parole. Most of the warrants in question are decades old and involve minor infractions, including warrants routinely issued when a person was unable to pay a fine or court fee, or a probation supervision fee. Based on prior experience with SSA’s failed former policy, the people who would be affected are those whose cases are inactive and whom law enforcement is not pursuing. Many people are not even aware that a warrant was issued for them, as warrants are often not served on the individual. A very high percentage of people who would lose benefits have mental illness or intellectual disability. Many are unaware of the violation, may not have understood the terms of parole or probation, or may have other misunderstandings about their case. Warrant databases are notoriously inaccurate. Fourteen percent of the arrest warrants processed by the federal Warrant Information Network in 2004 were later dismissed by the court or returned unexecuted. The state of Alabama, even with an audit mechanism in place, reported a 13% error rate in its arrest warrant databases. Due to these kinds of inaccuracies, some people will have their SSI benefits cut off as a result of mistaken identity, or paperwork errors, which can take months or even years to resolve. When this failed policy was previously implemented by SSA, many of those who had their benefits cut off had no arrest warrant outstanding against them. For example, Rosa Martinez, the lead plaintiff in Martinez v. Astrue was, in 2008, a 52year old woman who received notice from SSA that she was losing her disability benefits because of a 1980 arrest warrant for a drug offense in Miami, Florida. Ms. Martinez had never been to Miami, never been arrested, never used illegal drugs, and is eight inches shorter than the person described in the warrant. Despite an obvious case of mistaken identity, Ms. Martinez was left without her sole source of income. It was only after filing a lawsuit in federal court that Ms. Martinez was able to have her benefits restored. Resolving outstanding warrants can be very difficult and costly. People often must go before a judge in the issuing jurisdiction, and typically need counsel to assist them in navigating the process. Often, people have moved in the intervening years and live far away from the issuing jurisdiction. The proposed offset would cut off all SSI income. Losing this income will cause many people to become homeless and unable to meet their basic needs, much less resolve a warrant, a case of mistaken identity, or an error in the warrant database. Completely cutting off SSI benefits will leave people with little recourse to resolve an outstanding warrant, representing a step backward in bipartisan efforts towards criminal justice reform. By relying on databases of outstanding arrest warrants, this proposal seeks to punish people by presuming their guilt, undermining the presumption of innocence that is the bedrock of our criminal justice system. The existence of an arrest warrant does not establish that any criminal conduct has occurred. Many arrests do not result in criminal charges, or the charges are eventually dismissed. Even if an individual is charged and subsequently prosecuted, he or she is presumed innocent until proven guilty. The proposed offset also will have a disproportionate impact on people of color. People who are on probation are particularly susceptible to having an outstanding arrest warrant. Parolees and probationers are disproportionately people of color—in 2015, 13% of adults on probation were Hispanic, and 30% of adults on probation were African American. Finally, the proposed offset could harm some of the very same children who we seek to help through home visiting. In any given month, approximately 2.7 million children are estimated to live with a family member who is a senior or adult with a disability who receives SSI. These children’s families are overwhelmingly the same types of families served by the MIECHV program: over 3 in 5 families with a SSI recipient age 18 or older have a total family income below 150% of the federal poverty level, and SSI makes up on average about 40 percent of these families’ income. Cutting off SSI income would put families at risk of being unable to keep a roof over their heads, put food on the table, and meet other basic needs—including children’s and mothers’ health needs. H.R. 2824 would also harm Social Security beneficiaries—since over half of SSI recipients who are elderly, and almost onethird of SSI recipients with disabilities, are Social Security beneficiaries. In closing, we reiterate that although the MIECHV program has demonstrated beneficial outcomes, and reauthorization must be a priority, it should not come at the expense of cuts to SSI, which would harm seniors, adolescents and adults with disabilities, and their families, and should not be raided as a payfor for an unrelated program. We urge the U.S. Congress to reject any proposals to offset the costs of reauthorizing the MIECHV program by cutting SSI benefits. Sincerely,

Ms. JACKSON LEE. In addition, let me share with you the reality of this: Rosa Martinez. Yes, the Social Security Administration was doing this before, but they had to stop it. We are now reigniting it because Rosa Martinez filed a suit in 2008. She was a 52yearold disabled woman from Redwood, California, who received a notice from SSA last December that she was losing her only source of income, her disability benefits, because of a 1980 arrest warrant for a drug offense in Miami, Florida. Ms. Martinez has never been to Miami, has never been arrested, and has never used illegal drugs. In addition, she is 8 inches shorter than the Rosa Martinez identified in the warrant. Do you want this random, reckless cutting off of SSI benefits because of misidentification? Identity theft is rampant. So this bill is failed, it is a failure, and it has a number of Achilles’ heels that will not work. The bill will also increase mass incarceration. We should allow law enforcement to do their job. I don’t mind giving them the tools that they need, but I refuse to allow individuals to suffer because of this very abusive bill. I kneeled on this floor because of injustice. This is a bill that is full of injustices. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 2792. I oppose this bill for the following reasons: SSI is a needsbased program for people with limited income and resources. It will terminate essential benefits of poor people. It will deprive poor people of due process. It will increase mass incarceration. My amendment would have remedied these criminal justice defects in H.R. 2792, which struck the arrest warrant language because (1) it recklessly targets vulnerable and innocent individuals; (2) this bill deprives citizens of due process, particularly where many poor individuals are completely unaware of any pending warrant, and (3) there have been cases in which warrants were either decades old or, in many instances, it was a matter of a mistaken identity. The bill amends the Social Security Act (SSA) to make certain revisions that limit payment of benefits to fugitive felons under titles II, VIII, and XVI of the (SSA), by prohibiting Supplemental Security Income (SSI) payments to individuals with an outstanding felony warrant or parole or probation violation. ‘‘Almost none of the individuals who would be affected by this provision are actual fugitives from justice and most of the warrants in question are many years old and involve minor infractions,’’ the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities said in a letter to Senators who tried to implement this policy. This bill is merely a continuation of President Trump’s $1.7 trillion budget cuts of programs designed to help the millions of poor and lowincome families that need these programs for survival. Plainly stated, this bill will terminate SSI benefits of very lowincome seniors and people with disabilities, because SSI is granted based on financial need. In creating this bill, the sponsors essentially agree that it is best to incarcerate economically vulnerable people in order to fund the Maternal Infant Early Childhood Home Visiting program (MIECHV). As the Center for Law and Social Policy, a nonprofit group focused on lowincome Americans, previously reported of the Trump’s budget scheme, this bill would likewise, create an overall assault on a wide range of ordinary Americans for the purpose of providing tax cuts to the wealthiest. My Democratic colleagues on Ways and Means offered amendments to fully pay for a 5year reauthorization of the MIECHV program and doubling the funding by closing a tax loophole called the ‘‘stretch IRA’’. Republicans however, would not let my colleagues vote on those amendments. My amendment and those of my colleagues would have made this bad bill a lot more palatable. Instead, the Republicans have chosen, once again, to lock people up, and do so in a manner that deprives poor people of their sole source of income, while purporting to safeguard against fugitive felons that are recipients of these SSI benefits. This bill is unnecessary because under current law, SSI and Social Security payments are already prohibited to people fleeing prosecution or confinement. Most alarming, this bill will terminate these benefits without any judicial determination of guilt, and thus, usurping recipients’ rights to due process. The presumption of ‘‘innocent until proven guilty’’ is the constitutional principle at the bedrock of our criminal justice system. This principle guarantees that the government cannot deprive citizens of their rights without due process of the law. The bill maintains that payments could be immediately restored once the individual resolves any outstanding issues, a potentially lengthy and timeconsuming process. Ask the thousands of individuals swept under this broad policy if that is true. SSA already tried to implement this very illadvised policy and it resulted in thousands of court challenges in 2009 forcing the agency to repay billions of dollars it had withheld from people deemed fugitives. For example, Miami resident Joseph Sutrynowics’ Social Security Disability Insurance benefits were halted in 2008 because of a bad check he’d written to cover groceries in Texas more than a decade earlier. Under this policy, SSA agreed to repay $700 million in benefits that were withheld from 80,000 people whose benefits have been suspended or denied since January 1, 2007 in the Martinez v. Astrue case. SSA could also, reportedly, repay close to $1 billion in benefits to 140,000 individuals in the Clark v. Astrue case. We have already tried this before and failed miserably. Let us not waste tax payers’ money in litigation, while causing poor folks to go 
hungry. As the old adage says: ‘‘don’t continue to do the same thing and expect a different result, that’s insanity’’. Past experiences proved that this policy was detrimental then, and it is so now. It will further exacerbate the epic tragedy of mass incarceration, and the attendant costs incurred by taxpayers, particularly in the welldocumented higher cost of incarcerating the elderly and those in poor health. Even conservative coalitions like Freedom Works, American Conservative Union Foundation, Generation Opportunity, and Taxpayers Protection Alliance agreed that mass incarceration is extremely costly to taxpayers. In addition to tax dollars in litigation fees, incarceration cost taxpayers $407.58 per person per day and $148,767 per person per year. Criminalizing poor individuals, depriving them of their social security income benefits, and increasing the incarceration rate in this fashion will NOT solve the fugitive problem this bill purports it will do. In fact, this bill will expand existing problems of mass incarceration by increasing the likelihood for recidivism. Statistics show that incarceration does not serve as deterrence, nor does it keep our communities safe. For the reasons stated above, I oppose this bill. Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Alabama (Ms. SEWELL ), a member of the Ways and Means Committee. Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in opposition to H.R. 2792, the misleadingly titled Control Unlawful Fugitive Felons Act of 2017, which would prohibit the payment of Supplemental Security Income benefits to anyone with an unresolved arrest warrant for an alleged violation of a condition of probation or parole or an alleged felony offense. H.R. 2792’s title falsely claims to target fugitive felons. In fact, fugitive felons are already prohibited from receiving benefits under current law. If this bill were enacted, some of our country’s most vulnerable lowincome seniors and disabled Americans, who are neither fugitives nor felons, would not be able to get their SSI benefits. While proponents of H.R. 2792 continue to claim that the bill only targets violent fugitive felons, H.R. 2792 threatens many other individuals, like those who received arrest warrants because of an inability to pay court fines or fees. Just last week, the United States Commission on Civil Rights published a report, titled, ‘‘Targeted Fines and Fees Against LowIncome Communities of Color: Civil Rights and Constitutional Implications,’’ which found that many local jurisdictions rely on court fees or other fines to support their municipal budgets, including fees charged to those under court supervision. Some of the people charged with these fees are elderly or disabled SSI beneficiaries who are unable to work and have no way to pay court costs. When they cannot pay, a warrant is routinely issued for their arrest. If this bill were enacted, these people would lose their SSI benefits, which is the only source of income for many of these lowincome disabled individuals. During the markup of H.R. 2792, I offered a commonsense amendment which would have prevented SSI benefits from being cut off if the result would be the loss of benefits for individuals whose arrest warrants were issued for nonpayment of court costs. Unfortunately, my Republican colleagues rejected the amendment, as well as all other Democratic amendments to this bill. I stand united with over 119 national, State, and local organizations who oppose efforts to cut SSI benefits, and I urge opposition to the final passage of this bill. Further, I would like to go on the record to say that we should have a clean reauthorization of the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting program, MIECHV, which expires on September 30. The majority’s decision to tie home visiting to this harmful cut for our most vulnerable citizens only makes this harder to accomplish. MIECHV programs are proven programs, evidencebased programs that work. We actually should reauthorize these programs, but we should not tie it to this horrible bill. Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to the bill. b1015 Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2792 is a harsh, unfair bill. It would undermine the foundation of American justice, innocent until proven guilty, and it would do so for Americans who are impoverished and already at a severe disadvantage because of age, disability, education, race, and ethnicity. It would strip people of basic income, in many cases all they have to live on, based on a mere accusation. I reject the majority’s contention that people in nursing homes, people with dementia and cognitive impairments, and others with nowhere else to turn will not be harmed by this bill because of the very limited authority current law gives the Social Security commissioner to issue good cause exemptions. We know the good cause process is complicated and very difficult to navigate. Not surprisingly, the last time the policy was in effect, only a tiny fraction of the people who lost their basic income were able to follow the instructions in the sixpage letter from SSA and apply for relief, the good cause process that the majority repeatedly touts, as few as 10 days before benefit termination. SSI recipients have extremely limited financial resources and are severely disabled, elderly. Resolving errors within the criminal justice system is a long process that typically must be done in the geographic jurisdiction of the court and necessitates legal costs. The goal of H.R. 2792 is the same: raise $2.1 billion by cutting off benefits for tens of thousands of impoverished, elderly, and disabled people, be they cognitively impaired, victims of mistaken identity, facing homelessness, those who committed minor offenses, or those who are too poor to pay their court fees and fines. Mr. Speaker, there are no protections in this bill. There is no reason, no rational benefit, but there are instances where individuals will be forced to suffer even more than they currently do, so let’s not cut off their Social Security Income benefits. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, in closing, the CUFF Act is commonsense. The American taxpayer should not subsidize individuals who are fleeing from law enforcement. Because the Social Security Administration already possesses in place processes that will ensure due process and protect beneficiaries, claims about this bill are overblown and, quite frankly, they are wrong. I am proud that this bill is supported by the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Sheriffs’ Association, and the South Dakota Sheriffs’ Association. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 533, the previous question is ordered on the bill, as amended. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. NADLER (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to dispense with the reading. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New York is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I offer this motion to recommit on behalf of Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ . This is the final amendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended. It is unfortunate that we are here today debating inadequate policies while our fellow Americans in Puerto 
Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands are hurting. While I do not doubt the underlying bill was made with good intentions, it is not just inadequate for all the victims of the hurricanes, and it is insulting to the people of Puerto Rico. They are hurting. They have no food, no water, no power. They need our help. Estimates suggest the storm caused $40 billion to $85 billion in insurance claims throughout the Caribbean, with 85 percent of those losses in Puerto Rico. Nearly all of the island is without power, and 85 percent of cell towers were knocked out. The hurricane ravaged 80 percent of the crop value in Puerto Rico—a $780 million loss. This will result in higher food prices at a time when Puerto Rico faces shortages. These are only the initial estimates. Each day we learn more about the scale of devastation, and likely won’t know the measure of damage for some time. FEMA has indicated that it has ‘‘provided more than 1.5 million meals, 1.1 million liters of water, nearly 300 infant and toddler kits, and nearly 12,000 emergency roofing kits to the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico since Hurricane Maria’s landfall.’’ That is a quote from FEMA. Yet the total population of American citizens in Puerto Rico is 3.4 million. The total in the U.S. Virgin Islands is over 100,000. It has been 7 days since the storm. The math simply doesn’t add up, and neither does the bill as it is written. This motion to recommit would do more for the people of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands than the underlying bill. Unlike the underlying bill, this motion will give them funds to help them rebuild. The dollars are directed for rebuilding and other economic support. It considers specific provisions to ensure longterm growth is capable on the island, and it strives to treat disaster victims equally. By taking the politics out of natural disasters, all of our constituents, from New York, and Puerto Rico, to Florida, Louisiana, and Texas, will automatically have the necessary aid to rebuild. Giving them this peace of mind will give them the ability to focus on what matters: their families and communities. Rather than putting forth a fig leaf to offer themselves cover, as the underlying bill does, this motion would provide immediate, greater benefits to the people of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. They cannot wait for assistance. By voting for this motion, you would be voting to help our fellow Americans. I urge all Members to vote ‘‘yes.’’ Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to recommit. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I believe in bipartisanship, which means that oftentimes I am disappointed in this institution, but today I am not disappointed, I am shocked. I am shocked that some would politicize such a sensitive, desperate situation that so many Americans, from Texas to Puerto Rico, are facing at this hour. My colleagues say they want to help the people of Puerto Rico, the people of the Florida Keys in my district, and others throughout the country. A lot of them have come here boasting about the fact that they have never opposed a disaster relief package, yet they are willing to do so today. Why? To try to attempt to score political points. I think that is wrong, and I can’t help but take it personally, because my constituents really need this help. The people of Puerto Rico, by the way, the person they elected to this chamber, JENNIFFER GONZA´LEZCOLO´N, supports this legislation; STACEY  PLASKETT of the Virgin Islands, our colleague, put her name to this legislation as well; Chairman BRADY , whose constituents are trying to recover in the Houston area, is asking for passage of this legislation, yet people from other parts of the country are coming to this floor saying: No, that is not good enough for your constituents. So if my constituents get nothing, I should tell them: That is right. Someone from elsewhere said that because this wasn’t good enough, you get nothing. That is just wrong. This is an important first step that we have to take to help people in all of these jurisdictions, especially the people of Puerto Rico, because we know that the situation there is in no way comparable to anything that has happened on the mainland. It is personal for me in that sense as well, because guess what? When my wife’s family was exiled from Cuba, they went to Puerto Rico and they were welcomed there. My wife’s two elder brothers were born in Puerto Rico. My wife still has family in Puerto Rico, and I know that this legislation would improve their situation. Can we do more? Should we do more? Should we work together to do more in the future? Yes, we should and we will, but that is no excuse to vote against this legislation, that is no excuse to leverage the suffering of these people to try to achieve a political objective or even to advance different legislation. I respectfully ask all my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats, and I thank the 26 Democrats who stood with us on Monday, and I ask them to do it again today and for more to join us, to send a strong message of national unity for the people of Florida, Texas, Louisiana, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and, yes, Puerto Rico. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to recommit. There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule XX, this 15minute vote on the motion to recommit will be followed by 5minute votes on: Passage of the bill, if ordered; Passage of H.R. 2792; and Agreeing to the Speaker’s approval of the Journal, if ordered. The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were—yeas 188, nays 227, not voting 18, as follows: [Roll No. 541] YEAS—188

Mr. Speaker, I join you in thanking God for the return of our colleague, STEVE SCALISE , and to have him do so in such a strong way. You were brief, Mr. Speaker, I will be even briefer. Thank God, our prayers are answered. I take great pride in STEVE because we are both Italian Americans, and I think that is a source of some of his strength. I, too, want to say how proud we are of Jennifer, Harrison, and Madison, of your staff, and of our first responders— our Capitol Police—who took such good care of you. But if it is, as you said, an attack on you is an attack on all, then we all came through this magnificently because of your strength. So it is the power of STEVE SCALISE . The day we came to the floor when you weren’t here, we were all Team Scalise. Today we are Team Scalise. Thank you for being so wonderful. God bless you. The SPEAKER. Without objection, 5 minute voting will continue. There was no objection. The SPEAKER. The question is on the passage of the bill.

THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER pro tempore. The unfinished business is the question on agreeing to the Speaker’s approval of the Journal, which the Chair will put de novo. The question is on the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. 
PRIVILEGED REPORT ON RESOLUTION OF INQUIRY TO THE PRESIDENT Mr. GOODLATTE, from the Committee on the Judiciary, submitted an adverse privileged report (Rept. No. 115–335) on the resolution (H. Res. 488) of inquiry requesting the President and directing the Attorney General to transmit, respectively, certain documents to the House of Representatives relating to the removal of former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey, which was referred to the House Calendar and ordered to be printed. b1145 LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the majority leader for the purpose of giving us the schedule for the week to come. Mr. Speaker, before I yield, however, to the majority leader, I want to join all of our colleagues in saying how very grateful we are and pleased we are with the return of the majority whip, STEVE  SCALISE . All of us who sat here and heard STEVE , our friend and colleague, give his reaction not only to the hateful, vicious action that took place as he was practicing for the charity baseball game where Republicans and Democrats come together to raise funds for young people and people who need help, and they do so together in a spirit of good will and common purpose, I think STEVE SCALISE , our majority whip, spoke movingly, and I am sure all Members were impressed with his courage and with his comments about that which is important. He talked about his prayers having been answered and the prayers of literally millions of people around this country. And in talking about some of the world leaders who called him and expressed their concern, because they knew, as he said and as Leader PELOSI  said: An attack on STEVE SCALISE was an attack on us all, and it was an attack on our democracy and an attack on peacefully resolving differences, no matter how strongly they may be held—a lesson for all of us. I want to congratulate and thank Jennifer, his extraordinary wife, who shouldered a responsibility and a burden that she did not expect and, as STEVE said, did it with great courage and great grace. His children, Madison and Harrison, and their entire family, I know, were responsible for STEVE being able to be back here with us, and so we thank them. He is back with us today, and we look forward to him being a vigorous, as he was and is, part of the deliberations of this House and of reaching decisions in a positive, constructive way. STEVE and I have a difference of opinion on whose crabs are better. We had a crab dinner not too long ago, my staff and his staff, and he brought some crabs up from Louisiana, I brought some crabs from Maryland, and it was a split decision as to which were the best. It will not surprise you who was for which crab. Today, we are filled with joy to see him back on the floor and on the road to full recovery. We also continue to be grateful for the recovery of U.S. Capitol Police Officers Crystal Griner and David Bailey. I want to join STEVE , and I know all of our Members, as we rose and clapped to show our respect and our appreciation for those in the Capitol Police. Some of us are privileged to, as STEVE pointed out, have a detail, and they become family. We are so impressed with their commitment, their talent, the extraordinary training that they have received and display every day; and, of course, Crystal Griner and David Bailey responded and, in responding, were injured themselves. They put their lives at risk for not only STEVE SCALISE but for all the Members who were on the field at that point in time. I want to join STEVE , and I know all of our colleagues and the majority leader, in expressing appreciation and great respect for those who serve us in the Capitol Police. I say to my friend, the majority whip—he has left the floor now—we are glad to have you back. I wrote him a note this morning saying whatever I could do to help him, I was available to do that. I am sure he took it that that did not mean I necessarily would vote the way he wants me to vote, nor did I think he would vote necessarily the way I wanted him to vote, but we will continue in this great institution we call the House of Representatives, but, as STEVE called it and I call it and so many of us call it, the people’s House. Every 2 years, they send us back here to try to make policy to make their lives better and our country stronger, and, more than the public knows, we work together to accomplish that objective. They see the confrontations, but they don’t always see the cooperation. Now, at this time, Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCARTHY ), the majority leader, my friend—we cooperate more than people will see from time to time, I want to thank him for that—for the purpose of inquiring of the schedule for the week to come. (Mr. MCCARTHY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MCCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, before I give the schedule, I do want to say today was a day that was very good to see our dear friend, STEVE SCALISE , make it back. As the gentleman said, an attack on him was an attack on the entire institution. I was there that day in the hospital, my wife and I, and waiting for Jennifer to arrive, and STEVE , going through those surgeries. The number of times we would go back to visit, he is the strongest man I have ever known. I thought his speech today was fantastic. It is from the heart that he first would seek God’s guidance. The strength of Jennifer—I watched Madison and Harrison spend their entire summer in that hospital for their father, and for him to be able to walk back here as soon as he did and the excitement in his face when he was able to cast that vote, I know STEVE is going to continue to get stronger as he goes, and he thanks everybody for the help they provided. 
We should not forget the spirit that this floor had today. We should take that spirit into the days forward and continue it. We can disagree, but it takes an unbelievable terrible situation, at times, to remind us of the human spirit we have for one another, and I want to make sure, even for myself, that I remember those moments in times of the most heated debates. So with that, Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the House will meet at noon for morning hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business. Votes will be postponed until 6:30. On Tuesday and Wednesday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning hour and noon for legislative business. On Thursday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business. Last votes of the week are expected no later than 3 p.m. And on Friday, no votes are expected in the House. Mr. Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next week, a complete list of which will be announced by close of business tomorrow. Now, in addition, the House will consider H.R. 36, the PainCapable Unborn Child Protection Act, also, as I like to call it, ‘‘Micah’s Law.’’ Mr. Speaker, I spent some time on Tuesday with a young boy named Micah. Micah gave me this bracelet, ‘‘Miracles for Micah,’’ and I wear it because Micah was born premature at 20 weeks. If you look at a picture of Micah, he was the size of a bag of M&Ms. Today, he is happy, he is healthy, he is 5 years old, and no one would know the difference. Mr. Speaker, all life is a miracle, and we have an obligation here to speak for those who cannot speak for themselves. I look forward to the House passing this compassionate bill next week that will protect the lives of countless others just like Micah. Finally, Mr. Speaker, the House will take up the FY18 budget resolution. Our Republican budget balances within 10 years, provides for a strong national defense, eliminates burdensome regulations, and cracks down on waste, fraud, and abuse. Passing this budget will also enable tax reform, which is the key to economic growth and seeing that Americans take home more of their hardearned dollars. I thank Chairman BLACK and the entire Budget Committee—and especially you, Mr. Speaker—for their hard work on this bill. Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for the information on the schedule to come. I want to speak to two things that are not on the schedule, Mr. Leader, but I know that both of us are focused on this and realize that we need to move and we need to move quickly. First of all, I want to speak of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. The leader and I, Mr. Speaker, were scheduled to try to go to Key West and to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands this weekend. I am not sure that that is going to be able to happen, given some of the logistics on the ground, but whether that happens or not, Mr. Speaker, I know the leader and I are going to work very hard on this. There is a humanitarian crisis that has confronted Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Key West, at least you can drive to Key West still, and we can get relief to Key West and to Florida and to victims of Harvey. Obviously, our fellow Americans who are residents of two islands, or actually more than two islands, but that comprise Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, are in life threatening distress. I talked today to Dr. Price, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, about the availability of dialysis on the island. There are people who have already died because they were not able to get to dialysis centers, and those centers don’t have all the electricity they need, so there is a humanitarian crisis, as I pointed out, Mr. Speaker, and I know the leader appreciates this. Mr. Leader, I know we don’t have anything on the floor with reference to additional resources that might be and are necessary to meet this humanitarian crisis in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, but I would urge the majority leader, as I have done and I think he has done, to be in contact with the administration, be in contact with FEMA. In particular, I was pleased to see that General Kim has now been appointed, as General Honore was for New Orleans and Katrina, to coordinate activities. We have extraordinary resources in the Armed Forces of the United States, and I would urge the President, as Commander in Chief, and the Department of Defense to allocate every resource necessary to get the American people who live in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands to a point where communications, the availability of food, the availability of water, the availability of medical services are up and running, hopefully, full bore by the end of this weekend. This is a crisis. And I know the majority leader shares that view, and if he wants to make a comment on that, I yield to the gentleman from California. Mr. MCCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I thank him for his interest, and it is true, the gentleman and I were hopefully trying to go down to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands and Key West to look at some of the damage, and, right now, the Coast Guard tells us, with the rescue attempts that are ongoing, that we probably would be taking some equipment away from doing that work, and we do not want to do any of that. We will be able to go a little later when the time is right. We will continue to work with the administration. When you think what this country has gone through with Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, I do want to give thanks to the work of the administration. I have seen some coordination like I have not seen in the past. We know these are islands. The damage of the two hurricanes they have to go through, I have been keeping in constant contact, and just speaking with FEMA just recently, they are currently coordinating and establishing seven temporary hospitals. That was one of my concerns with dialysis and others, but there is so much more to do to be able to move through, and I will work with the gentleman, as we have in the past, to make sure whatever they need will be able to get there. b1200 And I do want to thank Congressman CARLOS CURBELO for his amendment to the bill that we just voted on, adding a little more resources there to make sure, knowing the tax code of Puerto Rico is a little different than the one we had voted on as we go through, to give them greater assistance, and the Virgin Islands. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments. Clearly, this is not a partisan issue when an American or a group of Americans or a large number—in this case, over 3.5 million people, all of them at dire risk. We want to act together, we want to act quickly, and we do not want to fail to deploy any resource that is necessary to help our fellow Americans. Secondly, Mr. Speaker, I would like to bring up an act, which although not the crisis that Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, in particular, confront us with, as did Harvey and Irma in Texas and in Florida, but, Mr. Speaker, I notice that the Dream Act is not a part of next week’s schedule. The leader and I have discussed the Dream Act, along with Speaker RYAN. I know that the President has said, if we pass the Dream Act, he has said publicly that he would sign the Dream Act. He is obviously concerned with security at the borders. We share that concern about security at the borders. But this is an item that, now, onesixth of the time that was available has run, and we have 5 months left to go. I will tell the majority leader that I am very hopeful. I know the majority leader and the Speaker have formed some task forces to look at this issue, but I am very hopeful, Mr. Speaker— and I ask the majority leader to perhaps comment on this—that before the end of this work period—there are another 14 days left after this week in this work period—that we might be able to bring the Dream Act to the floor. A discharge petition has been filed. I would hope that the discharge petition not be necessary for either the rule or for the Dream Act itself. The discharge petition on the Dream Act itself will be mature as of October 5, and I expect a discharge petition to be filed on that, as well. But I am hopeful, Mr. Speaker, that that will not be necessary. 
Given the fact that the President has said that he thinks DACA was issued beyond the authority of President Obama, we disagree with that conclusion. But whether that conclusion is correct or not, the President observed that we need to fix this legislatively. So my question to the majority leader is: How soon does he believe that we could address this issue in regular order? We continue to pursue a discharge petition, as we did, frankly, for the Ex Im Bank, which, when it was called to the floor, had over 300 votes in favor of it, including the majority of the majority party voted for that bill. We believe, Mr. Speaker, strongly, that if the Dream Act is brought to the floor, which over 8 in 10 Americans agree with, frankly, we believe large numbers on both sides of the aisle agree that these young people are not to be sent home. Lastly, let me just quote Senator ORRIN HATCH , who is a senior Member in the United States Senate and the chairman of the Finance Committee. He said: ‘‘I’ve urged the President not to rescind DACA. . . .’’ He did, and gave us 6 months to solve this, legislatively. Senator HATCH observed that if DACA were rescinded, it would be ‘‘an action that would further complicate a system in serious need of a permanent, legislative solution.’’ He was referring then, Mr. Speaker, to a comprehensive immigration reform. ‘‘Like the President, I’ve long advocated for tougher enforcement of our existing immigration laws. But we also need a workable, permanent solution for individuals who entered our country unlawfully as children through no fault of their own and who have built their lives here. That solution must come from Congress.’’ And I agree that that decision must come from Congress. Rush Limbaugh said—and I don’t usually agree with statements that Mr. Limbaugh makes: ‘‘Nobody’s gonna win anything by deporting a bunch of kids that we let in, whoever did, Obama, whatever. If we can get the strict enforcement of existing immigration law . . . then the DREAMer thing may be an acceptable payoff,’’ he went on to say. I don’t think this is a payoff. This is responding. And that is why the overwhelming majority of the American people support the Dream Act. As I say, over 8 out of 10 Americans. So I ask the majority—and I know that was a relatively long statement. This is a critical issue, however, as I have expressed in private to the majority leader, because we have but 5 months left to go. Hopefully, we could do this in this work period to allay the fears that these young people have, who are making such a positive contribution to America, to their communities, and to their families. So I am hopeful that we could resolve this issue as soon as possible. I yield to my friend, the majority leader. Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding. I first want to applaud Speaker RYAN for forming a working group on this important issue. The gentleman and I have met numerous times on this, and I have talked to the President about it, as well. He has been very clear, and I agree with the President’s position, courts have shown that the past was unconstitutional, and that just means the House has to do their job and the Senate. The one thing I would hate to happen here is that we only do the job halfway, and then we have this problem come back to us. The President has asked us about border security, as well. I believe we can find a solution here, together. I look forward to working with Mr. HOYER . The President has challenged this Congress to find a solution, and I believe we can. We are going to work to make sure we get it done. I would like to do it sooner than the timeframe the President has given us. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I welcome the majority leader’s thought that he wants to do it sooner rather than later. I will support him, of course, in that effort. I would say on his comment, Mr. Speaker, with reference to a comprehensive solution, we are for a comprehensive solution. We would like to see that because that is the only way we will stop this from coming back. The Senate passed a comprehensive immigration bill 3 years ago. We have not seen that on the floor as of yet. Again, we think that that would have a substantial vote and, perhaps, I think, a majority vote. I am not as confident of that as I am with the Dream Act, which I think clearly would enjoy the majority of the House’s support. But I am glad that he wants to move this quickly. We will work with him to get that, I would hope, as I said, by the end of the work period, to allay the great fears and anxiety. Very frankly, we have had some young people thinking of going back to a land they do not know, a language they do not necessarily speak, and a culture they have, as adults, never been exposed to and don’t know. This, for all intents and purposes, in anything other than having the paper that says so, is their country. They have gone to school here, they work here, and they have been positive citizens here. And, hopefully—as the President said, he loved these children—we could relieve their fears and, in effect, redeem the American Dream for them. There are other issues, obviously, with which we have to deal, and I would urge the majority leader, as well, at some point in time, to make a path forward for comprehensive immigration reform, because it is a system we all agree is broken and needs to be fixed and is part of the problem. Two more issues, Mr. Speaker. The majority leader mentioned the budget would be coming to the floor. This is the 2018 budget. This is obviously late, but, nevertheless, it is being brought to the floor, and we will be able to consider it. Can the gentleman tell me: Will this include reconciliation instructions and, if so, what those reconciliation instructions will deal with? I yield to my friend. Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I expect reconciliation in this budget. I leave it up to the Rules Committee and the Budget Committee when they produce it, but on this floor, I believe there will be reconciliation. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Leader, will it assume the repeal of the ACA in fiscal year ’17 or fiscal year ’18, either one of those years, which clearly has not seemed possible at this point in time? I yield to my friend. Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding. If the question is have I given up on repealing ObamaCare, the answer is no. So, yes, this is the budget for the rest of the year. We know the harm that ObamaCare has brought to many Americans. The lack of insurance, when you look at the number of counties, 40 percent of all of the counties in America only have one provider, some have none. We watched premiums go up. We want a healthcare system where people have choice, that, actually, the price is lower and the quality is better. That is something I will never give up on, so, yes. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the majority leader for that observation. Obviously, we disagree, as he knows, on the success or failure of the ACA. As a matter of fact, every health organization in America, every major health organization in America opposed the repeal, a bill that came to the floor. Senator MCCAIN, I thought, gave a very powerful exhortation to all of us when he said, on July 25, we ought to do this in a bipartisan way. We found, now, three efforts to repeal by the majority party, who control all three—the Senate, the House, and the Presidency—an inability to do that. Mr. Speaker, I believe—and I would hope the majority leader would pursue efforts, and we would do the same on our side. We believe the ACA has been working. We believe that 20plus million more people are insured under the ACA than were insured before the ACA. We believe people with preexisting conditions were able to get insurance. We believe seniors saved substantial money in purchasing prescription drugs as a result of that. We believe that people did not have— we know they did not have the specter of being canceled because their expenses in any one year were above a limit and that their lifetime limits 
would not be imposed when they get a serious critical illness. So we think it worked. The majority has tried to repeal it. They have not succeeded at this point in time, but they have created, Mr. Speaker, great anxiety and uncertainty in the marketplace. And to the extent, for instance, that premiums have risen in our State, the head of Blue Cross/Blue Shield, the largest insurer in our State, said the reason for at least 50 percent was the uncertainty that had been created by the administration and by the debates that have occurred in this House and the proposals that have occurred in this House, which have undermined the market. I talked to him the other day, and he said, in fact, if there were stability, he believes rates would come down significantly because insurance companies, providers, would have an opportunity to have a stable environment in which they could assess the cost of health insurance. Did the majority leader want to say anything? I yield to my friend. Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, the only thing I want to say, and I know we have debated this many times—we can always put an endorsement somewhere and we can always go back and forth, but I will just tell you for my own district—I don’t know why anybody would ever say they are making a decision based on something when our bill carries it out another 2 years even, so I don’t believe that to be true. But I know what is true. Currently, 30 percent of the people who are on the exchange in my district just had somebody pull out; and they had that health insurance, Anthem, so now they don’t. They have to go find something else. They had doctors who they loved, and they were promised that they were going to be able to keep them. Well, they couldn’t. I just look at numbers; and I take Republican, Democrat, I take whatever name is across from it. Almost twice as many people pay the penalty or take a waiver as actually make a payment for ObamaCare. b1215 So, yes, this will continue not because you and I have a disagreement, but because people are hurting, premiums are going up, deductibles are going up, and people are losing their providers. And the providers are not leaving because it is staying the same way for another 2 years, they are leaving because it is staying there. So, yes, I look forward to continuing this conversation because we cannot allow this harm to continue to go through this country. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. Mr. Speaker, we could go on, I presume, all day, and our friends who want to do a 1minute or a Special Order would not be happy with us, and they are maybe not happy now, but the fact of the matter is that this is a critically important issue to our country. When he talks about providers, the providers said they didn’t like any of these bills. We have had three opportunities: one that was offered but not put on the floor; then one that came to the floor and passed this House and then went to the Senate, and the majority of the Senate has not agreed with any of the three alternatives; plus the alternative that Senator GRAHAM brought forward along with the Senator from Louisiana. The majority in the Senate has not agreed, and, Mr. Speaker, what that has done is provided the insurance industry, providers, doctors, medical authorities with total lack of confidence on what is going to happen tomorrow. Nobody in business believes that you can have proper pricing if you do not know the context in which you are pricing your product. So, yes, there has been a disruption. What we ought to do, as Senator MCCAIN said, is come together and make sure a system works. We believe the ACA is working—not working as well as it should right now, it is not working as much for the small market or people on the exchanges as it should. It can. Almost every medical provider and the majority of the American people over these last 8 months has changed from not liking the ACA and not thinking it is good for them, to where the majority of the American people now support it, and 7 out of 10plus want the ACA fixed, not repealed. So in that context, it seems to me it is both good politics and good policy for us to come together and to create a system that works for the American people. We believe that is by fixing the ACA, and to that extent, we reflect the majority of the American people. Secondly, Mr. Speaker, the last issue I want to bring up are two items that were not included in the FAA bill, but which are important programs. One is the Perkins Loan Program for students. We know that the cost of education has skyrocketed and that we need to extend that act. That bill, by the way, Mr. Speaker, has 226 cosponsors, so it is not as if there is not a majority of the House that already supports that extension. The second thing that needs to be done: we need to deal with a comprehensive health system in our communities, the Community Health Centers. We need to deal with the teaching hospitals. We need to deal with the disproportionate share of hospitals. So there are many things that we did not include in the bill that we passed today that need to be addressed and need to be addressed immediately. They are not on the schedule for next week. Can my friend give me some idea when we might consider those, which, of course, expire on September 30? So September 30 will come and go before we start next week’s schedule. Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend. Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. You raised a couple issues there. When it comes to teaching hospitals, that was in the bill you just voted against twice this week on the floor. So that has been taken care of. When you are talking about SCHIP and the extension of that, Chairman WALDEN actually postponed a markup not because he wanted to, but because it was requested by the Democrats. So he postponed the markup this week in continuing bipartisan negotiations. This is something I would like to get done. I know Chairman WALDEN has now scheduled a markup for next week, so I am very hopeful that we will get this done very soon. I am a big supporter of SCHIP and a lot of the work that they do and what it moves forward for our healthcare in the future, especially for the health clinics out there. So I look forward to working with you. Mr. HOYER. I appreciate that. You mentioned SCHIP. Can you refer to the Perkins Loan Program? Does the gentleman know whether that is also moving forward? Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend. Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I apologize. You did mention the Perkins Act. I do not have that scheduled at the current time, but I will keep you abreast when I do. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that SCHIP is on the committee’s agenda for next week. Hopefully, that can be brought to the floor before we leave in this work period, perhaps just before or just after the Dream Act is brought to the floor. Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend, the majority leader. Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, it is our understanding that today could be the very last time that Margarida Curtis provides a message to us on this floor. We would like to thank Margarida Curtis. From a very grateful nation, thank you for your service. Many times the American people see your voice, but also the power of what you bring back and forth to make this democracy work. We want to thank you for your service, and we wish you all the happiness in retirement. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. Margarida Curtis has been a longtime employee of the United States Senate and, as a result, an employee of the people of the United States. Margarida, you have always done your work with great ability and clarity. We very much appreciate your service to the Senate, but also to this House, to the Congress itself, and to the American people. They are grateful for all you have done. God speed. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE A message from the Senate by Ms. Curtis, one of its clerks, announced that the Senate has passed with an amendment a bill of the House of the following title: 
H.R. 2266. An act to amend title 28 of the United States Code to authorize the appointment of additional bankruptcy judges; and for other purposes. f 
HOUR OF MEETING ON TOMORROW, AND ADJOURNMENT FROM FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 29, 2017, TO MONDAY, OCTOBER 2, 2017 Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 11:30 a.m. tomorrow; and further, when the House adjourns on that day, it adjourn to meet on Monday, October 2, 2017, when it shall convene at noon for morninghour debate and 2 p.m. for legislative business. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. 
SUICIDE PREVENTION (Mr. HILL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today during National Suicide Prevention Month to call attention to this tragedy that is so prevalent and important throughout our Nation. Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in the United States, and, on average, there are 121 suicides per day. Far too many Americans, about one in five, are suffering from some form of mental illness, a problem that has disrupted too many families, caused too much violence, pain, and cost too many lives. In Congress, we are working together on a bipartisan basis to bring needed reform to our mental healthcare system through the passage of the 21st Century Cures Act and the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act. The Central Arkansas Veterans Healthcare System, led by Dr. Margie Scott, is one of nine systems nationwide currently involved in the Clay Hunt pilot program. This program gives our VA employees the necessary tools to reach out to highrisk veterans and offer guidance while providing essential suicide prevention services. Dr. Scott and Central Arkansas Veterans Healthcare System have made over 200 community connections throughout Arkansas to assist our veterans. We all must work together and continue to move forward in addressing the issue of mental health and mental health access, and do what we can to save the lives of all American citizens and reverse this deadly trend of suicides. AUTHORIZATION FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS AND CHILDREN’S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM WILL EXPIRE ON SEPTEMBER 30 (Mr. GOMEZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. GOMEZ. Mr. Speaker, I can’t believe Congress has closed legislative business for the week without addressing a critical deadline that will impact the health of our country. On September 30, authorization for the Community Health Centers and the Children’s Health Insurance Program— CHIP—will expire. Well, it is September 28, and we just closed legislative business. That means funding for this critical program will lapse and the health of millions of Americans will be in jeopardy. Our Nation’s Community Health Centers have served lowincome, rural, and underserved communities for more than 50 years. In that time, they have increased the number of patients they serve and the services they offer so that they are now the primary healthcare option for millions of people. CHIP is another program that Congress will allow to lapse. No matter how big the differences between Republicans and Democrats, when it comes to healthcare, we have always come together to ensure our Nation’s children do not go without the care they need, yet here we are leaving D.C. and abandoning the 9 million children on CHIP and the millions more at the Community Health Centers. I ask that we come back into session and that we extend these critical programs. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF MAJOR GENERAL TIM LOWENBERG (Mr. NEWHOUSE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life and memory of Major General Timothy Lowenberg, former Adjutant General of the Washington State National Guard. After attending law school, Tim served on Active Duty at McChord Air Force Base before joining the Washington National Guard as a Judge Advocate Staff Officer. He was promoted to Adjutant General, honorably serving Washington State and our Nation. He stood up for our citizen soldiers, worked to ensure that the National Guard had the resources it needed, and oversaw multiple deployments to the Middle East. In addition, Tim established the Washington Youth Academy, providing an education and opportunity for at risk youth across the State. As a member of the Washington legislature, I was pleased to work with him on this, a cause that he was very passionate about, and was able to see his vision become a success. Upon retirement, he continued to serve his country and community. He will be missed by many, but his legacy of determination, kindness, and dutiful service to Washington and these United States lives on. Please join me in remembering Major General Timothy Lowenberg, my friend. f 
HONORING THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOOD STAMP ACT OF 1977 (Mr. PANETTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, today I honor the anniversary of the Food Stamp Act of 1977. Tomorrow, the program we know as SNAP—the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program—turns 40. We also know that before the implementation of SNAP, families couldn’t afford healthy meals and kids were going to school on empty stomachs. Today, thanks to this program, over 18,000 families in my district on the central coast of California count on SNAP benefits to put food on their tables at home and help their children feed their minds at their schools. In my district, the number one industry is agriculture. We ship our many fresh fruits and vegetables all over the country and to even other parts of the world. As a representative of this area, it is my goal and it is my responsibility to make sure that the families in my district have access to the same nutritious produce that is grown in our backyard. As a member of the House Agriculture Committee, under the leadership of Chairman CONAWAY , I look forward to working on the 2018 farm bill with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle so that we can support strong investments in SNAP. By doing that, we will support stronger families and a stronger future. 
b1230 THE 2018 FISCAL YEAR (Mr. ROTHFUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, this coming Sunday is new year’s day, the start of the Federal Government’s 2018 fiscal year. Several weeks ago, Congress passed and the President signed a temporary spending bill to carry the government through December 8. This temporary bill was necessary because, although the House passed its spending bills, the Senate did not. One of the more glaring problems with the CR is that it continues the years’ long practice of shortchanging 
our defenses and the men and women in our military. Defense spending and defense policy are frozen, and the changes this House has insisted on in both the Defense Authorization Act and the Defense Appropriations bill are stalled, to the detriment of our defenses and our men and women in uniform. Secretary Mattis has written, ‘‘Long term CRs impact the readiness of our forces and their equipment at a time when security threats are extraordinarily high. The longer the CR, the greater the consequences for our force.’’ The risks are real, Mr. Speaker. We see threats growing daily from North Korea and Iran. The fight continues against ISIS and against terror in Afghanistan, and now we need to deploy urgently needed resources to Puerto Rico. There is no need to wait until December 8 to get a fullyear Defense Appropriations bill. I call on the Senate to act promptly next week even and get our troops funded. 
ASSETS NEEDED IN PUERTO RICO AND THE U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I am glad President Trump listened to Secretary Clinton and deployed the U.S. Naval Ship Comfort to Puerto Rico, even though it was 7 days after Hurricane Maria destroyed the island. But President Trump must do more and do it now. Mr. Speaker, the President of the United States has a moral and legal duty to protect the wellbeing of our citizens. That is why today, right now, the President must order the Department of Defense to deploy all available assets to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands to prevent this catastrophe from getting worse. The thousands of Puerto Ricans and all of the Virgin Islanders I represent deserve to know that our Nation’s priority is their wellbeing, their families’, their friends’, and their fellow citizens’ as well—American citizens. 
LETTER CARRIER DONTE COTTON IS A HERO (Mr. TURNER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. TURNER. Mr. Speaker, I first want to welcome STEVE SCALISE back to this House floor. The strength of his message shows why he is such a hero to us all. I also want to tell the story of another hero, one from my congressional district in Dayton, Ohio. On April 5, 2016, letter carrier Donte Cotton saw an overturned car that had collided with a pole. The driver told Donte her child was inside the car. Acting on immediate instinct, Donte crawled through broken glass to rescue the baby from the car. Both the mother and the child were taken to the hospital and treated for minor injuries. In August of last year, Donte again found himself in the right place at the right time; again, on his letter carrying route. While on his normal mail delivery route, an elderly woman, whose home had just been invaded, ran up to Donte seeking help. Donte drove the woman to a nearby police cruiser, ensuring her safety. His courage is being rewarded this week by the National Association of Letter Carriers, which has given Donte its 2017 Central Area Hero Award. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Donte for his acts of true heroism in our community. f 
PASS THE DREAM ACT (Ms. GABBARD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, Josue Fuentes was brought to Hawaii from El Salvador when he was 13 years old, where he was escaping rampant gang violence and domestic abuse at home. He went to high school in Honolulu, made friends, got a job. But no matter what he did, he couldn’t escape the dark shadow cast on his future because of his immigration status. Josue describes DACA as a weight lifted from his back. He was empowered to apply for college. He bought a home and pursued opportunities that any of us would want for our children. Today, he is a small business owner. He owns a landscaping company, he volunteers at his local church, and continues to give back to the Kaneohe community that he calls home. I urge my colleagues to sign a discharge petition to bring the Dream Act to the floor for a vote so we can pass a permanent solution for Josue and millions of DREAMers across the country. Our Nation made a promise to these young men and women. We must uphold that promise. 
CERTIFY THAT IRAN IS IN FULL COMPLIANCE WITH THE JCPOA (Mr. CONNOLLY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call upon President Trump to certify that Iran is in full compliance with the JCPOA, otherwise known as the Iran nuclear agreement. To decertify at this time will destabilize the ability of the United States to engage in international agreements, especially those we initiated ourselves. Our credibility is on the line, especially given the fact that the IAEA and the United Nations and the United States Government have certified that Iran is in compliance. It is in compliance on its centrifuges, enriched uranium, the production of the plutonium reactor itself. We want to make sure that we don’t have a second nuclear front by decertifying Iran. It is important to the United States’ interests, to the security of the world, and the security of Israel that this agreement be certified as in compliance. f 
HONORING CHINESE GENERAL SUN LIJEN The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from California (Mr. KHANNA ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. KHANNA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the late Chinese General Sun Lijen. He was known as the evervictorious general, and fought with valor against Axis forces in Burma during World War II. General Sun’s strategies on the battlefield were a combination of traditional Chinese military theory and American military training. He was an important ally for the United States and a popular figure among his people. He was born in Anhui, China, and was the son of a Confucian scholar. He moved to the United States to attend Purdue University on a Boxer Indemnity Scholarship, and graduated with a degree in civil engineering. As China fell deeper into political upheaval and war, General Sun believed he could be more useful as a soldier than as an engineer. He went on to attend the Virginia Military Institute, where he faced prejudice from other cadets. When he returned to China, he advanced to the rank of colonel. In one of his earliest battles in World War II, he led troops to the defense of Shanghai and was wounded while leading his own men to safety. After recovering from his injuries, he established a military training camp in southern China. The men at the camp were trained in both Eastern and Western military strategy. General Sun is internationally renowned for his extraordinary service during the Battle of Yenangyaung in 1942. He saved the British First Burma Division by leading a regiment in a flanking maneuver. His bravery protected Allied forces from encirclement by the Imperial Japanese Army. During this battle, General Sun was also given command of a small group from the British Second Royal Tanks, making him the first Chinese officer to command British troops. In recognition of his victory in Burma, he was knighted by the United Kingdom and awarded the Legion of Merit by Franklin Delano Roosevelt. He was a friend of American Generals MacArthur and Eisenhower. In the report that recommended General Sun for the Legion of Merit, the U.S. War Department wrote the following: ‘‘For exceptionally meritorious 
conduct in the performance of outstanding service during the Burma operations in 1942. Under most trying conditions, General Sun displayed high qualities of leadership. The First Burma Division of the British Force at Yenangyaung was extricated by the attack of the 38th Division and saved from annihilation. General Sun held his unit together at all times during the retreat and brought it ready for combat to India. His example of courage and leadership reflect great credit on Allied Arms.’’ Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank the FDR Library and the Congressional Research Service for finding this document. I include this document in the RECORD , along with a letter from the Virginia Military Institute.

SUPERINTENDENT , VIRGINIA  MILITARY INSTITUTE , September 22, 2017. Congressman ROKHANNA , Washington, DC. DEARCONGRESSMAN KHANNA : Virginia Military Institute is pleased to join you in remembering and honoring General Sun Li Jen, VMI Class of 1927. The Institute takes great pride in the formative role it played in the leadership development of the ‘‘Ever Victorious General.’’ When General Sun returned to his native country, he implemented training practices that would assist in modernizing and preparing China for the challenges of the 1930s and 1940s. During those eventful decades, General Sun received international attention as a leader of the Chinese Nationalist Army during the Second SinoJapanese War, the Chinese Civil War, and World War II. In the latter conflict, he has been credited with reclaiming Burma from the Japanese. For his leadership in the ChinaBurmaIndia Theater, Sun was knighted Commander of the Order of the British Empire by King George VI and awarded the Legion of Merit by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. One of the general’s uniforms and his official portrait are exhibited in the VMI Museum where they are seen by 40,000 visitors annually. Over the years, generations of Chinese students have been inspired by the story of General Sun; many have followed his example and attended VMI. Thank you for gathering to honor this illustrious member of the Class of 1927. Sincerely, J.H. BINFORD PEAYIII ’62, General, U.S. Army (Retired). 
Mr. KHANNA. Mr. Speaker, I would like to read very briefly from that letter from the Virginia Military Institute, which recognized General Sun for his leadership in the ChinaBurma India theater, and recognize that his story has inspired many other Virginia Military Institute graduates since then. General Sun’s legacy lives on through his family, including California Assemblyman Kansen Chu. I am pleased to recognize Assemblyman Kansen Chu and his wife, Daisy Chu, who have joined us here today with his family and our honored guests in the House gallery. The district that Assemblyman Chu and I represent are some of the most ethnically diverse areas in our country. General Sun valued diversity. He found greater strength as a leader by combining Eastern and Western ideas. He led soldiers with different ethnicities and religions. His accomplishments demonstrate that we are better when we embrace diversity. Mr. Speaker, I encourage Congress to remember the contributions and legacy of General Sun and their importance to the people of the United States, of China, and those of ChineseAmerican ancestry. I want to end on this note. Several of us went a few days ago to the Library of Congress where Graham Allison was speaking. Graham Allison has this theory of the Thucydides Trap, which argues that two powers—when one power is rising and another power is established—often are likely to face conflict and war. He said that Xi Jinping in China is familiar with Thucydides Trap. I would submit that General Sun’s story is a reminder for why the United States and China can be allies and not adversaries. We often forget that China was critical in the United States’ efforts in winning World War II, and General Sun’s story is a reminder of that and an inspiration for us in this new century in finding common ground between the United States and China to help create a more peaceful world. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to avoid references to occupants of the gallery. f 
TRAVELING BY PRIVATE JET The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GALLEGO ) is recognized for the remainder of the hour as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Speaker, is Donald Trump running a Cabinet or a country club? Because every day it is getting harder to tell. Not only is the President spending vast sums to ferry himself to and from his various golf courses, but now it turns out that top leaders in his administration have developed a special fondness for traveling by private jet. The Treasury Secretary used a taxpayerfunded plane to hop down to Fort Knox to see the eclipse, for example, and he has also asked to use one for his honeymoon in Europe. Trump’s EPA Administrator, Scott Pruitt, spent another $58,000 on private jets. But the worst offender is HHS Secretary Price, who, in his brief time in office, has already chalked up an astonishing 400 grand in flights on private aircraft. He flew down to Tennessee for all of 6 hours, much of which was spent having lunch with his son. That is nice. He also jetted off to an island off the coast of Georgia for a trip that apparently featured far more recreation than government business. Clearly, when it comes to travel on the taxpayers’ dime, the price does not matter to Tom Price. Ethics and personal responsibility doesn’t matter to Tom Price. Doing what is right doesn’t matter to Tom Price, and that is why he needs to resign immediately. b1245 Now, don’t take my word for it. Here is what President George W. Bush’s top ethics official, Richard Painter, said about Price’s travel habits: ‘‘To use a charter flight on something that combines personal and government business, I think, is highly unprofessional and really inappropriate.’’ Those are strong words. But, Mr. Speaker, you know who summed up best how terrible it is for someone to use private jets? Tom Price, himself. Let’s see what Tom Price said. In 2009, he described government officials taking private planes as ‘‘just another example of fiscal irresponsibility run amok.’’ I couldn’t agree more, Mr. Speaker. Price spent nearly $25,000 to fly from D.C. to Philadelphia and back for one single day. He could have spent, at last minute, $725 to get there on United Airlines, or $133 to get there on Amtrak. 
Mr. Speaker, I just checked, on my phone, that an Uber to Philly right now, back and forth, would have cost Mr. Price about $450 round trip. That means that, for the price of his private jet, he could have ordered individual cars for himself and his 54 staff members. Every American who works and pays taxes should find this totally appalling. Amtrak was good enough for the Vice President of the United States, Joe Biden, but, somehow, it is beneath the Treasury Secretary and HHS Secretary to ride the train. Riding the train is apparently even beneath the EPA Administrator. Here is a good rule of thumb, Mr. Speaker: If you are spending more on private jets than most American families make in 1 year, you are spending too much on private jets. Tom Price has plenty of time to go jetting around the country, but not enough time, for example, to ensure that millions of kids won’t lose their coverage when CHIP expires soon. There is apparently plenty of money at HHS for private jets, but very little to help people sign up for health insurance. That is completely unacceptable. Secretary Price says he needs to fly around on his jet to connect with ordinary citizens. I am not kidding. His press secretary told reporters that these outrageous junkets were about ‘‘getting outside of D.C., making sure he is connected with the real American people.’’ Mr. Speaker, here is how you really connect with your fellow Americans: don’t take a private plane; fly a middle seat in coach. Of course, we should have seen this coming. News reports earlier this year revealed that, when he was a Member of Congress, Price was guilty of introducing legislation to benefit his own personal investments. Even more egregious, he traded more than $300,000 in healthcare industry stocks based on insider information. There is no question Secretary Price needs to resign right now, and, if he doesn’t, President Trump needs to fire him. Donald Trump claims that he loves firing people. He once said: I love doing it if someone really, really, really deserves it. Mr. Speaker, Secretary Price really, really, really deserves it. Then again, we all know Trump won’t actually do anything. We are all familiar with the Trump way of doing business with its bad deals and bankruptcies. Here’s the Trump way of doing government. Number one, hire people proven to be corrupt. Number two, create an environment in which corruption and bad behavior are encouraged. Number three, do absolutely nothing when the corruption and bad behavior is exposed. This administration talks about putting America first. This administration talks about draining the swamp, but its Cabinet officials are more interested in traveling first class. This administration talks about making America great again, but they are really only concerned about never ever having to wait at another airport gate again. This administration talks about fighting for working families, but its top leaders are only concerned about lining their own pockets with taxpayers’ hardearned money. I am fed up, and so are the American people. Let’s bring back government to the people, for the people, instead of government for the powerful friends of Donald Trump. Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend from California (Mr. TEDLIEU). Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Congressman GALLEGO for that terrific presentation. We are also joined today by Congressman RASKIN , who will be part of our dialogue as well. Today is Thursday. That means we all need to ask: Why does Jared Kushner still have a security clearance? He already submitted two false ones. But I digress. We are actually going to talk about three other problems in the White House, one of which is Secretary Price. To my left is a picture of the private jet that Secretary Price flew on at taxpayers’ expense. But in addition to Secretary Price, we also have Secretary Mnuchin, who flew on a government jet with his wife to Kentucky in order to watch the eclipse. Now, I get that was a pretty cool thing to do, but you shouldn’t be using taxpayer funds to do that. And then we have got EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, which, according to media reports, spent $58,000 on noncommercial flights to go to different places. With $58,000, you can do a lot with that. VoteVets put out a release today saying that with $58,000 you could hire a VA spinal cord specialist at the Syracuse VA, a nurse for 1 year. Then Secretary Price spent over $400,000 of your money, and that is a lot of spinal cord specialists. So we are talking about raiding the public funds and raiding the public trust. That is why I have introduced the SWAMP FLYERS Act, and what this act will do is stop this from happening in the future. It will prohibit senior Cabinet officials from using noncommercial flights, unless they certify, under penalty of perjury, that no commercial flights were available. So in this case, you had Secretary Price, for example, flying from here to Nashville. I guarantee you there were lots of commercial flights. There was no reason he had to take a noncommercial flight. In addition to what we are seeing with these three Cabinet officials, we do have sort of this culture of corruption that really needs to stop because this flows from the top. With the President, what we have now is the President staying at all these properties, private properties that are his or owned by his family, and then he comes with this massive entourage of Secret Service and other folks, and they are paying money to these properties to stay there, to eat there, and all of that money flows back to the Trump organization. So the President is enriching himself and his family at taxpayers’ expense. It is no wonder that we have got these three Cabinet officials doing these insane things with taxpayers’ funds. Now we have got a Republican Congress unwilling to do oversight on this. You have got Speaker RYAN recently going on TV saying that he thinks that the present administration is doing great. Well, you can’t have this kind of taxpayer waste when you have got the public trust at issue. We also have responses from these departments that are deeply troubling. So the Treasury Department, in response to what Secretary Mnuchin was doing, in addition to his noncommercial travel to Kentucky to watch the eclipse, he also asked if the Air Force could fly him and his wife on their honeymoon. The answer is no, you can’t do that. Now the response from the Department was, well, he needed to have secure communications. Well, that was the wrong response. I can guarantee you there are other ways of getting secure communications other than to have the Air Force fly you around on your honeymoon. With Secretary Price, again, the Department gave the wrong response. They said, well, Secretary Price needs to go around meeting Americans, and he shouldn’t be waiting 4 hours at the airport. Wrong response. Yes, he should be waiting 4 hours at the airport because that is what other Americans do. And I can guarantee you no American flies for $25,000 to meet other Americans. Again, the wrong response from that Department. What we need is to have these three Cabinet officials apologize. I joined with RUBEN GALLEGO , as well as J AMIE RASKIN and other Members yesterday in a letter to ask for Price to resign, and all of us are also coauthors of the SWAMP FLYERS Act. What we need now is really for the public to get engaged because what we are seeing is fraud, waste, and abuse with multiple members of the Trump Cabinet. Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the good gentleman from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN ). Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his leadership on this essential question of public integrity. I also want to salute my colleague from California (Mr. TEDLIEU), who has been a leading voice in demanding real financial accountability in the administration. I want to underscore some of the things that my colleagues have said, Mr. Speaker. If there are any Americans out there who love to fly wherever 
they want, whenever they want, at taxpayer expense, then we have got the perfect job for you in President Trump’s Cabinet. Now, of course, only billionaires and millionaires need apply for these jobs, but if you have a taste for fancy chartered air travel, paid for by hardworking Americans across the country, this is undoubtedly the job for you. My friends, while millions of desperate Americans are suffering in the sweltering posthurricane conditions of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Florida, Texas, and Louisiana, we have got Cabinet Secretaries who should be doing everything in their power to save our people but are, instead, looking out for something far more important, apparently, than other Americans’ mere survival. They are focused on their own first class, private charter, airplane flights to cushy destinations, paid for by hundreds of thousands of dollars of taxpayer money. We kid you not. This comes out this week. It comes out that Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price is less interested in health and human services than he is in wealth and valet services. Despite the fact that he blasted the use of governmentpaid jet travel on CNBC just a few short years ago, he seems to have come down with a severe and chronic case of swamp fever, billing you and me and millions of other Americans for 26 customized, deluxe, premier, first class, private charter, plane flights at taxpayer expense, at an extraordinary estimated cost of more than $400,000. That is just one Cabinet Secretary. Now, I can’t blame him for one of the trips that he took in August to the beautiful and secluded St. Simons Island in southern Georgia, and another trip that enabled him to get to his condo in Nashville and to have lunch with his son. You can hardly blame him for wanting to get out of town and to see the family. After all, it was hot here in Washington, D.C., as climate change sets in across America and the world. But as we say on Capitol Hill: ‘‘It’s not the heat, it’s the stupidity.’’ And look at what our Secretary of Health and Human Services did, and here I will read from Politico, September 26, an article entitled ‘‘Price’s privatejet travels included visits with colleagues, lunch with son.’’ ‘‘The HHS Secretary sometimes combined official travel and meetings with friends and family. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price took a governmentfunded private jet in August to get to St. Simons Island, an exclusive Georgia resort where he and his wife own land, a day and a half before he addressed a group of local doctors at a medical conference that he and his wife have long attended. ‘‘The St. Simons Island trip was one of two taxpayerfunded flights on private jets in which Price traveled to places where he owns property, and paired official visits with meetings with longtime colleagues and family members. On June 6, HHS chartered a jet to fly Price to Nashville, Tennessee, where he owns a condominium and where his son resides. Price toured a medicine dispensary and spoke to a local health summit organized by a longtime friend. He also had lunch with his son. . . . ‘‘An HHS official said both the Georgia and Tennessee trips were for official government business and were paid for by the Department.’’ It is no problem getting out of town and going to see your family but, really, do the taxpayers have to pay for it? If the taxpayers have to pay for trips like this, couldn’t Secretary Price at least fly on first class commercial airplanes, rather than jacking up the taxpayers for tens of thousands of dollars to book a private airplane to do it? Politico asked the same question. Here they said: ‘‘Like some of the other 26 flights that Price took on corporate jets since May identified by a Politico review, the trip to Tennessee appears to have occurred despite the existence of multiple commercial flight options. The trip to Georgia, while less direct, also could have been accomplished with a routine connecting flight through Atlanta’s busy international airport. ‘‘On August 4, Price flew a Dassault Falcon 2000 twin jet from Raleigh, North Carolina, where he had given a speech to a flu vaccine manufacturer, to Brunswick Golden Isles Airport, which is about a halfhour drive from St. Simons Island. It was the same plane that had shuttled him between five States in four days, one that HHS had chartered through Classic Air Charter for more than $86,000, according to Federal contracts. ‘‘The plane arrived in Brunswick at 4:02 p.m. the afternoon before the start of the twoday Medical Association of Georgia retreat and roughly 40 hours before Price addressed the group, according to airport records. . . .’’ b1300 ‘‘At about the same time, there were connecting commercial flights from Raleigh to Brunswick via Atlanta that would have gotten Price to St. Simons Island that evening.’’ My friends, you can go back and you can look. In all of these cases, for example, Secretary Price chartered a plane for $25,000 of government money from Dulles Airport to Philadelphia, a distance of a mere 135 miles. That charter flight left 5 minutes after a regular flight flew, commercial flight flew, from Dulles for a few hundred dollars. So he paid $25,000 and left several minutes later than he would have left had he just taken the commercial flight. He also could have taken, of course, the Amtrak, which is what most people do when they are going to Philadelphia from the Washington area, for a mere $72. Even the first class Acela would have been around $200. He could have taken the British Airways—they go there—whose slogan is: ‘‘To Fly. To Serve.’’ I guess that is not quite right. Or he could have taken Southwest Airlines. Their slogan is: ‘‘Low fares. Nothing to hide.’’ I see that wouldn’t have fit. Maybe JetBlue, ‘‘You Above All.’’ That could have worked. But no, instead, he had to book the private jet and fly for $25,000 from here to Philadelphia. Mr. Speaker, this is an old Washington story. The people who say they are coming to drain the swamp have become the swamp. And this is not something that affects just one Cabinet Secretary. Several Cabinet Secretaries are doing this, as my colleagues have pointed out. With Secretary Price, who seems to be the captain of the swamp flyers; Secretary Pruitt, who is a frequent swamp flyer himself; and Secretary Mnuchin, another swamp flyer, we have a serious staph infection spreading throughout the Trump administration. And why not, the President seems to have evolved a whole new model of government in the 21st century. Government is a moneymaking operation for specific families and specific tiny groups in the society. And that is the message that pervades the Trump administration today. Mr. Speaker, we need to pass the SWAMP FLYERS Act, which is very simple. It says that those of us who have the honor and the privilege of coming to serve the American people here in Washington, D.C., should use regular commercial air flights unless it is a matter of national security, or unless there is not a commercial flight that will get them to where they need to go. But the idea that you have Cabinet Secretaries who have already taken dozens of flights, paid for with hundreds of thousands, or millions of dollars, of taxpayer money when a commercial flight would have done is an absolute scandal. Now, it hasn’t gotten much attention yet because on the scale of the scandals we have seen in this administration, I agree, it is a relatively small one. But it is a dramatic and vivid illustration of what is going on here. The people who said they were going to drain the swamp became the swamp. And now, the swamp pervades everything. Every Cabinet member, all of the Secretaries, the entire government is engulfed in this kind of corruption. It begins right at the top, where President Trump has continued to collect hundreds of thousands, or millions, of dollars in foreign payments at the Trump Hotels, at the Trump office tower, and the Trump golf courses around the world from foreign governments, and has not once come to the U.S. Congress to ask for our permission and consent as is required by Article I, section 9, clause 8 of the Constitution, which forbids the collection of presents, emoluments, offices, and titles from foreign governments by anybody who serves under the United States, who holds an office under the United States. 
This President is not only collecting rampant, extreme amounts of money through his businesses from foreign governments, he is not even asking us for our permission or our consent. We have got to pass the SWAMP FLYERS Act. I commend Mr. LIEUfor writing this immediately when the news broke about this rampant abuse of current regulations. We need to take a stand as a Congress on a bipartisan level. Unanimously, we can pass this to say that government officials should not be flying at taxpayer expense for dubious reasons. We should be using coach like everybody else, flying commercial like everybody else. If you have got to fly first class, fine, fly first class, but fly commercial unless it is a matter of national security, or unless there is not a commercial flight that will get you there. Is that something that we can agree on, on a bipartisan basis? I just want to say, earlier today we saw a magnificent example of real public service and public dedication by our distinguished colleague, Mr. SCALISE , who has returned, thankfully, to this body. He demonstrates and embodies what is best in terms of public service. Unfortunately, we have also seen in Washington this week the personification of what is the worst in public service. We have got to stop taking the American taxpayers for a ride. Let’s pass the SWAMP FLYERS Act immediately. Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Speaker, how much time is remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman has 32 minutes remaining. Mr. GALLEGO. Representative LIEU, how often do you fly back, and where do you fly back to? Mr. TED LIEU of California. I fly about three times a month, and I generally fly from Dulles back to LAX in my district, and I fly commercial. Mr. GALLEGO. How long is your flight? Mr. TED LIEU of California. It is about 5 hours to 5
1⁄2hours, depending on the wind. Mr. GALLEGO. You and I have been Members of Congress since 2015. At any point in any of your flights to and from your work—I am sorry—from here to your home, have you ever used a charter plane? Mr. TED LIEU of California. No. Mr. GALLEGO. Would you even be able to, by law, use a charter plane according to the funds we are allowed to expense? Mr. TED LIEU of California. No. If I did that, I would be the subject of an immediate congressional ethics investigation. Mr. GALLEGO. So what makes Mr. PRICE think that he is somehow above the law, that he is allowed to do this, considering that he knew, as a Member of Congress, that was not allowed and that somehow he can just take advantage of the situation now that he has suddenly moved up after only just a few months of being in Congress, to be the Secretary of Health and Human Services? Mr. TED LIEU of California. That is a great point because what Secretary Price, and Mnuchin, and EPA Administrator Pruitt did was not only disrespectful to taxpayers, there were violations of the Federal regulations. So I am just going to read to you what the Federal regulation says. It says, ‘‘Your agency must select the method most advantageous to the government,’’ when considering travel. Advantageous to the government, not to Secretary Price, or Mnuchin, or EPA Administrator Pruitt. They violated that Federal regulation straight up. That is why Tom Price is under Federal investigation. That is why the IG is investigating Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, and now we call on an investigation of EPA Administrator Pruitt as well for violating the Federal regulations. Mr. GALLEGO. While you were talking about that actual regulation, and to see how well and easy it is not to violate the regulation, I literally just typed into Google, ‘‘flights to Philadelphia.’’ And there is a flight leaving in 46 minutes. And the cheapest I found right now—well, no, I found one for $441. I found another one for $447. If you want to connect to Philadelphia— which I don’t know why you would— but if you want to do that, JetBlue will take you there for $264. So in Secretary Price’s effort to live an extravagant lifestyle and basically void himself of all commonsense, he also violated ethics violations. And this is something that we consistently see within this Trump administration. On the other flip of that, we consistently see a Republicanled Congress that is not doing their duty by the Constitution of oversight on the executive. Not one, not one movement has been done by any Republican, especially Republican leadership, to push back on this egregious waste of taxpayer money. Mr. Speaker, I yield to Representative LIEU. Mr. TED LIEU of California. Let me again conclude by thanking Congressman GALLEGO and Congressman R ASKIN  for highlighting this issue with me today. This really is an issue about the public trust. Taxpayer funds should not be used for luxury private jet travel. It is a very simple issue. Please join us in supporting the SWAMP FLYERS Act. Please join Congressman GALLEGO and us in calling for the resignation of Secretary Price. As Abraham Lincoln said: ‘‘Public sentiment is everything. With public sentiment, nothing can fail. Without it, nothing can succeed.’’ Help us change public sentiment and help us tell the Trump administration: Please stop using taxpayer funds for luxury jet travel. Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. GALLAGHER ). The Chair would remind Members to direct all remarks to the Chair and to formally yield and reclaim time when under recognition. f 
DYNAMIC SCORING The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. SCHWEIKERT ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, my hope is that you find this as entertaining as I did putting some of this together. Actually, let’s put these boards up. We are going to actually do something that, with the rollout of the tax reform mechanics—and I apologize to everyone. Some of this is going to be a little geeky. But I wanted to try to put some things in perspective because I have heard some and read some crazy stuff the last couple of days. So we are going to actually do some dynamic scoring 101. And, actually, at that moment, I think I just heard thousands, if not tens of thousands, of C–SPAN watchers just turn their televisions off. But this is actually important, because every time we are heading towards working on major tax reform or other types of programs that actually have big, bold policy built within them, we get into this sort of debate. What are the effects? What are the effects on society? What are the effects on tax revenue? What are the effects on labor participation? What are the effects on our entitlement programs? And there is sort of this intellectual duplicity around this body. I know that is a little harsh, but we have got to be honest about it. If it were the stimulus package from President Obama several years ago, we had lots of Members on this side who actually talked about, supported, and thought the dynamic scoring models were great. But when we actually talk about something within the Tax Code, rewriting the Tax Code, well, then dynamic scoring is just unacceptable. So I am going to ask everyone to open up your minds and first understand, when we talk about scoring, what we really mean. And we are going to touch on a handful of things, and this is going to be very elementary, sort of basics. So we are going to walk through a number of these. And then I have a number of slides that we will get to in a moment that are more about examples of what math means when looking at it. And the fact of the matter is, there are such things as tax cuts that do not pay for themselves, but there are also such things, actually, as tax policy that do pay for themselves. You have to just choose and be willing to work through the math, and the history of math, and stop being afraid of data around this place. I get behind this microphone quite often and run this joke that this is sort of a mathfree zone. And I am working 
really hard to drag my brothers and sisters on both sides to understand that sometimes the folklore we believe in is correct, but a lot of times it just isn’t. First off, before we do some of the slides, I want to walk through some of the terms. How often do you hear us talk about the baseline? Okay, we talk about it all the time. The baseline is this—you do realize, the baseline actually does have a series of dynamic aspects when we build it. Why do you think, when we come out here every March, or like we did this last March and then again in June, all of a sudden the numbers have changed? That is a case where the world did not stay static. We didn’t create a number a year ago, and that is what the world stayed. Remember, we went through this really ugly, uncomfortable thing this year, where, in just a few months, the deficit actually grew dramatically to the point where we are almost borrowing $700 billion this year. And if we went back a year and a half, we thought this year we might be as low as $500 billion, $550 billion. So if we had stayed static, we would still be just pretending that we were at that number. We recalculate constantly. But it is not just calculating, hey, here are the tax revenues. It is also, hey, we see this trend in number of people taking jobs; hey, we see this trend in number of people signing up for entitlement benefits. So understand, we already, for years, and years, and years, have lived in a dynamic scoring sort of model right now, and we call it our baseline. I also want us to try a couple other things. I want us to think about dynamic scoring as not that number that is given to us but as a way of ranking decisions. So if I came to you right now and said, ‘‘Hey, we have these things in the tax policy, and here are the effects we believe we see as we have the information today,’’ think of it as a tool for making decisions, not that that number is the same number that it is going to actually produce 10 years from now. b1315 With the best data and information we have today, if you as a policymaker—if you are blessed to be one of us who gets to be in this body saying, well, it turns out if I spend the money on this type of tax change compared to the same money on this type of tax change, I get this different effect in the size of our economy, in the number of our brothers and sisters who have jobs and employment opportunities, but also in what it effects in tax revenues. So I know that is culturally hard for a lot of us because we all like to beat up CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation. But in all fairness, a dynamic scoring model is a ranking model. What is the real difference? If I asked you just to say in a single sentence we all had to agree upon a common definition of here is static, here is dynamic, the real difference is a dynamic score has calculations that reflect changes to the size of our economy, which is really important. Now I am going to digress to one side. About once a month I get behind this microphone, and we do a series of slide presentations on how much trouble we are in. The fact of the matter is that in not that distant of a future, we will barely have the revenues to cover our entitlement costs. We are living in a society right now where about three quarters of our spending is what we call mandatory spending—both earned and unearned entitlements—your Medicare is an earned entitlement. Your Social Security is an earned entitlement. But we also have other types that you get because you fell below a certain income or you may be part of a certain group. But the vast majority of what we do in this body is not managing the three quarters of our budget that is on autopilot. These are by formula. If you look at that sort of remaining 25, 27 percent of our budget, well, about a little more than half of that is defense, and everything else is what people think of as government—that is the FBI, that is the National Park Service, that is the FDA, and that is education and research. That will continue to shrink, and it is going to start shrinking fairly dramatically because baby boomers are retiring. Remember, the peak of the baby boomer is only 60 years old right now. We have our brothers and sisters whom we have made promises to, and this body never sat down and did the hard math to be prepared for what happens when 76 million of our brothers and sisters move into their retirement benefit years. So one of the critical reasons you do tax reform is economic growth, because without economic growth, it gets really ugly in about a decade. I continue to be sort of shocked that my brothers and sisters, particularly on the left, who claim to be sort of evangelical advocates for a lot of this entitlement spending, aren’t standing alongside of us and saying: We need to do a major rewrite of our Tax Code. That does just a couple of things. It makes it fairer, and it makes it more simple, but it dramatically—over the next 10, 15, 20, 30 years—expands the size of this economy, because without that expansion, the math is just ugly. A great example of this is when we talk about dynamic scoring. If you do actual dynamic scoring on what is about to happen over the next, functionally, 20 years of where we are demographically, the models don’t work. The actual computer comes back to you and says: Doesn’t work, doesn’t work, doesn’t work, because the math is impossible. Functionally, the amount of debt to the size of our economy gets so big that the models basically say that society has collapsed. You can’t float another bond, and you can’t borrow money from anyone else. It comes to an end. When the computer tells you that, when the computer starts giving you a red flashing—maybe if you don’t believe those of us who get behind the microphone, maybe they will believe the data. Let’s go ahead and start to walk through some of the slides. We are going to walk through a series of these ideas. I am probably going to say parts of this two or three times to have it sink in. We have already had a number of our folks quoted in the press and others showing their cynicism towards dynamic scoring. But those are some of the very same people who actually stood in this same well and promoted the immigration reform and the dynamic scoring that was built into the immigration reform. They are the same folks who actually promoted the dynamic scoring that was built in the stimulus bill several years ago. But they are also the same folks who actually believe things like global warming mechanisms, which are built on a dynamic scoring model, are the absolute facts of math. You can’t have the intellectual duplicity of saying: I believe in this sort of modeling math for things I am ideologically comfortable with, but things I am ideologically not comfortable with is not true. It is math. Let’s try one more time because if we are going to come to policy decisions, we have got to stop living in sort of a mathfree zone. I am doing this as more of an example. None of this is actually policy in the tax reform that those of us on the Ways and Means Committee are so incredibly blessed to be working on. It has been the most interesting year of my life grinding out this math. I can’t tell you the number of times that I thought I had a brilliant idea, you work it out, and you find out that the really smart people around you had all figured out all sorts of ways to get around your Tax Code changes. So sometimes you have got to be humble and just understand that what we are doing is tough. It is complicated. If you make one change over here in the Tax Code, then it turns out it affects over here and creates leakage over here. So that is why you have to do this unified theory. Just so we see this conceptually, if I came to you right now and said, Hey, we have this much money—I think in this model it was $70 billion or $60 billion. The actual dollar amount isn’t that important. If I came to you right now and said, ‘‘You have this much money, you have got to make a Tax Code change with that money,’’ if we did a static score, then the model says it costs you that much money. If you spent $60 billion on this over the 10 years, then it costs $60 billion. Then when we do the dynamic scoring, it turns out that not all tax changes produce the same amount of economic growth, even though it may 
promote fairness, it may promote simplicity, and there may be some things we haven’t calculated. So on this one, if we take a look over here, this was actually something we took from the Tax Foundation’s website. I encourage you to go there. It is a nonpartisan group, and it has some really interesting modeling. If we functionally doubled the child care tax credit to a couple thousand dollars, it turns out the model over 10 years functionally adds almost nothing to GDP growth. Now you will want to try to model it saying: Does it change birthrates? As you know, we are in a societal crisis right now where our birthrates are falling so low that mathematically, in about 20 years, we are going to have some real difficulties having enough taxpayers moving into society’s workforce to actually pay for our payasyougo entitlements. Social Security and Medicare are payasyougo entitlements. Today’s workers are paying for today’s retirees. If that population mix of workers moving in gets too out of whack, then the math gets really uncomfortable. For the same costs, if I came down and in this particular model reduced marginal tax rates, or we have another one where you are going to see we are expensing, which is a type of sort of depreciation that you can take all at once, then all of a sudden this one gets me almost no GDP growth. But the same dollars at that get me well over a point of additional GDP growth. If I am standing in an event back in Arizona and say, ‘‘We are going to spend $60 billion, and we are going to double the child care tax credit,’’ that helps me get reelected. But if I come and say, ‘‘We are going to spend $60 billion changing the marginal tax rates for corporations, or the exact same money for expensing so businesses, particularly smaller businesses, buy new plants and equipment so we get more efficient so we have more growth so more people have jobs,’’ then intellectually we know this is really important for everyone in our society. But this one down here is easier to talk about and easier to get reelected. That is the tough thing here when we live in a world of these pithy, little sound bites, where we say these quick, little simple things then march off and the intellectual discourse of, hey, it is harder than that, we need to find a way to be simpler and fairer, but we also have to be rational on what creates the next generation of economic growth so our brothers and sisters actually have jobs, they have chances to save, chances to have money to put their kids through college, and even their own retirements. We are going to walk through a few more of these examples, and then I have some actual data examples of where this is actually happening in our lives. Now, this slide is a little bit on the geeky side, so forgive me, but this is dynamic scoring 101. All this slide I really want you to look at is, when modeling, it is not only where the money goes, but did it increase the capital stock, and, therefore, there is more capital in these businesses and in these organizations to expand and buy equipment and provide employment, or did it not? But there is also: Did the tax change that creates that new capital stock stay in our Tax Code long enough that the next generation of new, more efficient equipment, new productivity moves in? We actually have some really interesting examples that have been produced datawise on what happens if a Tax Code change phases out. We see this a lot where we have done these, hey, this marginal tax rate for business is for 5 years, and then it goes back to the old higher rate. Or what we are struggling through right now is how to get as much economic growth as possible if we create a type of expensing or accelerated type of depreciation, and what happens in the future of that? Does it phase out? And if it does phase out, what are the economic effects? If you take a look at the green line, you can see what it actually meant both for GDP growth and also for attached within those numbers are revenues. Do you see the red line? So we both have a sympathetic curve here, and then the value of that actually fades away and actually falls, in some occasions, below what would have been a static score because you get the spike of people saying: We have to invest, we have to do this right now, and now we have to back off because of next year. A good example is if I came to you right now and said: Today you have this tax rate, but 2 years from now we double it, what are you going to do with your life? We are going to work like crazy this year, and that 2 years from now, you are planning on taking a vacation year. It is human nature, and I think we have to stop pretending that the Tax Code somehow operates just outside human nature. We will grind through some of these a little faster. At the end, we are going to talk about where you can see all these different charts. Why this is important is when you actually look at the effects of the deficit—and where this was interesting is this was just revenues taken out of society in the ACA, sort of the economic effects of what would happen when we actually did the microeconomic movement calculations, and you actually see if we did repeal those additional dollars—because, remember, this is costing, there is an additional special tax on capital gains and what it is actually doing in economic growth. We have a lot of slides, so I am going to try to go through some that are a little more entertaining. What we are trying to show here is what happens when you take, actually, the exact same functional cost with dynamic effects and static effects. This one is from the Tax Foundation. The real difference is, remember that first slide we walked through where we talked about if we doubled the child care tax credit? Hey, here is our cost, and here is what it actually does. If we dynamically score it or if we actually static score it, oddly enough, it comes out almost identical because there is none of that macroeconomic change. But if you actually dynamically score it, you will see they actually have tremendously that same spending if it were in corporate tax cuts. It has very different economic scores. b1330 We have another slide. We will show on the one down at the end that, at the end of 10 years, we actually make revenue. The revenue line goes beyond its costs. In the 10 years, the first option does not expand. At the end of 10 years, it is actually scored as a loss. That static score is actually accurate. There are a number of these sort of examples out there. I am going to actually go back. This is not being mean. Remember, we are operating under a principle that the dynamic scoring is as much about the money as, hey, we think we are going to have this much tax revenue or this much tax loss at the end of 10 years or the end of the year, but it is also helping us rank. These are important. From 2003 to 2008, we had a tax change, often referred to as the Bush tax cuts, that was going to be $317 billion over 10 years. If you looked at the models that were generated back there, it was supposed to actually cost society, cost the government money. But when we actually got to the end of that time, the end of the phaseout, it actually produced $77 billion more than that tax cut actually cost. That is just in our recent memory, but I have a number of charts here that actually show over and over and over that, if the tax cut is actually put in the right place, we get economic growth and, therefore, additional revenue from it. There are certain things out there that do not pay for themselves. That is why we have this whole discussion of how you find balance if you are working for fairness, if you are working for simplicity, but knowing we must have that economic growth if we are going to keep our promises here. This is just one more example. When you actually see something like this, this first one is as if we were actually to change depreciation tables, that function. It ends up taking about $308 billion out of GDP if we dynamically score it. Each one of these tax policies costs $32 billion. That is actually the idea. This costs $32 billion to the taxpayers. So, if I came right now and said we need to raise $32 billion and we intend to do it in a change in the Tax Code, and then we go out there and say, all right, let’s change depreciation tables to business and we take in $32 billion of 
additional money, what did we just do to the economy? In a static score, it says, hey, you just got $32 billion. If you do a dynamic revenue estimate, which actually does have some macro effects in there, we actually just lost $38 billion, because business slowed down. But if you do the dynamic scoring of what it does over 10 years to the economy, that $32 billion of hopeful tax revenue actually shrunk the U.S. economy by over $300 billion. When they build this model, they are using data going back to the 1950s. But we have an example on the other side. If you go to the far side, what if you were to disallow half of State and local taxes as a deduction? It turns out you would say that we are getting $32 billion because that is what it is written at. You end up bringing in about $29 billion, but you only shrink the economy by $19 billion. Policywise, staticwise, they both say $32 billion in new taxes, but they both have dramatically different effects on the economy. When we actually talk about the dynamic scoring, it is both actually on the taxraising side as much as the taxcutting side. The same sort of concept here, but what if we did it going the other direction? Actually, the same slide we just did, what does that mean in the percentage of GDP, if anyone is sort of thinking in that fashion. The first one, where we actually changed the depreciation tables, we took away of the ability of businesses— particularly, smaller business—to depreciate. It ends up shrinking the U.S. economy almost two points over those 10 years. State and local taxes are actually less than, I think, 0.16 of a percent of GDP over those 10 years. So when you actually hear the phrase ‘‘tax cuts don’t pay for themselves,’’ or, ‘‘you don’t get the revenues expected,’’ that is actually true, except for properly designed and properly targeted. This is actually the flip side of what we just did. Remember, we just did two boards that showed both the revenues and the actual percent of GDP we raise taxes. How about now if we do sort of the exact same thing but we do it as a tax cut? Once again, you are going to actually see—and I am sorry, I put additional notes to make it understandable—that not all tax cuts are the same. In this case, I am going from one end to the other side. So let’s say we go to the full end and we did full expensing. So instead of a depreciation table where, over the 7 years, it is this piece of equipment, or 10 years, whatever it may be, what if you could take the value of that almost immediately? In a dynamic model, it is adding a couple hundred billion dollars to the size of the economy. But if those same dollars, the same amount was spent on, let’s say, over here, we cut the bottom tax rate, that might be the appropriate thing to do for societal fairness. But we have to be cognizant, when we are calculating, what that means in GDP growth. You can see the blue here in the end, and the blue here is positive, but barely. That is over 10 years. This makes it hard because, so often, the very tax policies that are good for us in our reelections may not actually be best for what is good for society and its opportunity for jobs and economic growth. This is now sort of the exact same slide, but in the percentages and sort of understanding, when we doubled the child care tax credit or we lowered the individual brackets, maybe doubling the child care tax credit actually has an effect on birthrates. That would be terrific for society, and particularly for the future of our ability to pay into our entitlements, but if you are looking for GDP expansion and economic growth, it is marginal. The expensing or the corporate tax cuts, when you see those on there, you actually see we have substantially more of what they call capital stock. That is the money that is used to buy new equipment to get more productive, to hire more people, to raise their salaries, and for all of us to have more opportunity. I think we are going to make this our last one. This is the easiest one to sort of get our heads around, and it is the crispest of all. Say you are a fellow Member of Congress and I come to you and say we have $70 billion, over 10 years, that we can plug into on the Tax Code, we have that much capacity. Where do we put it that is best for our society? The initial instinct is to have that discussion of, well, what if we were to cut the bottom Federal tax rate? It is wonderful for our hardworking brothers and sisters who are at the lowest tier of income. It would be wonderfully fair. How about if we put that into expanding the child care tax credit, expanding that? How about if you put that money into expensing? If you get in front of an audience and we did an audience vote, what do you think we would get? The fact of the matter is, when you look at the models, what we have learned from the dynamic scoring, some may get almost no economic expansion. We may get economic fairness, which is a laudable goal. But, ultimately, over the next decade, I need my brothers and sisters in this country to have more job opportunities, more ability to be employed, putting that money into expensing so we get more productive as a society in buying new plants and equipment and machinery to make us more productive so we can pay people more, so we have the ability to save for education, for their retirements. That actually has over 5 percent additional expansion of the size of our economy. These are the types of issues that those of us on the Ways and Means Committee have been struggling with over the last year and are going to struggle over the next month as we try to find that balance of what is simplicity, what is fairness, but also what maximizes economic growth. Just as a couple of little last pieces here to sort of understand this. I am begging for those of us who are going to be in this sort of battle, debate, that we do our best to sort of be intellectually honest about what we are talking about. A good example is the number of dollars we are talking about right now in rewriting the Tax Code is, I think, 1 percent or so of GDP, maybe less than that. The stimulus from several years ago was 7 percent of GDP. We have had some folks who are criticizing this over here and saying you intend to dynamically score that, but were almost giddy about spending and scoring actual spending over here that we learned later did not allocate well. There is a concept, if I had a dollar, where would it be spent best to grow society, if I gave it to you as an individual, as a businessperson or an entrepreneur, saying: Where would you put that? Would you try and take that dollar and do something with it that grows the economy? Or we have the other side over here. When government spends it, we have this bad habit of spending money on things that are often politically driven and that don’t necessarily have the same type of economic expansionary effects. It is this thing called price theory, where money gets allocated into society. Who is better at allocating that dollar? I will make you an argument that individuals in the market actually have a long history of doing it much healthier, much better. As we finish what we will call Dynamic Scoring 101, what did we learn? The scores are incredibly important in making decisions about how you allocate resources, both on raising taxes, lowering taxes. Where does it have the most impact? Where does it do the most damage? Where does it do the most good? Dynamic scoring is actually a ranking mechanism, because the ultimate number, we are never going to have enough information to be perfect, but all we can do is take the information we have today and try to find a way to say, with today’s information, this use of these resources creates this much more opportunity in our society than spending the same dollars over here. So when we are going to get into this debate about what the dynamic scoring is providing those of us who are making the policy, understand, it is sometimes more of choosing A over C, because A produces more expansion in our society, more opportunity, even though they cost the same, than sometimes looking at the dollar amounts. Often, as we saw on some of these boards here, the dollar amounts, if we 
statically score it, are the same. They just have different effects. This is really, really important. So think of dynamic scoring as just that: it is the scorekeeping of how we all do this. For everyone that is actually interested in this, I will strongly encourage you to go to the Joint Committee on Taxation’s website. I believe they actually have a tab there that actually geeks out a little bit on what dynamic score is, particularly if you are an accounting or quant major. You will love this stuff. Also, the Tax Foundation, which is nonpartisan. We have actually borrowed lots of information from them. They actually have some really great examples of, when we, over the years, have made certain types of policy decisions, what has been good for society and where we have actually missed and not gotten near the numbers that we have promised. Do understand that, when we take a look at what we did in 2003, the U.S. economy ended up being 4.6 percent larger by 2006. So, from 2003 to 2006, we actually were 4.6 percent larger—I know these are a little bit geeky—than the models back then provided for. b1345 It is not that the models were bad and evil. They just didn’t have all the data. But they still provided an opportunity for the policymakers, back in 2003, to actually make their decisions. So I hope—actually, if anyone actually found this interesting, please write and tell us. If you are now bored out of your mind and we helped you sleep, please let us know. But the reality of it is, what is about to happen in the debate over tax reform is going to have a lot of really technical, really complicated debating points in it. As I learned yesterday, when we were rolling out some of the math, some of our brothers and sisters who desperately do not want us to have a win decided that zero was a tax hike. I just beg of everyone for at least on this issue, if we can sort of pull our partisan rage away and just sort of focus on the working population of our society and how we help and also how do we help for the future so my 2yearold daughter, so your children, so my family that may be heading towards retirement, everyone has a fair chance. And that fair chance can only happen if we really start to grow this economy and start to grow it fairly dramatically. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
RETURN OF STEVE SCALISE AND REPEALING OBAMACARE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT ) for 30 minutes. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, this has been a day that answered a lot of our prayers seeing our good friend STEVE SCALISE here, and it brings to mind part of the story of that tragic morning that I haven’t heard told anywhere else. One of our Members, Georgia Congressman BARRY LOUDERMILK , was there, and he was—the shooter started from behind the third base dugout and hit STEVE SCALISE right away. It was so deeply touching to hear STEVE ’s words today. It is just rather emotional seeing so many of our prayers answered, seeing STEVE return to the House. That morning, BARRY was saying that he was behind a little closet area, and as the shooter was moving toward the first base side continuing to shoot, Matt Mika had already been shot and was down, and BARRY realized that he had no place to go. He looked for places to run, and there was no place to run. The shooting had been going on for a while, perhaps 9 or 10 minutes at that point. Capitol Police Officer Griner was there. She and David Bailey, the other Capitol Police officer, were using their suburban for cover and shooting at the shooter—the hatefilled leftist who felt like it was a good idea to kill as many Republicans in Congress as he could. It was gratifying to hear that admission from our friend from Maryland, former majority leader HOYER , that it was hateful. He was full of hate. He was a leftist who had supported BERNIE  SANDERS . It is not B ERNIE ’s S ANDERS ’ fault. You don’t hear Republicans blaming a party or a candidate that a hatefilled person supported, but he was going to kill people. He was doing what he could. BARRY had no place to go, and he was working his way to where he was about—BARRY was going to be in the open and could see there was no place to go, and he said a prayer. He saw that Officer Griner had been shot in the ankle, and she was trying to return fire but under tremendous amount of pain. Just when it looked hopeless, David Bailey stepped out, completely uncovering himself. He had no cover at that point, and yelled twice: ‘‘Drop your weapon. Drop your weapon.’’ And as he said those words, the shooter fired twice at him. And as soon as he finished saying, ‘‘Drop your weapon’’ the second time, he fired twice and took the shooter down. Incredible courage. When I saw David Bailey out at the hospital a few days after the shooting, I said: ‘‘BARRY LOUDERMILK said that when it looked pretty hopeless for him, you stepped out from behind the suburban completely uncovered, that you made yourself a target taking all the attention toward yourself. Did you do that?’’ And David Bailey, a hero in every sense of the word, with his normal casual way of speaking, just said: ‘‘It hit me all of a sudden. I had to make it him or me. I had to make it him or me. That is when I stepped out. And, fortunately, it was him.’’ That kind of courage—when a shooter is about to get to a position to take out a bunch of defenseless people, some lying on the ground in the dugout, if he had made it just a little further, there would have been a lot of people killed that day. Crystal Griner shooting as she could and David Bailey stepping away from any cover, and he just instinctively knew, ‘‘I have to make it him or me,’’ thank God and thank David Bailey he is still here today and the hatefilled shooter is not. So it was touch and go. The hate that filled this leftist shooter almost did in a couple of people who day. But by the grace of God, the great work of the doctors—but as the doctor said out there that night after the shooting, telling me, the President, Melania, and my staff member Andrew Keyes, it was—he said he would be on pins and needles that night because he just didn’t know. To see STEVE SCALISE , our dear friend, standing right here earlier today, is just an answer to prayer, and I can’t wait to cook ribs again for my friend STEVE SCALISE very soon. It is also a good day for America, despite the House passing a bill that would have helped Americans by at least repealing part of ObamaCare, as we had promised, and despite the immense suffering by millions around this country who actually became victims of the lie that if you like your insurance, you can keep it; if you like your doctor, you can keep him or her— well, it turns out those were lies when they were spoken, and the people who spoke them knew they were lies when they spoke them. It was discussed that that would not be the case, they wouldn’t be able to keep their insurance, and people haven’t. It is a bit disingenuous when some of the altleft media boasts that so many millions of people have gotten insurance that didn’t have it, because there are an awful lot of people in my district that had insurance and, because of ObamaCare, they lost it, and then they were put on Medicaid—not even Medicare, but Medicaid. So they lost their doctor, they lost the hospital that was no longer in the network for Medicaid that they had before. ObamaCare took their insurance. The people who have talked to me in east Texas and as I go around in other parts of the country, they were desperate. They have been desperate. They are still desperate. They say: Please, you got to give us some help. It is tragic when you have some millionaires in the Senate who can get whatever healthcare they want, turning a cold shoulder to those suffering around the country because the countless promises they made to repeal ObamaCare are being broken every day we are in session and the Senate does not pass at least some kind of repeal of ObamaCare. I mean, what kind of person promises over and over, ‘‘You elect me, I will repeal ObamaCare, I will get it repealed,’’ knowing that there will be a 
smug and proud vote against any effort to repeal, even partially repeal ObamaCare? You make promises like that knowing that, without those promises, you would not get elected. People count on your promises because they really are hurting, they need the medicine that they are not getting under the new Medicaid, they don’t have the doctor that was providing so much help under their insurance before ObamaCare took it away. And an almost cheerful breaking of those promises, it really is tragic. It is simply tragic. It is really unfortunate that they don’t have the millions, like some Senators, to get whatever healthcare they want, that they make—they could suffer less, perhaps be cured if Republican Senators all kept their promises. b1400 It is just tragic. But despite that, this has been a week where the House has done what we can under reconciliation. We sent a bill to the Senate. They didn’t have to pass that bill, just something so that we could have a conference bill to give Americans the help they needed. We have done what we can there, so we are taking up tax reform. And if we do the right thing by Americans, they will have more money in their pockets. If we pass the bill that has just been proposed—I don’t have all the details— the framework certainly looks like something we can really work with that will put a lot more money in middle class pockets. It is interesting. I hear some people, especially at the other end of the hall in the opposite party, opposing party, who make efforts to tax the poor in order to reward Republican rich friends. We saw back in 2008, there were apparently a whole lot more rich people on Wall Street that supported Barack Obama than supported the unfortunate losing candidate of the Republican Party that year. Yeah, the rich people on Wall Street, more of them supported Barack Obama. That kind of goes against what is thought to be conventional wisdom that the Republicans are rich and the Democrats are poor when the reports we have to file annually indicate that some of us came here without anything and we sacrificed virtually everything we had to run, to try to make a difference in this country, and we haven’t become rich by being here; whereas, there are an awful lot of millionaire Democrats here in the House and in the Senate. But if you look at what has been proposed, the lowest tax rate in America right now is 10 percent. And it appears, we are told, it should be everybody paying 10 percent right now should end up paying no tax. Well, personally, I would rather see us have everybody pay something in the way of income tax, pay something, the lowest rate possible—whether it is 6, 7, or 8 percent, maybe 7 percent, something—so that every single American pays an income tax so they understand how important it is to have a frugal government and not just constantly be handing out welfare, especially in cases that involve fraud. I had a lady that was telling me there in Tyler, Texas, that she used to, every spring, work for H&R Block in helping people prepare their tax returns. She said she finally had to give it up. People would come in and they wouldn’t have Social Security numbers. They would have tax ID numbers. Now, why would they have tax ID numbers? Well, even though the law says that you are not supposed to be filing tax returns because you are not supposed to be working if you don’t have a Social Security number, the IRS assumed—and we know what that means, they assumed—that, gee, if we give people a tax ID number, then they will pay income tax, and that will bring in more money to the coffers. But, according to this lady, the reason she couldn’t do it anymore was she was becoming a nervous wreck because so many people were coming in with tax identification numbers, not Social Security numbers, and they would have a list of things that they would want her to put in their tax return. And they always had, she said, a number of children listed that they wanted to claim that would ensure that they got more money back from an earned income tax credit than they even paid in. Since she was a senior citizen on a fixed income, the little extra help that she made helping people prepare tax returns, she gave it up. It was driving her a bit crazy to help people get back more money than they paid in over and over and over again when she understood the law. That is not supposed to be what happened. So a lot of people say, hey, folks that are illegally in the country—and we are not talking about any particular place, just people illegally here from wherever they are—when they file a tax return and get more back than they paid in, then that is not quite as some represent, oh, gee, they pay so much money in income tax, they are good for the country. Well, we know an awful lot of hard workers who we have seen—illegal aliens. I hear contractors say: I found out one of my best workers is not here legally. But it brings us back to the point: Why are such hardworking people especially coming from south of the border into the United States? Well, obviously, for those type of folks—they came in and they are hardworking— they came to get jobs. But that begs the question: Why are they having to come to the United States to get jobs? They are hardworking. Why wouldn’t they find jobs in Mexico or El Salvador or Guatemala? Why wouldn’t they find jobs in these other Central American countries or Mexico? The answer is obviously very clear: it is because of all of the corruption. Even though I understand the President of Mexico recently claimed there were no drug cartel murders going on at the very time when there were an enormous number that happened within the few days of him saying that, we know there is murder, there is corruption, and it is from the drug cartels. And the gangs and the coyotes that bring people into the United States illegally, they answer to the drug cartels. It is the Border Patrol that told me over and over, every inch of the U.S.Mexico border is spoken for by some drug cartel; and if you cross into the United States without paying an appropriate price or dues to that drug cartel, then you are not going to last very long because they feel they have to make an example of you. I saw one estimate of $70 billion or $80 billion, somewhere around there, estimated to have gone from the United States into Mexico, to the drug cartels, for illegal drugs. Well, if we build a wall where it is appropriate and we totally secure our border 100 percent, then that $70 billion, $80 billion that is used for the drug cartels in their corruption of the Mexican cities and federal government and state government, that dries up to nothing. And if we could help dry up the $70 billion to $80 billion to $70,000 or $80,000 for illegal drugs, then, finally, we would help Mexico—as the best neighbor Mexico could ever dream of having—to become one of the very top economies in the world. They ought to be one of the top 10 economies now, maybe top 5. All the massive natural resources that Mexico has, they are actually in a better location for trade than the United States. They are between two continents, North and South America. They are between two oceans like we are, the Pacific and the Atlantic, with, of course, the Gulf of Mexico in between. They ought to be a top 10 economy, but they are not because of corruption from the drug money that illegally crosses the U.S. border into Mexico. We cut that off. And then you have all these hardworking people who just want to help their families. They don’t want to have to flee the country they love to find a job. The jobs would be abounding all over Mexico. Isn’t that what a friendly, caring neighbor would do for a neighbor? Shouldn’t we want to help Mexico stop the corruption? Of course. And any Mexicanelected official who says that there is no corruption, that there is no drug cartel influence, or that there is nobody being killed by the drug cartels, well, a statement by a Mexicanelected official that those things are not going on is an indication that that elected official is either completely ignorant of what is going on in his or her country or they are, as one would suspect, under the finger of the drug cartels themselves. So I am hopeful we are going to be able to get a wall where we need it. President Trump and Attorney General 
Sessions are both doing everything they can to help secure the border. We need a Secretary of Homeland Security, and I am sure that will be coming quickly. The Democrats will probably try to block whoever it is for as long as they can, but we need a Secretary of Homeland Security; and we need our border secured not merely to help us, but as being the best possible thing we could do as a caring neighbor of Mexico. Our Republican Conference we had in the House yesterday seemed very productive. We had a good discussion about the proposed tax reform, and, as I was mentioning earlier, you will have people who have been paying 10 percent will go to paying nothing. Some that are paying much higher taxes will be cut down to 12 percent, and brackets indicating that there is going to be an awful lot more money in the pockets of people who are working, that will be fantastic, because when we leave more money in the pockets of those who have actually earned it, it gets the economy going. People, whom I have immense respect for, like Dr. Arthur Laffer, Stephen Moore, Larry Kudlow, it is very clear to them, when they run the numbers, we could never adequately tax our way out of bankruptcy the direction we are headed. We couldn’t. We cannot tax enough. If you put on too much tax, then people quit working. But the way to make Social Security solvent and to make Medicare solvent is if we get the economy growing not at the 1.8 percent—I believe that was the average for the Obama administration—but for the good of everybody. People keep the money in their pockets. That allows them to spend it, and it causes the economy to grow. I know, during the Obama administration, they saw 3 percent growth in the economy as just being virtually impossible; and I can understand, because their idea was tax, tax, tax, and that kills an economy. Whereas, if you allow people to have more of their own money, they spend more of their money. That allows more jobs to be created, and there are more people paying taxes. They begin making more, so they are paying higher taxes, even though it is at a lower rate. That helps stimulate the economy. b1415 I was really hoping that President Trump’s number of 15 percent corporate tax would work out to be our number for corporate tax. I was hoping that would be for regular C corporations, as well as a passthrough subchapter S corporation, because President Trump and I and others know that if it is a 15 percent corporate tax, then we would get back most of the manufacturing jobs, which fled America because of our massive 35 percent tax. Actually, by the time you add in all the others, it is well over 40 to 50 percent tax on corporations. The reason some of us say the corporate tax is one of the most insidious taxes there is is because the government defrauds Americans into thinking they are not paying the corporate tax. These evil, rich corporations are paying those taxes. They are saying: ‘‘We are not paying them. Make the evil corporations.’’ Whereas, anybody that is going to really be honest about it would have to say: ‘‘Well, the truth is, yeah, it is actually a passthrough from the customer, because if the corporation doesn’t pass on that massive tax they are paying, they go out of business.’’ So it is actually an additional tax on the little guy. So the middle class, lowerincome folks are paying the big corporate tax. It is not the wealthy. It is the customers that are paying all that extra corporate tax. So if you got the tax rate for corporations down to 15 percent, those companies start coming back, the manufacturing jobs come back. As I mentioned to the President one time: ‘‘Mr. President, you understand it because of your great business acumen, and I understand it from studying history, but any major nation that cannot manufacture what they need in a time of war will not be a major nation after the next war.’’ The President wants those jobs back. It is not 15 percent being proposed. It is 20 percent. But that will bring back jobs. Not as many as if we had a 15 percent corporate tax, but it will bring back jobs. I know there are those who say: Oh, we have evolved in America. We are more of a service economy. We don’t want to be a manufacturing economy with those dirty jobs. Yes, we do. We need to have those manufacturing jobs. Those are good jobs. We have requirements that you have to be concerned about the health of Americans. And by doing that, we bring back the jobs, we help our economy, and we actually save Social Security and Medicare. I see my friend, Dr. HARRIS , is here. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
TAX REFORM The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. HARRIS ) for 30 minutes. Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Texas is absolutely right. An important thing happened this week. We announced that the American public is going to get a tax cut. As I go around my district, as I am sure Members when they go around their districts, one thing they rarely hear is: You know, Washington spends their money very efficiently. They do everything just right. So why don’t you tax me a little bit more? We don’t hear that. What we hear is that hardworking Americans want to keep more of their paycheck. They look at what the Federal Government takes out of their paycheck. They don’t think they are getting their money’s worth. Honestly, Mr. Speaker, once you are around here a while, you realize they are probably not getting their money’s worth. So what we are going to do is we are going to follow the President’s lead. The President has said that what he wants is a tax reform bill that cuts taxes in America so that businesses come back to America, that our job creators get tax relief, and that hardworking middle class American families can keep more of their paychecks. And that is exactly what the tax reform outline has laid out for the American public this week. Now, from the naysayers, you will hear the same old lines: tax cuts for the rich, blah, blah, blah. The bottom line is that we are going to relieve the tax burden on American businesses that will bring jobs back to this country. Mr. Speaker, if you look over the past 35 years of what has happened, from 1980 to 2015, the corporate tax rates, back in 1980, the top line of this graph is the U.S. tax rate, marginal corporate tax rate, which was around 50 percent at the time. It was just about the same as what the worldwide average was. In the 1980s, the last time we had major tax reform under the leadership of President Reagan, we dropped the corporate tax rate to under 40 percent, and at that time, it was right in the middle of where the corporate taxes were worldwide. So the companies had no advantage to take their businesses and move it overseas in order to save taxes. But something very interested happened. If you look at the top line here, since then, our corporate tax rate has stayed at right about 40 percent. It is now 39.6 when you add in both the Federal taxes and the State corporate taxes, but the worldwide averages have fallen. Mr. Speaker, other countries around the world have figured out that businesses will go to countries and they will create jobs in those areas where the taxes are lower. So what has happened? So if you look at what the corporate taxes look like now and what the corporate tax rates are around the world, these are the 35 leading nations, our competitors in the world. The United States now has the highest corporate tax rate at 38.9 percent combined. Again, the Federal plus the State tax rate. France and Belgium, 34 percent. Germany, 30 percent. But if you look at where we are losing our business to, it turns out that very small countries like Ireland, way down at the bottom, years ago lowered their corporate tax rate to 12
1⁄2percent. And what happened? We moved businesses to Ireland. When I worked in the operating room—and still do a few days a year— I would pick up what is called an endotracheal tube. It is a tube we use when 
we breathe for a patient. It goes into their windpipe and they breathe through it. I would pick it up—and this happened 15 years ago—look at it and say: ‘‘Wait a minute. This is made in Ireland. How in the world are medical items like this made in Ireland?’’ And I would look at other items in the operating room, and they were made in Ireland. I didn’t know at the time that the reason was that Ireland lowered its corporate tax rate, and literally many things that used to be made in the United States, like those endotracheal tubes, like other medical devices, were now made in Ireland; not by Americans, but by people in Ireland. We lost those jobs over there, and it was as a result of our corporate tax rate. So our other competitors, you know, we look at car manufacturers, Korea, 24 percent corporate tax rate. Again, ours is at 38.9 percent. We look at other places around the world. The United Kingdom, Britain, one of our largest trading partners and one that certainly competes with us for businesses, whether it is the pharmaceutical industry or whether it is other businesses, they are at 19 percent. We are at 38.9 percent. So what does this tax plan do? This tax plan says that for those corporations that are moving businesses around the world based on a tax rate, we can’t have the highest tax rate in the world, because what we have seen is the emptying of American manufacturing to places around the world where the tax rate is lower. Mr. Speaker, I would offer that if you or I invented something today and we looked to manufacture it somewhere, where would we go? Would we stay in the United States with a 38.9 percent combined corporate tax rate? Or would we go to Ireland, where it is 12
1⁄2percent, where, for every item we make, our company can make more money, invest that back in the company and take profits from it? Of course we would go to Ireland. So what do we have to do? We have to address that. The President has said this is one of his top priorities, because this will bring back the jobs that have bled from the United States. When we looked at what is called a corporate inversion, where a company looks to buy an American company, move its headquarters overseas, it is doing it for tax purposes. Why should that happen? Why shouldn’t we be attracting these companies to the United States? How do we do it? We do it by lowering the corporate tax rate. The plan, the outline that we have put forward to the American people this week lowers the corporate tax rate to 20 percent. Again, from 35 percent, which is the Federal rate, to 20 percent. It lowers it to the lowest among our competitive countries. Now, not as low as I would like to see it go, not as low as the President would like to see it go. The President thinks we need to be way down at the bottom of that chart. That is how we need to attract businesses back. Mr. Speaker, to be honest, if we lower the tax rate just to be competitive, we are not competitive anymore. Companies will bring their business back to the United States for the reasons that a lot of businesses originally were in the United States: we have a highly trained workforce, we have the rule of law, we have a lot of benefits for businesses to do business here. Now, if Congress agrees, if we can come up with this reform plan, we are going to be seeing businesses fighting each other to come back into the United States because they realize this is the place they can do business best. Mr. Speaker, only a minority of jobs are actually produced by those large corporations, what we call C corporations, the ones that paid the ‘‘corporate income tax.’’ So the President said he also wanted to emphasize that what we need to do is lower the tax rate on our small businesses because, as you know, almost twothirds of the jobs created in this country are created by small businesses. So the Unified Tax Reform Framework, our tax plan, limits the maximum tax rate for small and family owned businesses to 25 percent. Mr. Speaker, today that tax rate is 39.6 percent. Again, this will allow these small businesses and our familyowned businesses to take the money, invest it; and then when their businesses make money, when they hire workers and they make money, they are allowed to keep more to put back in those businesses, to hire more workers. This is how we get our economy going again. If you talk to, again, these small businesses and these familyowned businesses, or the larger businesses, there are two things that these businesses say they need in order to succeed. One is they need a regulatory environment that is reasonable. Mr. Speaker, the last administration was strangling American businesses through overregulation. So the first thing the President did when he came into office, to his credit, is say: We have to have only reasonable regulations. We can’t overregulate our businesses. We are stifling them. Mr. Speaker, it is amazing that over the past 100 years, the average growth in what we call the GDP—the gross domestic product—in the United States, the average growth in GDP is 3.3 percent over 100 years. Now, over the last administration, of course, you know it has the dubious honor of being the first administration where there was never a year of 3 percent growth. In fact, the average growth was under 2 percent. The mood was so bad in American business and the American business climate that the economists who would predict how the economy was going to operate have actually lowered their expectations of GDP growth to under 2 percent per year for the near future. That is not the America we know. The America we know leads the world. When we see 6, 7, and 8 percent growth in China, why would we be satisfied with under 2 percent growth? There is no need to be satisfied with that. So we have to go to, again, our small businesses and our other businesses and ask them: What do you need to grow and produce jobs, to bring jobs back to this country, to put Americans back to work? And the answer is: One, relieve us of the regulatory burden. And from day one, that is what the President has done. b1430 But there is another thing they say. We need relief from our tax rate. Again, the tax rate was the highest in the industrialized world. Our tax rate, the highest in the industrialized world. Our tax rate on small businesses was even higher. 39.6 percent was the highest marginal rate. That is not an environment where businesses thrive. The President is taking care, to a large extent, of relieving the regulatory burden, the overregulatory burden, that exists for American businesses. Now Congress needs to turn its attention to the second leg on that stool, which is the tax problems. So the reform framework does that, and it does it exactly the right way. It says we agree with the President. Americans are waiting for these jobs to come back. They don’t want to see the back end of the moving van leaving American companies and bringing them overseas anymore. They don’t like that. I can’t blame them. There is no reason why more things can’t be made here, more businesses can’t thrive here. So we need to take those steps, but that is only one part of this plan. The President said the other thing we need to do is return more dollars into the pockets of hardworking middle class taxpayers. That is exactly what this plan does. It does it by simplifying the Tax Code, by doubling the standard deduction and lowering all the rates. The naysayers will say: Well, you know, if you lower the rates, you are going to increase our debt and our deficit. In fact, if you turn on the TV right now, that is what all the talking heads are complaining about. How could those Republicans suggest a plan that will increase our deficit? Well, Mr. Speaker, if you ask some people over at the Congressional Budget Office what happens to revenues if you increase the tax rate to 200 percent of income, they will say: Oh, it goes up 200 percent. Well, that is ridiculous. At some point, overtaxation suppresses economic activity, and revenues go down. Conversely, both with the tax cuts under President Kennedy in the 1960s 
and the tax cuts with President Reagan in the 1980s, what we saw when we lowered rates was, in fact, the rejuvenation of the American economy, a stimulation of our GDP, a stimulation of our economy, leading to, in fact, increased revenue in both of those instances. But in both of those instances, the naysayers said: You can’t do this. If you are going to cut your taxes, your deficits will go up. That just plain doesn’t happen. So, yes, if you assume, all else being equal, that if we lower tax rates that revenue will go down, that would be true. But we know what happens when the American people feel the economy is going well, when they are fully employed, when we bring goodpaying jobs back to this country and we lower the tax burden directly on hardworking middle class Americans. We know what happens. The economy grows. With more money in their pockets, people make the decision to buy a car, to buy a house, to buy the new washing machine, to spend money on things that they have been afraid to spend money on because of the stagnant economy over the past 8 years. We will unleash growth like we haven’t seen since the 1980s, when, in response to the Reagan tax cuts, we had GDP growth not of 3 percent, not of 4 percent, but of 5 and 6 percent after that tax cut. So, in fact, tax cuts stimulate the economy, which lifts all boats, and it increases revenues. So, Mr. Speaker, we have to tackle this challenge. Now, we know there are a lot of special interests there because, when you simplify the Tax Code, what happens? All the lobbyists come knocking on our doors, and they want to maintain their little piece of this Tax Code. And the Tax Code runs to thousands and thousands of pages. Very knowledgeable people can’t even fill out their tax returns anymore, they are so complicated. Or they are worried they filled it out wrong. Or, Mr. Speaker, the best thing—or the worst thing—the funniest thing that I hear is that, if you have a tax question and you can’t figure out exactly how to do it and you call the IRS, if you call two or three times, you are likely to get two or three different answers about how to fill out that form and how much tax you have to pay. Well, when you get to that situation, you have gone way too far, and, Mr. Speaker, that is where we are. We are at that situation that a reasonable American can’t even fill out their own taxes it has become so complicated. So, as part of this framework, if we can simplify it the way this framework says, 90 percent of Americans will literally be able to fill out their taxes on something the size of a postcard. That is what we need to get back to, that kind of simplification. But again, the road won’t be easy because we will have all the special interests here in this town, and we know there are a lot of them. We will have all of those special interests knocking on our doors, saying: Please preserve our little carveout. But every little carveout makes the Tax Code more complicated. Every complication means that hardworking Americans don’t get to keep as much in their pockets, and that is what we have to solve. We have to solve this problem. It has been getting worse now. Again, the last time we dealt with the Tax Code in a comprehensive way was 30 years ago. To its credit, at the time, we reduced rates, we stimulated the economy, but we really didn’t simplify the Tax Code as much as we would like to at this point. So it is going to be hard, it is going to take months, and it is going to take a lot of people looking past the naysayers, past the people who say this can’t be done, past the people who say the sky is falling, because we have heard this all before. I am old enough to have heard it in the 1980s. That is when I started working. That is when I started bringing home a paycheck. That is the time when I started realizing what Federal taxation was. I always tell the story of my oldest daughter, who trained to become a nurse, and she went and got hired. The first time she brought her paycheck—a real paycheck, a fulltime job paycheck from the hospital—home, she said: Dad, what is going on here? I thought I was making this amount of money, and this is the amount I bring home. We all know what happened. You saw all those lines: The Federal tax taken out; the State tax taken out; the local tax taken out; the Social Security tax taken out; the Medicare. You saw all the taxes that were taken out. So what we have to do is we have to simplify the Code, bring those tax rates down, put more of that money in the pockets of hardworking middle class Americans. We owe them that. Part of that is simplifying that Tax Code. Now, once we do this and we stimulate the economy, we get the economy going again, our deficits will come down. Look, we have to control spending. There is no question about it. Spending in this town is out of control. There is no question about it. Our deficit will exceed $700 billion a year. To put that in perspective, that is 20 times the size of my State’s entire budget, and that is the amount that we are going to borrow this year. When people say that we need money for this and we need money for that, every time we ask that question, you know, can we afford it, we have to ask: Can we afford passing this debt on to future generations? I have five children, now, six grandchildren. My children will never pay off this debt. Those listening at home, if they don’t believe me, go and look at the Federal Budget website and look at the projection of Federal debt. It never goes to zero. It never, ever goes to zero—ever—not in my children’s lives, not in my grandchildren’s lives, not in my greatgrandchildren’s lives. That is just not the way we ought to run a government. So once we tackle this tax reform, once we get our economy booming again with businesses vying to come into this country—not to go to some other country, but to come into America to do business—then we have to turn our attention to securing the future for future generations, to making certain that our Social Security system, which our seniors depend on, will not only be here for the seniors now, but for when my children and grandchildren reach their old age; that the Medicare system, which is scheduled now to be bankrupt in 10 years, that the Medicare system that our seniors depend on will not be there just for my generation, not just for my children’s generation, but for my grandchildren. We have to make sure that this country remains the strongest, most powerful country on Earth, a force for good and freedom throughout the world. We have to restore our defense budget. This President, to his credit, has called for that. But as we restore our defense budget, we do have to redefine our spending priorities, because we don’t—or, I guess, maybe we do, print money here, but it is not the right thing to do. We shouldn’t be borrowing from future generations to take care of these priorities. We have to get our economy going, make sure our revenues increase, and then turn our attention to making sure those revenues are spent wisely and that we define the future for our children and grandchildren, a future that they can be proud of in a country that remains, as Majority Whip SCALISE  said on this floor today, standing at this podium, a country that the world can look toward for leadership, the country that, for now over a century, the world has looked toward for leadership to be the beacon of freedom, to be what President Reagan called the ‘‘shining city on the hill.’’ Mr. Speaker, we do that by restoring the health of our economy. We took a big step toward that this week with our tax reform framework. We are setting the country up for an economic rejuvenation, for a restoration, for those companies that have gone overseas to come back home. Let our great American workers make their products. Come back home to the greatest country this world has ever known. Mr. Speaker, that was a big step, but it is only the first step. We have weeks and months of work to get that done, a big job, an important job, but the first step was taken this week. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
