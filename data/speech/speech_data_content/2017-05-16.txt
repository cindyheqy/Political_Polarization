Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, all across America over the last 2 or 3 weeks has been an exciting time for a lot of young Americans and families as graduating seniors in 4year programs and 2year programs are receiving their degrees and beginning, obviously, a new, exciting stage in their life. Unfortunately, there is still, though, a cloud over a lot of those folks in terms of what they face in the near future and the longterm future and many others who graduated in recent years, which is the high cost of student loan debt. The Federal Reserve has calculated that over $1 trillion of overhang exists in the U.S. economy because of student loan debt: an amount greater than credit card debt, an amount greater than auto debt, and at rates that far exceed any of those forms of consumer debt, including mortgages for homes. The Federal Government, in the meantime, is out selling bonds as a borrower to people who buy Treasury bonds, 10year notes. This morning’s rate, which I checked before coming down here, the rate that the Federal Government is going to pay as borrower, is 2.3 percent. Well, as many, I think, listening here, Mr. Speaker, know, the fact is that student loans carry much higher rates of interest, particularly legacy debt that goes back 5, 6 years ago when, again, the rates for Stafford student loans, which are the publicly financed loans through the Federal Government, and certainly private loans that banks give to students that are on an unsecured rate can sometimes exceed 8, 9, 10 percent. So tomorrow, I and many others are going to be introducing legislation called the Bank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act, which will allow folks who carry the student loan debt not to get their debt forgiven, but to allow them to actually refinance down to 3.76 percent, which was the interest rate last year that the Federal Government offered for Stafford student loans. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that that will put about $50 billion into the pockets of young people all across the country who, because of student loan debt, are being inhibited in terms of getting married, starting a family, starting a business, and getting out of their parents’ house. There is just all kinds of, I think, inhibitors that student loan debt creates for young people, millennials, all across the country. Again, I want to emphasize the bill that I will be introducing tomorrow with 61 cosponsors is not debt forgiveness. It just simply does what any middle class family does in a lowinterest rate environment, whether it is with a home mortgage or credit cards, to just simply get their rates down to a proportionate level with, again, the rest of consumer debt that is out there in the economy. Simultaneously tomorrow, Senator ELIZABETH WARREN from Massachusetts will be introducing exactly the same bill, so we will have bills in the House and in the Senate. Last year we had 182 cosponsors on a similar piece of legislation. Unfortunately, the Speaker never allowed the bill to be brought to the floor for debate. But it is a new Congress; it is the 115th Congress that was sworn in last January. This problem, I will just submit, Mr. Speaker, exists in Republican districts and Democratic districts, rural districts, suburban districts, urban districts. This is an opportunity to lift a debt burden from, again, the very folks that we really want to assist and help as they begin a new phase, a new chapter, in their life, and they should not have the albatross of high student loan rates hung around their neck. Hopefully, this will be the year that we will move forward on this measure, which is fully paid for—it does not add to the Federal debt—and just, again, allows young people and families the opportunity to do what they do with all other forms of consumer debt. So it is the Bank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act. Hopefully, anyone listening to this will call their Members to tell them to get on this bill. And I would urge, Mr. Speaker, all of us on both sides of the aisle to deal with an issue that really is a breadandbutter, kitchentable issue 
all across America, that, again, at this special time when students are graduating, we can do a really positive thing to help students and families all across America. 
FUTURE OF U.S. INVOLVEMENT IN AFGHANISTAN The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. JONES ) for 5 minutes. Mr. JONES. Mr. Speaker, after 16 years, $800 billion, over 2,000 Americans killed, and 20,000 Americans severely wounded in Afghanistan, it is time that the House of Representatives has a debate on our future involvement in Afghanistan. Mr. Speaker, let me remind you again: We have been there 16 years, and nothing has changed at all. H.R. 1666 is a bill introduced by JOHN GARAMENDI from California and me. All this bill does is to say that the House of Representatives, after 16 years, will have a debate on the future involvement of our country in Afghanistan. Obviously, Members of Congress can vote for this bill or against this bill. We are just saying that, after 16 years, it is time for the Congress to meet its constitutional responsibility and to have a debate on the future of America. We owe this to our military. We owe it to the taxpayers of this country. Mr. Speaker, we have 300 Members of Congress today that were not here in 2001. 2001 was the last time we had a debate on this floor of the House, a meaningful debate, on the future of Afghanistan. In fact, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, General Kulack, now retired, has been one of the biggest supporters of mine in saying that it is time for the American people to put pressure on their Member of Congress to say debate the future of Afghanistan and maybe to put pressure on our Congress to say it is time to come home from Afghanistan. I have Camp Lejeune Marine Base in the Third District of North Carolina, which I have the privilege to represent. I have talked to many, many marines who have been to Afghanistan, and, Mr. Speaker, almost every one of them will tell you: Nothing is going to change. Many of those marines I am talking about, Mr. Speaker, have been there three, four, and five times. Mr. Speaker, Afghanistan is known as the graveyard of empires. Why in the world are we continuing to spend our money, but, more importantly, our young men and women, over in a country that will never change no matter what you do? It is a tribal nation. It is a nation that will never change. That is why I hope my colleagues in Congress will join JOHNGARAMENDI and me in H.R. 1666 that only asks the Speaker of the House, PAUL RYAN, to let us have this debate on the floor of the House. After 16 years, we owe it to the military, and we owe it to the taxpayers to say that we are listening to the taxpayers and our military. Let’s debate the future of America in Afghanistan. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to ask God to please bless our men and women in uniform, to please bless the families of our men and women in uniform, to ask God in His arms to hold the families who have given a child dying for freedom in Afghanistan and Iraq. I ask God to please bless the House and wake the House up that we will debate the future of Afghanistan. And I will ask three times, God, please, God, please, God, please, bless America. f 
RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess until 2 p.m. today. Accordingly (at 12 o’clock and 9 minutes p.m.), the House stood in recess. 
b1400 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. MITCHELL ) at 2 p.m. 
PRAYER Dr. Bruce Hargrave, Bruce Hargrave Ministries and Charities, Rowlett, Texas, offered the following prayer: Almighty God, we thank You this day for the bountiful blessings You have poured out upon the peoples of the United States of America and to the men and women elected and assembled here today to serve the ‘‘We the People.’’ Grant us, O God, Your grace, knowledge, and wisdom in the affairs that we will deliberate, debate, and vote upon. May the outcome of our endeavors be for the great benefit of the American people. Help these Members as Representatives of their various congressional districts be more than an elected Representative. Help each of them to be servant leaders guiding all of us to greater heights and achievements for all the American people. I ask all of this in the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen. 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. KILDEE ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. KILDEE led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
WELCOMING DR. BRUCE HARGRAVE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. SESSIONS ) is recognized for 1 minute. There was no objection. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank the gentleman who has just given our invocation, Dr. Bruce Hargrave. As a faith leader, a city council member in Rowlett, Texas, and a trusted member of his community, he has dedicated his life to helping others. He has served in the Baptist and United Methodist churches for more than 40 years and continues to help those not only in need in his community, but those who seek him out and who he seeks through spiritual and emotional guidance. As a civil servant, Bruce has played an integral role in his community. He is a member of the Rowlett Chamber of Commerce and the Rowlett Rotary Club, where he is a Paul Harris Fellow. In the wake of the devastating tornados that hit north Texas over a year ago on December 26, Bruce decided that he wanted to do more than just help but rather to rebuild the city that he called home. So he ran for the city council and was elected to serve in May. It truly is a distinct honor not only to have a wellrespected person from Rowlett, Texas, in the 32nd Congressional District with us today, but it highlights how important it is that each of the Members of Congress who are so proud of those that we represent come to our great Nation, our Nation’s Capital, and not only give us best wishes but pray for our success. I would like to thank the Honorable Dr. Bruce Hargrave for his service to not only Rowlett, Texas, to his country, but also to our Lord. And I thank him very much. God bless Texas, and God bless America. 
RECOGNIZING NATIONAL POLICE WEEK (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, this week is National Police Week, a time each year when we honor the service and sacrifice of our Nation’s heroes in blue. At this particular time, I especially cherish the memory of Officer Greg Alia, a veteran of the Forest Acres Police Department. He was a hardworking, humble man, an Eagle Scout, a graduate of Richland Northeast High School and the University of South Carolina. 
Greg’s end of watch was September 30, 2015, when he was shot while pursuing a suspect. He is survived by his wife, Kassy; parents, Richard and Alexis; and his young son, Sal. Kassy continues to promote Greg’s legacy of service through the Heroes in Blue, an organization dedicated to sharing the caring and courageous stories of police officers across the Nation. As we mark National Police Week, I am grateful to have officers who risk their lives every day to protect our families. In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. Congratulations to the newly crowned Miss USA, Kara McCullough, a South Carolina State University graduate who represented the District of Columbia. Also, congratulations to Miss South Carolina USA, Megan Gordon, of North Augusta, who placed in the top five. 
SERIOUS QUESTIONS ABOUT PRESIDENT’S CARELESSNESS AND LACK OF JUDGMENT (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, in revealing classified information to the Russians, President Trump has compromised our ability to defend ourselves against ISIS to gather intelligence against them, and he has jeopardized our relationships with allies across the globe. Make no mistake about it, the President’s actions were reckless. They are indefensible, and they make America less safe. Republicans cannot stay silent. There are serious questions about the President’s carelessness, about his lack of judgment. In fact, last July, the Speaker said that individuals who are extremely careless with classified information should be denied further access to it. Even the President’s own Chief of Staff said those who mishandle classified information have had their security clearances revoked. They have lost their jobs. They have faced fines. Some have gone to prison. I have to ask my colleagues, shouldn’t the President of the United States be held to that same standard? They say he can do what he wants, but does that make it smart? No. Does that make it right? No. Does it make it less safe? Absolutely. 
JUDGES THREATEN OUR DEMOCRACY (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, in their coverage of the President, the liberal media have given up being objective, and their credibility is now at an alltime low. Are the courts next? When considering the President’s written immigration orders, some judges are basing their decisions not on the actual text but on what was said during the heat of the campaign. This is a dangerous development, dangerous to our judicial system and dangerous to our democracy. The judiciary’s role is to interpret the law and decide whether it is constitutional. When judges decide to become politicians, injecting their own political bias into a decision, our Constitution and our government are at risk. If the media and the judiciary cease being objective, we should fear for the future of our country. f 
RECOGNIZING NATIONAL POLICE WEEK (Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, this week recognizes National Police Week. I would like to especially highlight the small but significant things officers do for our communities. Police officers in Clearwater, Florida, surprised a 10yearold robbery victim with lunch after his lunch money was stolen as he walked to school. Hillsborough County sheriffs will drive homeless men and women to the Social Security office and help them with paperwork. These are extraordinary individuals, Mr. Speaker. There are countless examples of local law enforcement doing good every day. This week we commemorate the fallen officers. Florida lost 11 officers in the past year, including Deputy Sheriff John Robert Kotfila from Hillsborough County who was killed after a collision with a wrongway driver. We also remember the Tarpon Springs officer, Officer Charles Kondek, who was fatally shot by a fugitive while on duty in 2014. Thank you to our law enforcement officers in Florida and nationwide who keep us safe.

MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT A message in writing from the President of the United States was communicated to the House by Ms. Mariel Ridgway, one of his secretaries. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 510) to establish a system for integration of Rapid DNA instruments for use by law enforcement to reduce violent crime and reduce the current DNA analysis backlog. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 510 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Rapid DNA Act of 2017’’. 
(a) S TANDARDS .—Section 210303(a) of the DNA Identification Act of 1994 (42 U.S.C. 14131(a)) is amended by adding at the end the following: ‘‘(5)(A) In addition to issuing standards as provided in paragraphs (1) through (4), the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation shall issue standards and procedures for the use of Rapid DNA instruments and resulting DNA analyses. ‘‘(B) In this Act, the term ‘Rapid DNA instruments’ means instrumentation that carries out a fully automated process to derive a DNA analysis from a DNA sample.’’. (b) INDEX .—Paragraph (2) of section 210304(b) of the DNA Identification Act of 1994 (42 U.S.C. 14132(b)(2)) is amended to read as follows: ‘‘(2) prepared by— ‘‘(A) laboratories that— ‘‘(i) have been accredited by a nonprofit professional association of persons actively involved in forensic science that is nationally recognized within the forensic science community; and ‘‘(ii) undergo external audits, not less than once every 2 years, that demonstrate compliance with standards established by the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation; or ‘‘(B) criminal justice agencies using Rapid DNA instruments approved by the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in compliance with the standards and procedures issued by the Director under section 210303(a)(5); and’’. 
SEC. 3. CONFORMING AMENDMENTS RELATING TO COLLECTION OF DNA IDENTIFICATION INFORMATION. 
(a) F ROM CERTAIN FEDERAL OFFENDERS .— Section 3 of the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000 (42 U.S.C. 14135a) is amended— (1) in subsection (b), by adding at the end the following: ‘‘The Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation may waive the requirements under this subsection if DNA samples are analyzed by means of Rapid DNA instruments and the results are included in CODIS.’’; and (2) in subsection (c), by adding at the end the following: ‘‘(3) The term ‘Rapid DNA instruments’ means instrumentation that carries out a fully automated process to derive a DNA analysis from a DNA sample.’’. (b) FROM CERTAIN DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA  OFFENDERS .—Section 4 of the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000 (42 U.S.C. 14135b) is amended— (1) in subsection (b), by adding at the end the following: ‘‘The Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation may waive the requirements under this subsection if DNA samples are analyzed by means of Rapid DNA instruments and the results are included in CODIS.’’; and (2) in subsection (c), by adding at the end the following: ‘‘(3) The term ‘Rapid DNA instruments’ means instrumentation that carries out a fully automated process to derive a DNA analysis from a DNA sample.’’. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOODLATTE ) and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia. 
Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous materials on H.R. 510, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Virginia? There was no objection. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. The House of Representatives works on many important issues, but few are more important than making sure that innocent arrestees are promptly released and that culpable suspects are not released to strike again. Rapid DNA technology has the potential to do both of those things and, as such, can be an important tool for law enforcement and a key component of this body’s ongoing efforts on criminal justice reform. I applaud the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. SENSENBRENNER ) for reintroducing H.R. 510, the Rapid DNA Act of 2017, in this session of Congress. With Rapid DNA technology, it is possible to test the DNA of arrestees as soon as they are in custody and determine within hours whether they match the DNA profile from a crime scene or from other earlier crimes. This technology would also enable police to check the Federal DNA database to see if an arrestee matches the DNA profile from previous crimes for which a DNA sample exists but no known suspect has been identified. Rather than waiting weeks for a DNA sample to be processed and risk releasing a suspect back into the public to potentially reoffend, creating new victims, police will be able to determine at initial booking if the suspect is a person of interest in other crimes. This bill will provide important tools for law enforcement. For instance, it will inform decisions about pretrial release or detention and their conditions. It will solve and prevent all crimes, including violent crimes. By freeing up forensic analysts, it will prevent DNA analysis backlogs. I believe this is necessary, responsible legislation that will aid law enforcement and protect American citizens by keeping offenders off the streets. I again thank Congressman SENSENBRENNER for sponsoring this important legislation, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in strong support of H.R. 510, the Rapid DNA Act of 2017. I also want to salute Mr. SENSENBRENNER for his hard work on it. This bipartisan legislation would integrate Rapid DNA technology into the FBI’s Combined DNA Index System, popularly known as CODIS, to enable law enforcement to perform valuable investigative functions faster and more efficiently. DNA technology is a valuable, dynamic, and rapidly unfolding element of our criminal justice system. DNA technology helps us to identify suspects, eliminate false suspects, exonerate the innocent, and ultimately to convict responsible perpetrators of crime. My State of Maryland is home to the first capital prisoner in the United States who was exonerated while in prison for a homicide with DNA technology. CODIS and the National DNA Index System play a critical role across the country in criminal investigations by Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies. Rapid DNA involves a fully automated, handsfree process designed to produce a DNA profile within minutes at the booking stage outside of a crime lab. Existing law does not provide for the inclusion of Rapid DNA analyses into CODIS. H.R. 510 would bridge the gap between Rapid DNA technology and CODIS by authorizing law enforcement to conduct Rapid DNA analyses and upload the results to the national index, as long as the Rapid DNA machines that are used are accredited. This adds a realtime layer to CODIS and saves us all significant time and resources, improving efficiency in the criminal justice process. H.R. 510 has significant practical and positive consequences for law enforcement and for public safety. For example, Detroit, as of this April, has tested approximately 10,000 backlogged sexual assault kits. As a result, there have been more than 2,600 DNA matches, including CODIS hits; the identification of nearly 800 potential serial rapists; 92 convictions obtained by the Wayne County Prosecutor’s Office; and DNA crimes linked to 40 other States and the District of Columbia. The addition of Rapid DNA information to the CODIS database will help identify serial rapists if matches are made to the lab analyses of the sexual assault kit samples. I hope that the use of Rapid DNA will allow other DNA labs to focus more of their resources on reducing the backlog 
of untested sexual assault kits across the country. My home State of Maryland has 3,700 untested rape kits right now, according to a report done last year. Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to join the chairman and those of us in the minority in supporting this important legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. SENSENBRENNER ), the former chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and the chief author of this legislation. Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOODLATTE ) for yielding me this time. Rapid DNA is a promising new technology that allows for the almost immediate DNA analysis of an arrestee. Unlike standard DNA practices, which require sending DNA samples from arrestees out to labs with a result taking weeks to ascertain, Rapid DNA results take only a few hours and can be done right at the booking station. Like fingerprinting, photographing, and other booking procedures which at the time were novel but now have become routine, Rapid DNA will soon be standard procedure in police stations throughout the country. There is only one problem with Rapid DNA technology: Federal law. Our law, written in 1994 when DNA technology was still in its infancy, prohibits the use of Rapid DNA technology in booking stations. This is not because of any limitation in Rapid DNA technology, but simply because at that time Rapid DNA technology was not even contemplated. Similar to the transformation of musical devices—records leading to cassette tapes, cassette tapes leading to CDs, CDs leading to MP3, and now iPods and online music hosting services—technology moves quicker than we can legislate. Now is the time to change the law to permit Rapid DNA technology. Rapid DNA machines are compact, approximately the size of copy machines, and can provide a DNA analysis from a cheek swab sample of an arrestee within 2 hours. This has two profound implications. First, arrestees may be exonerated of crimes in 2 hours rather than waiting for up to 72 hours for release, or months for more standard DNA testing. Second, those arrested for a crime can quickly be matched to other unsolved crimes where there was forensic evidence left at the crime scene but for which there was no identified suspect. The Rapid DNA Act updates the current law to allow DNA samples to be processed using Rapid DNA instruments located in booking stations and other approved locations. The bill will require the FBI to issue standards and procedures for the use of such instruments and their resulting DNA analyses to ensure the integrity of such instruments and the accuracy of the results. It will permit those results to be included in the DNA index if criminal justice agencies taking the samples comply with the standards and procedures that the FBI approves. In this way, the bill would permit this new category of DNA samples to be uploaded into the index with the same protections and quality standards as current DNA samples. Not only does Rapid DNA have the potential to reduce crime, help expeditiously exonerate the innocent, but also to positively impact the current backlogs for rape kits and other DNA sample analysis. This committee has spent a great deal of time and significant work to try to reduce the forensic DNA backlog, especially in rape kits. Rapid DNA could not at this time be used for rape kits, but the implementation of Rapid DNA will allow forensic labs to focus on forensic samples, not on identification samples which can easily be handled by Rapid DNA machines. I hope this will reduce the rape kit backlog, which will also prevent future rapes from happening. I am pleased that the House is taking a significant step in furthering the use of this technology. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. COHEN ). Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. RASKIN for his kind words and his work on this. I particularly thank Mr. SENSENBRENNER for his work. He has been the sponsor of this since it was introduced. I was an original sponsor since it was introduced as well. It makes a lot of sense for us to do this and get DNA evidence and use science to the advantage of the American people, and particularly in law enforcement where we have problems in identifying suspects and proving guilt on occasion, and also exonerating the innocent. DNA is a perfect tool as it exonerates the wrongfully accused and gets the person who has committed the crime. I am honored to be a part of this. This bill, while a small part in the big picture, shows that Democrats and Republicans can work together to get some things done. I appreciate the honor to be able to sponsor, and I appreciate Mr. SENSENBRENNER ’s work. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I don’t have any additional speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time to close. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. The Rapid DNA Act is strongly supported by several organizations which know that the expanded use and availability of Rapid DNA will enhance public safety by reducing the DNA backlog, reducing violent crime, and allowing law enforcement to investigate crimes and identify suspects with greater efficiency and accuracy. The organizations include the National Center for Victims of Crime; the Police Foundation, which works to improve policing through innovation and science; and the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association. b1615 Mr. Speaker, in the case that I referred to before, the Bloodsworth case from Maryland, this was a gentleman who was convicted of a grisly rape and murder of a 9yearold girl. He swore he hadn’t done it. He was convicted. In court he swore every day that he was the wrong guy. When DNA technology was first unveiled, he read about it. He begged his lawyer who is now the chief judge on the D.C. Superior Court, Judge Morin, to get the DNA test done. That lawyer took $5,000 out of his own pocket to do the DNA test, and it came back with greater than 99 percent certainty it could not have been Bloodsworth. Then the DNA evidence provided an exact match to a prisoner who was a floor below Bloodsworth at the time. So they found the right guy, and he was about to get out of prison a few months later. The DNA evidence establishes an extraordinary new era that we are in in terms of criminal justice, and I am proud to be supporting this legislation that Mr. SENSENBRENNER has brought forward, which I think will improve accuracy and efficiency all around. I applaud his efforts and the efforts of our chairman to ensure the integrity and the quality of the analysis that will be used in the criminal justice system. I urge all of our colleagues to join me in voting for H.R. 510 today. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill. It is a bipartisan bill. I thank Members on both sides of the aisle for their contributions to this effort. I again commend the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. SENSENBRENNER ) for reintroducing this bill. I urge my colleagues to support the bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOODLATTE ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 510. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
STRENGTHENING STATE AND LOCAL CYBER CRIME FIGHTING ACT OF 2017 Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1616) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to authorize the National Computer Forensics Institute, and for other purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1616 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Strengthening State and Local Cyber Crime Fighting Act of 2017’’. 
SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION OF THE NATIONAL COMPUTER FORENSICS INSTITUTE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY.

National Computer Forensics Institute.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOODLATTE ) and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia. 
Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 1616, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Virginia? There was no objection. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the National Computer Forensics Institute serves a vital purpose in preparing State and local law enforcement to combat computer and cybercrime. Last Congress, the House passed this legislation by voice vote under suspension of the rules. I am pleased to support this legislation once again, and I am confident that this bill will once again receive bipartisan support. The United States Department of Justice has declared that cybercrime is one of the greatest threats facing our country and that it has enormous implications for our national security, economic prosperity, and public safety. We have seen this just in the past few days after cyber vulnerabilities led to widespread computer disruptions around the world. With this in mind, the National Computer Forensics Institute serves the vital purpose of providing legal and judicial professionals a free, comprehensive education on current cybercrime trends, investigative methods, and prosecutorial and judicial challenges. The National Computer Forensics Institute is a 32,000squarefoot facility located in Hoover, Alabama. The institute boasts three multipurpose classrooms, two network investigations classrooms, a mock courtroom, and a forensics lab. The special agents of the United States Secret Service staff the institute and work diligently training attendees in modern counter cybercrime procedures and evidence collection. When the attendees leave, they take with them the critical knowledge and equipment required to conduct autonomous and thorough cybercrime investigations at their home agencies. Since its creation in 2008, the institute has earned praise for its work in preparing America’s local law enforcement in how to deal with these important technology issues. Over the last 7 years, the institute has instructed law enforcement professionals from every State in the country and from over 500 different law enforcement agencies. In fact, law enforcement in my own district has benefited from NCFI training, including Lynchburg Commonwealth Attorney Mike Doucette and his staff. Each professional educated at the institute is a force multiplier for the Secret Service. The institute itself is a force multiplier for other law enforcement cyber forensic efforts, complementing vital training offered by entities like the National White Collar Crime Center, otherwise known as NW3C. After successful completion of the NCFI and the NW3C programs, the students can bring their new knowledge back to their local agency to inform their colleagues how to properly conduct computer forensic investigations. Mr. Speaker, I firmly believe that for our Nation to successfully combat the cybercrime threat, we must support legislation such as H.R. 1616. I want to thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. RATCLIFFE ), a member of the Judiciary Committee, for sponsoring this important legislation. Authorizing the existing National Computer Forensics Institute in Federal law will cement its position as a hightech cybercrime training facility and will help law enforcement professionals nationwide in their efforts to combat cyberrelated crimes. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON HOMELAND SECURITY , Washington, DC, May 15, 2017. Hon. BOBGOODLATTE , Chairman, Committee on Judiciary, Washington, DC. DEAR CHAIRMAN GOODLATTE : I write concerning H.R. 1616, the ‘‘Strengthening State and Local Cyber Crime Fighting Act of 2017’’. This legislation includes matters that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on Homeland Security. In order to expedite floor consideration of H.R. 1616, the Committee on Homeland Security agrees to forgo action on this bill. However, this is conditional on our mutual understanding that forgoing consideration of the bill would not prejudice the Committee with respect to the appointment of conferees or to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject matters contained in the bill or similar legislation that fall within the Committee on Homeland Security’s Rule X jurisdiction. I request you urge the Speaker to name members of the Committee to any conference committee named to consider such provisions. Please place a copy of this letter and your response acknowledging our jurisdictional interest into the Congressional Record during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Sincerely, MICHAEL T. M CCAUL, Chairman. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY , Washington, DC, May 15, 2017. Hon. MICHAEL T. M CCAUL, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, Washington, DC. DEAR CHAIRMAN MCCAUL: Thank you for consulting with the Committee on the Judiciary and agreeing to be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 1616, the ‘‘Strengthening State and Local Cyber Crime Fighting Act,’’ so that the bill may proceed expeditiously to the House floor. I agree that your foregoing further action on this measure does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of your committee or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives on this bill or similar legislation in the future. I would support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate number of conferees from your committee to any HouseSenate conference on this legislation. I will seek to place our letters on H.R. 1616 into the Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill. I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward to continuing to work together as this measure moves through the legislative process. Sincerely, BOBGOODLATTE , Chairman. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I, too, rise in support of H.R. 1616, the Strengthening State and Local Cyber Crime Fighting Act. This bill establishes the National Computer Forensics Institute as an official Federal program to be managed by the Department of Homeland Security and operated by the U.S. Secret Service. I strongly support it because it addresses a serious problem and advances a solution that is critically important to the safety of our people. Cybercrime poses an enormous threat to national security, economic prosperity, and public safety. The range of threats and the challenges that they present for law enforcement multiply just as rapidly as technology evolves, causing serious insecurity in the personal lives, the work lives, and the finances of our people. Over the past decade, our law enforcement community has recorded a significant increase in the quantity, quality, complexity, and danger of sophisticated cybercrimes targeting private industry, including our financial services sector and private individuals. These crimes include intrusions; hacking attacks; the surreptitious installation of malicious software; identity theft; and massive data breaches that have compromised and exposed the personal, financial, business, medical, and professional information of millions of U.S. citizens. How many of our people have suffered the disruption, indignity, and anxiety of identity theft, for example? For Americans who have been victimized by cybercrime, especially our seniors, it is a terrifying and demoralizing experience. For small businesses affected, it is costly and enormously draining. Just as cyber warfare has transformed the nature of war in this century, cybercrime has transformed the nature of crime, adversely affecting the members of our law enforcement and intelligence services. To date, the National Computer Forensics Institute has risen to the occasion, training more than 4,000 State and local law enforcement officers and 1,600 prosecutors. With this legislation, the institute will continue to educate State and local law enforcement officials, prosecutors, and judges on current trends in cyber and electronic crime investigations and best practices taken across the country. The institute will train officers on proper procedures to conduct these important investigations that are affecting more and more Americans every year. In addition, the National Computer Forensics Institute will continue to work to protect our citizens’ personal information from unwarranted governmental intrusion by establishing national standards for conducting these investigations. The institute will protect these important privacy interests along with the security of our businesses, our homes, our finances, and our personal effects. For these reasons, I proudly support H.R. 1616. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, at this time I am pleased to yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. RATCLIFFE ), the chief sponsor of the legislation. Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1616, the Strengthening State and Local Cyber Crime Fighting Act of 2017. Let me start out by thanking Chairman GOODLATTE for his support and allowing this bill to come to the floor and Senator GRASSLEY , chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Ranking Member FEINSTEIN for their support in introducing a companion measure over in the Senate. Mr. Speaker, the bicameral, bipartisan support on this issue underscores its critical importance and the need for this issue to transcend political parties and partisan politics. Mr. Speaker, this is Police Week in the United States. It is our chance to show appreciation for some of the most important unsung heroes in our Nation. I couldn’t be more grateful for the opportunity to use my time before this legislative body today to thank each and every member of this country’s brave dedicated men and women of law enforcement. From patrolling our streets to pursuing criminals of every kind, it is these men and women in blue who keep our communities safe and uphold the pillars of law and order in society each and every day. Every American should be grateful for those who run towards danger and who march into harm’s way to keep us safe. Nearly a decade ago I had the privilege of being appointed the United States Attorney under former President George W. Bush. Serving as the President’s top Federal law enforcement official gave me the chance to work shoulder to shoulder with hundreds of great police officers and police departments across the 33,000 square miles of the Eastern District of Texas. It also instilled in me an incredible sense of gratitude for those in law enforcement who wake up each and every day simply wanting to make the world around them a safer place to live for all of us. I could say it 1,000 times and it wouldn’t do justice to the service that they provide: Thank you. Thank you for all you do. We are all grateful. And while the simple truth is that we can never really repay those in law enforcement for the incredible sacrifices they make each and every day, as a lawmaker, I want to do everything within my power to give them the tools to help them keep us safe. Today this body has a unique opportunity to stand up for those who selflessly and dependably stand up for all of us. H.R. 1616, the Strengthening State and Local Cyber Crime Fighting Act of 2017, does exactly that by authorizing into law the National Computer Forensics Institute, or NCFI. As the chairman said, the NCFI is a critical national training center located in Hoover, Alabama, that is operated by the United States Secret Service for the purpose of training our State and local law enforcement officers, prosecutors, and judges on how to investigate cyber and electronic crimes, on how to conduct computer and mobile device forensics examinations, to respond to network intrusions, and to preserve the chain of custody for digital evidence. Mr. Speaker, in today’s digital world, it is rarely that drop of blood or strand of hair that solves a crime or a case. Instead, far more frequently, it is proof of a text message that was sent or an online purchase that was made or geolocation data on a mobile device. Since its creation, the NCFI has trained and equipped more than 6,000 law enforcement officials from all 50 States on how to handle digital evidence and solve and prosecute cybercrimes. By authorizing the NCFI into Federal law, Congress can ensure that the NCFI remains our Nation’s premier cybercrime training center for State and local law enforcement officials for many years to come. This isn’t some theoretical program at the NCFI. The proverbial rubber is already hitting the road. In fact, three different law enforcement agencies in my own district have had their folks trained at the NCFI, folks like Don Waddle, a 25year veteran of the Greenville Police Department in my home district. In a hearing I chaired last year about the impact of the training that Don received at NCFI, he talked about the value that not just he got as a law enforcement officer, but the community that he serves. He told me: I am not the main benefactor of this training. The citizens of 
Greenville and Hunt County and the entire northeast Texas area reap the benefits of this training with better recovery rates for stolen property, as well as more perpetrators being taken off of our streets. b1630 Don is like thousands of detectives and prosecutors and judges across the country who because of their NCFI training are better able to serve their communities and do their law enforcement jobs in an everincreasing digital world. Mr. Speaker, the need for this bill could not be more clear. Cybercrime has surpassed drug trafficking as the most profitable criminal enterprise in the world. Today, let’s vote to help fight cybercrime by passing this commonsense legislation to support our law enforcement and give our officers a leg up on the criminals who are increasingly using digital means in cyberspace to evade justice. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 1616. I once again thank Chairman GOODLATTE and my Senate colleagues for their support. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN ). Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding me time. Just to close, I want to echo Congressman RATCLIFFE in observing it is National Police Week, so we have the opportunity to highlight the successful efforts that have already taken place to combat cybercrime. As the operator of the National Computer Forensics Institute, the Secret Service has demonstrated its excellence and diligence in pursuing cybercrime both domestically and internationally. Its investigations have produced more than 4,000 arrests, involving more than a billion dollars in fraud, and saving the public billions of dollars more in potential fraud that would have taken place absent their intervention. H.R. 1616 will strengthen these efforts in continuing to combat cyber and electronic crime. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. PALMER ). Mr. PALMER. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman RATCLIFFE and the committee for their work on this bill. The internet is an everincreasing medium for criminals to carry out crimes, such as sex trafficking, credit card theft, and identity theft. We are currently witnessing an unprecedented global cyber attack. Attacks such as this threaten our economy and our national security. This highlights the need for law enforcement to be trained at local, State, and national levels to recognize and combat this activity. Prior to 2008, training for State and local law enforcement and cybercrimes was difficult to find. Recognizing this problem in 2007, the State of Alabama offered the Secret Service and the Department of Homeland Security property and funds to construct a stateof theart facility if the Federal Government would fund the training and allow the Secret Service to operate it. I am proud to say this facility is located in my district in the city of Hoover. The National Computer Forensics Institute, NCFI, opened its doors in May of 2008. State and local law enforcement officers come from all across the Nation to be trained at this oneofa kind facility, where they are trained by Secret Service agents on the same equipment and same software that our Secret Service agents use. NCFI has trained law enforcement officers, prosecutors, and judges from all 50 States, and its graduates represent over 500 agencies. They are not only trained in solving crimes but also in prosecution. I am pleased that the work that NCFI does is being recognized, and I am proud to be an original cosponsor of H.R. 1616. I urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this good legislation. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOODLATTE ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1616, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
HONORING HOMETOWN HEROES ACT Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1892) to amend title 4, United States Code, to provide for the flying of the flag at halfstaff in the event of the death of a first responder in the line of duty. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1892 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Honoring Hometown Heroes Act’’. 
SEC. 2. PERMITTING THE FLAG TO BE FLOWN AT HALFSTAFF IN THE EVENT OF THE DEATH OF A FIRST RESPONDER SERVING IN THE LINE OF DUTY. 
(a) A MENDMENT .—The sixth sentence of section 7(m) of title 4, United States Code, is amended— (1) by striking ‘‘or’’ after ‘‘possession of the United States’’ and inserting a comma; (2) by inserting ‘‘or the death of a first responder working in any State, territory, or possession who dies while serving in the line of duty,’’ after ‘‘while serving on active duty,’’; (3) by striking ‘‘and’’ after ‘‘former officials of the District of Columbia’’ and inserting a comma; and (4) by inserting before the period the following: ‘‘, and first responders working in the District of Columbia’’. (b) FIRST RESPONDER DEFINED .—Such subsection is further amended— (1) in paragraph (2), by striking ‘‘, United States Code; and’’ and inserting a semicolon; (2) in paragraph (3), by striking the period at the end and inserting ‘‘; and’’; and (3) by adding at the end the following new paragraph: ‘‘(4) the term ‘first responder’ means a ‘public safety officer’ as defined in section 1204 of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3796b).’’. (c) EFFECTIVE DATE.—The amendments made by this Act shall apply with respect to deaths of first responders occurring on or after the date of the enactment of this Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOODLATTE ) and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia. 
Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 1892, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Virginia? There was no objection. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. On June 14, 1777, the Second Continental Congress passed a resolution establishing an official flag for the new American Nation. The resolution, now known as the Flag Act of 1777, stated that the flag would be ‘‘thirteen stripes, alternate red and white; that the union be thirteen stars, white in a blue field, representing a new Constellation.’’ For the last 240 years, the American people have celebrated Flag Day every June 14, and, over that time, the flag has evolved. As we all know, changes have been made to its design, shape, and arrangement. The Flag Act of 1794 changed the design from 13 to 15 stars to accommodate the admission of Vermont and Kentucky into the Union. The Flag Act of 1818 mandated that the 13 stripes represented the Thirteen Original Colonies, the number of stars matched the number of States, and provided that subsequent changes in the number of stars would be made on the 4th of July. What has remained rock solid over that quarter millennium, however, is what our flag represents. It represents one nation, freedom, and justice for all, and the sacrifices made in pursuit of those core American values. 
Current law provides guidance for displaying and handling the flag so it is afforded the respect it deserves and has earned. In abiding by these guidelines, we all commemorate the value and love we hold for what our flag represents. That is why the legislation before us today, H.R. 1892, the Honoring Hometown Heroes Act, is not only appropriate but necessary. This bill amends Federal law to permit State and Territorial Governors and the Mayor of Washington, D.C., to order that the flag be flown at halfstaff in the event that a public safety officer dies in the line of duty. For purposes of this legislation, ‘‘public safety officers’’ include local police officers, firefighters, and EMS professionals. These are individuals who make great sacrifices so we all can live in a free country. These men and women work long hours, separated from their loved ones, and consistently place themselves in harm’s way so we as Americans can enjoy our freedom and our way of life. These sacrifices often go unappreciated. When an officer dies in the line of duty, he or she is making the ultimate sacrifice for their community, their family, and for their country. H.R. 1892 allows the American people to show their appreciation to these men and women, who are truly the bulwark between order and chaos. They represent the values the Founders held so dear nearly 250 years ago, and their sacrifices must be publicly acknowledged so they are not taken for granted. I thank the lead sponsor of this bill, Congressman JOHNLARSON . On May 3, the House Committee on the Judiciary approved the Honoring Hometown Heroes Act with unanimous, bipartisan support. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and the other bills before the House today to honor the men and women who have made the ultimate sacrifice to ensure the safety of our Nation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise also in support of H.R. 1892, the Honoring Hometown Heroes Act. I want to begin by saluting the distinguished author of this legislation, the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. LARSON), who has navigated the twists and turns of the legislative process to bring this legislation to the floor with the Committee on the Judiciary. H.R. 1892 would bestow one of the highest honors that can be given in America to our first responders who have died in the line of duty by allowing the U.S. flag to be lowered in their respective jurisdictions. The bill amends the U.S. Flag Code to allow the Governor of a State, Territory or possession, and the Mayor of the District of Columbia to order the flag be lowered to halfstaff if a first responder in the jurisdiction dies while serving in the line of duty. Our first responders put their lives on the line every day for the greater good of the people that they have taken an oath to serve and protect. Every year, some first responders make the ultimate sacrifice and lose their lives while serving and protecting their communities in the line of duty. Currently, under the U.S. Flag Code, a Governor or the Mayor of the District of Columbia can order that the flag be lowered to halfstaff after the death of a President or former government official or after the death of a member of the Armed Forces from the jurisdiction. It is only fitting that, given the hard work and sacrifices and crucial role of first responders, we honor these brave men and women in the same way that we honor government officials and members of the Armed Forces when they make the ultimate sacrifice. Accordingly, I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 1892. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. LARSON). Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished Member from Maryland and our distinguished chairman from Virginia for taking up this legislation. Let me start by thanking so many cosponsors, starting with PETER KING and BILLPASCRELL , the cochairs of our Congressional Fire Services Caucus, for their extraordinary work; the sheriff, as I like to refer to DAVID REICHERT , who I serve with on the Committee on Ways and Means; and TIMWALZ, the chairman of the Congressional Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Caucus and ranking member of the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs. Amongst the Members who are cosponsors of the bill, many are former first responders as well: DUTCH RUPPERSBERGER , former police officer; JOHN RUTHERFORD , former sheriff of Duval County, Florida; BRIAN FITZPATRICK , former FBI special agent; JIMRENACCI , former volunteer firefighter from Ohio. Special thanks to the Committee on the Judiciary for recognizing, however simple a solution, how powerful the meaning for those who have lost a member of their community and their family who, as Lincoln would say, have given the full measure of their devotion. I thank Chairman GOODLATTE and Ranking Member CONYERS , S TEVE  KING, and S TEVE COHEN also for their work on this. I deeply appreciate it. I especially thank and single out Jim McLoughlin, a veteran firefighter from Connecticut. He is the founder of the National Honor Guard Commanders Association, and it was he who first came to me with endorsing this concept. I also thank the strong support of Harold Schaitberger of the International Association of Firefighters, the Fraternal Order of Police, Sergeants Benevolent Association, International Association of Fire Chiefs, and the National Volunteer Fire Council, among others. As has been said on the floor already today, a number of people have mentioned that this week we come together during National Police Week to recognize first responders. In fact, the White House was lit in blue last night. It is those who put their lives on the line every day to protect us and our communities, as the chairman noted, who often get forgotten in terms of their line of duty. I am the son of a proud firefighter. I think in every firefighter’s memory and every memory of the Nation will be permanently seared that vision of firefighters rushing up the steps of the World Trade Center as people were coming down. b1645 Whether it is a national emergency or a medical emergency, these brave men and women are the first to answer the call, and they deserve our respect. Scripture tells us to love our neighbors as we love ourselves, but only a few are willing to step into harm’s way for others. When everyone else flees from danger, our law enforcement officers, firefighters, and EMTs heroically place their lives in jeopardy to help people that they have never met. These jobs are inherently dangerous. The reminders are too common. And as any family of a first responder can tell you, they oftentimes do not return home to their families. JOECROWLEY  has spoken eloquently of that on this very floor. This bill has been reviewed by the chairman, and I thank Mr. RASKIN for his comments as well. But I think we can all agree that these courageous men and women deserve what is a simple tribute but a very powerful message when the American flag and all that it stands for is lowered to halfstaff when they have given the full measure of their devotion to their community, their State, and this Nation. Mr. Speaker, I urge its passage and am thankful for the bipartisan support that we have received on this very important week for these incredibly remarkable and important people who serve their country. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I encourage all of my colleagues to support this wonderful legislation, and I take the occasion of National Police Week to restate everyone in this body’s appreciation for the hard work that our responders and our officers do. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOODLATTE ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1892. The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
AMERICAN LAW ENFORCEMENT HEROES ACT OF 2017 Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1428) to amend the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to authorize COPS grantees to use grant funds to hire veterans as career law enforcement officers, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1428 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘American Law Enforcement Heroes Act of 2017’’. 
Section 1701(b)(2) of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3796dd(b)(2)) is amended by inserting ‘‘, including by prioritizing the hiring and training of veterans (as defined in section 101 of title 38, United States Code)’’ after ‘‘Nation’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOODLATTE ) and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia. 
Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 1428, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Virginia? There was no objection. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Police officers and military veterans have much in common: Both wear uniforms, both protect and serve, and both face great physical risk in executing their duties. It is understandable, then, that many military servicemen and women seek employment as police officers upon returning to civilian life. Similarly, police departments are seeking men and women who are physically and mentally fit to assume these roles, who are used to working in teams, and who have experience making quick decisions under stress. To a police department, a military veteran may be a perfect fit. In recent years, we have strived for communityoriented approaches to policing. A communityoriented approach requires officers not just to enforce laws, but to wear many other hats, like first aid provider, social worker, counselor, crisis manager, and peacemaker. If there is a problem, we expect the police to solve it. The knowledge, skill, and abilities military veterans bring to police departments enhance the departments’ problemsolving mission. H.R. 1428, the American Law Enforcement Heroes Act of 2017, is good legislation introduced by our colleague, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. HURD). The bill authorizes grantees who receive grants under the Community Oriented Policing Services program at the Department of Justice, commonly known as COPS, to use them for prioritizing the hiring and training of military veterans. When military veterans return from deployment and enter civilian life, it is important we recognize their sacrifices by assuring they can obtain employment and support their families. This bill helps to ensure veterans can do just that. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. HURD for introducing this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in support of H.R. 1428, the American Law Enforcement Heroes Act of 2017. I want to thank the author of the bill, Mr. HURD, for bringing it forward. This measure has the laudable goal of recognizing our brave men and women who have served in the armed services, but it also helps to protect our communities through communityoriented policing. I support H.R. 1428 for several reasons. To begin with, the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, also known as the COPS Office, is responsible for advancing community policing by law enforcement agencies through information and grant resources. The COPS Office promotes community policing with a commitment to building trust and mutual respect between police and the people in the communities they serve by awarding grants to law enforcement agencies for the hiring of law enforcement officers for community policing. Through the COPS Hiring Program, funds are provided directly to law enforcement agencies to hire or rehire career law enforcement officers to increase their community policing capacity and crime prevention activities. To date, more than 129,000 officers for over 13,000 agencies have been funded via the COPS Hiring Program, which was first established 23 years ago under President Bill Clinton in 1994. The COPS Office began supporting military veterans through the COPS Hiring Program and currently gives additional consideration to law enforcement agencies that commit to hiring our veterans. Although we have not had hearings to discuss the import of providing incentives through this program for the hiring of veterans as new law enforcement officers by State and local law enforcement, we believe the bill is well designed and well intentioned. The bill prioritizes grant applications of law enforcement agencies that will use grant funds from the COPS Office to hire veterans, thereby giving preference to those agencies when applying for grant funds. The intent is to assist law enforcement agencies in attracting wellqualified, serviceoriented people who have already served America through their military service. Another positive purpose of this legislation is to provide our brave veterans the opportunity to continue to serve their country and respective communities upon completion of their military service. Military service provides vital leadership traits that can be valuable in assisting military veterans in their effort to succeed in law enforcement careers, and we need to take advantage of that. Veterans with combat experience have obtained skill sets that relate to law enforcement work, such as discipline, loyalty, ethical standards, and integrity; physical fitness; firearms and tactical skills; the ability to respond appropriately under stress; and experience working with diverse populations. Those who have served in the military often have a desire to continue to serve others, and a career as a law enforcement officer allows veterans to continue serving others through community policing, where we need them so much. A career in law enforcement also provides veterans with longterm stability, gives a sense of accomplishment and pride, and offers a career where their dedication to protecting and serving the public can be applied. Finally, measures such as H.R. 1428 will help ensure our communities are protected through communityoriented policing. Accordingly, we support passage of H.R. 1428, the American Law Enforcement Heroes Act. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. HURD), the chief author of this legislation. Mr. HURD. Mr. Speaker, the veteran unemployment rate is currently 5 percent in Texas, higher than the national average of 3.7. While the national average has steadily declined in recent years, the unemployment rate for young veterans ages 18 to 24 has skyrocketed to 13 percent, more than double the rate it was at this time last year. We need to do more for the men and women who have sacrificed so much for our freedom and our safety. That is why I introduced the American Law 
Enforcement Heroes Act: to provide an outlet for these heroes to continue their service right here at home. My district is home to more than 4,600 Active Duty and 45,000 military veterans who have served or supported Joint Base San Antonio, Laughlin Air Force Base, and Fort Bliss, among others. They often tell me about their struggles to find good jobs once they leave the military. This bill incentivizes State and local governments to hire veterans as new law enforcement officers by giving preference when applying for grants through DOJ’s COPS Office which fund academy and field training along with promoting community collaboration. It is modeled after an expired program called Troops to COPS, which helped about 1,000 veterans in the late 1990s. We owe our freedom to these men and women and must do a better job facilitating their transition into meaningful civilian careers. Ultimately, we should be doing everything we can to help those who have served our Nation in one uniform continue to do so in another one right here at home. In commemoration of both National Police Week and Military Appreciation Month, this bill will better serve our veterans and be a win for communities nationwide. I want to thank Senator JOHN CORNYN, my colleague from Texas, for his leadership on this issue, and I ask my colleagues to join me in support of H.R. 1428. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I close by restating my support for this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I again commend the gentleman from Texas (Mr. HURD) for his thoughtful legislation and his outstanding leadership on this issue. This is good legislation that will help young military men and women find employment in law enforcement where they can provide great continued service to our country. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOODLATTE ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1428. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO THE STABILIZATION OF IRAQ— MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (H. DOC. NO. 115–42) The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following message from the President of the United States; which was read and, together with the accompanying papers, referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs and ordered to be printed: To the Congress of the United States: Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent to the Federal Register for publication the enclosed notice stating that the national emergency with respect to the stabilization of Iraq that was declared in Executive Order 13303 of May 22, 2003, is to continue in effect beyond May 22, 2017. Obstacles to the orderly reconstruction of Iraq, the restoration and maintenance of peace and security in the country, and the development of political, administrative, and economic institutions in Iraq continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Accordingly, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency with respect to the stabilization of Iraq. DONALD J. T RUMP .THEWHITE HOUSE , May 16, 2017.

NOTICE OF INTENTION TO OFFER RESOLUTION RAISING A QUESTION OF THE PRIVILEGES OF THE HOUSE Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause (2)(a)(1) of rule IX, I rise to give notice of my intent to raise a question of the privileges of the House. The form of the resolution is as follows: Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the President shall immediately disclose his tax return information to Congress and the American people; Whereas, in the United States’ system of checks and balances, Congress has a responsibility to hold the executive branch of government to the highest standard of transparency to ensure the public interest is placed first; Whereas, according to the Tax History Project, every President since Gerald Ford has disclosed their tax return information to the public; Whereas, tax returns provide an important baseline disclosure because they contain highly instructive information, including whether the candidate paid taxes, number one; what they own, number two; what they have borrowed and from whom, number three; whether they have made any charitable donations, number four; and whether they have taken advantage of tax loopholes, number five. Whereas, disclosure of the President’s tax returns could help those investigating Russian influence in the 2016 election understand the President’s financial ties to the Russian Federation and Russian citizens, including debts owed and whether he shares any partnership interests, equity interests, joint ventures, or licensing agreements with Russia or Russians; Whereas, the President fired FBI Director James Comey last week, whose FBI was investigating whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 election; Whereas, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who made the recommendation to fire Director Comey, during sworn testimony—the Interior Ryan Zinke to review national monuments that Presidents have designated or expanded since 1996; Whereas, this review was praised by industry groups who could benefit financially from oil, gas, mining, and condemned by environmental organizations concerned this review will scrap or scale back critical Federal designation to protect tribal and historic lands; Whereas, the American people are in the dark to knowing if this review was started to justify selling or leasing public lands to private corporations that could enrich the President or his business partners without reviewing the President’s tax returns; Whereas, it has been reported that Federal prosecutors have issued grand jury subpoenas to associates of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn seeking business records as part of the ongoing probe into Russian involvement in the 2016 election; Whereas, according to his 2016 candidate filing with the Federal Election Commission, the President has 564 financial positions in companies located not only in the United States but around the world; Whereas, against the advice of ethics attorneys and the Office of Government Ethics, the President has refused to divest his ownership stake in his businesses and can still withdraw funds at any time from the trust of which he is sole beneficiary; Whereas, the Emoluments Clause was included in the United States Constitution for the express purpose of preventing Federal officials from accepting any—from the Constitution, article I, section 9—‘‘present Emolument, Office, or Title . . . from any King, Prince, or foreign state’’; Whereas, the most signed petition on the White House website calls for the release of the President’s tax return information to verify compliance. The legislative branch has the responsibility and the authority to check the executive branch in section 6103 of the Tax Code—in 1924 allows for an examination of his tax returns, the authority put in place specifically so Congress could examine the conflicts of interest in the executive branch of government following the biggest scandal of the 20th century, the Teapot Dome scandal. b1900 Nothing could be more of a threat to the integrity of the House than ignoring our duty to fully examine the personal financial entanglements this President may have with Russian entities and individuals and whether he has abused the tax laws of the United States of America. We have nothing but evidence to justify such an examination. If and when such conflicts are revealed, I do not want to say to our constituents that we had the power to review these conflicts, but we did nothing. I, for one, do not want my integrity, or the integrity of my colleagues on either side of the aisle in this body, to be demeaned by such a shameful failure. To restore the dignity of the House, we must use our authority to request 
President Trump’s tax returns and give the American people the transparency they deserve. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to dispense with the oral announcement of the resolution in order that the entire text appears in the RECORD . The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. TAYLOR ). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New Jersey? There was no objection. The form of the resolution is as follows: 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the President shall immediately disclose his tax return information to Congress and the American people. Whereas, in the United States’ system of checks and balances, Congress has a responsibility to hold the Executive Branch of government to the highest standard of transparency to ensure the public interest is placed first; Whereas, according to the Tax History Project, every President since Gerald Ford has disclosed their tax return information to the public; Whereas, tax returns provide an important baseline disclosure because they contain highly instructive information including whether the candidate paid taxes, what they own, what they have borrowed and from whom, whether they have made any charitable donations, and whether they have taken advantage of tax loopholes; Whereas, disclosure of the President’s tax returns could help those investigating Russian influence in the 2016 election understand the President’s financial ties to the Russian Federation and Russian citizens, including debts owed and whether he shares any partnership interests, equity interests, joint ventures or licensing agreements with Russia or Russians; Whereas, the President fired FBI Director James Comey last week, whose FBI was investigating whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 election Whereas, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who made the recommendation to fire Director Comey, during sworn testimony neglected to mention his contacts with the Russian ambassador and recused himself from anything involving the Russian investigation; Whereas, Senate Russia investigators have requested information from the Treasury Department’s criminal investigation division, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, which handles cases of money laundering, for information related to President Trump, his top officials and campaign aides. FinCEN has been investigating allegations of foreign moneylaundering through purchases of U.S. real estate; Whereas, the President’s tax returns would show us whether he has foreign bank accounts and how much profit he receives from his ownership in myriad partnerships; Whereas, the President hired a law firm to send a letter to Senator Lindsey Graham to fight suggestions he has Russian business ties; this letter left open the question whether Mr. Trump or his firms received Russian income or loans or derived income from Russianlinked partnerships. Whereas, Donald Trump Jr. said the Trump Organization saw money ‘‘pouring in from Russia’’ and that ‘‘Russians make up a pretty disproportionate crosssection of a lot of our assets.’’ Whereas, the White House will not confirm whether the President has filed a 2016 tax return; Whereas, Congress gave itself the authority to review an individual’s tax returns to investigate and reveal possible conflicts of interest of executive branch officials involved in the Teapot Dome scandal. Whereas, President Donald Trump’s executive order on the Review of designations under the Antiquities Act has directed the U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke to review national monuments that presidents have designated or expanded since 1996. Whereas, this review was praised by industry groups who could benefit financially from oil, gas and mining and condemned by environmental organizations concerned this review will scrap or scale back critical federal designation to protect tribal and historic lands. Whereas, the American people are in the dark to knowing if this review was started to justify selling or leasing public lands to private corporations that could enrich the President or his business partners without reviewing the President’s tax returns. Whereas, it has been reported that federal prosecutors have issued grand jury subpoenas to associates of former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn seeking business records as part of the ongoing probe into Russian involvement in the 2016 election; Whereas, according to his 2016 candidate filing with the Federal Election Commission, the President has 564 financial positions in companies located in the United States and around the world; Whereas, against the advice of ethics attorneys and the Office of Government Ethics, the President has refused to divest his ownership stake in his businesses; and can still withdraw funds at any time from the trust of which he is the sole beneficiary; Whereas, the Emoluments Clause was included in the U.S. Constitution for the express purpose of preventing federal officials from accepting any ‘‘present, Emolument, Office, or Title . . . from any King, Prince, or foreign state’’; Whereas, the most signed petition on the White House website calls for the release of the President’s tax return information to verify compliance with the Emoluments Clause, with 1 million, 94 thousand signatures as of date of this resolution; Whereas, the Chairmen of the Ways and Means Committee, Joint Committee on Taxation, and Senate Finance Committee have the authority to request the President’s tax returns under Section 6103 of the tax code; Whereas, the Joint Committee on Taxation reviewed the tax returns of President Richard Nixon in 1974 and made the information public; Whereas, the Ways and Means Committee used IRC 6103 authority in 2014 to make public the confidential tax information of 51 taxpayers; Whereas, the American people have the right to know whether or not their President is operating under conflicts of interest related to international affairs, tax reform, government contracts, or otherwise: Now, therefore, be it: Resolved, That the House of Representatives shall— 1. Immediately request the tax return information of Donald J. Trump for tax years 2006 through 2015 for review in closed executive session by the Committee on Ways and Means, as provided under Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code, and vote to report the information therein to the full House of Representatives 2. Support transparency in government and the longstanding tradition of Presidents and Presidential candidates disclosing their tax returns. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under rule IX, a resolution offered from the floor by a Member other than the majority leader or the minority leader as a question of the privileges of the House has immediate precedence only at a time designated by the Chair within 2 legislative days after the resolution is properly noticed. Pending that designation, the form of the resolution noticed by the gentleman from New Jersey will appear in full in the RECORD at this point. The Chair will not, at this point, determine whether the resolution constitutes a question of privilege. That determination will be made at the time designated for consideration of the resolution. 
HONORING AN AMERICAN HERO, JEREMY ‘‘SCOTT’’ MCGUIRE (Mr. SCALISE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to honor an American hero. Jeremy ‘‘Scott’’ McGuire was a special agent assigned to the National Security Investigations Division at the Department of Homeland Security in New Orleans. Scott began his career in law enforcement while pursuing a bachelor’s degree in criminal justice at the University of Southern Mississippi, where he received the Most Outstanding Undergraduate Pursuing a Career in Law Enforcement Award. After graduating with honors from USM, Scott was hired by the former U.S. Customs Service, where he was an import specialist. After the September 11 terrorist attacks, Scott was selected to be a special agent with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement team at the Department of Homeland Security. There, he received numerous awards and citations while he investigated successes that included preventing the export of radioactive material in Iraq and halting an attempt to smuggle military aircraft parts to Pakistan, just to name a few examples. On January 25 of 2016, Scott was killed in the line of duty while conducting investigations to dismantle transnational criminal and terrorist organizations that threaten the United States. Scott will forever be in our hearts and minds. I want to thank his family for being here with us in the balcony. 
REMOVAL OF NAME OF MEMBER AS COSPONSOR OF H.R. 60 Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to remove my name as a cosponsor of H.R. 60. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. 
CONGRATULATING THE BISHOP HENDRICKEN HIGH SCHOOL ACADEMIC DECATHLON TEAM (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Bishop Hendricken High School’s Academic Decathlon team, the Division II winners of the United States Academic Decathlon National Competition. The team consists of Mitchell Boyer, Ryan Brady, Darragh Harkin, Steven Huang, Jaidan Idarraga, Connor Milson, Cory Morris, Alden Pratt, and Dylan Temel. They spent countless hours studying and, on April 22, their hard work paid off. Led by Coach Sister Carol Ann Murray, they won an impressive 12 gold, 8 silver, and 11 bronze medals and became the first Rhode Island team to win their division at the national competition. The students’ dedication and scholastic abilities have made Bishop Hendricken, my alma mater, and the whole State of Rhode Island extremely proud. Mr. Speaker, they have shown the vast academic potential of Rhode Island students, and I congratulate them on this great accomplishment. 
RECOGNIZING NATIONAL POLICE WEEK (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize police officers and our law enforcement community during National Police Week. It is these brave men and women who put their lives on the line every day for us and for our communities; and it is a special time to remember those who have fallen in the line of duty who have actually made the ultimate sacrifice. Police officers from around the country are gathering this week at the national memorial as a part of that remembrance. We must also never forget that serving in law enforcement is a family affair and requires strength and dedication from loved ones as well. As a member of the Law Enforcement Caucus, I know that our communities are better served, and served well, thanks to the unwavering commitment from our police officers who take on countless risks for other people and not just themselves. The badge is not just a symbol of authority but one of selflessness and commitment to the greater good. Mr. Speaker, we owe so much to these police officers for the many difficult decisions and situations that they face every day, and we thank them for keeping us safe. 
NOW IS THE TIME TO ACT (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, today we learned that former FBI Director James Comey documented his conversations with President Trump in a series of memos. In one memo, Mr. Comey claims that, after clearing the room, President Trump asked him to end the investigation of General Michael Flynn. If true, this assault on the rule of law would be a violation of our democracy unseen since Watergate. What comes next is uncertain, but investigations into this matter must begin, as those into the President’s Russia ties must continue. All the Comey memos should be turned over to Congress. Any unclassified memos should be released to the public, and President Trump should submit to investigators any tapes with which he threatened Mr. Comey. Lastly, Congress and the American public must hear Mr. Comey testify publicly and under oath. The time has come when silence is no longer denial, it becomes complicity. Now is the time to act, and to do otherwise is only to delay the truth. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. f 
HONORING LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS DURING POLICE WEEK (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, over the weekend, tens of thousands of law enforcement officers from across the country arrived in Washington for National Police Week. Established by a joint resolution of Congress in 1962, National Police Week pays special recognition to those law enforcement officers who have lost their lives in the line of duty for the safety and protection of others. National Police Week is a collaborative effort of many organizations dedicated to honoring America’s law enforcement community. The National Peace Officers’ Memorial Service took place on Monday as the Nation paused to remember officers who made the ultimate sacrifice. A candlelight vigil hosted Saturday evening recognized nearly 400 fallen officers. This week honors the men and women in blue who gave everything to protect their country and their communities. Earlier this year, Pennsylvania mourned the loss of 23yearold State Trooper Landon Weaver, who was killed in the line of duty on December 30, 2016. Our officers put on their uniforms each day knowing that they can be in harm’s way at any moment. On behalf of a grateful nation, thank you to all of our officers who serve. 
INFRASTRUCTURE WEEK (Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, this year, the American Society of Civil Engineers once again gave America’s infrastructure a Dplus rating. During Infrastructure Week, I must highlight the need for action and investment in our Nation’s infrastructure. Our roads, bridges, and waterways are neither Republican nor Democrat; they belong to all of us. From the New Deal to the Federal interstate highways, infrastructure projects have traditionally enjoyed broad bipartisan support and leadership. Improving and maintaining our 21st century transportation system creates access and opportunities for all, allowing for job creation, economic growth, and fostering innovation. As we continue to wait for the President to put forth a plan and true efforts toward investment in our Nation’s crumbling infrastructure, we bear witness to hundreds of millions of dollars in lost economic productivity and a threat to the safety and security of our Nation. It is time to build. It is time to invest in America. f 
NATIONAL POLICE WEEK (Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, as we know, this week is National Police Week. With many officers coming from all over the country to Washington, D.C., it is an opportunity for all of us to show our support for our local law enforcement at home by thanking them for all they do to keep us safe in our communities. I recognize all the men and women in uniform in my own district in northern California and across the country who sacrifice to protect and serve our communities each day. We can’t allow these sacrifices to go quietly unnoticed either. Last year, 135 officers never made it home to their families or their loved ones. In California, 11 officers lost their lives in 2016, one of which was from my district in northern California. Sheriff Deputy Jack Hopkins of Modoc County Sheriff’s Department was murdered while responding to a disturbance call at a rural property a few miles south of Alturas, California. His watch ended on Wednesday, October 19, 2016. Jack’s killer is rightfully facing the death penalty in California; and this week, the House of Representatives is voting on the Thin Blue Line Act, which adds the murder of a law enforcement officer, firefighter, or first responder, as an aggravated factor for a jury to consider in deciding whether to impose the death penalty in Federal capital cases. The murder of a Federal law enforcement officer is already an aggravated factor under current law. Now we are 
taking action to ensure that those who harm local and State law enforcement officers are brought to justice as well. We have to send this clear message: We cannot tolerate this under any circumstances. 
b1915 54TH ANNIVERSARY OF PEACE OFFICERS MEMORIAL DAY (Mrs. DEMINGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, this year marks the 54th anniversary of Peace Officers Memorial Day, so I rise tonight to pay tribute to the law enforcement officers from Florida who were killed in the line of duty last year. Today we remember them and honor them for their service and dedication: Deputy Sheriff Eric James Oliver from the Nassau County Sheriff’s Office; Major Jorge Sanchez from the Miami Police Department; Deputy Sheriff Michael Scott Williams from the Taylor County Sheriff’s Office; Sergeant Jorge Ramos from the Florida Department of Corrections; Deputy Sheriff John Robert Kotfila, Jr., of the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office; Police Officer Henry Malcolm McAleenan, Jr., of the MiamiDade Police Department; and, as you have already heard tonight, Special Agent J. Scott McGuire of U.S. Homeland Security Investigations. Mr. Speaker, we remember these brave men and pray for their families and the countless others who have mourned their loss. 
CONGRATULATIONS TO LADY EAGLES SOFTBALL TEAM (Mr. OLSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, it all started 11 years ago: The Lady Eagles from Fort Bend Baptist Academy won their first Texas State softball title. Years later, the name was changed to Fort Bend Christian Academy, but the dynasty had been born. The Lady Eagles won their sixth Texas title last week by defeating Dallas Christian School with a score of 6–2. One word can describe the Lady Eagles’ playoff run: domination. In the last four games, they scored 37 runs, their opponents only 2. Our four seniors—Claire, Lauren, Danielle, and Kendall—have set us up to make history: our third straight Texas title in 2018. We will honor them as we honor the Lord. Congratulations, Eagles. 
PRESIDENT SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO FIRE FBI DIRECTOR (Mr. BROWN of Maryland asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Speaker, why did President Trump fire FBI Director Comey? He called Comey a ‘‘showboat’’ and ‘‘grandstander’’ and said he was going to fire him regardless of the rationale outlined by the Deputy Attorney General. He justified firing Comey, who was leading the investigation into Michael Flynn and Russian interference in our elections, by saying it ‘‘is a madeup story.’’ But the President’s political removal of Comey without any legal or ethical reason shatters the idea that the FBI is independent and insulated from partisan politics. The President should not be able to fire the FBI Director for political or personal reasons. That is why, today, I introduced legislation to raise the standard for the President to dismiss the FBI Director. Congress placed similar restrictions on the President’s power to remove members of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Director of the CFBP, and special counsels. The FBI should be no different. Congress cannot continue to be a rubberstamp for this administration. Let’s uphold our constitutional responsibility to hold the President accountable. f 
COMMENDING COMFORT CREW FOR MILITARY KIDS FOR THEIR EFFORTS (Mr. WILLIAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Speaker, today I would like to honor a nonprofit organization in Austin for their outstanding achievements. The Comfort Crew for Military Kids develops and delivers programs to help support the children in our Gold Star families who serve around the world. This month, the organization is celebrating their 10th anniversary. As a Congressman from Fort Hood, the largest military base, Comfort Crew for Military Kids holds a very special place in my heart. For too long, military families have faced constant struggles and have had few places to turn. The Comfort Crew helps provide relief for these American families who sacrifice so much for our country. I have personally met with Comfort Crew both in Washington and, just last month, in Austin, Texas. While I was in Austin, I was fortunate enough to lend a hand, assembling care packages for the military children whose parents are deployed. These care packages may not seem like much in comparison to what these kids are giving up in return; however, they provide some comfort and solace. Mr. Speaker, I would like to commend the Comfort Crew for their selfless efforts. They have had an impact on over 1 million military family members. In this unstable world, it is vital that we support these military families that give so much to us. I am proud to represent this organization and will continue to do everything I can to ensure our military children receive the support they need and the support they deserve. In God we trust. f 
HONORING LAW ENFORCEMENT AND FIRST RESPONDERS (Mr. CORREA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in honor of the men and women who protect our families, our streets, and our communities. Fiftyfive years ago, President Kennedy proclaimed May 15 National Police Week. Each year, Americans come together to honor our law enforcement professionals and remember those who have made the ultimate sacrifice while protecting our families and our communities. I remember that infamous day, 9/11, when thousands were running away from burning and crumbling buildings; yet, at the same time, our police and first responders ran into the same burning and crumbling buildings to save lives. These brave men and women knew that they were running to certain death. Every day, police leave their homes knowing full well that they may not return that evening. Every day, they have our backs. It is our job to make sure that they know that we have theirs. 
CONVINCE CHINA TO REIN IN NORTH KOREA (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, like a character out of Looney Tunes, the incorrigible little Kim of North Korea and his minions can’t stop rattling their sabers. New satellite images show a prolonged and heightened level of activity at North Korea’s underground nuclear site. Since coming into power, little Kim has continually defied U.N. sanctions and increased testing of missiles and nuclear weapons. Just this last weekend, North Korea illegally launched yet another menacing ballistic missile. North Korea plans to develop submarines from which to launch these missiles towards the United States. Despite little Kim’s Wile E. Coyote antics, the United States cannot underestimate the warprone lunacy of Kim Jongun. Even our old Deputy Secretary of State recently warned that little Kim’s weapon capabilities have shown improvement within the past year, resulting in ‘‘unprecedented level of activity.’’ The last administration’s appeasement policy of North Korea and its strategic patience has failed. The 
United States must cripple North Korea’s regime with multiple sanctions. We must convince China that it is in their interest to rein in their puppet state of North Korea, and quickly deploy the new THAAD missile systems throughout the region and in Asia. And that is just the way it is, Mr. Speaker. 
BRING BACK ALL CHIBOK GIRLS (Ms. WILSON of Florida asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. WILSON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, on May 6, Nigerian Government officials announced the release of 82 Chibok schoolgirls who have been held captive by Boko Haram since April 20, 2014. I couldn’t believe it. It is truly, truly a reason for celebration, and I thank each and every Member of this House who has shown support for this extremely endless cause. Mr. Speaker, I am thrilled for the families whose daughters were among the 82 released, but we cannot forget that there are still 113 waiting to be freed. Nigerian President Buhari has vowed to bring them all home. When we began this fight, the lives of more than 200 girls were at stake. Slowly but surely, we are making progress. The release of the 82 underscores why we cannot give up. We have to keep pushing and pressing, doing everything we can to ensure that this fight doesn’t end until the last girl has returned home. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow is Wear Something Red Wednesday, and I hope that this news will compel every Member of Congress to wear something red and show his or her support for the #bringbackourgirls movement. Women of Congress, wear your red scarf, a gift for Valentine’s Day from Congresswoman DINGELL . Men of Congress, wear a red tie, Republicans and Democrats, and tweet, tweet, tweet. 
NATIONAL POLICE WEEK AND RECAP OF FIFTH ANNUAL FIRST RESPONDERS TOUR (Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of National Police Week and to thank these brave men and women for their service and sacrifice to their communities. Our law enforcement and first responders run toward the danger when, ofttimes, we are running away from it. There is no way we can ever truly say ‘‘thank you’’ for their willingness to serve. Last week, I held my fifth annual first responders tour to thank them for their dedication to the communities of South Carolina and beyond. The tour consisted of five of the counties I represent: Newberry, Saluda, Edgefield, McCormick, and Greenwood. I can tell you that their expertise, focus, and commitment are unmatched. I visited the facilities and met with the men and women that are on the first line of defense, the ones who are so critical to the safety of our citizens. These folks encounter dangerous and lifethreatening situations that require critical, onthespot decisionmaking, but they never secondguess answering that call and going towards the unknown to help those in need. I hope that events like National Police Week and first responders tours encourage more people to learn about the unique challenges that face these heroes every day. It is important for our law enforcement and first responders to know that their hard work and sacrifice is greatly appreciated. Thank you to all those that serve and have served. They are truly heroes, and we are grateful for their service to make us safe. May God bless these heroes, and may God continue to bless the United States of America. f 
BACK THE BLUE AND FIRST RESPONDERS (Mr. MCCAUL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, this week we honor the brave men and women who make it their life’s duty to protect and defend our citizens, our Nation, and our way of life. Police officers across the country wake up every morning unaware of the challenges they may face, the threats they must overcome, and the lives they will affect and protect in the process. The badge officers don is a symbol of their altruism and their devotion to the common good. I believe in ‘‘Backing the Blue’’ and visit first responders throughout my district in Texas to express my unyielding support. America’s police officers represent the best in all of us and are the finest our country has to offer. For their service, their sacrifice, and their selflessness, we are eternally thankful. 
PRESIDENT’S BREACH OF INTELLIGENCE (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I too rise to honor this week of celebrating our police officers and hope to be able to speak about their bravery throughout the week. But I am overwhelmed and shocked at the actions of the President of the United States to have yielded classified information into codeword intelligence inside a room with the Foreign Minister of Russia and the Ambassador. It is well known that Ambassador Kislyak is reportedly considered by the U.S. intelligence community to be one of Russia’s top spies and a central figure in the FBI investigation into Russia’s collusion with Trump campaign officials during the 2016 Presidential election, along with the downfall of General Flynn. This is an absolutely unacceptable way for a President to act. Mr. President, you have jeopardized the lives of the American people; you have jeopardized the lives of intelligence assets around the world; and you have breached the liaison relationship that we have had with many of our allies. This needs to have a full investigation, besides a number of tools of the commission, a special prosecutor. This Judiciary Committee on the House side needs to stand up and have full hearings regarding the investigation of these horrific actions, violations that may breach on high crimes and misdemeanors. It is shocking that the day after the President fired FBI Director Comey to impede the Bureau’s investigation of the Trump campaign’s ties to the Russian agents and entities that interfered in the 2016 presidential election, we learn that the President recklessly disclosed classified and highly sensitive information to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Russian ambassador to the U.S. Sergey Kislyak at a meeting held at the request of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Ambassador Kislyak is reportedly considered by the U.S. intelligence community to be one of Russia’s top spies and a central figure in the FBI investigation into Russia’s collusion with Trump campaign officials during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. And yet, the President thought it appropriate to disclose to him classified information that had not even been shared with some of our allies. The President’s disclosure of classified and highly sensitive information may have severely compromised a U.S. intelligence partner. But rather than provide a more thorough explanation for the President’s actions, his surrogates are engaged in a bait and switch, feigning outrage over leaks when the President’s loose lips are responsible for the crisis he has created for our nation and for himself. Every day the President gives the nation another reason to question his judgment, doubt his word, mistrust his motives, or question his capacity and competence to manage the national security and foreign policy of the United States. The American people deserve better. Beginning with the creation of an independent bipartisan commission to investigate President Trump’s ties to Russia and the appointment of an independent special counsel to investigate the Trump campaign’s ties to the Russian agents and entities that interfered in the 2016 presidential election. And Congress must take seriously its oversight responsibilities, and its oath to uphold the Constitution, and be a check on the excesses of the Executive Branch. 
b1930 HONORING THE SERVICE OF OUR NATION’S POLICE OFFICERS (Mr. KATKO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the courage and commitment of our policemen and women across this great country. Every day, individuals donning the police shield risk their lives to protect and serve our local communities. Having served as a Federal organized crime prosecutor for 20 years, I have had the distinct pleasure and honor of working with countless police organizations across this country, including in my hometown, such as the Syracuse Police Department, the Syracuse Gang Violence Task Force, and the Onondaga County Sheriff’s Department, among many others. Together, we worked to make Syracuse safer by going after drug and gang organizations that plague our community. While I now proudly represent New York’s 24th Congressional District, their mission continues. I am elated that this body will consider two bills, the Thin Blue Line Act and the Probation Officer Protection Act, that will help protect these individuals who protect us every day. Further, I have a bill that will be debated tomorrow. This bill will help fusion centers disseminate information to our policemen and women as they continue to tackle new and adapting threats across this country. Again, I would like to thank all our Nation’s police officers and honor them this day for their dutiful service. 
POLICE WEEK (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, as a member of the law enforcement community, I rise today to recognize the service and the profound commitment of our police officers around our great Nation. The dedication and sacrifice of our blue line deserves to be respected every day. National Police Week gives us all the opportunity to stand together in support for those in blue and to recommit ourselves to the ideals and laws of our Nation that they are tasked to uphold. National Police Week is a special time to unite nationwide to honor those who sacrifice so much to protect our neighborhoods and our loved ones. To those who have made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty, we as a nation stand eternally grateful. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to recognize National Police Week 2017 and to join with the millions of proud Americans throughout our country to thank our law enforcement members for their continued service and sacrifice. 
POLICE WEEK (Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise unscripted and sober in respectful support for my brothers and sisters of the thin blue line from sea to shining sea. These men and women behind the badge rise each day and serve each night as we work and as we slumber, sure to face dangers unknown, certain to face enemies unseen, and sometimes to be completely unappreciated. This week, we recognize them and we celebrate them. To my brothers and sisters of the thin blue line, please hear that your support within this body is unwavering and shall not falter. God bless you, one and all. f 
MAKE IT IN AMERICA The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. COMER ). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from California (Mr. GARAMENDI ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, this is Infrastructure Week. Infrastructure. Can you imagine Congress actually talking about building things that America needs, like roads, highspeed internet, and maybe a few ports and ships and highspeed trains from here to there? It is Infrastructure Week. Mr. President, you promised us a trilliondollar infrastructure bill; however, you seem to be occupied on a few other things. So we will be understanding and just kind of take up the issue here and talk about it and see if we can move this issue forward since we really haven’t heard from the administration on your trilliondollar program. Let’s talk about some of the elements of it today. I am going to start with a really old placard that we have used now for 7 years. We call this the Make It In America agenda, and it has been something that Mr. HOYER of Maryland and I and many others on the Democratic side of the aisle have been talking about for some time. We talk about trade; tax policy; energy policy; and labor issues, such as the Davis Bacon Act that guarantees that we are not going to have a rush to the bottom, but that we are going to hold up the working men and women that are making things in America, like roads and bridges; education; research; and not at the bottom, but always important, infrastructure. So today we talk about infrastructure. As we do so, I want us to always keep in mind that infrastructure offers an incredible opportunity for America to do more than just lay down concrete, more than just putting asphalt on a road or a pipe in the ground. Infrastructure offers an opportunity for us to rebuild the American manufacturing sector. There are many different ways we can do that. For example, if we are going to build locomotives for the eastern corridor of the Amtrak system here in the United States, new electric locomotives. Way back when, some of us do remember the Great Recession and the effort of this Congress—then controlled by the Democrats—to jumpstart, to rebuild the American economy. In what was the stimulus legislation there was a piece of it that called for, I think, $700 million or $800 million for about 80 new electric locomotives for Amtrak. Some brilliant staffer wrote into it: 100 percent American made. Guess what. Siemens, a German company, said, Oh, a $700 million, $800 million contract to make a bunch of locomotives; we can do that. So, in Sacramento, California, they expanded their little trolly plant and made it into a locomotive plant. They have now built all of those 100 percent American made. So when we talk about infrastructure—in this case, the Amtrak system—it can be made in America. Manufacturing matters. To get down to the details here of what infrastructure is all about, international trade is critical to the American economy. Unfortunately, we are running a trade deficit. All of that trade—about 90 percent of it, actually—comes through the ports of America. So when you talk about infrastructure, you have got to talk about the ports. Harbor maintenance is a particular program that has been in existence for a long time. It is a tax on every cargo container that arrives in the United States in ports and is basically used for dredging. My colleague and I, who will joining me in a few moments from the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, made a little change here. We said that money can’t just go for the support of the Treasury and the deficit, but, rather, it must be used on harbor maintenance. We expanded the definition of harbor maintenance to include on the wharf and related issues. But when we talk about infrastructure, much of that infrastructure will start at the great ports on the West Coast up in Seattle and the Puget Sound and San Francisco Bay. Don’t let me forget about Oregon. They have got some great ports in Oregon. Then, of course, the busiest port in America— well, probably among the busiest ports—L.A.Long Beach Port in California. Infrastructure. Are the American ports ready for tomorrow’s international commerce? The answer is: Not really. The Panama Canal has been expanded and now we have ships called Panamax ships and super Panamax ships, all of which require that our ports be upgraded. The channel has deepened. The wharf has expanded. The number of containers that can be handled at any one time increased. So you have got the channel deepening, wharves that need to be made, docks, the rest, and all of the cranes and all of the movement necessary to 
handle these ships that have thousands upon thousands of containers, all of which have to be unloaded quickly. I want to begin with the infrastructure issue at the ports, but there is more to it than that. It is the ships that arrive at the ports. The United States used to have a great maritime industry. At the end of World War II, there were more than 1,500 Americanflagged and American built ships. Over the years, we have seen a continuing decline in that. We had 500 about 20 years ago, and today, less than 80 ships are American flagged. We do have the Jones Act, which is extremely important. That is for the domestic shipping. Those are Americanflagged and Americanbuilt ships, but those are all domestic. The intercontinental ships—what they call the Blue Ocean Ships—are not made in America anymore, but they could be. This is where I want to take this discussion. I want to take this discussion back to another part of the infrastructure. Remember, I was talking to you about the trains, the locomotives made in America and really rebuilding the American locomotive industry in California with a German company, Siemens, building those locomotives. Now, guess what. America is not energy independent yet, but we are on our way to that. We would expect to be the third largest exporter of natural gas in the form of liquefied natural gas by 2020 and one of the world’s largest exporters of crude oil by 2025. As of today, none, nada, not any of that liquefied natural gas or oil will be on Americanbuilt ships. Don’t you think it ought to be the American policy that some of it should be on Americanbuilt ships with American flags and American mariners? If you care about the national security, you should care about blue water shipbuilding in the United States. There are two bills that I am introducing that go directly to this. The fundamental question is this: Will the LNG ships be made in China, Korea, Japan, or will they be made in America? American national security depends upon the U.S. Navy and the ability to build ships in the United States. Right now, the great oceangoing ships on the commercial side are not built in the United States and our shipyards are losing the trained men and women, from naval architects to welders and steamfitters, and on and on, that can build these ships. What we need to do is to reenergize the American shipbuilding industry and the infrastructure that goes with it by passing legislation that we call the Energizing American Maritime Act and energizing the American shipbuilding industry, all part of an infrastructure package that includes the ports, the docks, the trains and trucks that arrive there, multimedia, and on the water itself—Americanbuilt ships with American sailors providing at least some of the export potential that is in the process of being achieved. Liquefied natural gas. We would expect to have more than 100 ships moving that LNG from American ports to somewhere around the world—mostly China, Japan, India, and Europe. b1945 But right now it will be zero unless we pass a bill—16 lines of law—that say: Build it in America; make it in America, American mariners, American ships. We can do this as part of a large, trilliondollar infrastructure package— ships on the ocean and ports in America that are capable of handling the largest ships in the world, docks that are capable of quickly unloading these ships in an efficient, effective manner, rail yards that move the goods out of the ports and into the ports for export, and the trucks that move across the highways, all of this, part of an infrastructure package, just one piece of a much larger issue. Now, joining me tonight in our little discussion is an extraordinary Representative from the great State of Connecticut who has now taken a leadership position on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee as vice ranking member, ELIZABETH ESTY. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE WEEK The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. ESTY) is recognized for the remainder of the hour as the designee of the minority leader. Ms. ESTY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, Mr. GARAMENDI , for our shared commitment to American manufacturing and to ensure that, once again, America will be the envy of the world for a fantastic infrastructure and transportation system. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PAYNE ), who is my friend and colleague, to continue our discussion on this the second day of National Infrastructure Week to talk about the tremendous need that we have in this country to do a better job to ensure our citizens get to work on time and safely and get home in the same way. Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, first, let me thank the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. ESTY) for allowing me this time to engage the American people in a subject that is crucial to the economy of this Nation and for the citizens that use transportation throughout this country. I think Mr. GARAMENDI really gave us the bang in terms of looking at the rail situation. That is an area that I also am going to speak on. Let me say that, with every day that passes, the need for Federal infrastructure investment grows more and more urgent. Robust and reliable infrastructure is the foundation for economic success and security. But for too long, the United States has underinvested in our infrastructure, and this once vibrant foundation has crumbled. Yesterday, in my district, I took a visit with Amtrak to the 107yearold Portal Bridge that carries about 450 trains and thousands of passengers over the Hackensack River in New Jersey every weekday. It is a major bottleneck along the Northeast corridor, the Nation’s busiest rail line. This rail line goes through New Jersey—well, actually, it starts here in Washington and will travel to Boston. So it travels through Connecticut as well. But we have a major bottleneck in New Jersey. This old infrastructure, this 107year old bridge, is really outdated machinery because this bridge over the river has to spin on a turret when there are barges coming through. Normally it gets stuck. The replacement of the bridge is a key component of the $23.9 billion Gateway program, a comprehensive rail investment program to double rail capacity between New Jersey and New York City. According to a recent study released by Amtrak, the program could generate $3.87 worth of economic benefit for every $1 invested. New Jersey and New York have agreed to contribute $750 million towards the estimated $1.5 billion costs for the Portal Bridge project. But the program will not be able to move forward without Federal investment. President Trump’s proposal to zero out the New Starts programs threatens to derail the overall Gateway program and the Portal Bridge project along with it. America’s infrastructure is failing. Now is the time to build the infrastructure that we need to grow our economy, keep America safe, and become more competitive. Every dollar of infrastructure investment means another $3 of economic growth. America’s infrastructure needs could be met, and then some, for a fraction of the cost of the President’s tax plan—which is estimated to increase the deficit by $3 trillion to $7 trillion over the next decade—while contributing immensely to economic growth. Mr. Speaker, we see what is happening across this Nation. We have seen what has happened when bridges crumble, poor infrastructure and tunnels, and it is time for this Nation to invest, once again, in its infrastructure if it wants to remain the beacon in the world for economic growth. I would like to thank the gentlewoman, once again, for allowing me this opportunity to talk about a critical topic. If no one hears this call, we are doomed in terms of our infrastructure. Ms. ESTY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of National Infrastructure Week. I do this proudly as the daughter and 
granddaughter of civil engineers—men who built bridges, roads, airports, and dams all across this country and all across the world. However, Mr. Speaker, sadly, today I need to recognize that America is not getting a good grade in infrastructure. In fact, just this last month, the American Society of Civil Engineers gave America’s infrastructure a grade of Dplus. Now, before we despair, we can be happy it is not as bad as 4 years ago when it was a D. But there is no parent in America who will cheer when their child comes home and says: I made it all the way from a D to a Dplus. America can and must do better, and this Congress needs to fulfill its duty under the Constitution and under the basic tenets of what a government is supposed to do by meeting the needs of the American people. There is no better time than now, and there is no better place than here, in the people’s House, for us to take up this call because, at the end of the day, infrastructure is about jobs. It is about putting people to work right now replacing those bridges, roads, dams, airports, and rails. But, more importantly, it is about getting people to work safely and on time tomorrow and getting home in time to see the soccer game. So we are going to go through, a little bit, some of what these grades were. So the composite grade of Dplus is made up of roads, D; and bridges, C plus. Many Americans will remember an August night 10 years ago in 2007, in the Twin Cities. People were driving across a heavily traveled bridge on I– 35. The bridge collapsed, sending people crashing down into the river. Twenty Americans lost their lives when that bridge collapsed. In my own State of Connecticut, people remember when the Mianus River Bridge collapsed on I–95, the major backbone of the entire Northeast corridor. Fortunately, the bridge collapsed in the middle of the night, and only three people died. Had it been during the middle of the day, that number would have been far higher. Mr. Speaker, America should not wait, nor should this Congress wait, until bridges collapse or trains derail until we fix our aging infrastructure. It is the backbone of what government is supposed to do. Our roads are congested. In 2014, engineers estimated that congestion cost American commuters $160 billion in a single year. For the average commuter in an urban area, that was 42 hours of their lives—a full workweek. So it is not just dollars and aggravation, it is polluted air, and it is broken axles. But it is also time, which for many Americans is the most valuable thing we have. We want to see our families. We work hard in this country, and we in Congress should be working harder to make sure that our hardworking people we represent can get home on time to see their families. So that is where we are. That is where we are with bridges and roads. I had a constituent come up to me in the nearby city of Waterbury last week. We were looking at an aging infrastructure intersection. She said: 
I came over here just to tell you that I hit such a big pothole last week. I have got a couplehundreddollar repair bill for my car, and I don’t have the money to pay for it. You have got to tell those people in Washington we need to fix things so I don’t have to worry about a pothole ruining my car and making me unable to pay my bills. 
Mr. Speaker, too many of our bridges are structurally deficient—almost 4 in 10 of our bridges. Thirtynine percent are 50 years old or older. That is the structural lifespan of a bridge—50 years. I drive across some of those every single day, and nearly 10 percent of the Nation’s bridges are graded structurally deficient. Just to say, they are really not safe. It is not just bridges and roads that are in dire need of repairs. We also have our rail system. We saw from my colleague, Mr. PAYNE , that rail systems are a problem. Our transit systems are in desperate need of upgrade. Passenger rail, we don’t even have a full estimate of what that would take to bring it up to speed. We have passenger rail that runs through Connecticut; 100,000 people commute every single day. The commute right now from New Haven, Connecticut, to New York City is as long as it was 100 years ago. Surely America can do better. It is not just passenger rail and freight rail. We should say a good word about freight rail here. Freight rail is the reason we are up from a Dplus to a D. Freight has moved up to a B, so we can be glad about freight’s grade this past year. We also have airports. Now, I don’t know how many of you have been through airports recently. If you have, you might even be surprised they are up to a D and not lower than that. American airports are congested. Many of them are aging and are in need of significant work. Congestion at airports is growing. Twentyfour of the top 30 airports in the U.S. are experiencing the ‘‘Thanksgivingpeak traffic volume’’ once a week. That used to be a term that was used once a year. American airports across the country are serving 2 million passengers a year. I can tell you about a recent time I landed in LaGuardia Airport in New York. It used to be considered one of the Nation’s shining examples. People came and arrived in LaGuardia and were amazed and impressed with this great country. b2000 One of the last times I was in LaGuardia Airport, I was greeted by a blue plastic tarp ducttaped to the ceiling inside the terminal, funneled down into a 30gallon trash can to collect the water that was leaking through the terminal. That is not the way a great country greets its own citizens, or any others, to one of the world’s great cities. In addition to the work we need to do on our airports, we have our water infrastructure. This is our clean water system, and it is also our wastewater system. According to the most recent Clean Watersheds Needs Survey, the EPA reports that the total wastewater and storm water treatment capital needs in the next 25 years is $271 billion; yet the Federal Government has been contributing less and less to that growing need to make sure that our rivers and streams and waterways are clean. All of America saw, last year, what happened when one single community, Flint, Michigan, failed to add a single corrosionprevention agent to its clean water and ended up literally poisoning its children with lead. It is time for America to do better. There are costs when we don’t invest in this country. I like to think of it more or less like the roof on America’s house. Now, many of you may know it is pretty exciting when you put an addition on your house, but it is not exciting to replace your roof; but if you don’t replace your roof and it keeps leaking, ultimately, you lose the entire house. The ceiling collapses. That is where we are as a country right now. We have stopped fixing America’s roof. We have stopped it in bridges and roads. We have stopped in it airports and rail. It is time for us to get going. I will tell you that I am encouraged by reports coming from the new administration about making a serious commitment to invest in America’s infrastructure, but there are some things that we need to keep in mind when we are talking about American infrastructure. One is to remember that it used to be called by another name. It used to be called public works. There is a reason it was public works. There is a reason it wasn’t private works. So I think it is certainly appropriate that we look to do publicprivate partnerships, to leverage the power of private investors to fix some of our aging infrastructure, and to build some new infrastructure. But we should make no mistake: This country became great, it was transformed by the Interstate Highway System, literally linking America from end to end. But we cannot expect, nor should we think, that the basic public infrastructure of America is going to be able to be outsourced to financiers in New York City. If that were the case, they would have already done it. These are basic public works where we need real dollar investments, and I can assure the administration there are many of us in Congress who are ready to move forward with that. When we are talking about infrastructure, there is another piece I like to remind people we need, because part of infrastructure is moving goods and services, getting people to work and back, getting things to markets and things they want to buy and put on the table. But the 21st century is going to be built on information, and information is what is moving most in this society and creating much of the value. 
So if we need information, that means we need energy and we need internet everywhere. So in addition to infrastructure and transportation, we need to have infostructure. We need to have reliable, cybersecure, sustainable energy systems across America, and we need to have internet available for every single American to participate in this exciting new economy. So we have infrastructure, we have infostructure, and we have public works. Mr. Speaker, the roof of America’s house is leaking. The time is now for this body, the people’s House, to come together to work on real transportation and infrastructure bills. We have dozens of them that are available in the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and other committees. But the time has passed; the time has passed for us to wait, to pass the buck, to delay fixing the roof because the leaks are getting worse. The American people are suffering. When it is your family that is on the bridge that is structurally deficient, you would want, if your family crosses that bridge every day, you would want to make sure that it gets fixed and not wait until it falls down. This is the sort of basic function government used to do without a question. It is what used to happen in this Chamber because people didn’t care whether there was a D or an R after their name. Bridges and roads don’t have D’s or R’s after their names. They are not affiliated with political parties, nor should they be. It is time for us to do our jobs and set aside whatever partisan bickering there may be in other venues. On this, on bridges and roads, rail systems and dams, water infrastructure and infostructure, I ask my colleagues to please join me—join all of us—and make this, National Infrastructure Week, the start of the 115th Congress’ commitment to do right by the American people, to make these investments, to do the sort of compromise and negotiation that this body is supposed to be doing to meet the needs of the American people. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

PRAYER The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer: Let us pray. Savior, lead us as a shepherd guides the sheep. We find consolation in the knowledge that You have gone before us to bring us to Your desired destination. Lord, direct the steps of our lawmakers so that even when they fail to fulfill Your purposes, You will continue to uphold them with the right hand of Your righteousness. May they remember that nothing can separate them from Your love. As they face the heat of tough decisions, provide them with the watered gardens and living springs of Your presence. Lord, You have begun a good work in them; carry it on to completion. We pray in Your Holy Name. Amen.
