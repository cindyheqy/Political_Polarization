Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8, rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. SCHRA DER) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. SCHRADER led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my hometown and my home State of Haleyville, Alabama, as the birthplace of the first ever 911 phone call that was placed 50 years ago tomorrow, February 16, 1968. This pioneering phone call remains a source of great pride in our city, in our State. The phone call was placed by Alabama’s thenSpeaker of the House, Rankin Fite; and my predecessor, Congressman Tom Bevill. The call was made on a bright red phone that has been showcased in our city hall for the last several years. I am proud to report to my colleagues this morning that this red phone, a piece of Haleyville history, will be temporarily showcased as a piece of American history at the Smithsonian. The current mayor of Haleyville, Ken Sunseri, has done an outstanding job in marking this anniversary for our town; and, by the way, his fatherinlaw, James Whitt, was the mayor at the time the phone call was made. I want to personally thank the mayor and so many others, including the National Emergency Number Association and all the 911 organizations, for all their efforts to recognize this 50th anniversary of the world’s first 911 call. f 
PASS A DREAM ACT TO PROTECT DACA RECIPIENTS (Mr. SCHRADER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Speaker, I would like to share Miriam’s DACA 
story and continue to demand that House Republicans allow a vote on the Dream Act. Miriam was brought to Oregon by her parents when she was a little girl. She is grown and has not allowed her immigration status to deter her from working hard or pursuing her dreams. When DACA was established in 2012, it opened a path that was unknown to her and has allowed her passion to flourish. Miriam is currently a sophomore in college, and her future is full of hope. She dreams of one day holding public office here at home and hopes to work towards a career in either public schools or as a computer engineer in the healthcare sector. This is a young lady who is working hard, doing the right things to better herself, and who maintains goals that give back to her community and this amazing country that raised her. The sad reality is this Republican controlled Congress and administration are holding Miriam’s dreams hostage by not allowing a vote on the Dream Act. It is inhumane to continue to entangle the lives of these young folks in partisan games. Let’s do the right thing. Let’s get a Dream Act passed so that our country can move forward and protect the 800,000 DACA recipients. 
THANKING STENOGRAPHERS DURING NATIONAL COURT REPORTING AND CAPTIONING WEEK (Mr. BYRNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate National Court Reporting and Captioning Week. As an attorney, from firsthand experience, I can say that court reporters have had and continue to have an enormous impact on our legal system, both in a practical matter but also in an important historical sense. As we attorneys talk away, court reporters tirelessly capture every single word. The importance of this cannot be underestimated. Without their record, there would be no Brown v. Board of Education, Miranda v. Arizona, or countless other legal decisions of importance to the American people. Captioners also do wonderful work to help better the lives for millions of Americans who are deaf and hard of hearing by providing captioning realtime. So, on National Court Reporting and Captioning Week, I want to thank the thousands of Americans who work in this industry for their hard work and dedication. 
CONGRESS SHOULD REJECT THE DIRTY BUDGET AND INFRASTRUCTURE SCAM (Ms. MCCOLLUM asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, as Americans, we have a responsibility to protect our environment and our public lands for today and for tomorrow, and that is why we, Congress, passed clean air and clean water laws. That is why we protected our public lands and treasured spaces. President Trump has a different set of priorities. With his dirty budget and his infrastructure scam, President Trump is attacking basic environmental safeguards. The Trump budget cuts environmental protections and makes it impossible for the EPA to keep American families safe and healthy. The Trump budget stops essential research on climate change, slashes clean energy development, and threatens endangered species. The Trump infrastructure scam repeals basic environmental safeguards and sells off our public lands to Big Oil. Once again, President Trump is putting polluters and their profits first at the expense of America’s families being healthy. Our air, water, and our land should never be partisan issues. Congress must reject this dirty budget and infrastructure scam and work to protect our environment and not destroy it. 
RECOGNIZING PENNSBURY SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR THEIR FOCUS ON MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Pennsbury School District in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, for their focus on the mental health of their students and our community at large and their determination to end the drug epidemic. Pennsbury School District recently launched an onsite mental health counseling program for their high school students and their families in partnership with the district’s new Addiction and Mental Health Task Force. The clinical counseling, in partnership with St. Mary Medical Center and Family Service Association of Bucks County, began last month at the Pennsbury High School. The district hopes to continue its partnership and expand the program to students and families in the elementary and middle school communities. As the cochair of the Bipartisan Heroin Task Force, we have worked tirelessly, both in Congress and in our communities, to find solutions to this devastating epidemic. We are so encouraged by the steps that these members of our community are taking to address the issues of mental health and addiction. We encourage every school district in Bucks County to follow the lead of Pennsbury School District in both educating and protecting our children, and we also thank the St. Mary Medical Center and Family Service Association of Bucks County for partnering with the Pennsbury School District in this critical program. f 
GUN VIOLENCE (Ms. KELLY of Illinois asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because, on a day when schoolchildren should be thinking about baseball tryouts, prom, and college selections, again they head to school living the reality that a gun may strike them down at any moment. Today 17 children will never again return to their school in Florida, casualties in America’s 18th shooting in 44 days. Once again parents and counselors will have to bring the comfort and security that this Congress refuses to offer. This week in Chicago, a decorated police commander, Paul Bauer, was shot and killed, another officer lost in a disturbing trend of police shootings that we have not addressed either. Mr. Speaker, Melissa Falkowski, a teacher in that school, asked when Congress will do something. A student said, The country needs to look in the mirror. He said, We cannot get used to this. This cannot become the norm. Do you remember the terror you felt as grown men on that baseball field? Well, imagine those young people in that school, in our neighborhoods, at a concert, in a park. Despite your words, your prayers, you have proven over and over you don’t care about anyone but yourselves and your contributions. It is sickening, and shame on you. 
LOS HERNANDEZ TAMALES HONORED WITH JAMES BEARD FOUNDATION AWARD (Mr. NEWHOUSE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Los Hernandez Tamales in Union Gap, Washington, for winning the James Beard Foundation’s 2018 America’s Classics Award. Felipe and June Hernandez, as well as their daughter and soninlaw, Rachel and Dion Wilburn, have operated the tamale eatery in the Yakima Valley for the last three decades. Felipe came to America from Mexico to work in agriculture and opened Los Hernandez Tamales in 1990. This family owned establishment is well known for its pork, chicken, and seasonal asparagus tamales and, until now, remained a relatively secret spot among us locals. The James Beard Foundation America’s Classics Award honors locally owned restaurants that are cherished for quality food that reflects the character of their community, and Los Hernandez Tamales is the first restaurant in central Washington to be recognized by the foundation. 
I, my family, my friends, and my staff can all attest that this award is well deserved, and it is an honor to recognize the Hernandezes for their hard work and accomplishments. 
CELEBRATING PENN STATE’S THON (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow marks one of the finest traditions on Penn State’s campus, a 46hour dance marathon called THON. THON is the grand finale of a yearlong fundraising campaign that Penn State students undertake for the kids. Beginning at 5 p.m. on Friday, more than 700 recognized dancers will put their stamina to the test and dance for 46 hours, without sleep, at the Bryce Jordan Center. But it is much more than that. THON is the largest studentrun philanthropy in the world, and it raises money to fight pediatric cancer. The proceeds raised go directly to Four Diamonds, which benefits the Penn State Children’s Hospital in Hershey. Four Diamonds ensures that families who are battling pediatric cancer are not faced with any costs, allowing them to fully focus on the needs of their child. THON 2017 raised more than $10 million. Since its inception, THON has raised more than $146 million. Mr. Speaker, I am always in awe of the power of our Penn State students and their care and concern for others. I wish everyone participating the best of luck. We are. 
Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 620. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. NEWHOUSE ). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Virginia? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 736 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 620. The Chair appoints the gentleman from Idaho (Mr. SIMPSON ) to preside over the Committee of the Whole. b0914 
Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill (H.R. 620) to amend the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 to promote compliance through education, to clarify the requirements for demand letters, to provide for a notice and cure period before the commencement of a private civil action, and for other purposes, with Mr. SIMPSON in the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the first time. General debate shall not exceed 1 hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary. The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOODLATTE ) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. NADLER ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia. b0915 Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Private enforcement of title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act is a critical tool for disabled individuals to gain access to places like restaurants and shopping centers. Most businessowners, however, feel blindsided when they are sued for violations they were unaware of. This has been the case even for disabled businessowners who have testified before the House Judiciary Committee. Lee Ky testified in 2016. She runs one of her family’s doughnut shops that was sued for technical violations of the ADA because a restroom sign was in the shape of a triangle instead of a square. A person who has never walked in her life, Ky testified that she is proud of this Nation’s effort to improve accessibility by enacting the ADA, but she thinks that businesses should be given an opportunity to remove barriers before getting sued. Donna and David Batelaan have also testified. They were coowners of a store that sold accessibility devices in Florida. Despite employing two people who used wheelchairs, despite themselves using wheelchairs, and despite the fact that virtually their entire clientele was composed of customers who had mobility limitations, they were sued because they had not painted lines and posted a sign for a ‘‘handicapped’’ spot required by the ADA. Indeed, according to their testimony, it was later found that they had been just one of many businesses targeted by an unscrupulous, outofstate attorney. According to Mrs. Batelaan, it did not matter that their parking lot and store were totally accessible. It was greed that was driving these suits. These examples are among many shared by businesses across the country. The ADA’s private right of action, which was originally intended to be the primary enforcement mechanism to achieve greater access, has instead encouraged a cottage industry of costly and wasteful litigation that neither benefits the business nor disabled individuals seeking more accessibility. A report aired on ‘‘60 Minutes’’ on December 4, 2016, for example, featured several smallbusiness owners who were subject to what are known as ‘‘driveby’’ lawsuits. In such lawsuits, commonly filed by opportunistic trial lawyers, the plaintiff need only drive by the property, not actually visit it, to file a lawsuit alleging an ADA violation. In other cases, plaintiffs can even use Google Earth to target alleged violations and, in turn, file lawsuits before even notifying a smallbusiness owner of the problem. The fact that these types of small businesses are illequipped to defend an ADA lawsuit is the reason why they are sued. Indeed, opportunistic attorneys are more often willing to settle for just less than it would cost those momandpop businesses to defend themselves in court. According to a 2017 oped published in The Hill, a conservative estimate of the average settlement amount is $7,500. Given that plaintiff attorneys’ motive is often to line their own pockets, there is little or no incentive to work with businesses to cure a violation before a lawsuit is filed. This results in wasted resources that could have been used to improve access. H.R. 620 is a commonsense solution because it gives businesses a fair chance to cure title III violations before they are forced into a lawsuit, while still preserving the power of the threat of a lawsuit when businesses fail to make the required fixes in a timely manner. H.R. 620 will create more access for more Americans more quickly because businesses would much rather fix an access problem quickly than face an unpredictable and expensive lawsuit that could hurt their ability to expand access in other ways. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense reform, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chair, before we discuss the bill before us today, I want to address the horrible school shooting in Florida yesterday. We mourn the deaths of those shot and killed, and we support those who were injured and the families of the victims. But we must also do more to prevent future shootings in our schools and on our streets. There have been 18 school shootings in this country so far this year, and it is only February. According to a Washington Post analysis, over the last 19 years, more than 150,000 students attending at least 170 primary and secondary schools have experienced a shooting on campus. That does not include violence outside of the classroom. We cannot allow this to continue. It is long past due for the House to consider legislation on this floor to help prevent gun violence. Our calls for hearings and for action on gun violence prevention legislation have been met 
with silence. Congress did nothing after Columbine 20 years ago, and nothing after Sandy Hook 5 years ago. Inaction is unacceptable. Moments of silence are completely inadequate. Our citizens demand that we act without delay. Mr. Chairman, H.R. 620, the socalled ADA Education and Reform Act of 2017, would undermine the civil rights of Americans with disabilities by significantly weakening the key enforcement tool of the ADA Act of 1990, which is the filing of private lawsuits by discrimination victims. Congress passed the ADA 28 years ago with the goals of fully integrating persons with disabilities into the mainstream of American life and counteracting discriminatory social attitudes toward the disabled. By making it harder for persons facing such discrimination to vindicate their rights in court, this bill ultimately undermines those goals. H.R. 620 would, among other things, institute a presuit notice and cure regime under the title III of the ADA, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in public accommodations, like hotels, restaurants, private schools, and healthcare providers. Specifically, the bill would prohibit a disability discrimination victim from filing a lawsuit to enforce his or her rights under title III unless the victim first notifies a business of a title III violation. The victim must then wait up to 180 days to allow the business either to comply with the law or simply to make some undefined level of substantial progress—whatever that means—toward complying with the law. No Federal civil rights statute imposes such onerous requirements on discrimination victims before they can have the opportunity to enforce their rights in court. Both individually and cumulatively, this bill’s notice and cure provisions will have the effect of inappropriately shifting the burden of compliance with the Federal civil rights statute from the alleged wrongdoer onto the discrimination victim and perversely incentivizing businesses not to comply voluntarily with the ADA. Moreover, because H.R. 620 does not define the term ‘‘substantial progress,’’ the bill leaves it entirely to a businessowner’s discretion as to whether he has made such progress. At a minimum, this raises the prospect of expensive and protracted litigation over the question of whether the business has made sufficiently substantial progress should a lawsuit be filed. Such a prospect, along with the need to wait 180 days before filing a lawsuit, may be enough to deter discrimination victims with meritorious claims from even sending a notice of violation, much less filing suit to enforce their rights. In addition, the bill’s notice requirement is overly burdensome and excessive. Rather than simply requiring an aggrieved person to notify a business of the existence of an access barrier, H.R. 620 essentially requires the person to plead a legal case in his or her initial notice. For instance, a victim must cite the specific provision of the ADA that has been violated, describe whether the victim made a request to the business about removing an access barrier, and explain whether an access barrier was temporary or permanent. Such specific information may be very difficult or impossible for a discrimination victim to provide at the notice stage, particularly without legal counsel. Finally, H.R. 620 does not even address the purported problem identified by his proponents who claim that a presuit notification is needed to stop lawyers from filing numerous similar lawsuits alleging both Federal ADA claims and State law claims against numerous businesses in order to force quick settlements. That is because many States allow for damages under their State disability rights laws. But this ignores the fact that title III of the Federal ADA only permits recovery of reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, no recovery of money damages. In other words, it is State law, not the Federal ADA, which provides the financial incentive for pursuing numerous lawsuits. Additionally, the filing of multiple suits alleging violations of the ADA or State disability laws says nothing about the underlying merits of those suits or the intent of the parties involved. To the extent that lawyers actually engage in misconduct, courts already have the tools to address such misconduct, including imposing sanctions, refusing to award attorneys’ fees, or dismissing cases that have no legal or factual basis. A presuit notification requirement, together with a lack of any requirement to actually comply with the law, is a virtual getoutofjailfree card for every public accommodation in America. H.R. 620 substantially diminishes the primary incentive for voluntary compliance with title III, which is the credible risk of being sued and having to pay reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. H.R. 620’s notice and cure requirements, by starkly diminishing the risk of litigation, would send a clear and devastating message to every public accommodation in America that there is no need to comply voluntarily with the ADA. Instead, the bill tells businesses that they should simply wait and see if they ever receive a notice of a violation and to forget about the rights and needs of people with disabilities until then. As the former Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge wrote recently in The Hill in opposing H.R. 620: ‘‘. . . it is unacceptable to roll back the civil rights of people with disabilities. We should ensure access, not progress. We should expect businesses to know and comply with their obligations, not require our neighbors and colleagues with disabilities to shoulder the burden of informing and educating businesses about those obligations. We should not turn the business of everyday life into a complex and legal ordeal for people with disabilities.’’ For the foregoing reasons, I oppose H.R. 620 and I urge the House to reject this deeply flawed bill. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chair, I yield myself 30 seconds to respond to the gentleman from New York. In point of fact, the United States Code contains several examples in which a potential plaintiff must provide notice before filing a lawsuit. For example, title I of the ADA, in fact, requires a plaintiff to first file an administrative complaint with the EEOC. Unlike a complaint filed in Federal court, it is a method for parties to try to resolve the case before litigation through a conciliation process. As part of this process, the complainant is required to fill out a form that puts the recipient on notice of the alleged issues. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act has a similar process. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. CALVERT ). Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, the goal of the American with Disabilities Act is to provide access for the disabled. That goal must be pursued and protected. It is important to distinguish, however, that the ADA is not intended to feed driveby lawsuits and put good people out of business. Unfortunately, my State of California has become ground zero for abusive ADA lawsuits. I have heard from many small businesses in my congressional district that have fallen victim to abusive ADA lawsuits that are not aimed at improving access to the disabled. In fact, California accounts for roughly 40 percent of ADA lawsuits nationwide, despite being home to just 12 percent of the country’s disabled population. Protecting small businesses from abusive lawsuits and ensuring disabled Americans have adequate access are not mutually exclusive goals. That is why I am an original cosponsor of H.R. 620 and believe its passage is critical to both the disabled and to our small businesses. By giving businessowners adequate time to make appropriate changes to provide access, we are returning to the original spirit and intent of the ADA. I thank my friend from Texas, Representative POE, for his leadership on this issue, as well as the bipartisan group of cosponsors for their support. I urge all of my colleagues to vote for this bill and ensure that serial litigants are no longer rewarded for taking advantage of an important and meaningful law. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. LEWIS). Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I thank my good friend, the ranking member, Mr. NADLER , for yielding. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this bill. Many of my colleagues may not remember when the Civil Rights Act became the law of the land in 1964, but I remember. I was there. As a matter of fact, I gave a little blood during the sitins, during the Freedom Rides. b0930 I remember the struggle, the fight, and the sacrifice of so many to protect the dignity and the worth of every human being. I was here serving in this very Chamber when the Americans with Disabilities Act became the law of the land 26 years later. Yet today, it is unbelievable; it is unreal; we are considering a bill that turns the clock backwards and strikes a devastating blow in the fight for civil rights. Mr. Chair, I want to make it crystal clear for the record: there is no place in our country for the burden to be placed on those whose rights have and will be violated time and time again. Mr. Chair, this bill is wrong, it is meanspirited, and it is a shame and a disgrace that we would bring it to the floor. I urge each and every one of my colleagues to oppose this bill. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. POE), a member of the Judiciary Committee and the chief sponsor of this legislation. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Chair, I want to thank the chairman for his long work on this issue, and I want to thank a couple of the cosponsors—this is a bipartisan bill—Congressman PETERS , Congresswoman SPEIER , and Mr. K EN CALVERT , who have worked on this for years. I appreciate the words of the gentleman who just spoke, a great leader in civil rights movement, but as he probably knows, title VII of the Civil Rights Act does require notice, as well as this legislation hopefully will do. And let me be clear. This legislation makes the ADA better because it requires that businesses be told and be given a chance to fix the problem if there is a problem. Under current law, that is not the case. The goal of this bill, the ADA legislation that we have, is to have accommodations for the disabled and to make sure businesses comply with that accommodation. When a lawsuit is filed, many times the business is never told what the problem is, and it may be a year or longer before that lawsuit ends up in a Federal court. Under this legislation, businesses, once they are put on notice, they have 180 days to fix the problem or make substantial progress. If the goal of the ADA is to get problems fixed, the legislation we have here helps that. But what is taking place in our country, Mr. Chair, because of the legislation that we currently have under the law, some lawyers, as mentioned earlier, use the legislation and abuse the legislation under current ADA to the disadvantage of the disabled to make a profit for themselves. And here is the way it works, Mr. Chair. A litigant, a plaintiff, will send a letter or sometimes file a lawsuit against a small business. We are not talking about the big businesses—we are talking about small momandpop stores—and telling them they have an ADA violation. The letter—the lawsuit—may not even state what the violation is. And the letter says: ‘‘You pay or we will continue the lawsuit.’’ These businesses don’t have the money to hire a lawyer to represent them, so what do they do? They pay the $3,000, $5,000, the extortion, so that those lawsuits are dismissed. The problem that may be alleged in that lawsuit is never required to be fixed for two reasons: one, the lawsuit doesn’t require it; and second, these lawsuits may not state what the problem is. So, if the goal of the ADA is to make businesses comply, these serial plaintiffs that are filing multiple lawsuits still don’t require that the businesses, even if they get the money, have to comply with the alleged violation. This is happening throughout the United States. Let me mention just a few of these. In Florida, a plaintiff named Howard Cohan filed 529 of these lawsuits; California, a person named Vogel filed 124; Pennsylvania, a plaintiff named Mielo brought 21 lawsuits; and even in New York, a plaintiff named Hirsch brought 24 lawsuits. What are they doing? These plaintiffs may not even live in the State where the violation is supposed to occur. These plaintiffs may not even be disabled themselves, but they will file the lawsuit against these businesses, sometimes using Google Maps to find a violation in the parking lot, send a letter from a law firm saying, ‘‘You comply with paying us, or this lawsuit’’—or paying us this shakedown is what it amounts to—‘‘or we will continue the lawsuit,’’ and many businesses file or pay the extortion. It has become a profit industry. It doesn’t help the disabled. Contrary to what the other side has said, these lawsuits do not help the disabled. In fact, I think these lawsuits are being filed on behalf of serial plaintiffs who want nothing else except to receive extortion money. Before my time is completed, I want to mention some of the Federal judges. One Federal judge from New York has taken notice of these cases. The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Chair, Federal judges have said that there are issues with these driveby lawsuits. Judge Brian Cogan of the Eastern District of New York, in 2016, in his decision, said that these cases, ‘‘are brought against small bars and grills, restaurants, or bodegas or occasionally corner grocery stores (and sometimes their landlords), which are likely ill equipped financially to vigorously defend these violations, and it is to intimidate businesses to settle before the trial takes place.’’ I have parents that are in their 90s. I am concerned about access for all disabled people, and the thought that this bill makes it worse for the disabled is wrong. This bill makes businesses comply and puts them on notice. If they don’t comply within the time period, then file the lawsuit, go after them, but businesses should be able to have the notice of what the problem is so that they can fix it, which is the goal of the ADA: to make businesses comply. And that is just the way it is. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT). Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding. H.R. 620, the socalled ADA Education and Reform Act of 2017, is an attack on the civil rights of Americans with disabilities. The Americans with Disabilities Act, or the ADA, is a civil rights law passed in 1990 to protect people with disabilities from discrimination in all aspects of society. I recognize that the ADA falls within the committee jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee, and I am here as the ranking member of the Committee on Education and the Workforce because, if H.R. 620 were to become law, it would have a profound effect on students and workers with disabilities who are trying to learn, work, or just generally access their community. Mr. Chair, prior to the ADA, people with disabilities had no recourse if they faced discrimination in employment, housing, transportation, health services, or when accessing public schools. The ADA is nearly 28 years old, and yet we still have continued gross noncompliance with the law. H.R. 620 specifically targets title III of the ADA regarding access to public accommodations. Title III prohibits discrimination in public accommodations such as restaurants, shopping malls, and hotels. By adding a notice and cure requirement, H.R. 620 shifts the compliance burden to the victims of discrimination. H.R. 620 effectively provides that discrimination against people with disabilities can continue until somebody hires a lawyer to file a legal complaint of discrimination. Then the bill allows 6 more months to achieve some undefined substantial progress. So even when people know they are out of compliance with the ADA, they don’t have to do anything under the bill until somebody files a formal legal complaint. Mr. Chair, this bill does not help people with disabilities. This is an attack 
on civil rights. That is why the disability community and civil rights communities are unanimously opposed to H.R. 620. There are 236 organizations that joined a letter, led by the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities, opposing the bill. More than 500 national and State organizations signed a letter, led by the National Council on Independent Living, urging Congress to reject the bill. More than 200 organizations signed a letter, led by The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, urging Congress to reject the bill. The ADA was enacted to eliminate barriers of discrimination against people with disabilities. And so I strongly urge each of my colleagues to stand with people with disabilities: protect civil rights by voting ‘‘no’’ on this bill. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chair, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. PETERS ), the primary cosponsor of this legislation. Mr. PETERS. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the chairman for yielding. One thing I want to agree with Mr. NADLER on is his comments about the tragedy yesterday in Florida. I completely endorse those comments with respect to that tragic event. I do rise today in support of H.R. 620, the ADA Education and Reform Act. Today, as Members have heard, the ADA is being abused by a few bad actors who are serving their own personal interest, financial interest, not fighting for the disabled. They file lawsuits and immediately settle them for a few thousand dollars without actually requiring that anything be fixed. Nobody says this abuse is not happening. Nobody says this advances the cause of access. A small restaurant owner in downtown San Diego tells a typical story. It was sued by an attorney who had filed 50 ADA suits against restaurants in San Diego County in 1 year. The barriers claimed in that suit didn’t exist. The tables were at ADA compliant height, the bathroom was accessible, there was access between tables, but the property owner’s attorney told him it could cost him upwards of $50,000 to prove it in court, so they settled with the plaintiff for $2,500. The serial litigant got the quick payoff he wanted although there were no violations that had to be fixed, and if there were violations, it wouldn’t have required that they be fixed. We hear stories all the time of lawsuits settled without any barriers being fixed. Now, some State governments have acted to curb this abuse. And do you know who has led the fight against the abuse of disability laws? California Democrats. In 2016, Governor Jerry Brown signed S. 269, authored by a Democratic State senator and passed by a majority Democratic legislature. It gives businesses 120 days to correct violations claimed by a plaintiff. It is a bipartisan solution that educates businessowners on compliance, redirects payouts to settle claims away from lawyers and toward actually improving access, and it protects against these cookiecutter lawsuits filed by serial plaintiffs. Now, let me address some of the issues that have been raised today. We are trying to provide the same kind of correction at the Federal level. First, this bill doesn’t turn anyone into a secondclass citizen by requiring notice and an opportunity to cure. The concept of notice and cure is not new to private rights of action. In fact, it is very common. Under the Clean Water Act in which I practice, if a complainant has to notify violators of a violation, the violator has 60 days to fix the problem before he can file a private right of action. And in civil rights laws, too, as has been said, notice and opportunity to cure is common. Before you can file a lawsuit for a hostile workplace environment, for instance, you have to file a claim and give the employer the chance to fix it. And the same is true, quite ironically, for disability. If you want to file a notice on reasonable accommodation, you have to give the opportunity to fix it. Today, we are asking that businessowners be given the same chance to fix problems that we currently give employers. Second, the bill does not hold harmless public accommodations. Under H.R. 620, public accommodations are still responsible for ensuring access under threat of litigation. If a property owner fails timely and adequately to respond to a notice, she is subject to the same remedies that exist today. Third, a notice and cure period does not shift the burden of compliance from businesses to victims. Today, if a public accommodation is out of compliance with the ADA, a plaintiff—a real plaintiff who had a problem with it— would have to file a lawsuit to force compliance. Under H.R. 620, a plaintiff would be able to file a notice that starts the timeline to fix the problems that exist. That doesn’t shift the burden. And finally, H.R. 620 does not weaken the rights of the disabled. On the contrary, it facilitates the removal of barriers to ensure better access for the disabled within a short period of time, discouraging the quick payoffs that do nothing for access. b0945 No one solution proposed by Congress is ever perfect. I have worked with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to find amendments and changes to the law to make the timeline for fixes tighter and to tighten the definitions of compliance. In fact, many of the defects that are noticed by Mr. NADLER , I believe, will be addressed by amendments today. The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from California. Mr. PETERS. Specifically, we will have a provision for plain language notice, which I think is an improvement: 120day clarification instead of 180 days, and a better definition of what substantial progress means. I think we can continue to improve the bill, and I hope to work with my colleagues and the Senate to do that. But in the face of undisputed abuse of one of our Nation’s civil rights laws for personal gain, I am certain that doing nothing is the worst response. Mr. Chairman, I urge support of this bill. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from New York for yielding. Mr. Chairman, because we are talking about need this morning, having seen Mr. DEUTCH in Florida, let me offer my deepest sympathy for the tragic loss of our children. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to be able to speak for many of those who cannot be on the floor today, and that is the millions of disabled Americans; and to be able to say that with all of the consternation and the uncomfortableness of some of the very important people in America: small businesses, the engine of our economy. I have to stand and speak for the value of civil rights and the civil rights of Americans with disabilities who waited for centuries to not be looked upon in distaste and disgust. I remember preceding the passage of the American with Disabilities Act. George H.W. Bush is a Texan, and I see often his passion for passing that bill. There are 57 million Americans with disabilities. That translates to 1 in 5 Americans. There are 31 million Americans with physical disabilities. I heard some of their comments: ‘‘As an older woman with disabilities, I feel invisible.’’ Or ‘‘I am not living; I am just existing.’’ The ‘‘notice and cure’’ framework included in this bill would fundamentally change the structure of the ADA’s public accommodations title and remove any reasons for business to comply proactively with the law. The same as the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that we now suffer because we gutted section 4 and section 5, and we have voter suppression, and people are not having their civil rights in terms of voting. You touch this in a way that you undermine the very existence of people living with disabilities. I am outraged, even though I am empathetic. But if it is a problem of lawyers, State bars can regulate them and State courts can regulate them. You can punish or sanction lawyers who do not have the proper protocols. Mr. Chairman, this is wrongheaded. I ask my colleagues to stand for civil rights for Americans with disabilities. This is not just an amendment. It is undermining the civil rights of those 
who are living with disabilities. They have a right to live. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to H.R. 620, the ‘‘ADA Education and Reform Act,’’ legislation that would infringe on important civil rights of Americans who live with physical disabilities. I am deeply troubled that the House of Representatives is taking up H.R. 620, legislation that would remove any incentive businesses currently have to comply with this longstanding civil rights law and undermining protections that allow millions to live independently and in the dignified manner they deserve. There are about 57 million Americans with disabilities; that number translates to 1 in 5 Americans. There are 31 million Americans with physical disabilities who use a wheelchair, cane, crutches, or a walker. And for that I commend former President George H. W. Bush, along with many members of Congress, for their leadership in passing the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, legislation that made our country’s public spaces more accessible to those with disabilities. H.R. 620 would require disabled persons to notify businesses of a violation of the ADA’s public accommodation provisions contained in title III of the act, and wait up to 180 days to remedy that alleged violation before a lawsuit could be filed, presenting a direct undermining of the civil rights of Americans with disabilities. The ‘‘notice and cure’’ framework included in this bill would fundamentally change the structure of the ADA’s public accommodations title and remove any reasons for business to comply proactively with the law. H.R. 620’s notice and cure provisions will have the effect of inappropriately shifting the burden of enforcing compliance with a federal civil rights statute from the alleged wrongdoer onto the discrimination victim. Moreover, it would undermine the carefully calibrated voluntary compliance regime that is one of the hallmarks of the ADA, a regime formed through negotiations between the disability rights community and the business community when the ADA was being drafted 28 years ago. H.R. 620 would, instead, perversely incentivize a public accommodation to not comply with the ADA unless and until it receives a notice of a violation pursuant to H.R. 620’s notice provision. Finally, the bill does nothing to address the problem that its proponents seek to address, which is the purported concern with the filing of meritless lawsuits by certain plaintiffs’ attorneys, a problem (to the extent that it is actually a problem) that is one of state law, not the federal ADA. This is not the first time in this Congress, or even this year, that I witness the Republicans, allegedly a party for state’s rights, completely undermine the established idea that tort law should be left for states to legislate without interference from federal mandates. H.R. 620’s proponents have never adequately articulated why federal law must be amended to address a problem driven by state law. Also, the bill makes no attempt to distinguish between meritorious and nonmeritorious lawsuits and would, instead, impose its harmful and unnecessary requirements on all ADA claims, regardless of potential merit. I remain adamantly opposed to any effort to weaken the ability of individuals to enforce their rights under federal civil rights laws and I am concerned that H.R. 620 would undermine the key enforcement mechanism of the ADA and other civil rights laws, namely, the ability to file private lawsuits to enforce rights. Joining me and my colleagues in opposition is a broad coalition of 236 disability rights groups, including: American Foundation for the Blind, the Bazelon Center for Mental Health, the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation, the National Council on Independent Living, the National Disability Rights Network, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, Vietnam Veterans of America, the AFL–CIO, the AntiDefamation League, Human Rights Campaign, the NAACP, and the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. Additionally, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights opposes the bill because it would ‘‘remove incentives for businesses to comply with the law unless and until people with disabilities are denied access’’ which ‘‘would lead to the continued exclusion of people with disabilities from the mainstream of society and would turn back the clock on disability rights in America.’’ Likewise, the American Civil Liberties Union opposes H.R. 620 because it would ‘‘fundamentally alter [the] way in which a person with a disability enforces their civil rights and would severely limit access to places of public accommodations.’’ For the foregoing reasons and those discussed below, we strongly oppose H.R. 620 and respectfully dissent from the Committee report. While it is very important to protect small and growing businesses, we can do so without jeopardizing the rights of disabled individuals to have a day in court. I do not believe that we have crossed the T’s and dotted the I’s with all the information that we should have in trying to improve our situation and address the concerns of many small businesses. Small businesses are the heartbeat of America and the backbone of successful communities, which is why I have served as one of their strongest advocates during my tenure in Congress. But the reality is that H.R. 620 does not help small businesses, it only hurts the disabled. I do, however, hope that we can achieve this balanced goal through a different avenue. So today I stand with Ranking Member NADLER, Congressman L ANGEVIN and all those who stand for civil rights and for the rights of Americans with disabilities. For these reasons I oppose H.R. 620. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time is remaining on each side? The CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia has 13 minutes remaining. The gentleman from New York has 17
1⁄2 minutes remaining. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1
1⁄2minutes to respond to the gentlewoman from Texas. Opponents of this bill claim it will delay access in some cases, even if just by a few months. But under current law, unscrupulous lawyers already delay filing ADA complaints for months after alleged violations are discovered, simply to boost their claim for attorneys’ fees based on hours worked. Here is an affidavit from a former ADA lawyer showing his firm fraudulently and routinely waited months to alert businessowners of potential violations and file lawsuits so they could falsely claim many hours of work preparing the case when no such work was required. Here is what the lawyer testified to: The alleged time entries at issue in this case include authorizing discovery 6 months in advance of the case being filed. I told Mr. Lopez, the real person in charge, this practice was useless. Mr. Lopez’s response was that increasing legal fees was what I was supposed to do. 
This means that, today, there are months of unnecessary delays before the businessowner is even notified of a violation so they can begin working on fixing the problem. That is an additional delay of months that this bill will eliminate. The bottom line is that, in ADA cases, lawyers routinely delay filing lawsuits to boost their fees. This bill will stop that practice and let that time and money be used instead to increase access, not pad the pockets of unethical lawyers. This bill will provide access months sooner than under current law. This is a procivil rights bill, and I urge my colleagues to support it. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. GOODLATTE. I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, first of all, the American Bar Association supports this legislation. Secondarily, the gentleman is talking about lawyers, not the disabled. Let the State bars and let the State courts regulate these lawyers. Sanction them, just like we have sanctions in the Federal court system. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, they oppose our bill to increase sanctions on unethical lawyers. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN ). Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Chairman, one of our great Republican Presidents, Abraham Lincoln, who served in this body, spoke of government of the people, by the people, and for the people. We didn’t start out that way, but through civil rights movements and civil rights statutes, we have opened America up. The Americans with Disabilities Act has been a crucial piece of legislation to opening America up—our restaurants, our hotels, all of our business establishments—to tens of millions of Americans who otherwise couldn’t fully participate fully and on an equal basis. 
This bill would require a totally novel requirement in the civil rights field, that in order to sue for violations of public accommodations law under the ADA, the person must first notify the business of their alleged violations and then wait 180 days to allow the business to remedy the violation, or make substantial progress towards compliance. No other Federal civil rights law operates this way. They just don’t work like that. The ADA has been in process for 27 years, and there is no reason that any business today should be out of compliance with a very clear directive under the ADA. The new notice and cure provisions will have the effect of shifting the burden of enforcement from the wrongdoer to the victim of discrimination. It would incentivize businesses not to comply with the ADA, unless it receives a notice of violation. Now, our colleagues raised questions of overzealous, or vexatious, or abusive litigation by certain lawyers, and we know that there are cases of that. They are in the handful of States that have added damages under the ADA. Understand that, under the ADA, federally, there are no damages. You can just get your costs and your legal fees. So some States have added damages. Then there are some lawyers who are out making trouble. We agree with that. Use the State bars to sanction them. If there is sanctionable behavior, disbar them. Deal with that problem. But don’t cut the heart out of the Americans with Disabilities Act, which has been central to the ability of our people and all of our families to participate on an equal basis in our economy and in our society. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, it is my pleasure to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. WOODALL ). Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman of the committee for yielding. Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from Maryland just said that, after decades, the ADA was well understood and the law was easy to comply with. In many cases, that may be true, but technology has been advancing so quickly that there are areas where the ADA is not clear today, and we are in need of guidance. Mr. Chairman, in the great State of Georgia, scores of businesses have received demand letters for their websites, that their websites should be considered public accommodations; and demand letters to say those websites do not comply with the ADA, when these businesses do not know how to make their websites comply with the ADA. Fifty credit unions alone, Mr. Chairman—folks who are in the business of serving our communities—have received these demand letters, unable to respond. Mr. Chairman, I would like to enter into a colloquy with the gentleman from Texas (Mr. POE), if he would be willing, and ask if he is aware of the issues created by this emergence of technology and the predatory litigation that credit unions, community banks, and other small momandpop businesses are facing. Mr. POE of Texas. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. WOODALL. I yield to the gentleman from Texas. Mr. POE of Texas. Yes, the gentleman from Georgia is absolutely correct, I am aware of this matter. Also, I am aware that the gentleman joined Chairman GOODLATTE and about 60 Members of this Chamber last year to urge the Justice Department to finalize a regulation in this area with the intent of providing certainty. Even still, it is not clear that there is a statutory obligation under the ADA for the Department of Justice to act, which is why H.R. 620 doesn’t address that issue specifically. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for his guidance. Of course, there was no opportunity for the ADA to anticipate the internet, to anticipate websites. So it is unclear whether or not Congress intended for websites to fall inside the public accommodations statute. Because of this ambiguity, though, all of the small businesses—everyone with a website presence, Mr. Chairman—are unclear about whether or not they are violating the law. They don’t even have a framework of guidance so that they could comply with the laws that I know each and every one of these credit unions, community banks, and small businesses wants to do. Mr. Chairman, I would ask the gentleman from Texas (Mr. POE) if he would be willing to commit to working with me to encourage the Justice Department to move forward with some guidance in this area so that we could provide certainty not just to credit unions and not just to community banks, but to all of these small businesses looking to do their very best to comply with the ADA? Mr. POE of Texas. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. WOODALL. I yield to the gentleman from Texas. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Chairman, as the gentleman is aware, this legislation makes it better for the disabled to have access under the notice and cure requirement. The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from Georgia. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Texas. Mr. POE of Texas. The Judiciary Committee will continue to work with the Department of Justice and stakeholders on this. In fact, for jurisdictions where courts have held the ADA does apply to websites, we believe protections in H.R. 620 will be applicable as well. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Chairman, these are small businesses that want to do their very best to comply with the ADA. With guidance, they will be successful in that effort. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Delaware (Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER ). Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER. Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend, Mr. NADLER , for yielding and for his leadership on this issue. Mr. Chairman, as a former Delaware Secretary of Labor, I rise today to strongly oppose H.R. 620, the ADA Education and Reform Act of 2017. This bill on the floor today would roll back the clock on civil rights for people with disabilities. Twentyseven years ago, Congress passed the transformative Americans with Disabilities Act, which prohibited discrimination against people with disabilities and mandated that they have an equal opportunity to participate in society. Before the ADA, a person with a disability could be barred from a meaningful career, education, and, really, to live a fulfilling life. Mr. Chairman, some claim that the ADA exposes businesses to exorbitant costs or damage awards, but this is not the norm. It is one of the myths that has perpetuated. According to the Department of Labor, 57 percent of accommodations cost nothing at all, while the rest typically cost only $500. So once you peel back the myths surrounding the ADA, we are left with one simple question: Why not comply? The monetary cost is typically minimal in comparison to the value of providing qualified Americans with a job or a shot at the American Dream; or giving an individual with a disability the means to go to the grocery store, pick up their children from childcare, or travel, or work. That is why these standards are so essential. They ensure real, fair, and equal access for everyone. People with disabilities simply want to live an independent life, free from discrimination. This bill rolls back that progress. I will be voting against this bill, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY ). b1000 Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 620, which would violate the 28yearold Americans with Disabilities Act by allowing public places to bar access to people with disabilities. H.R. 620 would actually allow barriers for the disabled to stay in place as long as ‘‘substantial progress’’ is made to remove them, whatever that means. The ADA was a compromise, giving the disability community access and helping businesses to comply by giving them tax credits and training. H.R. 620 undoes that compromise, making it virtually impossible to enforce the 
ADA’s goal of fairness and inclusion; and that is why the AARP, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, the National Council on Independent Living, and the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities oppose this bill. It is why the National Organization of Nurses with Disabilities ‘‘believes that H.R. 620 represents a downward spiral of the Americans With Disabilities Act and will impact people with disabilities’ freedom of access . . . across the United States.’’ And it is why 55 Illinois—where I am from—disability groups, led by Access Living, whose president, Marca Bristo, my personal hero, helped enact the Americans with Disabilities Act, she says and they say: ‘‘H.R. 620 . . . would fundamentally harm our Nation’s progress toward an accessible and integrated society. The bill telegraphs to individuals with disabilities that . . . their inclusion is not important.’’ Let’s show people with disabilities that they do matter, that they shouldn’t be locked out of restaurants or sporting events or job opportunities, that they should not be treated as secondclass citizens in the American civil justice system. Show your commitment to the ADA and to civil rights, and vote ‘‘no.’’ Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I include in the RECORD the affidavit that I cited in my earlier remarks. 
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT SOUTHERN  DISTRICT OF FLORIDA  Case No. 1:17–cv–24116–KMM Enrique Madrinan, Plaintiff, v. Harbour Shopping Center, Inc. and Luza Corp. d/b/a Donut Gallery Diner, Defendants. 
DEFENDANT LUZA CORP .’S NOTICE OF FILING AF FIDAVIT IN RELATION TO DOCKET ENTRY THIR TYTHREE , PLAINTIFF ’S REPLY TO DEFEND ANTS RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFF ’S MOTION TO  
DISQUALIFY COUNSEL AND LAW FIRM REP RESENTING DEFENDANT LUZA CORP ., D/B/A 
DONUT GALLERY DINER  7. Notably, the alleged time entries at issue in this case, include authoring discovery six months in advance of the case being filed. Because most cases settled upon filing, and Federal Disability Advocates wanted to bill hours before they settled, they had their offsite team who handled the pre filing, filing, and service, serve discovery with the Complaint. I repetitively told Mr. Lopez, the real person in charge of Federal Disability Advocates, this practice was useless because a party cannot propound discovery until after the scheduling conference. I even argued that it was counterproductive because it led to a debate over when, and if, discovery was served, which unnecessarily increased legal fees. Mr. Lopez’s response was that increasing legal fees was what I was supposed to do, and that serving discovery with the complaint was part of how to get to ten hours prefiling. 
Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER ), the minority whip and one of the original authors of the ADA in 1990. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this legislation. In 1990, President George H.W. Bush declared a long overdue ‘‘independence day’’ for people with disabilities as he signed the historic Americans with Disabilities Act into law. As the House sponsor of the ADA, I shared the President’s optimism and hope that every man, woman, and child with a disability can now pass through once closed doors into a bright new era of equality, independence, and freedom. I was proud to work across the aisle on the ADA and on the ADA Amendments Act of 2008, the only time the ADA has ever been amended. We brought together outside groups from a broad range of affiliations to create a framework for policy that would vastly improve accessibility and be agreeable to all. Unfortunately, people with disabilities still face stubborn barriers to full inclusion. In the last year, people with differing abilities have had to fight for access to healthcare and the services they need to live independently and with dignity. Now we have on the floor a bill that would undermine the central tenet of the ADA: the right of victims of discrimination to seek redress for exclusion. Requiring victims of discrimination to provide notice of a violation before bringing a lawsuit is an improper shift of the burden of compliance onto victims, one not required of any other group by any other civil rights law. Not a single civil rights law gives this kind of provision. As the Paralyzed Veterans of America wrote in its letter of opposition: ‘‘Veterans with disabilities who honorably served their country should not bear the burden of ensuring that businesses in their communities are meeting their ADA obligations. Instead, it is the responsibility of businessowners and their associations to educate themselves about the law’s requirements.’’ Now, this law was passed some 27 years ago. There is no excuse for not knowing the obligations. Our laws do not require such notice for women, African Americans, Latinos, religious minorities, or any other groups protected against discrimination. I acknowledge that there are issues in States that have added compensatory damages to their State laws. There are no damages in this national ADA law, which was a compromise. A problem with State law, however, should be fixed at the State level and not with a retreat in the Federal law. Lawyers who file vexatious suits may well be in violation of their ethical obligations. Sadly, we are seeing that almost 28 years after its passage and decades of notice as to what is required, tax credits so that you can make changes necessary to make your place accessible, there are still those who have barriers to full accommodation for Americans with differing abilities, contrary to law. In fact, when we adopted the law, we didn’t have it go into effect for 24 months—2 years—so that people could educate themselves on their responsibilities. People with differing abilities still have to fight day in and day out for the access and inclusion to which they should already be entitled under the law as businesses continue to dismiss their obligations. We have a colleague, Senator TAMMY  DUCKWORTH . She was a helicopter pilot. Her legs were shot off. She now serves in the United States Senate. She is a disabled veteran and an American hero. She wrote the following in The Washington Post about this bill: ‘‘This offensive legislation would segregate the disability community, making it the only protected class under civil rights law that must rely on ‘education’— rather than strong enforcement—to guarantee access to public spaces.’’ I will be voting ‘‘no’’ on this legislation in the name of upholding the bedrock principles of civil rights law in this country and the integrity of the ADA that many of us worked together to enact on a bipartisan basis, an overwhelmingly bipartisan basis, 400 votes plus, for this legislation. Let us not retreat this day. Let us not say to those with disabilities: You have got to wait 180 days. What if we said: If you are an African American and you try to go into a place of public accommodations and they wouldn’t admit you, and you said, ‘‘Well, I have got a complaint,’’ and you had to wait 180 days to have that right redressed, that is not right. Let us not treat those with disabilities as secondrate citizens. Defeat this bill. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume to respond to the gentleman from Maryland. The technical requirements of title III are constantly changing. We have seen numerous revisions to both regulations and guidance, not to mention the resulting case law that affects its interpretation; therefore, the regulatory requirements of the ADA in 1991 are not the same as those today. There is no better example of these changes than the rise of the internet, which came into its current existence after the ADA was enacted. As people no longer need a physical storefront to have a business, the courts have struggled to apply the ADA’s public accommodation requirements. There is, for example, a current circuit split as to whether companies operating exclusively online are subject to these requirements. And with continued advancements in technology, we will continue to see changes to the regulatory requirements. It is perfectly reasonable for small business owners, many of whom are disabled themselves or of minorities, to have the opportunity to fix a problem before a predatory lawyer simply brings an action for the purpose of recovering—not fixing the problem, but getting money that could have been better spent by that small business fixing the problem. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute. Mr. Chairman, 28 years after the ADA’s passage, too many businesses remain inaccessible to persons with disabilities. The last thing Congress should be doing is undermining the civil rights of a discrete and insular minority group by making it virtually impossible to enforce their rights in court. That is why more than 230 disability rights groups, civil rights groups, labor unions, and veterans organizations strongly oppose H.R. 620, including the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, the AARP, the NAACP, Human Rights Campaign, the AFL– CIO, AFSCME, the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, the United Spinal Association, the National Federation of the Blind, and the National Disability Rights Network. I urge the House to abide by these groups’ concerns with H.R. 620 and reject this deeply problematic legislation. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I have no speakers remaining other than myself and I am prepared to close. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. LANGEVIN ). Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 620, the ADA Education and Reform Act. This misguided piece of legislation is being sold to my colleagues and the American public as a measure that will help people with disabilities, help businesses come into compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, and help reduce driveby lawsuits in States that have gone beyond the ADA to allow for monetary awards. In actuality, H.R. 620 doesn’t accomplish any of these objectives. What is worse, if passed, this illconsidered bill will not only decimate the protections that people with disabilities rely on, it will turn back the clock to a more segregated society, and it will unravel the core promise of the ADA that a disability, visible or otherwise, can never be grounds to justify or tolerate discrimination. Mr. Chairman, I am angry. I am frustrated. I am insulted. But more than anything, I am disappointed. Further, neither Mr. PETERS nor Mr. P OEever even approached me to sit down and have a discussion about this bill, to try to find some common ground to try to actually fix the problem if it is about driveby lawsuits. Has the Congress really become so divorced from the human experience of the disability community that we are willing to sacrifice their rights because it is easier than targeting the root of the problem? Are people with disabilities, people like me, so easily disregarded? I am here to say enough is enough. Mr. Chairman, whether someone is born with a disability, develops a disability, or becomes disabled due to an accident or from having served in our Armed Forces, the fundamental truth is that it happened by chance, certainly not by choice. As the first quadriplegic elected to the United States Congress, I overcame many obstacles to sit beside you as a Member of this Chamber, but I would never have had the opportunities that I cherish today without the tireless efforts of those who came before me to fight for the rights of people with disabilities. Mr. Chairman, I was injured in 1980, at just 16 years of age, a full 10 years before the passage of the ADA, and I certainly remember what life was like before the ADA became law. I remember that I couldn’t go inside a public building that didn’t have a ramp, couldn’t travel without accessible transportation, and was excluded from gatherings in restaurants and libraries, movie theaters and sports venues that couldn’t accommodate a wheelchair. I struggled to wash my hands at a sink, access a restroom, and enter a classroom. I even declined matriculation at my firstchoice college because the challenge of getting around the campus would have been too difficult, if not impossible. Mr. Chairman, the ADA brought more than just the recognition that disability rights are civil rights. It brought hope and opportunity to millions of people, and it brought dignity. b1015 Mr. Chairman, after all, having a disability should not limit opportunity, and it is with opportunity that people with disabilities can lead more active, productive, and independent lives. The ADA was passed nearly 28 years ago, and instead of holding people accountable to correctly implement the law, especially when free resources and technical information are readily available, H.R. 620 weakens Federal protections under the ADA, protections that prohibit discrimination on the basis of a disability. The ADA does not allow people to sue for compensatory or punitive damages, only injunctive relief. Yet some States have gone beyond the Federal law to permit monetary awards. H.R. 620 seeks to address the issue by including a notice and cure period. Well, the idea that places of public accommodation should receive a free pass for 6 months before correctly implementing a law that has been a part of our legal framework for nearly three decades creates an obvious disincentive for ADA compliance. People with disabilities, Mr. Chairman, still face immeasurable obstacles, despite the progress of our great Nation since the passage of the ADA. This past year, the disability community has had to fight to preserve access to healthcare, the longterm services and supports that are a lifeline for so many under Medicaid, and the ability to maintain certain protections and credits under the Tax Code. Mr. Chairman, they are tired, and I am tired, of defending against efforts to weaken our rights. I urge my colleagues to see past the smoke and mirrors and irresponsible claims that H.R. 620 is anything but an appalling effort to strip away the civil rights of a protected class of Americans. Mr. Chairman, every vote in support of H.R. 620 will be a message to people with disabilities that we are not worthy of inclusion, acceptance, or deserve the same civil rights protections as others. Mr. Chairman, as Members of Congress, Americans with disabilities look upon us to defend their rights. Let us not vote to eliminate them. Let us make them proud and reject H.R. 620. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time I have remaining. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia has 6 minutes remaining. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Chairman, the House Judiciary Committee, over decades, has heard testimony from many disabled owners of businesses, several of whom have testified before the committee who themselves have been extorted by trial lawyers to pay thousands of dollars to lawyers. That money could have been spent on making small adjustments to the premises to easily overlooked technical violations. Let me give you an example. Take the testimony of Donna Batelaan, who owned a store for the disabled, and herself used a wheelchair. It was a store devoted entirely to selling accessibility devices and similar items. She was made to pay $2,000 in attorneys’ fees for a simple fix that cost $100. Clearly, Mrs. Batelaan was deeply interested in accommodating the disabled, yet she, too, was caught up in a legal shakedown. She said the following before the House Judiciary Committee: ‘‘We have coowned a mobility equipment business in south Florida for the last 20 years. Our parking lot and our building are totally wheelchair accessible. We employ two people who use wheelchairs, and we ourselves use wheelchairs, and all of our customers have mobility limitation. We had not painted the lines and posted a sign on’’—just one of the—‘‘handicapped spot that is required by ADA. An attorney from New Jersey, without notice, filed a suit against us. It cost us less than $100 to correct the infractions and $2,000 for attorneys’ fees.’’ ‘‘The original intent of ADA was to provide access and opportunity to American life for all people with disabilities, not to give the legal profession an opportunity to make more money.’’ As Abraham Lincoln’s name was mentioned previously, I want to quote him on the subject of unnecessary and wasteful litigation. In his notes on a 
law lecture he delivered, here is what Abraham Lincoln had to say: ‘‘Discourage litigation. Point out to them how the nominal winner is often a real loser—in fees, expenses, and waste of time. As a peacemaker, the lawyer has a superior opportunity of being a good man. There will still be business enough.’’ And finally, to that same point, I have to say it is simply ethical practice for lawyers to give a business a headsup of a potential violation before a lawsuit is filed. There are many other examples in Federal law where that notice to the defendant to cure, including in civil rights actions, is afforded. It should be afforded here as well. Indeed, the vast majority of lawyers do what this bill requires as a matter of simple ethical lawyering. But many lawyers don’t act professionally, and they abuse the law to shake down businesses, taking money away from compliance and putting it into their own pockets. All this bill does is require those unscrupulous trial lawyers to do what ethical lawyers already do: give fair notice of a violation before thousands of dollars in attorneys’ fees are racked up against a small business, diverting money away from accessibility where it belongs. Mr. Chairman, this is the right correction addressing this problem. It will enhance accessibility, it will encourage more work to be done, and it will not deprive anybody the opportunity to notify people that they have a problem with accessibility at their business. If they don’t fix it, they will then be the subject of that very lawsuit. But the opportunity to fix it in a prompt fashion is, I think, critically important to making accessibility more available and helping small businesses in America to succeed, thrive, and create even more jobs for people with those disabilities. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. 620, the ADA Education and Reform Act of 2017. This is overdue legislation that will increase protections for individuals with disabilities while providing business and property owners the opportunity to remedy ADA infractions before unnecessary lawsuits and the costs that accompany litigation. Under the current ADA law, lawyers may collect fees when suing businesses or property owners, but plaintiffs cannot collect damages. The current system has created ‘‘driveby’’ demand letters sent by lawyers, like a bulk mailer, to every location on Main St. or at a small mall. In some cases it was not clear that the plaintiff had even attempted to access the property or had even gone inside. The emphasis was on filing the lawsuit and collecting fees without regard for increasing accessibility for the disabled. Sometimes the infractions are easily corrected: signage, soap dispenser heights. In my district in east San Diego County we have quaint, older towns that are notable for their historical structures dating back to the 1800s. These communities are proud of their heritage and these buildings are a source of local pride and tourism. In Julian, an old gold mining and apple growing town, the Julian Town Hall was threatened by a lawsuit. A public relations stunt was held there where someone crawled up the steps of the town hall, cameras rolling, despite the fact that a handicap accessible ramp was located on the side of the building. In Ramona, a predatory lawyer targeted every business on Main St. with various and frivolous claims. It is for these and other reasons I introduced similar legislation, H.R. 777, the ADA Notification Act of 2013. With the ‘‘notice and cure’’ provision in H.R. 620, driveby lawsuits will be eliminated, business will have an opportunity to remedy any deficiency, and there will be increased compliance and correction because property and business owners cannot defer the corrections. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the rule which makes in order H.R. 620, the ‘‘ADA Education and Reform Act,’’ legislation that would infringe on important civil rights of Americans who live with physical disabilities. I am deeply troubled that the House of Representatives is taking up H.R. 620, legislation that would remove any incentive businesses currently have to comply with this longstanding civil rights law and undermining protections that allow millions to live independently and in the dignified manner they deserve. There are about 57 million Americans with disabilities; that number translates to 1 in 5 Americans. There are 31 million Americans with physical disabilities who use a wheelchair, cane, crutches, or a walker. And for that I commend former President George H.W. Bush, along with many members of Congress, for their leadership in passing the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, legislation that made our country’s public spaces more accessible to those with disabilities. H.R. 620 would require disabled persons to notify businesses of a violation of the ADA’s public accommodation provisions contained in title III of the act, and wait up to 180 days to remedy that alleged violation before a lawsuit could be filed, presenting a direct undermining of the civil rights of Americans with disabilities. The ‘‘notice and cure’’ framework included in this bill would fundamentally change the structure of the ADA’s public accommodations title and remove any reasons for business to comply proactively with the law. H.R. 620’s notice and cure provisions will have the effect of inappropriately shifting the burden of enforcing compliance with a federal civil rights statute from the alleged wrongdoer onto the discrimination victim. Moreover, it would undermine the carefully calibrated voluntary compliance regime that is one of the hallmarks of the ADA, a regime formed through negotiations between the disability rights community and the business community when the. ADA was being drafted 28 years ago. H.R. 620 would, instead, perversely incentivize a public accommodation to not comply with the ADA unless and until it receives a notice of a violation pursuant to H.R. 620’s notice provision. Finally, the bill does nothing to address the problem that its proponents seek to address, which is the purported concern with the filing of meritless lawsuits by certain plaintiffs’ attorneys, a problem (to the extent that it is actually a problem) that is one of state law, not the federal ADA. This is not the first time in this Congress, or even this year, that I witness the Republicans, allegedly a party for state’s rights, completely undermine the established idea that tort law should be left for states to legislate without interference from federal mandates. H.R. 620’s proponents have never adequately articulated why federal law must be amended to address a problem driven by state law. Also, the bill makes no attempt to distinguish between meritorious and nonmeritorious lawsuits and would, instead, impose its harmful and unnecessary requirements on all ADA claims, regardless of potential merit. I remain adamantly opposed to any effort to weaken the ability of individuals to enforce their rights under federal civil rights laws and I am concerned that H.R. 620 would undermine the key enforcement mechanism of the ADA and other civil rights laws, namely, the ability to file private lawsuits to enforce rights. Joining me and my colleagues in opposition is a broad coalition of 236 disability rights groups, including: American Foundation for the Blind, the Bazelon Center for Mental Health, the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation, the National Council on Independent Living, the National Disability Rights Network, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, Vietnam Veterans of America, the AFLCIO, the AntiDefamation League, Human Rights Campaign, the NAACP, and the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. Additionally, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights opposes the bill because it would ‘‘remove incentives for businesses to comply with the law unless and until people with disabilities are denied access’’ which ‘‘would lead to the continued exclusion of people with disabilities from the mainstream of society and would turn back the clock on disability rights in America.’’ Likewise, the American Civil Liberties Union opposes H.R. 620 because it would ‘‘fundamentally alter [the] way in which a person with a disability enforces their civil rights and would severely limit access to places of public accommodations.’’ For the foregoing reasons and those discussed below, we strongly oppose H.R. 620 and respectfully dissent from the Committee report. While it is very important to protect small and growing businesses, we can do so without jeopardizing the rights of disabled individuals to have a day in court. I do not believe that we have crossed the T’s and dotted the I’s with all the information that we should have in trying to improve our situation and address the concerns of many small businesses. Small businesses are the heartbeat of America and the backbone of successful communities, which is why I have served as one of their strongest advocates during my tenure in Congress. But the reality is that H.R. 620 does not help small businesses, it only hurts the disabled. I do, however, hope that we can achieve this balanced goal through a different avenue. 
So today I stand with Ranking Member N ADLER, Congressman L ANGEVIN and all those who stand for civil rights and for the rights of Americans with disabilities. For these reasons I oppose the rule governing H.R. 620. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chair, when the Americans with Disabilities Act was first signed into law, President George H.W. Bush praised this bill for its assurance ‘‘that people with disabilities [were] given the basic guarantees for which they have worked so long and so hard: independence, freedom of choice, control of their lives, and the opportunity to blend fully and equally into the rich mosaic of the American mainstream.’’ His words were true when the ADA passed, and they are true today. H.R. 620 would reverse decades of progress. It would pave the way for businesses to delay or completely avoid complying with the ADA, and shift the onus on people with disabilities to report noncompliance. If this bill were signed into law, it would effectively hold harmless places of public accommodation for willfully failing to comply with the ADA. This legislation purports to curb ‘‘driveby’’ lawsuits, which can be a legitimate problem, but these suits have arisen predominantly in states that provide for recovery of money damages in their state laws. The federal ADA does not provide for damages, only injunctive relief and attorney’s fees. This would be a step backwards. We have a responsibility to protect these safeguards and ensure that people with disabilities are provided accessible accommodations. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise. The motion was agreed to. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. POE of Texas) having assumed the chair, Mr. SIMPSON , Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 620) to amend the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 to promote compliance through education, to clarify the requirements for demand letters, to provide for a notice and cure period before the commencement of a private civil action, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon. 
RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess for a period of less than 15 minutes. Accordingly (at 10 o’clock and 22 minutes a.m.), the House stood in recess. 
b1027 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. POEof Texas) at 10 o’clock and 27 minutes a.m. ADA EDUCATION AND REFORM ACT OF 2017 The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 736 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the further consideration of the bill, H.R. 620. Will the gentleman from Idaho (Mr. SIMPSON ) kindly resume the chair. b1028 
Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the further consideration of the bill (H.R. 620) to amend the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 to promote compliance through education, to clarify the requirements for demand letters, to provide for a notice and cure period before the commencement of a private civil action, and for other purposes, with Mr. SIMPSON in the chair. The CHAIR. When the Committee of the Whole rose earlier today, all time for general debate pursuant to House Resolution 736 had expired. Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment under the 5 minute rule, and shall be considered as read. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 620 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘ADA Education and Reform Act of 2017’’. 
Based on existing funding, the Disability Rights Section of the Department of Justice shall, in consultation with property owners and representatives of the disability rights community, develop a program to educate State and local governments and property owners on effective and efficient strategies for promoting access to public accommodations for persons with a disability (as defined in section 3 of the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. 12102)). Such program may include training for professionals such as Certified Access Specialists to provide a guidance of remediation for potential violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
Paragraph (1) of section 308(a) of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12188(a)(1)) is amended to read as follows: ‘‘(1) AVAILABILITY OF REMEDIES AND PROCE DURES .— ‘‘(A) IN GENERAL .—Subject to subparagraph (B), the remedies and procedures set forth in section 204(a) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000a–3(a)) are the remedies and procedures this title provides to any person who is being subjected to discrimination on the basis of disability in violation of this title or who has reasonable grounds for believing that such person is about to be subjected to discrimination in violation of section 303. Nothing in this section shall require a person with a disability to engage in a futile gesture if such person has actual notice that a person or organization covered by this title does not intend to comply with its provisions. ‘‘(B) BARRIERS TO ACCESS TO EXISTING PUB LIC ACCOMMODATIONS .—A civil action under section 302 or 303 based on the failure to remove an architectural barrier to access into an existing public accommodation may not be commenced by a person aggrieved by such failure unless— ‘‘(i) that person has provided to the owner or operator of the accommodation a written notice specific enough to allow such owner or operator to identify the barrier; and ‘‘(ii)(I) during the period beginning on the date the notice is received and ending 60 days after that date, the owner or operator fails to provide to that person a written description outlining improvements that will be made to remove the barrier; or ‘‘(II) if the owner or operator provides the written description under subclause (I), the owner or operator fails to remove the barrier or to make substantial progress in removing the barrier during the period beginning on the date the description is provided and ending 120 days after that date. ‘‘(C) SPECIFICATION OF DETAILS OF ALLEGED  
VIOLATION .—The written notice required under subparagraph (B) must also specify in detail the circumstances under which an individual was actually denied access to a public accommodation, including the address of property, the specific sections of the Americans with Disabilities Act alleged to have been violated, whether a request for assistance in removing an architectural barrier to access was made, and whether the barrier to access was a permanent or temporary barrier.’’. 
This Act and the amendments made by this Act take effect 30 days after the date of the enactment of this Act. 
SEC. 5. MEDIATION FOR ADA ACTIONS RELATED TO ARCHITECTURAL BARRIERS. 
The Judicial Conference of the United States shall, under rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or any other applicable law, in consultation with property owners and representatives of the disability rights community, develop a model program to promote the use of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, including a stay of discovery during mediation, to resolve claims of architectural barriers to access for public accommodations. To the extent practical, the Federal Judicial Center should provide a public comment period on any such proposal. The goal of the model program shall be to promote access quickly and efficiently without the need for costly litigation. The model program should include an expedited method for determining the relevant facts related to such barriers to access and steps taken before the commencement of litigation to resolve any issues related to access. 
The CHAIR. No amendment to the bill shall be in order except those printed in part A of House Report 115– 559. Each such amendment may be offered only in the order printed in the report, by a Member designated in the report, shall be considered read, shall be debatable for the time specified in the report, equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent, shall not be subject to amendment, and shall not be subject to a demand for division of the question. b1030 
AMENDMENT NO . 1 OFFERED BY MR . DENHAM  
The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 printed in part A of House Report 115–559. Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Chair, I rise to offer my amendment to H.R. 620. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. 
Page 3, line 7, strike ‘‘Based on existing funding’’ and insert the following: (a) INGENERAL .—Based on existing funding Page 3, insert after line 18 the following: (b) MATERIALS PROVIDED IN OTHER LANGUAGES .—The Disability Rights Section of the Department of Justice shall take appropriate actions, to the extent practicable, to make technical assistance publications relating to compliance with this Act and the amendments made by this Act available in all the languages commonly used by owners and operators of United States businesses. 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from California (Mr. DENHAM ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Chairman, my amendment would ensure that the Department of Justice takes appropriate actions to provide ADA compliance materials for businessowners whose primary language is not English. As a Representative from California’s Central Valley, my district is far too familiar with the kinds of abusive lawsuits H.R. 620 aims to curb. For years, small businesses—some that make less than $30,000 a year— have been targeted by ‘‘driveby’’ lawsuits from people who are driving by— many of whom are from outside of our State and, certainly, outside of our community. They have been slapped with demands for thousands, even tens of thousands, of dollars for minor infractions, like faded parking signs or outdated signage or stripes in the parking lot. More often than not, the lawyer or plaintiff didn’t even enter the business in the first place. In too many cases, these lawsuits did not lead to compliance. They led to shakedowns and shutdowns. Throughout California and, certainly, throughout California’s Central Valley, we have seen a number of minority businesses and businesses as a whole, small businesses, that have been shut down by many of these shakedown lawsuits where the attorney will call back and say: I understand that you can’t pay us today, but we will put you on a monthly plan. That doesn’t solve any problems for those with disabilities. It certainly doesn’t solve any problems for the businesses. All it does is line the pockets of some abusers that are coming into our area that will target dozens of businesses in a day’s or week’s time, only to leave our community without even going into these businesses. In my district alone, Barnwood Restaurant in Ripon was sued and shut down. Main Street Inn in Ripon was sued. Country Ford Trucks in Ceres was sued. The city hall in Escalon was sued. In Turlock, my hometown, seven businesses less than a mile apart on the same road were sued by the same plaintiff. Fortythree businesses in the city of Modesto were all sued by the same plaintiff. California has been ground zero for this lawsuit abuse. Even the State legislature in a State that is not considered conservative by any means has had a number of ADA lawsuit measures aimed at trying to curb those. The Federal Government has a job to fix this, and that is one of the reasons that I am a coauthor and support the ADA Education and Reform Act. I especially support its provisions to increase businessowner education on ADA compliance, which I believe my amendment can help to strengthen. In California, 75 percent of the businesses targeted by these types of lawsuits are immigrant or minority owned businesses. These demographics are more unlikely to be familiar with ADA standards as well as their own legal rights. That is the reason for the shakedown of these minorityowned businesses. One obstacle for these types of businesspeople is that the vast majority of the DOJ’s compliance resources aren’t readily available in other languages that they may need to be made available. For example, key sections of a Spanishtranslated web page haven’t been updated for 3 years and doesn’t include close to the number of materials available in English. With a district like mine that is over 40 percent Hispanic, this is a real problem. If you want businesses to comply with the law, you have to give these businesses the opportunity to comply. Give them the ability to read from their own website what new laws are going into effect every single year. Because if only the lawyers know, then the shakedowns will continue to occur and businesses will continue to lose more of their profits and be unable to provide raises and bonuses to their employees. But worse than that, you will continue to see small businesses shut down. Let me finish on one final note. A few years ago I received a phone call in my office. We had been focused on ADA lawsuit abuse for quite some time. I talked to the lady about her concerns. She explained how she had received a notice in the mail and then a followup notice. No attorney had ever come into her restaurant—a smallbusiness owner. She was just trying to make ends meet. In fact, she was not only the proprietor of this restaurant, but she worked the kitchen. In fact, she started the business and worked the front end and the back end. She was the first to come and the last to leave. We have heard a lot of these stories about small businesses and the regulatory impacts that they face. But in this case, I was amazed to find out when I visited that she was more than happy to fix any ADA compliance issue. As she wheeled around in her wheelchair from her kitchen to the cash register, and her Spanish language being the first language that she knew, she wanted to fix things for her customers and fix things for those who are coming in with disabilities. We need to give her the opportunity to do that. Mr. Chair, I ask for support of this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment, but I do not oppose the amendment. The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Virginia is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chair, I want to first commend the gentleman from California for addressing this issue. He is quite right that it is important that, in order to expeditiously make sure that accommodations for the disabled are made, people have to understand what those requirements are. The regulations on this change frequently and constantly. I do not oppose this amendment. In fact, I support it. I would ask the gentleman if he would work with us moving forward to make sure that this does not impose an inordinate burden on the bureaucracy responsible for putting this out so as to delay getting new regulations to protect the ADA folks out. There are many languages spoken by people in various businesses in this country. Some are very common, and that is definitely the case, but we may not have this written in every single language that is spoken by every single individual. Mr. DENHAM. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. GOODLATTE. I yield to the gentleman from California. Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Chair, I look forward to working with the gentleman. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, at this time I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. POE). Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman and I thank Mr. DENHAM for offering this amendment and letting us all know some of the driveby lawsuit problems in California. Mr. Chairman, the Department of Justice, for example, has come up with 250 pages of regulations recently about the ADA. These regulations are sent out to the businesses. It is important, as the gentleman from California has mentioned, that these businesses be able to understand what those regulations are because many of these businesses that are being targeted by unscrupulous lawyers are minorityowned businesses, some firstgeneration Americans who have come into our country trying to make ends meet. So the amendment is a good idea. I support the amendment, and I urge all Members of this body to vote for it as well. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I have no further speakers. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. 
The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. DENHAM ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 2 OFFERED BY MR . LANGEVIN  
The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 printed in part A of House Report 115–559. Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 3, strike line 19 and all that follows through page 6, line 2. 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. LANGEVIN ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Rhode Island. Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I am offering this amendment with my colleague and fellow Bipartisan Disabilities Caucus co chair, Representative GREGG HARPER . I want to mention that it is the only bipartisan amendment being offered to H.R. 620, and I think it is important to stress this point. Mr. Chairman, two Members of Congress from different political parties— who represent a caucus that exists solely to inform, educate, and highlight issues impacting the disability community—have come together to say that there is something gravely wrong with this bill. We are offering an amendment that would make it palatable. The amendment would strike H.R. 620’s notice and cure requirement. As presently written, the notice and cure section mandates that someone who claims discrimination on the basis of a disability relating to an architectural barrier must provide a written notice that allows 60 days in order to acknowledge receipt of the complaint and 120 days to demonstrate substantial progress in removing the barrier before further legal action may be pursued. That is 6 months of waiting without a guarantee that the architectural barrier will be removed and access granted. So the idea that places of public accommodation must first receive a notice before correctly implementing a law that has been part of our legal framework for nearly three decades creates an obvious disincentive for ADA compliance. The proposal of a notice ignores the tenets of the ADA that support an indisputable right to inclusion and respect. No other civil rights law requires protected class members to hand a notice to people behaving in a discriminatory manner in order to educate them without any guarantee the situation will improve. This amendment would keep program funding for the ADA education. It also maintains language supporting alternative mediation pathways relating to architectural barriers outside of the existing framework within the Department of Justice. If supporters of H.R. 620 truly believe these Statebased nuisance lawsuits are the result of a lack of knowledge of what the Federal ADA requires, and that businesses need less costly avenues to remedy violations, then why wouldn’t they support an amendment that provides an answer to both of those claims without the harm of a notice and cure period that weakens the civil rights protections of the ADA? Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to consider the consequences of a bill that delays justice for people with disabilities in a way that no other class protected by civil rights laws must endure when asserting their civil rights. I then urge my colleagues to consider whether the delay of a notice and cure requirement adequately addresses the underlying issue of ‘‘driveby’’ lawsuits. I am hopeful that doing so will result in a decision to support this amendment to remove the harmful notice requirement, while maintaining provisions that increase access to education and mediation. Mr. Chairman, I urge passage of the amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I must oppose this amendment because it would completely gut the notice and cure provisions, which are the core provisions of this bill. The need for a notice and cure period has been highlighted in congressional hearings since the early 2000s. In 2016, David Weiss, who testified on behalf of the International Council of Shopping Centers, stated: 
The problem that the private sector faces is an increasing number of lawsuits typically brought by a few plaintiffs in various jurisdictions and often by the same lawyers for very technical and usually minor violations. It has become all too common for property owners to settle these cases, as it is less expensive to settle them than to defend them, even if the property owner is compliant. It is often too costly to prove that a property owner is doing what is right or required. Therefore, the property owner makes a rational business decision commonly resulting in settlement. 
Mr. Chairman, given that plaintiffs’ attorneys’ motives are often monetary, there is little or no incentive to work with businesses to cure a violation before a lawsuit is filed. This unintended result wastes resources on the cost of litigation that could have been used to improve access sooner. This delays justice. H.R. 620 remedies these problems by allowing businesses a finite period of time, before a private enforcement lawsuit can be filed, to fix defects on their premises once they are notified that these premises do not comply with the ADA. This will reduce abuses of the law by opportunistic lawyers. It will result in more access for the disabled because it encourages businesses to cure their access issues now in order to avoid costly litigation later. Mr. Chair, I would also note that made in order is an amendment coming up that would reduce this amount of time by 2 months, the total amount of time for notice and cure. I think that is a good step to address the concerns raised, but I cannot support an amendment that completely takes away the purpose of the legislation, which is to give smallbusiness owners the opportunity to cure a problem once they are made aware of it. Many of these are very technical violations of the law designed primarily to line the pockets of some unscrupulous lawyers, as opposed to really helping advance the cause of accessibility. For those reasons, I oppose this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. b1045 Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I proudly yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from New York (Mr. NADLER ), who is the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Chairman, I strongly support the LangevinHarper amendment. This bipartisan amendment removes from the bill its onerous and unjustified notice and cure provisions while leaving in place its potentially helpful educational and mediationrelated provisions. As I discussed extensively during general debate, the notice and cure provisions would have the effect of drastically weakening the ability of discrimination victims enforcing their rights in court. Any law, including the ADA, is only effective to the extent that it is enforceable, and civil rights statutes, particularly, depend primarily on private rights of action for their enforcement. By weakening enforcement, H.R. 620’s notice and cure provisions ultimately undermine the ADA’s goal of integrating people with disabilities into the mainstream of American life. For these reasons, I urge the House to adopt the LangevinHarper amendment which cures most of the problems with this bill. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to close. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Rhode Island has 30 seconds remaining. Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, again, I urge support of my amendment. The whole point of this amendment is to remove the notice and cure provision. Again, the ADA law has been around for nearly three decades now. People should be proactive about understanding what their responsibilities are 
to operate businesses or issues of public accommodation, to understand what their responsibilities are. Not, basically, taking that responsibility incentivizes people to say: Well, just wait and see if there is an issue, and only if we get notified will we then fix the problem. People need to be proactive and comply with the law, and I believe, there, everybody wins. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment, as I indicated, because the ADA is a regulationbased law, and those regulations are constantly changing as new technology changes and as accessibility to new features that businesses offer are desired by those in the disability community. That is a necessary thing, but it is also necessary to make sure that businesses have time to accommodate as well and learn about those new requirements and have the opportunity to fix it before somebody can just get attorney’s fees for something that is going to be done anyway. So I think the better approach is to oppose this amendment and support the underlying bill with the addition of an amendment coming up that would reduce that time by 2 months. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. LANGEVIN ). The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Rhode Island will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO . 3 OFFERED BY MR . FOSTER  
The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 printed in part A of House Report 115–559. Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Chairman, I rise to speak in favor of the amendment. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 4, line 10, insert after ‘‘in violation of section 303’’ the following: ‘‘, except that if a violation continues to occur after the expiration of the applicable period provided for under subparagraph (B), the court may, in addition to any other available relief, award punitive damages in such amount as the court determines appropriate’’. 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. FOSTER ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois. Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Chairman, since the start of the debate on this legislation, I have been laserfocused on getting the problems with ADA compliance actually fixed. The problems of driveby lawsuits have hit my district, and abusive demand letters are a problem nationwide. One of the tragedies of the status quo is that, even after settlement of demand letters, the problems are often not even fixed. Many of my colleagues have expressed concern, however, that the underlying text of this legislation would not provide sufficient incentive for legitimate civil rights attorneys to take to court businesses that offer no good faith effort to solve the problem with ADA compliance after they have been pointed out. My amendment simply would allow courts to award punitive damages in the cases that a business has made no good faith effort to remove a barrier to access. If they cure the problem, the matter is resolved; if not, they should be subject to the full force of the law, including punitive damages. Since its enactment, the Americans with Disabilities Act has allowed millions of Americans to gain access to public accommodations that many of us take for granted. The passage of the ADA was a major civil rights victory. Many more schools, hospitals, grocery stores, and movie theaters are now accessible. Thanks to the ADA, many of our fellow citizens are fully integrated into the fabric of society. Despite these gains, however, more still remains to be done. As people with disabilities have continued to work to make our public accommodations more accessible, unfortunately, some individuals have found ways to use the current system for their own financial benefit. The underlying bill aims to prevent unscrupulous individuals from taking advantage of the law and to establish a process leading to increased compliance. However, during many meetings with disability groups in my district over their concerns, some voiced fears that the underlying bill would discourage attorneys from taking ADA cases. My amendment would work to create an incentive for lawyers to take ADA cases, knowing that, if a business does not comply, punitive damages may be sought. The goal is that individuals with disabilities have access to competent legal representation in order to bring meritorious cases against businesses that seek to purposely avoid compliance with the ADA. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition. The CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment because it would defeat the whole purpose of the bill, which is to resolve access issues under title III without the need for expensive litigation. The private enforcement provisions provided in title III of the ADA are already a powerful tool to achieve greater accessibility through injunctive relief. Importantly, the ADA does not provide for damages in private lawsuits; it never has. This amendment would then, for the first time, allow such damages, which will drive up litigation costs and provide even more fodder for trial lawyers to abuse the law. Businesses should use their resources to fix access to problems, not to pay unnecessary and wasteful litigation costs. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Chairman, I would just like to answer by saying that my goal in this amendment has nothing to do with the plaintiff’s bar. It has to do with getting the problems fixed without going to court. Unfortunately, I think without at least the threat of punitive damages, I think it is a legitimate question as to whether some fraction of the violations of the ADA will, in fact, not be fixed as part of the calculation of cost benefit. I think that is not the way we should solve this in this country. It is a time in this country when a lot of our justice system—our courts— are coming under attack, and I actually have faith in the judges and courts in our country to make a reasonable judgment as to whether or not there was a good faith effort made to fix this fundamental law in our country. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for his comment about having faith in judges. As a former judge, I appreciate that comment. When the ADA legislation was debated here on this House floor in 1990, there was discussion about this whole issue. The purpose of the ADA legislation that passed Congress was to fix the problems that businesses had in accessibility for the disabled. It was not designed for punitive damages at all. It was designed to fix the problem. That is why the underlying legislation that we are sponsoring today makes businesses move in a timely manner if there is a violation. So this would change the whole concept of the ADA. Mr. Chairman, I oppose this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. FOSTER ). The amendment was rejected. 
AMENDMENT NO . 4 OFFERED BY MS . SPEIER  
The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4 printed in part A of House Report 115–559. Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 5, line 12, insert after ‘‘barrier or’’ the following: ‘‘, in the case of a barrier, the removal of which requires additional time as a result of circumstances beyond the control of the owner or operator, fails’’. 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. SPEIER ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California. Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Chairman, the ADA is a powerful and important law that we all respect and embrace. Unfortunately, in States like California, it has created a cottage industry of unscrupulous attorneys abusing title III of the ADA. The amendment I am offering is very simple. The current language in the bill permits a business notified of noncompliance with the ADA to simply make substantial progress in remedying the violation. Frankly, this language is too loose. My amendment strengthens this language to only permit the language of ‘‘substantial progress’’ where they cannot complete the work because of extenuating circumstances. Mr. Chairman, this amendment promotes basic fairness. It does not allow dishonest property owners to abandon responsibility by claiming they have made substantial progress. The message is still clear: businesses must fix their ADA violations. Today is a chance to pass something that addresses the real problem. Let’s not let the lack of a perfect solution get in the way of real progress. I want to speak to some of the issues that we have had in California. In California, this particular law has created an industry that allows for lawyers to make a lot of money off of small businesses. It has basically allowed shady law firms to make a profit out of abusing the ADA, often resulting in high legal bills and no fix to the allegations presented. In many cases, businesses are forced into settlements because the cost of fighting an allegation is so great. The average cost of a settlement is $16,000, but the cost of fighting the allegation is sometimes four to six times the average $75,000 income generated by the business. In California, a simple fix—putting up a sign or moving a door a few inches—can carry a $4,000 penalty, the minimum amount of damages, which will still be in place when the bill passes. This is no small sum if you are a local bakery, a neighborhood grocery store, or a barber shop. California is ground zero for this problem. It is home to 12 percent of the disabled population but 40 percent of ADA lawsuits nationwide. From 2012 to 2014, 54 percent of all related complaints in California were filed by just two law firms. The law firms sometimes recruit plaintiffs who are not directly impacted by the ADA or even living in the same State. Fourteen plaintiffs brought 46 percent of all these lawsuits. One of them, Robert McCarthy, filed more than 400 suits against California businesses, and he doesn’t even live in the State. One infamous example is the Californiabased Moore Law Firm, which filed more than 700 lawsuits over the past few years, resulting in large settlements and sometimes even bankruptcy for some businesses. Given recent laws to address this in my home State, trial lawyers are rushing to States like Texas, New York, and Florida, where they can make a profit. In 2014, a bar owner living in Torrance, California, was handed five lawsuits in the past 2 years and needed to save up to $30,000 to remodel. She was the target of a small group of attorneys who took aim at businesses in shopping centers for a quick profit. What we need to do, Mr. Chairman, is take the profit out of making these facilities accessible. We all want them to be accessible. We want to give them notice and a couple of months to cure the problem or else the lawsuit can continue. I think this makes a lot of sense. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition. The CHAIR. The gentleman from New York is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, this amendment does not appear to make any substantive change to H.R. 620. Whether or not the amendment is adopted, it still would be the case under the bill that a businessowner who fails to make substantial progress in removing an access barrier would be subject to a lawsuit. The amendment, however, does not address the fundamental concerns with H.R. 620’s notice and cure provisions that I expressed in general debate, including the fact that the bill does not require a business to comply with the ADA, only to make ‘‘substantial progress’’ toward compliance within the bill’s 180day cure period. While the amendment does not make the bill worse, it also does not make the bill better. Regrettably, therefore, I must oppose the amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. POE). 
b1100 Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for offering this amendment and being the original sponsor of this legislation. I support the amendment. The substantial progress provision in H.R. 620 provides needed flexibility in cases in which removing a barrier is halted for reasons beyond the business’ control. For example, a business may not be able to pour concrete in Alaska during the winter to fix a ramp. Likewise, a business may find that getting a building permit from their local government is taking longer than expected. In these cases, as well as other unexpected events, the substantial progress provision provides judges with a discretionary standard to determine whether the improvements and progress by the business are both material and meaningful. This clarifying amendment further defines the term ‘‘substantial progress’’ to make clear that circumstances beyond the business’ control—owner—are the only allowable justifications for not making substantial progress within the required time. The amendment will help provide more access for the disabled. I support it because it makes this legislation better. Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Chair, let me close by saying this: I wholeheartedly support the letter and the spirit of this law. I recognize how important it is. This law is powerful, but it has been weaponized by lawyers who are trying to make a quick buck. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. WOMACK ). The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from California (Ms. SPEIER ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 5 OFFERED BY MR . BERA  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5 printed in part A of House Report 115–559. Mr. BERA. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 5, line 15, strike ‘‘120’’ and insert ‘‘60’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from California (Mr. BERA) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. Mr. BERA. Mr. Chair, the Americans with Disabilities Act is landmark civil rights legislation. Americans with disabilities face real challenges every day. We should strive to support them every way we can. When Congress passes a law, we have an obligation to make sure that legislation is working and see if improvements can be made. Under the ADA, business owners are responsible to make sure their business is fully accessible to those with disabilities. However, in some cases, business owners are unaware they are in violation of the ADA. Most Americans can agree: rather than immediately face lawsuits for violations, business owners should be given time to actually fix what is wrong. This solution advances our shared goal of improved access for all members of the community. But in listening to my constituents in Sacramento County, many are concerned that the timeframe for fixing these violations was too long. And I agree. In response, my amendment would cut the time businesses have to fix violations in half. This means, after the notification period, a business has 60 days to fix violations, instead of 120 days in the current bill. 
In some cases, these barriers can and should be immediately addressed. But in a State like California, which is prone to earthquakes, construction permits can take time. Small businesses should be given a reasonable amount of time to make changes and better serve their customers. Having heard both sides of this debate, I believe we can, and should, find a compromise that works for both. I have seen how hard Sacramento small businesses work and how important they are for growing our economy and creating goodpaying jobs. As a doctor, I have seen firsthand the challenges of those with disabilities. This amendment seeks the middle ground and is a commonsense improvement. Americans with disabilities deserve to live full, healthy lives, unafraid of barriers that restrict their movement. Now, let me be clear: if a business does not make the modifications to obstructions once notified, they should be held accountable and there should be consequences. When we work across the aisle, Washington can get things done for the American people. This amendment is a commonsense fix that makes the bill better. Mr. Chair, I urge support of my amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Rhode Island is recognized for 5 minutes Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I rise, again, in opposition to this amendment. While I thank the gentleman from California for stressing the importance of providing opportunities for places of public accommodation to learn that they are in violation of the ADA, I disagree with the premise that the onus of enforcement should be placed on people with disabilities by requiring them to issue arduous and detailed notices. There are free resources available that provide information and technical assistance to the public on the requirements of the ADA. I can’t stress this enough: when someone owns a business, they have to balance a variety of regulations and requirements at both the State and Federal Government level. Why should the requirements that their business be accessible to people with disabilities, requirements that have been in existence for decades, be weakened or viewed as less important? Why should business owners be given a free pass until someone catches a violation before they comply? The suggestion that we can reduce the timeframe of a notice and cure period misses the point. There is nothing that can be done to improve a notice requirement that shouldn’t exist in the first place. No other civil rights law requires people who experience discrimination to wait for justice or provide a written notice before taking legal action. Why should people with disabilities be treated any differently? Further, what are the incentives to comply with the ADA in the first place if businesses can wait to be told what is wrong and then maybe fix the issue? After all, even with a reduction in the notice and cure timeframe, there is still no clear requirement that a barrier actually be removed. Again, I appreciate my colleague’s desire to find a compromise, but this is not the answer. Whether the notice and cure period is 120 days or 180 days, it does nothing to address the underlying issue of drive by lawsuits. That is the crux of the problem happening in States that have gone beyond the requirements of the ADA and merely delays access and creates a national policy of apathy on ADA implementation. Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BERA. Mr. Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. POE). Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I support the amendment. The goal of the bill is to provide more access for Americans more quickly. Absent circumstances beyond a business’ control, 120 days is sufficient time to remove a barrier. Under this amendment offered by the gentleman, instead of 180 days total, a business would have up to 120 days, instead, to fix access problems. I believe this amendment improves the bill. I urge its support, and I thank the gentleman for offering this amendment. Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, again, while I appreciate my colleague’s attempt to find somewhat of a common ground on this issue, it does not address the underlying problem. The issue of the ADA being around for 30 years—it is wellknown now. People are even proactive about finding out what their responsibilities are under the ADA, as opposed to just waiting until they are notified of a problem and then perhaps complying with. No, we should not treat people with disabilities any differently than anyone else who is protected under civil rights laws. That is why we have them in the first place. I would urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. Let’s work together on finding a better commonground solution. But this amendment and the underlying bill is not the answer. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BERA. Mr. Chair, this amendment makes the bill better. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. BERA). The amendment was agreed to. AMENDMENT NO . 6 OFFERED BY MR . POE OF  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6 printed in part A of House Report 115–559. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I rise as the designee of Mrs. MCMORRIS  RODGERS , and I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 5, beginning on line 22, strike ‘‘the specific sections of the Americans with Disabilities Act alleged to have been violated,’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. POE) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Chairman, this amendment will make it easier for a disabled American to provide a business with a notice of an ADA violation. Violations of the ADA can be very technical. The Department of Justice has hundreds, if not thousands, of pages of regulations and guidance documents on complying with the public accommodation requirements of title III of the ADA. Given that the Department of Justice will not certify whether a business’ property is ADA compliant, these ADA requirements are often left to the interpretation of plaintiffs’ lawyers. The notice provisions of H.R. 620 require that those who allege a business is violating the ADA must provide the business with a description of ‘‘the specific sections of the Americans with Disabilities Act alleged to have been violated.’’ This provision was designed to ensure that businesses have a clear picture of the alleged violation with the business. However, this requirement may go too far. Accordingly, the amendment removes this requirement, making clear that written notices provided by disabled individuals can be written in plain English, without legalese. Removing this requirement will also facilitate a dialogue between the individual and the business. Additionally, it may avoid any need for a disabled individual to hire a lawyer. Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New York is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chair, I appreciate the intent behind this amendment to make the notice provision of H.R. 620 slightly less onerous, and I acknowledge that it does so by eliminating the requirement that an aggrieved person cite in his or her initial notice to a business the specific ADA provision being violated. The amendment, however, still leaves in place the basic problem with the 
bill, the basic problem with the notice and cure provision, and that is the notice and cure provision. Therefore, it does not alleviate any of the real concerns with the underlying bill. Again, the basic notice and cure provisions of the bill turn on its head the normal practice of any civil rights statute in which the burden of compliance is on the actor, not on the victim. Here, we put the burden of compliance on the victim. The debate has been as if people have not had 28 years to come into compliance, only to find out they are not in compliance when someone complains about it, some victim is victimized. That is just wrong. This goes in exactly the wrong direction. Although this amendment would slightly alleviate the provision, it is putting lipstick on a pig. For this reason and in deference to the disability rights community, which opposes this amendment and the presuit notice and cure requirements, I must oppose the amendment. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman’s comments. I want to remind folks that notice requirement is required even under title VII of the Civil Rights Act. It is also required under title I of the original ADA legislation. So this is not a new phenomena. This legislation and this amendment gives potential plaintiffs the ability to advise and put a business on notice without even having to hire a lawyer with the legalese requirements that are written by the Department of Justice, which constantly updates what requirements are under the ADA. The intention is to simply have the violation described in a way that is sufficient to put the business on notice of what the ADA violation is. Therefore, Mr. Chairman, I would ask that all Members support this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. POE). The amendment was agreed to. The Acting CHAIR. The Chair understands that amendment No. 7 will not be offered. b1115 Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise. The motion was agreed to. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia) having assumed the chair, Mr. WOMACK , Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 620) to amend the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 to promote compliance through education, to clarify the requirements for demand letters, to provide for a notice and cure period before the commencement of a private civil action, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon. f 
RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess for a period of less than 15 minutes. Accordingly (at 11 o’clock and 15 minutes a.m.), the House stood in recess. 
b1120 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. MITCHELL ) at 11 o’clock and 20 minutes a.m.

Will the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. WOMACK ) kindly assume the chair. b1121 
Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the further consideration of the bill (H.R. 620) to amend the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 to promote compliance through education, to clarify the requirements for demand letters, to provide for a notice and cure period before the commencement of a private civil action, and for other purposes, with Mr. WOMACK (Acting Chair) in the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The Acting CHAIR. When the Committee of the Whole rose earlier today, amendment No. 6 printed in part A of House Report 115–559 offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. POE) had been disposed of.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge the upcoming centennial anniversaries of the statehood and independence of the three Baltic States. This year marks 100 years since the restoration of the state of Lithuania on February 16, and the proclamations of independence of Estonia on February 24, and Latvia on November 18. Thus, in the aftermath of World War I, in 1918, Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia declared their independence and marked their beginnings as new republics and their emergence as modern democratic societies. Despite a history of turmoil, the people of the Baltics have always stood up for their values and worked to maintain their independence, freedom, and sovereignty. Today, 100 years later, the three Baltic States are strong allies of NATO and fullfledged members of the European Union. They are committed to making the transatlantic community an area of cooperation, partnership, and prosperity. The United States is proud to be strong allies of the Baltic States, and our nations stand together to defend our shared values of freedom and democracy. Mr. Speaker, I extend sincere congratulations and send best wishes to Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia on their centennial observations and anniversary. f 
WHAT WILL IT TAKE (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, what will it take? What will it take for this body to finally grapple with this issue? Columbine wasn’t enough. West Virginia wasn’t enough. Colorado, in a movie theater, wasn’t enough. A nightclub in Orlando wasn’t enough. Newtown wasn’t enough. Mr. Speaker, this has become a national disgrace. Ninetyfive percent of the American people say that they believe in sensible gun reform, gun laws that make sense. Ninetyfive percent. The minority party does not represent 95 percent of this Nation. You are in that number as well, yet you still turn your back on the American people. The NRA stands for ‘‘no Republican action.’’ 
MONTANA STATE UNIVERSITY MARKS ITS 125TH ANNIVERSARY (Mr. GIANFORTE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a proud Bobcat to recognize Montana State University, which is celebrating its 125th anniversary tomorrow on Founders’ Day. Montana State University, a land grant university in my hometown of Bozeman, was formed in 1893. Originally, the agricultural college of the State of Montana, the school started with eight students in a small classroom in a local high school. The college quickly grew to include many other degree paths, including engineering and nursing; two programs for which the school is particularly known. Today, Montana State University serves over 16,000 students each year. This year’s spring enrollment set a new record for the tenth year in a row. Montana State University is a cornerstone of the Bozeman community, and we are fortunate to have such an institution in our State. The fact is that the success of my business, as well as that of many others, would not have been possible without Montana State University. Go, Cats, go. f 
WE NEED SENSIBLE GUN LAWS (Mr. CARBAJAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. CARBAJAL. Madam Speaker, I rise with a heavy heart, imagining the pain felt in Parkland, Florida. No parent should have to send their children to school each day wondering if they will return home. While details of the shooting in Florida are still emerging, it is clear this horrific act of violence was perpetrated by an individual in crisis. I lost my older sister to suicide with a firearm at a young age. What I have learned since is that helping to prevent people in crisis from temporarily having a gun saves lives. Today, I urge my colleagues to support the Gun Violence Restraining Order Act, allowing family members or law enforcement officials to petition a judge to temporarily remove firearms from an individual in crisis. For those who keep repeating after each mass shooting that it is too soon to discuss gun violence reform, please consider that for many families, including my own, it is far too late. We owe these families more than just our thoughts and prayers. We owe them sensible gun laws that protect our children from needless gun violence. 
JENNIFER’S STORY OF TRAFFICKING (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. POE of Texas. Madam Speaker, Jennifer’s childhood was violently chaotic. By her early twenties, she was living on the streets, begging and stealing to survive. After a local gang member suspected that she may have stolen his money, her life became even more horrific and hellish. The gangster beat her mercilessly with a baseball bat until she collapsed, and then he and other gang members pistolwhipped her and burned her with cigarettes. They tattooed their names all over her body, branding her as property. For 6 years, they held her in slavery, forcing her to have sex with countless men for money. Desperate, Jennifer tried to kill herself, but when the rope broke, she resolved to escape. Luckily for Jennifer, she found a shelter and was able to rebuild her life. She covered up the traffickers’ names with flowers and the words ‘‘free yourself.’’ We, as a society, owe it to Jennifer and survivors like her to protect them 
and put the slave masters in the jailhouse, where they belong. And that is just the way it is. 
DAY OF REMEMBRANCE FOR JAPANESE INTERNMENT (Ms. GABBARD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. GABBARD. Madam Speaker, over 120,000 Japanese Americans were incarcerated on American soil during World War II. On the annual Day of Remembrance, we are reminded of the brave men, women, and children who lost everything. They lost their homes, their belongings, their businesses, really keeping only what they could carry with them. But their spirits were not broken. Countless stories of bravery, courage, and resilience defined an entire generation, including the Niseionly ‘‘Go For Broke’’ 442nd Infantry Regiment, becoming the most highly decorated unit in Army history. The anniversary of this shameful blight on our history remains a powerful reminder of the fragility of civil rights and the threat that prejudice and divisiveness and bigotry continue to pose to our way of life today. We must follow in the footsteps of those Japanese Americans who volunteered to serve this country, even with their loved ones incarcerated on American soil, and find the light and love of the Aloha spirit to stand up and fight against intolerance, bigotry, and hatred. 
TY MUSE IS BROOME COUNTY’S DISTINGUISHED CITIZEN OF THE YEAR (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. TENNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ty Muse, the CEO of Visions Federal Credit Union, who was recently honored by the Boy Scouts of America and the BadenPowell Council as the Broome County Distinguished Citizen of the Year. Each year, this award is given to an individual in the Broome County community who sets a positive example for others and demonstrates concern and significant care for their community. Mr. Muse moved to the Broome County area 5 years ago and hit the ground running. He has been honored for his commitment to helping young leaders throughout the region by sponsoring a free track program, donating to several local school districts and colleges, and working to raise awareness in financial literacy. Madam Speaker, I extend both my congratulations and my thanks to Mr. Ty Muse for his hard work and dedication to the Broome County community and for his commitment to inspiring leaders of the future. THE CFPB—HOW TO KILL A GOOD THING (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, a leader must believe in the mission of the organization he or she heads. But Donald Trump turned this principle on its head by appointing Mick Mulvaney to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Mr. Mulvaney doesn’t believe in the agency’s mission to protect consumers. In fact, he once said that he doesn’t ‘‘like the fact that the CFPB even exists.’’ When he was a Member of Congress, he cosponsored legislation to eliminate it. Now, as Director of the CFPB, he wants to zero out its budget for this year. He eviscerated the CFBP’s rules against predatory payday lending, and then dropped all the lawsuits against them. He halted its investigation into Equifax. As Senator ELIZABETH WARREN pointed out, you should not put someone in charge of an agency when they want to destroy it. He is running it into the ground, and we must stop it. Consumers will pay dearly. 
b1215 CONGRATULATING GREGORY OLSEN (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PAULSEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Gregory Olsen from Chaska who was recently appointed to serve on the National Honey Board by the Secretary of Agriculture. Greg will serve a 3year term alongside 19 other members as the importer handler representative. The National Honey Board is one of the 22 industry funded boards authorized by Congress under USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service. Its purpose is to expand domestic markets for honey and honey products. The National Honey Board is responsible for research and development, advertising and promotion, consumer education, and industry information of the honey industry. Madam Speaker, Greg brings important industry experience to the table and will assist the National Honey Board in their mission of successful innovative research, education, and promotional work for honey products that many people rely on in Minnesota and across the world. Congratulations again to Greg Olsen. 
CUTTING EPA’S BUDGET (Mr. BEYER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, 26 percent—that is how much Trump and Pruitt want to cut the EPA’s budget, a starved agency cut again by a full one quarter. That is massive cuts of staff, massive cuts to our health and safety, massive cuts to the EPA’s ability to do its job. The day after they proposed those cuts, we learned that Mr. Pruitt likes to fly first class on the taxpayer’s dime. Over one stretch last June, taxpayerfunded travel for Scott Pruitt and his aides cost at least $90,000. If the administration wants to look for cuts, maybe Scott Pruitt shouldn’t be flying first class to his meetings. Maybe he should have to sit next to the constituents he represents. Madam Speaker, the EPA’s mission is to protect our environment. President Trump’s dirty budget wants to cut its budget by $3 billion. Madam Speaker, we need to be able to protect our health and environment and prioritize funding to do so. It doesn’t look like Mr. Pruitt is capable of doing that, even from 40,000 feet in the air. f 
AMERICANS ARE THRIVING BECAUSE OF TAX REFORM (Mr. FERGUSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. FERGUSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today to share just a few examples of how the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is already helping businesses in Georgia’s Third District. It is helping them to grow, and it is helping them to reinvest in their workers. Last month, I had the opportunity to visit such a business, Custom Truck and Body Works, in Woodbury, Georgia. This is a unique company that builds specialty vehicles for first responders. Because of the changes made by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, this small business has been able to hire new workers, is beginning a facility expansion, and, in fact, told me they are still looking for folks to fill positions today. This isn’t the only business in the Third District that is thriving because of tax reform. Another small business, ShredX, which is a small business that has 10 employees and provides recycling and shredding services to 3,000 clients throughout Atlanta and west central Georgia, plans to use the additional savings to buy a new truck and potentially hire a new employee. For a company of 10 people, this is a huge difference. Madam Speaker, I am thrilled to see our Main Street job creators thriving because of tax reform, and I look forward to seeing our economy continue to thrive as Americans reap the benefits of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 
ADDRESS GUN VIOLENCE (Ms. SHEAPORTER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. SHEAPORTER. Madam Speaker, children and families across the country rely on their leaders in Congress for much more than thoughts and prayers. They need us to take action to keep them safe. Gun violence in this country is a horrifying epidemic. There have been 18 school shootings in the past 7
1⁄2weeks. It is even hard to talk about this. It is difficult to argue, though, with people who are looking at Congress and wondering whether too many Members in Congress are too close to the NRA and the gun manufacturers. Congress actually passed a law to prevent the CDC from even studying gun violence. In difficult times, I, too, seek thoughts and prayers from friends, clergy, and family, but this is not stopping the slaughter. I agree with police officers across the country who say: Get the AR–15s out of the hands of dangerous people now. Our children are being massacred in their schools. Madam Speaker, Speaker RYANmust put bills on the floor to address gun violence or his party will go down in history as the party that blocked solutions to this crisis. 
HONORING SHELAGH SWEENEY (Mr. FASO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. FASO. Madam Speaker, it is with great pride that I rise today to recognize Hurley Fire Department member Shelagh Sweeney. Shelagh was named Hurley Fire Department’s first female Firefighter of the Year. Her service and dedication to her community as a firefighter, EMT, and field training officer for mobile life support services is most admirable. Her inspiration to join the fire department came from her attendance of a firstaid class during her time at SUNY Ulster. Continuing her education by taking classes at Marist College is a testament to the dedication she reflects with her service to her community. Shelagh’s selfless service to the community, while striving for further personal growth, is greatly appreciated, and I wish her the best in continuing on her journey. 
INVESTING IN THE NATION’S INFRASTRUCTURE (Mr. MCNERNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MCNERNEY. Madam Speaker, this week, the President unveiled a budget proposal that would not only endanger the health and safety of the American people and our environment, but also jeopardize the longterm stability of our infrastructure systems. It completely ignores what we know about climate change, proposing a 61 percent reduction in funding for renewable energy research and cutting critical enforcement tools and public safety regulations. It also lacks the foresight to produce a forwardthinking plan that will ensure a stable and resilient infrastructure future. In fact, it seeks to eliminate essential programs like ARPA–E, which supports early stage energy research and development. Nationwide infrastructure systems like the electric grid must be updated to anticipate severe weather and climate conditions. We have seen the toll that national disasters take on our electric grid. Smart planning and investment is essential to ensuring that we have the proper resources to maintain and operate these essential structures. The President has spoken at length about investing in our infrastructure. Now let’s see some action. f 
WORKING WITH ASIA DURING YEAR OF THE DOG (Mr. YOHO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. YOHO. Madam Speaker, this week commences the Lunar New Year, a time of thankfulness and new beginnings for the United States and many of our Asian partners. Reflecting upon last year’s Year of the Rooster, we have enjoyed tremendous political, social, and economic achievements. Filled with enthusiasm for diplomacy and cooperation, we continue to look to our partners in Asia to promote peaceful international relations. During the Year of the Dog, I believe that our friends will continue to embody loyalty, honesty, and integrity, working with us to craft mutually beneficial international policies. In turn, the United States will encourage effective diplomatic behaviors among all of our Asian counterparts. As lawmakers, we have an obligation to protect the interests of the United States, as well as those of our strong allies around the globe, especially in the AsiaPacific region. Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to continue to work toward policies that will positively shape strong, multinational Asian foreign relations in 2018. 
UNDERFUNDING NATIONAL PARKS (Mr. HUFFMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, from the mighty redwoods to the headlands and beaches of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area in my bay area, backyard to the ancient sequoias of Yosemite, to the scorching deserts of Death Valley, we know our national parks are worth protecting. Parks not only protect nature and wildlife but our history, too. And they are economic engines supporting thousands of jobs. But Donald Trump’s dirty budget and infrastructure scam would bulldoze right through this American success story. Trump is proposing a 7 percent cut to the National Park Service, meaning even less maintenance and visitor services, and a 17 percent cut to the Department of the Interior overall, while giving Secretary Ryan Zinke free rein to continue his drilling spree on our public lands. These cuts, combined with Trump’s ongoing effort to hike entry fees for working families, threaten access to these places that drive millions of visitors to our communities and small businesses each year, while generating hundreds of millions of dollars in economic activity. Underfunding our national parks puts visitor access at risk. We should reject this budget and work together. f 
ADA IMPROVEMENTS (Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, the Americans with Disabilities Act has played an important role in improving accessibility for many years. Unfortunately, it is often taken advantage of by dishonest attorneys who file driveby lawsuits against small businesses in order to get a quick payday. This entails coercing a business owner into paying expensive settlements or legal fees for unintended or technical violations and vague interpretations of the ADA. This practice has risen dramatically. From just 2013 to 2017, ADA lawsuits in Federal courts have increased by 182 percent, and it goes beyond that for many years previously as well. This practice violates the spirit of the law and hurts small businesses without really improving access. One example, a small business, a minimarket in my district, went through a renovation. They put in a nice ramp there on the front of their business, a concrete structure that had been inspected, and they were working with the county all along. Then, when they were done, someone came and said: This is 1 degree off on incline. How is a small business supposed to deal with issues like that when the regulators themselves can’t even keep track of what they are supposed to be doing? This only benefits corrupt attorneys. That is why I support the ADA Education and Reform Act which will end this shady practice and give property owners a reasonable chance to fix potential issues. 
COMMONSENSE GUN SAFETY LEGISLATION (Ms. FRANKEL of Florida asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. Madam Speaker, a person sends their child to school and expects that they are going to come home safely. I am so sad for the grieving families of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland. Innocent children—gone in a blink. I am thankful for the first responders, but foremost, my thoughts are with the grieving families, the students, and the teachers affected by this horrific shooting. We see this carnage over and over again. We know there is no magic solution, but that doesn’t mean that there are no solutions. We need more resources for mental health, not tax cuts for billionaires. And, yes, Mr. President, are you listening? We need commonsense gun safety legislation, not these idiotic bills that expand gun usage. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. HANDEL ). Members are reminded to please address their remarks to the Chair and not to a viewing audience. 
CALLING FOR SENSIBLE GUN REFORM (Mr. SOTO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I do not rise today for another moment of silence for Parkland, Florida, for the semiautomatic weapon and shooter who wielded it already silenced 17 Floridians and injured countless others at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Instead, I rise to make their voices heard. I rise to call for action on sensible gun reform. The Parkland shooter likely got his semiautomatic weapon through a private sale or a gun show without a background check, in spite of a record of mental health issues. It is time to close that loophole. The Las Vegas shooter used a bump stock to convert a semiautomatic weapon into an automatic weapon—which is already illegal. Bump stocks should also be illegal. Why is nothing happening? In my own home of Orlando, the shooter at the Pulse nightclub was on the FBI watch list. Imagine if we passed no fly, no buy and stopped that from happening. Now is not the time for silence. Now is the time for action, and now is time for solutions. 
b1230 HONORING THE LIFE OF CHRISTIANA DUARTE (Mr. KIHUEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. KIHUEN. Madam Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Christiana Duarte. Christiana attended the Route 91 Festival in Las Vegas on October 1. She had recently graduated from the University of Arizona with a degree in business marketing. While in college, she interned with the Arizona Wildcats and was a member of the sorority Sigma Kappa. After graduation Christiana worked for the Los Angeles Kings as a fan services associate. Friends and family remember Christiana as a bright, beautiful young woman who was full of life and energy. I would like to extend my condolences to Christiana Duarte’s family and friends. Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada, and the whole country grieve with you. f 
PRESIDENT TRUMP’S BUDGET (Mr. GOMEZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. GOMEZ. Madam Speaker, a budget reflects one’s values. President Trump’s budget shows he values polluters and profits over people. With the ink barely dry on the Republican tax scam, Trump’s budget proposes we pay for their corporate giveaway by gutting public health and environmental programs. One of the budget’s largest targets is the EPA, which will suffer a 25 percent cut. This means cuts to grants that help States like California implement the Clean Air and Clean Water Act. That means cuts to Superfund programs that clean up sites where toxic chemicals from factories and landfills were dumped for decades, polluting the surrounding soil, water, and air. We simply cannot afford a dirty budget that prioritizes polluters and profits over people. 
AMERICAN SCHOOLCHILDREN ARE AT RISK (Mr. COHEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, this House generally jumps into action once there has been a mass shooting by having a moment of silence. Today we didn’t even have a moment of silence because the House knows that those are meaningless acts that don’t have any effect on our schoolchildren who have been the victims of 18 school mass shootings this year. It is shameful this Congress has not dealt with no fly, no buy. If you are on a terrorist list, you can still buy a gun. It is a shame this Congress passed a law that takes away from individuals who get Social Security who may be mentally ill the ability to buy a gun. We don’t even have studies on what has been happening in trying to protect schoolchildren. It is a shame. We need to act. American schoolchildren are at risk, and I am ashamed at what this Congress has failed to do: take action. 
LET DEMOCRACY PREVAIL ON IMMIGRATION (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, we have 4 legislative days before those protected by DACA will be at risk. The Speaker has said he was going to address this issue. He has not at this point in time. The Speaker said on 9/23/2010: We will advance major legislation one issue at a time. He said: We will not duck the tough issues. We will take them headon. In that light, I urge the Speaker to put on the floor the three bills that are pending in this House: a clean Dream Act; the USA Act, sponsored by Representatives AGUILAR and H URD, a bipartisan bill; and a Republican bill, the Securing America’s Future Act, sponsored by Representative GOODLATTE . Madam Speaker, let the people’s House speak. Let them vote. Put these three bills on the floor, and let the majority rule. That is democracy. Let democracy prevail in this House. 
IMMIGRATION The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GALLEGO ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Speaker, in June, seven American heroes died on a dark night when a ship collided with an American destroyer, the USS Fitzgerald. Among the dead were immigrants from Vietnam and the Philippines, as well as sons of workers who journeyed north from Guatemala. As one of the sailors who survived explained: You are crammed in with all sorts of cultures on the ship, but when you are on the Fitzgerald, you are family. Just like the Fitzgerald, my unit in Iraq included men of many races and religions. We were a family, too, and it made us stronger. Madam Speaker, what is true of our military is also true of our country. Lots of nations have democratic institutions, plenty of countries have good schools, and all too many, as we know, wield powerful weapons; but what makes America great, what makes America powerful, and what makes America America is that, since our founding, we have thrown our doors open to the world, and we have kept them open to the strivers and the dreamers from every corner of the globe. We didn’t become the greatest, most powerful country in the world because we let in a certain group of people and then slammed the door behind them. No, Madam Speaker, we built this country by making America the only country in the world where anyone from anywhere can accomplish anything. President Reagan may have summed it up best when he explained that: You can go to Japan to live but you cannot become Japanese. You can go to France to live and not become a 
Frenchman. Anyone can come to America to live and become an American. Unfortunately, our current President and his friends in Congress want to turn their backs on what made America great. Their antiimmigrant agenda will lead to the deportation of millions and drastic cuts in legal immigration. The last time Congress restricted immigration in this way was almost 100 years ago. Back then, conservatives were worried that there were too many Italians and Jews who were arriving on our shores. Now, they are concerned about Mexican, Nigerian, and Chinese immigrants. The rhetoric may have shifted, the targets may have changed, but it is the same kind of backward, unAmerican thinking that existed then. The American people are too smart for this. We don’t fear people who don’t speak like us or look like us or even pray the way we do. Time and time again, we have rejected the racists and the nativists of this country. We have done it before, and we will do it again. Madam Speaker, I don’t have to look at the polls to tell you that there are a lot more Americans like Aaron Chamberlin from Phoenix than like Donald Trump. Aaron is a restaurant owner in Phoenix. When he learned that a young prep chef named Suny Santana was undocumented, Aaron said Suny could stay as long as he found a way to fix his undocumented status. Thankfully, Suny qualified for DACA. He worked hard and thrived. In fact, he did so well that Aaron offered to partner with him in opening his very own new restaurant in downtown Phoenix. But then, cruelly and without warning, President Trump terminated DACA and stripped away Suny’s status, throwing his entire life into limbo. Democrats are fighting for Dreamers like Suny and for businessowners like Aaron who believe in them. We are also fighting for veterans like Miguel Perez of Chicago. Miguel has lived in this country since he was 8 years old. He served two tours in Afghanistan and suffers from PTSD as a result of his service. Unfortunately, as is too often the case with us, this led to problems with addiction. Miguel deserves our support. Instead, he is facing deportation. As I speak, Miguel is currently sitting in an ICE detention center in Kenosha, Wisconsin, which happens to be in the district of our Speaker, PAUL RYAN. Miguel isn’t alone. Hundreds of immigrants who served our country in uniform could now be deported at the behest of a President who has never served one day in service to this country. These are men and women who took an oath to protect and defend this Nation. They have earned the right to call this country home. They have earned the right to call themselves Americans. To deport these brave men and women after they have fought under our flag dishonors the service of all of us who risked our lives for this country. We must find a way to protect Dreamers and immigrant families, including brave immigrants who served in uniform. The American people are on our side. They know that Trump’s fearful vision for our future is incompatible with who we are as Americans. They are proud to live in a country that attracts the brightest minds and the hardest workers from all around the world. They understand that exclusion and hate are the exact opposite of what makes America America. This Nation did not become great by kicking out immigrants who fight hard like Miguel or who dream big like Suny. Unlike every other country on Earth, we aren’t defined by where we come from, but we are defined by what we believe. Donald Trump may not understand that, but the American people do. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. f 
IMMIGRATION REFORM The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GARRETT ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. GARRETT. Madam Speaker, it is a somber time to come into this Chamber as we have colleagues at the other end of the building who formed something they call the Common Sense Coalition, which is, I think, a gentle euphemism like so many things in this town are, which might well be called the ‘‘kick the can down the road’’ coalition, the ‘‘doing the same thing again and again and again and again and expecting a different result’’ coalition, or the ‘‘those who do not learn from the past are doomed to repeat it’’ coalition. The photo that is to my left and to your right if you are viewing at home is of me at a ceremony at Red Hill Farm in the Fifth District of Virginia, where a man named Patrick Henry lived. Patrick Henry is notable as an early patriot who sought to ensure the blessings of selfdetermination and liberty for a fledgling nation that determined that it was unjust that they should be governed by edict from across the sea and most notably said the words: ‘‘I know not what course others may take; but as for me, give me liberty or give me death.’’ Indeed, anyone who signed the Declaration of Independence understood at that time that they were literally signing their own death warrant, yet they did because it was the right thing to do. Today we have degenerated into a political class that knows pandering and efforts to placate individuals without the interests of the mass constituency that we all unitedly serve, and that is the American people. In fact, when Patrick Henry spoke about liberty one day in a separate speech, from the back of the room, someone shouted, ‘‘Treason,’’ and Henry responded eloquently: ‘‘If this be treason, make the most of it.’’ What has happened to our leaders? So that day I spoke to a group of a couple of dozen new Americans from every corner of the world—from Asia, Africa, the Middle East, Europe, and South America—who had, in some instances, worked decades to become Americans and to earn those blessings of liberty gained for us by people like Patrick Henry, like 1 million nameless faces who died of combat death, disease, or starvation during a war to end the horrific institution of slavery, and like Abraham Lincoln and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. So they, indeed, looked like America—Brown people, White people, Black people, Asian people, American people—and they earned it. But what is coming out of the Senate now essentially throws aside the sacrifices of so many in order to score political points. It was, indeed, one of the greatest honors of my life to welcome those new brothers and sisters to our American family. Yet the process through which they pained and labored does not in any way mirror the process that we would continue by kicking the can down the road under the proposed Senate ‘‘compromise.’’ I could really, literally, do this all day, all week, all month, and all year if I wanted to highlight the cases of individuals who had lost their lives because our Federal Government is completely unwilling to enforce the laws that it currently has on the books. b1245 Many of you recognize the lovely face of Kate Steinle, who was enjoying a beautiful afternoon in the Embarcadero district of San Francisco on pier 14 with her dad. A graduate of Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo, she worked in the medical field and had recently moved in with her boyfriend when an illegal who had been deported 5 times, who the local government refused to turn over to Federal authorities, discharged a weapon that he stole from a member of law enforcement at what he said was a sea lion—which is bad enough—and killed this lovely young woman whom her friends say loved yoga and helping others. Reports indicate that among her last words was a plea to her father to please help. She passed away because we refuse to enforce our law. Edwin Jackson, a linebacker for the Indianapolis Colts, was born in the same town that I was: Atlanta, Georgia. He didn’t have bigtime football offers out of high school. Indeed, instead of the University of Georgia or Florida or Clemson, he matriculated to Georgia Southern University. But he worked, and he worked with an optimism that radiated from the very smile on his face. 
And not long ago, Edwin Jackson became one of nearly 1,000 people per year who die in alcoholrelated accidents involving people in this country illegally; as well as his Uber driver, Jeffrey Monroe, who should also be noted. Edwin Jackson’s obituary indicated that his greatest goal in life was to be a positive role model for young people to overcome challenges. The individual who was detained had a blood alcohol content of .239, or nearly three times the legal limit. He had been deported twice before, tried to run from the scene, and lied to police officers about his name upon his apprehension. Edwin Jackson and Jeffrey Monroe are dead because we refuse to enforce our laws. Denise Mosier, in my home State of Virginia, in 2010, was riding in a van with two other nuns from the 33women monastery where she made her home, aspiring to help people. Her two dear friends were horrifically injured in an accident that took Miss Mosier’s life. This Benedictine nun had devoted her life to the service of others. Quite literally, you could find nothing bad that anyone could say about this woman. The driver who took her life was ultimately charged with DUI third or subsequent offense. He had arrived illegally in this country and was only weeks away from a deportation hearing, which he was only having because of his multiple prior arrests for driving under the influence. Tragically, our unwillingness to enforce our own laws cost about 10 percent of the community at the monastery where Denise Mosier made her home dearly and cost about 4 percent their life. In fact, 13 percent of all drunk drivers arrested in the United States every year are here illegally—13 percent of 1.5 million. And the death toll of drunkdrivingrelated offenses in this country is about 10,000 per year. So extrapolating those numbers, nearly 1,000 people per year are killed in alcoholrelated accidents involving those here illegally. And we refuse to enforce our own laws. Peter Hacking was a volunteer fire department captain in Texas. One afternoon not long ago, Peter stopped off Highway 78 to pick up his children, which included 4yearold Ellie and a son who was 2, when they were killed by a previously deported drunk driver, who ultimately received a sentence of about 2 years, and who was here because we will not secure our border and we will not enforce our laws. Let me be clear: those two dozen or so individuals whom I had the great honor—of all faiths and all creeds from around the world—of welcoming into our American family are American just like everyone watching this today. But those who are not here legally, who will not go through the processes prescribed by this very body, are a discredit to those who work so hard and those who have sacrificed so much to make this Nation the beacon of freedom that it is. And no nation of laws can perpetuate itself so long as it looks the other way as its laws are selectively enforced and not enforced. Tessa Tranchant, from Virginia Beach, Virginia, was riding with a girlfriend and killed by a drunk driver here illegally. Danny Oliver and Michael Davis were law enforcement professionals from Sacramento, California. They were murdered by a frequently deported individual who swears that he will find a way to kill more police officers. Dominic Durden was killed while riding his motorcycle by an illegal drunk driver. Jamiel Shaw was brutally shot and murdered by an illegal. Marilyn Pharis, who devoted her life to the service of this Nation in the United States Air Force, was beaten, tortured, raped, and murdered by an illegal who had been arrested 6 times in 15 months, the most recent time being 8 days before this crime was perpetrated but not reported to Federal authorities because the sanctuary community that she was in did not deem it worthy to report. I want to see a healthy and robust immigration system into this country, legally. I want to live in a nation that enforces the very laws that these bodies pass to protect those people who we are tasked with serving, the American people, be they naturalized or native born. I literally could keep telling these stories for weeks and weeks and weeks. So we now find fiscal responsibility a rallying cry from individuals who don’t seem to care about that at any point in time except for when it is convenient to their political agenda. We have a President in the White House who suggested that we would build a border wall and we would have those who are responsible for the immigration problem pay for it. We have a media that glowingly and gleefully pokes fun and asks: How is that plan going for you? Well, I have a proposal. About 92 percent of foreign nationals in U.S. Federal prisons are here illegally. That is over 9 out of 10. That comes out to about 34,500 inmates in our Federal prison system here illegally. And they are not here for immigration violations. They are here for robbery; they are here for rape; they are here for murder. The cost to incarcerate one individual in the Federal prison system annually is about $32,500. I’m not that good at math, but that comes out to about $1.1 billion per year. If you move away from the Federal prison system and extrapolate those numbers across the State prison systems, you are looking at something like $9.5 billion per year to incarcerate illegals here convicted of violent crimes, felonies. We are talking about prisons, not jails. Now, the Senate plan says: Okay. Well, what we are going to do is we are going to spend $18 billion over 10 years. I will tell you what. If we can just secure the Southern border and stop the inflow of illegals, we could reduce our Federal and State prison expenditures by about $9.5 billion a year, and I’ll get you your $18 billion in 2 years. In other words, you want to pay for this wall? Build it; it will pay for itself. And that is in dollars and cents. But, folks, how do you quantify the lives of these people? How do you put a dollar value on the life of a woman who spent her entire life serving our country and was tortured, raped, and murdered by someone who had been arrested just 6 days before and, under the Federal law, should have been reported to Federal authorities, but they didn’t think it was necessary in California? Or Jamiel, is there a dollar value you can put on this young man’s life? How do you quantify these lives? How about these law enforcement professionals? How about this teenage girl from Virginia Beach, Virginia? How about a firefighter and father of a 22 monthold and a 4yearold? How about a nun who devoted her entire life to serving others? How about a football player who worked his way up from the bottom and only wanted to motivate and inspire young people who faced challenging circumstances? I genuinely love my brothers and sisters of all races, creeds, and origins; I genuinely do. I welcome them to apply to a process to allow them to avail themselves of the benefits of, I believe, the greatest Nation the Earth has ever seen. Winston Churchill said: ‘‘Democracy was the worst form of government, except for all the others.’’ This is the worst country in the world, except for all the others. But if we won’t enforce the laws that we pass, who are we? What have we become? And if we won’t protect those people who protect us—firefighters, police officers, nuns, and mothers—how can we look at ourselves? Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. BUDD). Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague from Virginia for yielding. I really thank him for his leadership on this issue. The last time I spoke on this floor on immigration, I talked about three principles: One, Americans have the right to determine who becomes citizens through laws; two, the people who do come here should be in the best interest of American citizens; and three, that we have the right to enforce those choices. The people who do come here should be in the best interest of American citizens. That is key. What we are doing now isn’t there yet. We allow, today, one individual to get a green card. Then he is able to sponsor his immediate family and relatives. And then the relatives can sponsor their relatives. Then the relatives of those relatives can sponsor their relatives and so on, until there is no one in the family left to sponsor or no one left who 
even wants to come to the United States. Potentially, this could go on forever. This is called chain migration, and 65 percent of our green cards are awarded through this chain migration. That is about 700,000 people every year gaining permanent residence in our country through no other criteria than that they happen to be related to someone who lives here. We have no idea whether these individuals are going to be economically successful. We have no idea whether they will contribute to our country. We don’t even look at those characteristics for chain migration. The important question is who the immigrant is related to, not whether or not he might help America be a safer or a more prosperous country. Chain migration does not meet that key principle. American immigration should be in the best interest of Americans. The Securing America’s Future Act ends this chain migration. It stops it for everyone except the children and spouses of immigrants. But those relatives cannot bring in additional immigrants, so the chain is broken. The Securing America’s Future Act, in turn, replaces those immigrants with skilled workers, workers who could help us build a better future. I think about it this way: there are 150 million people around the world who would say that they would emigrate to the United States if they were just given the opportunity. What a great country. We could do what we do now and let those people enter on the basis of who they are related to. That is what we are doing. Or we could let in the best engineers, doctors, nurses, teachers, and businessmen. We can let in those who could speak English well, who know our system of government, who have gone to university. But that can only happen if we end chain migration. The chain migration proposal in the Securing America’s Future Act becomes even more crucial when we look at the DACA issue. If we allow DACA recipients to get some form of residency, past history tells us that they will potentially sponsor around 3
1⁄2immigrants each. That is a 2 to 3millionperson increase in the immigrant population. That is a huge incentive for future immigrants to come here illegally. b1300 The notion that you will get to bring your whole family over here if you manage to enter illegally is part of what led to the 2013–2014 border crisis. When the previous administration was rumored to be granting amnesty, tens of thousands of Latin American families sent their minor children north. It was a national emergency, and it overwhelmed the Border Patrol and the immigrant processing facilities there in the Southwest. We had to pass emergency appropriations just to process these individuals. Any DACA fix that does not also include additional border security and protections against those migrating this way, they could really see a similar crisis. Madam Speaker, the Securing America’s Future Act is an incredible piece of legislation. And while I have dwelt on its chain migration provisions—and there are many more worthy reforms— this bill cracks down on sanctuary cities, which my colleague mentioned earlier. It includes Kate’s Law to toughen penalties against those who are deported, come back to the United States, and commit crimes. It includes mandatory EVerify to crack down on businesses that break the law. It ends the diversity visa lottery, one of the most senseless Federal policies that I can think of. I thank Chairman GOODLATTE for his efforts on this; I thank Representative LABRADOR , one of our staunchest conservative leaders in the House, for his leadership in crafting this bill; and I thank Representative GARRETT for organizing this opportunity to discuss the bill. Mr. GARRETT. Madam Speaker, I thank Representative BUDD for his comments. At this time, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Florida, (Mr. YOHO). Mr. YOHO. Madam Speaker, I would like to thank my good colleague from Virginia (Mr. GARRETT ) and everybody else who has participated in this important topic. For far too long, Washington has allowed our broken immigration system to fester. Since 1986, when safeguards were put in place to protect our Nation from illegal immigration, we have seen the rule of law not followed, and it has led to the situation we have today. This is not an overnight sensation that just has happened. If you look at the number one role of government, it is to provide for the common defense of our Nation and the security of our Nation. Madam Speaker, you cannot have a secure nation if you don’t have secure borders. That is one of the reasons we lock our car doors. That is one of the reasons we lock our house doors is to secure our family. Well, the government’s role is to secure their Nation and the people within it so that we can have a secure nation, the peace of mind that our families are protected from people that shouldn’t be here in the first place. We need to reform our system so that we have legal immigration that is not burdensome to the point where it doesn’t work, and that is what Washington has been well known for. We need to seek real reforms that cut down on illegal immigration while protecting and bolstering the legal immigration system. Our Nation is a nation of immigrants, and Theodore Roosevelt addressed this, I think, very succinctly in 1907 in a speech when he talked about our land being a land of immigrants, how we have come over from other countries from around the world. But he also went on to say and talk about the values of America, that we, being a land of immigrants, understand this: There is but room for one flag. It is the American flag. You need to honor it. There is room but for one language. It is English. You need to learn it. Immigration without assimilation is an invasion, and that is really what we have, an invasion, because we don’t know who is here. We don’t know where they came from. And Dreamers who were brought here to this country, I think we are all sympathetic. They were brought here to this country at no fault of their own and registered with DHS under DACA. There is a program where they could have registered. They are a different class, but they can be handled in a systematic manner, whether it starts off with probationary periods, running background checks, ensuring all fines are paid for outstanding traffic tickets or other, among other things. And I stand with and I am a cosponsor of the GoodlatteLabrador bill. I think it is a great start. As immigration policies or as policies up here in Washington, we know they change over time, and so I think this is a good start. We need to strengthen our border— that needs to be paramount—and tighten our borders through what the Customs and Border Patrol tell us to do. You know, there are people who want to build a wall from sea to shining sea. I think we should build a wall where the experts say we need to build a wall and do other forms of security, but the bottom line is we have to have a secure border. And it is not just our southwest border; it is all of our borders. And I think every American should be concerned about this, and you would think they would want this. We also should allow Customs and Border Patrol to survey and make recommendations for how they think best we can increase the security of, again, not just our southern border but, again, all the borders. Sanctuary cities who openly defy Federal immigration law place American citizens at risk, and I would hope the people in those cities, the citizens of those cities, would rise up and hold their elected officials accountable so that it is not a political platform that a party wants to promote. All you have to do is look at the many people who have been killed by people here illegally, and they rush for the protection of a sanctuary city. And these are cities, again, that are breaking the Federal law. They defy Federal law without consequence. Congress does have the power to hold these people accountable, these States. And, again, it will be the citizens of those cities, hopefully, who will rise up and say enough is enough. The GoodlatteLabrador bill, H.R. 4760, the Securing America’s Future Act, I cosponsored because it lays out a plan to address many of the immigration reform priorities: It eliminates the diversity visa, which is just a happenstance. If you are the lucky one 
who pulls the right number, you get the lottery ticket, and the lottery ticket is coming here to America. It eliminates the diversity visa to increase the number of skilled worker visas. It creates a new agriculture guest worker program. And I am proud because some of the recommendations we have are in that bill, and so we want to see that pass. This is one of the things that has to happen. But before we can go forward, we have to make sure that the borders are secured, that the rule of law is enforced, and that we have a good guest worker program. It also requires employers to utilize the EVerify system to ensure their employees are legally able to work in this country. The good thing about the EVerify system, it also gives protection to the employer, knowing that they went through the process that the government says they must go through and they have hired people that the government says are okay. So it gives protection not just to our employers, but it gives protection to the people here, who come here for the privilege of coming to America to work. It invests in a new security measure for our borders, gives registered DACA recipients a renewable 3year legal status, while ensuring individuals who could cause harm are not eligible for it. It withholds grants and Federal funding from sanctuary cities and gets rid of the chain migration. So this, I think, is a very strong bill. I think it is a very good bill, that it accomplishes the goal. It could always be better. It is not comprehensive immigration reform, but it is a great start. You know, working in the agricultural sector for 35 years of my life as a veterinarian working on the farms, I talked to a lot of the immigrants, and a lot of the immigrants that I talked to were here illegally. And I asked them: Do you want to be a citizen of the United States? They said: No. The majority of them didn’t. They wanted the opportunity— the opportunity—to come here to make some money to go back home, and I think we should accommodate that. And then if you talk to other immigrants who are here and they migrated here legally, I asked them: Why did you come here? Why did your parents come here? And do you know what it always comes down to? They wanted opportunity, and they wanted security, and they wanted a better life for their family. So our broken system does not accomplish that, and it is time to fix the broken system, and this is the time to do it. With that, I thank the gentleman for bringing up this great topic, this passionate topic, and with your work, your help, we can accomplish this. Mr. GARRETT. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. YOHO), my friend and colleague, for his comments. In 42 years, 3,037 Americans have been killed on U.S. soil by foreignborn terrorists. There have been 182 foreign born terrorists, to be precise, who have taken the lives of almost 3,050 Americans, and 63 of those 182, or greater than a third, came here legally on visas, to include the diversity visa scheme. In fact, our office has tried relatively diligently to calculate the actual death toll of nativeborn Americans by recipients of diversity visas, unsuccessfully. These are difficult data points. But just in the last few years, the name Sayfullo Saipov has been in the American news. This jihadist who had an admiration for terrorists, to include the murderous raping, intolerant thugs of ISIS, took the lives of eight Americans and injured many more in a truck attack on Halloween, just last October. He was the recipient of a diversity lottery visa. Before that, Abdurasul Hasanovich Juraboev from Uzbekistan was also the recipient of a diversity lottery visa, and he was arrested in 2015 for conspiring to ‘‘kill as many Americans as he could.’’ He wrote: I am in the USA now. We don’t have the weapons we need. Is it possible to commit ourselves as dedicated martyrs anyway while here? What I am saying is, to get guns, to shoot Obama, and then maybe get shot ourselves. Would that do? That would strike fear into the hearts of the infidels. 
If this is not successful, maybe bomb Coney Island. 
Fortunately, he was arrested before he could bring to fruition his plans to assault individuals in the very Nation that had so graciously opened its doors. It is incredibly interesting to me the results that I learned when my wife and I engaged in that which is all the rage these days and looked at our DNA. I found out I had relatives from multiple continents, and I am proud of that. But I am an American just like those people who stood with me that day at the home of the great American patriot Patrick Henry, from Africa and Asia, the Middle East, South America, Europe, Oceania. They are my American brothers and sisters. They did everything by the numbers and availed themselves of a dream that we all share. Those who do not, cheapen the sacrifice made by so many who have come before them. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
SUCCEEDING ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. WOODALL ) for 30 minutes. Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I very much appreciate that, and I appreciate you being here with us on a Thursday afternoon. I know that you came to Congress with the same optimism that I came to Congress with, and that is, if only we work hard enough together, if only we commit ourselves with earnestness to one another, we will be able to make a difference for folks. I still believe that, and I hope you still believe that, too, after your time here. I still believe that, if only we work hard enough, we are going to be able to serve the American people as we promised we would. But occasionally—occasionally—I don’t want to vilify the entire fourth estate today, Madam Speaker. There is not enough time to go through that today. But occasionally, the fourth estate seems to suggest that we are failing the American people when, in fact, we are succeeding on their behalf, and that is what I want to talk about this afternoon. We just came through a difficult budget time, Madam Speaker. We came through that not because of any failures of any man or woman in this institution. I want to make that clear. This House came together as a body back in July of last year and passed every single national security appropriations bill that was upon us. b1315 July of last year—3 months before the end of the fiscal year—this body came together and did its job to fund our men and women in uniform, fund border security, and fund those incredibly important national security items that every single American family cares about. The Senate had been unable to get any of those bills passed. That brought us to just a week ago, when the President finally signed into law a funding bill for the United States Government to cover the remainder of fiscal year 2018. I mentioned the House passed, in July of last year, all of the national security appropriations bills. In September of last year, Madam Speaker, the House passed all the rest of the appropriations bills. So the entire Federal Government, from the perspective of the 435 men and women who serve in the House, that work was completed on time before the end of the fiscal year. But, again, the Senate was unable to take up any appropriations bills, for a variety of different reasons—and I am not interested in assigning that blame today. I am interested in figuring out what we can do about it going forward—took until just a week ago for the Senate to sign an appropriations bill, craft a plan, and do what we call raising the caps so that we can get a funding agreement that will take us over the next 18 months. Madam Speaker, you can’t see it here, but I have a chart of defense spending going back over the last few years. In fact, I started the chart the year that I was running for Congress for the very first time. It was 2010. I came in in that big class of freshmen. There were 100 of us. Imagine that: 100 
out of 435 Members, coming in for the first time, together, in January of 2011, and many of us came here with a desire to balance budgets. Among the many data points that get shared, Madam Speaker, one was shared with me when I was doing C– SPAN’s Washington Journal this week. The host said: ROB, do you think the era of fiscal conservatism is over? I thought that was odd. I am thinking: No, I serve in a body full of men and women, both sides of the aisle, fiscal conservatives, who want to make sure the American taxpayer is getting a dollar’s worth of value for a dollar’s worth of taxes, who want to make sure we are not balancing the budget on the backs of our children and grandchildren, and who want to make sure we are not mortgaging the future of our children and our grandchildren. Why would the era of fiscal conservatism be over? Well, the suggestion was made it is because we just signed a budget deal, and that budget deal raises levels of discretionary spending in this country; and if we are raising levels of discretionary spending, mustn’t that mean that our commitment to fiscal responsibility is over? That led me to come to the floor today, Madam Speaker, because what you can’t see on this chart, but I have displayed here, are two lines. One is a red line. Oftentimes, Madam Speaker, folks bring charts to the floor that only show you a part of the picture, so the amplitude is exaggerated. It looks like things are worse or better than they actually are. I have grounded my chart at zero. This is zero dollars in spending, going all the way up to $1 trillion in spending. The year I got here, we were spending about $689 billion a year on defense. Well, we got together as a body, Madam Speaker. And, I will remind you, Republicans controlled the U.S. House at that time. President Obama controlled the White House, Harry Reid controlled the United States Senate, and the House was in minority hands, being led by Republicans. But we got together, Republicans and Democrats— House, Senate, White House—and we crafted a budget plan forward that reduced spending. Now, the plan was that we were going to reduce spending on both the defense side of the ledger and the nondefense side of the ledger, and then we were going to come together and deal with those major healthcare entitlement programs that are driving the debt far out into the future, deal with the trust funds for Medicare and Social Security that are underfunded today that cannot sustain the promises that have been made to generations today, that we would repair those programs and make them solvent long into the future. It was a worthwhile goal. It was a goal worthy of this body, men and women—Republicans, Democrats, House Members, Senate Members—who came together. But what you can see on this chart, Madam Speaker, is the black line indicates the path we took of funding national security, each year, spending less and less and less. Now, mind you, nobody thought this was the right plan for how to fund national security. This was designed to be a driver to force folks to come together and deal with those larger entitlement programs that actually are the drivers of the debt. It didn’t work. In fact, we had an entire Presidential election cycle that just went on 15 months ago, Madam Speaker, where you can’t name the candidate who ran on either the Republican or the Democratic side of the aisle, who made debt and deficits their priority. Who was that? Who was that leader running for the White House, the last time around, who focused on debt and deficits as their priorities? For whatever reason, it slipped from the national stage, probably because we had been successfully curbing the needle on spending. So, fast forward, to just a week ago, Madam Speaker, where we raised defense spending by $100 billion a year. Now, if you calculate where the caps were going to go and how the sequester was going to happen, you actually turn out to have about a $150 billion increase over where folks expected us to be. Well, golly, Madam Speaker, even in Washington, D.C., when you raise a $550 billion budget to $700 billion, that is an enormous increase. That is why I was asked: Is the era of fiscal conservatism over? I direct you to this chart, I show you this enormous increase in defense spending, and I show you that we are still $100 billion a year lower than Barack Obama, NANCY PELOSI , and Harry Reid had anticipated before I was elected to Congress in 2010. All of this area, between the red line and the black line, Madam Speaker, are dollars saved for the American people. Now, those dollars came at a price. I reference testimony that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, former General Jim Mattis, gave in the Armed Services Committee—this was just a week and 2 days ago—and he said this: ‘‘I cannot overstate the impact to our troops’ morale from all this uncertainty.’’ He is talking about these continuing resolutions that get passed. Again, the House passed its bills back last July, the Senate hasn’t been able to pass any of its bills, so we were funding the government one shortterm bill at the time, creating havoc on the American military. ‘‘I cannot overstate the impact to our troops’ morale from all this uncertainty. The combination of rapidly changing technology, the negative impact on military readiness resulting from the longest continuous stretch of combat in our Nation’s history, and insufficient funding have created an overstretched and underresourced military.’’ I don’t believe there is a man or woman in this Chamber, Madam Speaker, who would disagree with that, ‘‘an overstretched and underresourced military,’’ or ‘‘the longest continuous stretch of combat in our Nation’s history.’’ This is not an issue that divides this Chamber, this is an issue that unites this Chamber, Madam Speaker. I am proud that we came together, as a House and a Senate, as Republicans and Democrats, to address that failure. In fact, I will quote from General Mattis. Just two days after that morale quote, after this body had acted, after the Senate had finally acted, after the President had put his signature on the bill, General Mattis said this: ‘‘I am very confident that what the Congress has now done and the President is going to allocate to us in the budget is what we need to bring us back to a position of primacy.’’ ‘‘What the Congress has done and what the President will allocate will bring us back to a position of primacy,’’ I mention that again, Madam Speaker, because, among the many conversations we have here about military readiness, General Mattis has expressed confidence that, in a time of war, the Congress would fund the military. In fact, in that same testimony that I quoted from earlier before the Armed Services Committee, he said: ‘‘I know that in time of a major war, Congress will provide our military with what it needs. But money at the time of crisis fails to deter war. . . .’’ I know the Congress will provide what we need in a time of crisis, but money at a time of crisis fails to deter that crisis. We could have avoided that conflict had only we been properly funded. We came together with White House leadership. The President said: I need $700 billion for 2018; I need $716 billion for 2019. That is what General Mattis said as well. That is what we are hearing from the entire administration. That is what we came together and gave. But the era of fiscal conservatism, Madam Speaker, is not over. The era of shortchanging our military, in the hopes that we might come together on a bigger deal, the gridlock that was created by that, that gridlock is over. That uncertainty that General Mattis bemoaned, that is over. But fiscal conservatism continues. It is not just on the defense side. It is easy to talk about the defense side because I know that is something that unites everyone in the Chamber, Madam Speaker. But let’s look at the nondefense side. Nondefense, as you know, Madam Speaker, is, well, everything else that the Federal Government does—it is not an income support program—from parks to roads to courts, from prisons to education, from investments in NIH and the CDC, from our involvement overseas in hunger programs and refugee programs. Absolutely everything 
else the Federal Government does is in the nondefense discretionary side. I point you to two lines, once again, Madam Speaker. The red line is what President Obama, Speaker PELOSI , AND MAJORITY LEADER HARRY REID ANTICI PATED SPENDING BEFORE I ARRIVED . THE 
SPENT SINCE I ARRIVED . Among the many changes made in the law, when the President signed the caps deals into effect last week, is that we raised nondefense discretionary spending, too. In fact, over the 2year deal that the President signed, we are talking about an additional $300 billion—billion with a B—in additional spending. Well, by golly, Madam Speaker, if you care about budgets, if you care about deficits, isn’t $300 billion a frighteningly large figure to increase spending in a time of already existing deficits? Of course, it is. Of course, it is. But let me say, once again, that does not mean the era of fiscal conservatism is over. We had a choice. We could continue to keep the military in that space of uncertainty that General Mattis cited as being so dangerous, or we could cut the deal that we had to cut to break that cycle of uncertainty. I don’t know what kind of negotiating experience you have had, Madam Speaker, but it turns out that when you walk into a negotiation and say, ‘‘I have got to have what I have got to have, and I will give you whatever you need in order to get it,’’ you are not in a particularly strong negotiating spot. That is the position the President found himself in. He was 100 percent committed to our troops, he was 100 percent committed to national security, he was 100 percent committed to that pay raise that we had promised our troops, but we had not funded, and he said: I am going to do whatever it takes to get $700 billion in 2018 and $716 billion in 2019, to make sure national security is protected and our troops are served. Well, what that led to was an increase in nondefense discretionary spending as well, Madam Speaker. But still look at these lines. That delta between the top line of where we were going to go and the black line of where we have actually gone is trillions of dollars’—trillions with a T—worth of savings. Between the defense spending, Madam Speaker, which changed dramatically after that big freshman class in 2011 arrived, and nondefense spending, which changed dramatically after that big class in 2011 arrived, trillions of dollars in debt has not occurred. Trillions of dollars in spending of American taxpayer dollars has not occurred. We have squeezed those budgets: the security budget and the nonsecurity budget, the defense budget and the nondefense budget. We have squeezed each of those budgets to make sure that we are getting a dollar’s worth of value for the American taxpayer out of every dollar that we spend. The net result of that, Madam Speaker—that and a collection of economic outcomes that have been desirable— has led to a decrease in net interest spending: money that was not borrowed, interest that does not have to be paid—money that was not borrowed. Thus it didn’t drive interest rates up. Those interest rates are lower on all the other money that has already been borrowed, not just trillions of dollars in savings on spending that was foregone, Madam Speaker, but trillions of dollars in savings of interest that was not paid. b1330 Why do I take the time to come down to the floor to tell that story, Mr. Speaker? It is because I grow weary, as I know all of my colleagues do, of reading the defeatist headlines that show up on the paper day after day after day: Congress failing; gridlock prevailing; bipartisanship dead; cooperation extinct. It is not true. What we have done together is worth bragging about back home. What we have done together is worth celebrating when we are together. What we have done together is worth using as a model for thinking about what we can do together again tomorrow. It doesn’t matter whether you sit on the furthest right in this Chamber or the furthest left in this Chamber, Mr. Speaker. That dollar worth of taxes raised from that American citizen is a valuable thing. It is a trust. There is a stewardship obligation to each and every one of those dollars. What do you want to use it for? Maybe you want to give it back to those American citizens. I am particularly pleased with the tax bill we passed that did exactly that. Again, passed it in the House, passed it in the Senate, moved it to the White House; done in a bicameral way. I think the American citizen can generally spend their dollar better than we can spend it on their behalf. I know they trust themselves to spend their dollar more than they trust us to spend it on their behalf. We could take that dollar, we could put it back in an American citizen’s pocket. Leave it with them to begin with and never even take it. That is what we did with the tax cuts. We could invest that dollar in national security. We could look to see what is that additional training an airman might need; what is that additional equipment that a marine might need; what is that additional item that we could research, purchase, improve, repair, that would make a difference in the life of a man or a woman who is serving this country. We could spend that dollar on national security. We could spend that dollar on nondefense needs; research in Alzheimer’s; research at our major universities; research into that next generational transportation outcome that is going to change the way that we deal with congestion in America. There are 1,000 different ways to spend each and every one of those dollars. It does not matter where you believe that dollar ought to go. It is a worthwhile purchase to make sure we are using that dollar, either with the American citizen in their pocket, with the DOD in the pursuit of national security, or with one of our great research institutions in pursuit of the next healthcare discovery, rather than paying it in interest to someone around the globe who lent us money in our time of need. We need to restrain those dollars today, Mr. Speaker, so that when we have a time of need in the future, we will be able to access them. The era of fiscal responsibility is not behind us; it is upon us. We have an opportunity each and every day together to squeeze those dollars until they scream; squeeze the value out of every nickel that comes through this institution. We have done it together, Mr. Speaker. This isn’t an aspirational goal. This is a certain fact, that we have done it together year after year after year after year. This isn’t something that maybe one day, if only we work hard enough, we can do. This is something we have achieved year after year after year after year. Let’s not stop. Let’s not stop. And let’s not let folks tell us that we can’t get it done together. Let’s not give in to that devil on the left shoulder that says we should go down and run each other out and talk about why the institution fails. Let’s give in to that angel on the right shoulder that talks about how, if we put our minds together, if we commit ourselves to one another, there is genuinely no limit to what we can do together. I am not just talking about what we can do together as the body here in the United States House, Mr. Speaker. And I am not just talking about what we can do together as a House and a Senate and a White House. I am talking about what we can do together as the American people. The strength of this institution has never been the 435 Members who are in it. It has been the 300 million Americans who have sent us here. The strength of this institution has never come from the Members. It has come from the Nation that lends us its power. I genuinely believe there is no limit to what we can do together. I am genuinely disappointed in those days that we give in to that devil on the left shoulder that tells us that running each other out, running each other down, denigrating the institution, denigrating the Nation, denigrating one another is the pathway to success. But we have had enough victories together. We have come through enough challenges together. When they said we 
would fail, we have succeeded together enough that I have great optimism not just about the next 10 months in this Chamber, but about the next decade, the next generation, the next hundred years for this country. We don’t know when the economy is going to fail us, Mr. Speaker. We have to plan for that rainy day. We have been doing that. We have been doing it with spending at every single level in the government, and it has made the biggest difference in debt and deficits that I have seen in my lifetime. Let’s build on that success. Let’s recommit ourselves to that goal. Let’s surprise the naysayers about the things that we do together. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
