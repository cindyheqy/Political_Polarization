Mr. REED. Mr. Speaker, I rise to today to recognize the commissioning of the newest combat ship to be added to the United States Navy, the USS Little Rock (LCS–9). This three hundred and eightynine foot littoral combat ship is named in honor of the previous USS Little Rock, which began service in 1944 and was taken out of service in 1976, subsequently being converted into a floating museum. This commissioning ceremony in Buffalo, New York, is the first time in the history of the United States Navy that a ship has been commissioned next to its namesake. It serves as a moment to remember the proud history of the United States Navy as well as the brave men and women who have served, and continue to serve our country at sea. I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the commissioning of the USS Little Rock and wishing success and safety to all of her future crew members as they serve and protect our great nation and advance the cause of liberty around the world. 
MOTION TO CONCUR IN THE SENATE AMENDMENT WITH AN AMENDMENT TO H.R. 1370—FURTHER CONTINUING RESOLUTION FOR FY2018 AND H.R. 4667—MAKING FURTHER SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, FOR DISASTER ASSISTANCE FOR HURRICANES HARVEY, IRMA, AND MARIA, AND CALENDAR YEAR 2017 WILDFIRES 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, it is no secret that the Republican majority has utterly failed to govern responsibly and has neglected the needs of the American people. The federal government’s fiscal year started three months ago, and since then House Republicans have accomplished nothing except to pass their deficit busting taxscam for big corporations and billionaires. In the meantime, they have held hostage a full year of funding for our government and failed to extend critical healthcare programs like the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP). So here we are debating H.R. 1370, a third continuing resolution that attempts to paper over the failures of this Republican Congress. Mr. Speaker, this is simply intolerable to my constituents. H.R. 1370 contains billions in defense ‘‘anomalies’’ that are not subject to the discretionary spending caps and have not had a single hearing in the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense. Democrats have been ready for months to strike a bipartisan agreement to raise the caps for defense and nondefense spending with parity. Bypassing the defense cap with new spending in H.R. 1370 is unacceptable. H.R. 1370 fails to include a bipartisan reauthorization of the Children’s Health Insurance Program, continuing the uncertainty and fear that 9 million children and their families who depend on the program face. The funding provided for CHIP in this bill would only fund the program through March, 2018, and would be offset with cuts to other critical healthcare programs like the Prevention and Public Health Fund. Every American should be offended that Republicans have spent their time passing tax cuts for the rich while the medical needs of children are cast aside. H.R. 1370 also temporarily extends surveillance authorities under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, including FISA Section 702. In 2012, I did not vote to extend these authorities when they were reauthorized out of a concern for how the privacy of the American people would be impacted. Since 2012, there has been no effort to address my concerns, so I cannot support an extension of FISA in the current form. Finally, while I am glad to see that a serious conversation has begun on separate legislation that would provide additional emergency disaster relief for areas impacted by this year’s hurricane season (H.R. 4667), I am deeply concerned that the bill fails to fix a Medicaid funding shortfall in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. If this is not addressed early in the next session of Congress, thousands of Americans will be at risk of losing access to critical healthcare programs in 2018. The federal government has a responsibility to provide the same standard of federal assistance to the American citizens living in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands as it does to states. As we debate this today, the Senate has already indicated they will not take up H.R. 4667 due to these same concerns. Mr. Speaker, Republicans need to stop lurching from crisis to crisis. These problems require bipartisan solutions, and we know from history that the only way appropriations bills are enacted into law is when Republicans and Democrats reach an agreement on funding levels. So I urge my Republican colleagues to put forward appropriate funding levels for all twelve appropriations bills and finally work with Democrats to meet the challenges our nation faces.
