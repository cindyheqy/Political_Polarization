RECOGNIZING THE COMMIS-SIONING OF THE USS ‘‘LITTLE ROCK’’ 
HON. TOM REED 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, December 22, 2017 Mr. REED. Mr. Speaker, I rise to today to recognize the commissioning of the newest combat ship to be added to the United States Navy, the USS Little Rock (LCS–9). This three hundred and eighty-nine foot lit-toral combat ship is named in honor of the previous USS Little Rock, which began service in 1944 and was taken out of service in 1976, subsequently being converted into a floating museum. This commissioning ceremony in Buffalo, New York, is the first time in the history of the United States Navy that a ship has been com-missioned next to its namesake. It serves as a moment to remember the proud history of the United States Navy as well as the brave men and women who have served, and con-tinue to serve our country at sea. I ask my colleagues to join me in recog-nizing the commissioning of the USS Little Rock and wishing success and safety to all of her future crew members as they serve and protect our great nation and advance the cause of liberty around the world.

MOTION TO CONCUR IN THE SEN-ATE AMENDMENT WITH AN AMENDMENT TO H.R. 1370—FUR-THER CONTINUING RESOLUTION FOR FY2018 AND H.R. 4667—MAK-ING FURTHER SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE FIS-CAL YEAR ENDING SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, FOR DISASTER ASSIST-ANCE FOR HURRICANES HAR-VEY, IRMA, AND MARIA, AND CALENDAR YEAR 2017 WILDFIRES 
HON. BETTY McCOLLUM 
OF MINNESOTA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, December 22, 2017 Ms. M
CCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, it is no se-cret that the Republican majority has utterly failed to govern responsibly and has neglected the needs of the American people. The federal government’s fiscal year started three months ago, and since then House Republicans have accomplished nothing except to pass their def-icit busting tax-scam for big corporations and billionaires. In the meantime, they have held hostage a full year of funding for our govern-ment and failed to extend critical healthcare programs like the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP). So here we are debating H.R. 1370, a third continuing resolution that attempts to paper over the failures of this Re-publican Congress. Mr. Speaker, this is simply intolerable to my constituents. H.R. 1370 contains billions in defense ‘‘anomalies’’ that are not subject to the discre-tionary spending caps and have not had a sin-gle hearing in the House Appropriations Sub-committee on Defense. Democrats have been ready for months to strike a bipartisan agree-ment to raise the caps for defense and non-defense spending with parity. Bypassing the defense cap with new spending in H.R. 1370 is unacceptable. H.R. 1370 fails to include a bipartisan reau-thorization of the Children’s Health Insurance Program, continuing the uncertainty and fear that 9 million children and their families who depend on the program face. The funding pro-vided for CHIP in this bill would only fund the program through March, 2018, and would be offset with cuts to other critical healthcare pro-grams like the Prevention and Public Health Fund. Every American should be offended that Republicans have spent their time passing tax cuts for the rich while the medical needs of children are cast aside. H.R. 1370 also temporarily extends surveil-lance authorities under the Foreign Intel-ligence Surveillance Act, including FISA Sec-tion 702. In 2012, I did not vote to extend these authorities when they were reauthorized out of a concern for how the privacy of the American people would be impacted. Since 2012, there has been no effort to address my concerns, so I cannot support an extension of FISA in the current form. Finally, while I am glad to see that a serious conversation has begun on separate legisla-tion that would provide additional emergency disaster relief for areas impacted by this year’s hurricane season (H.R. 4667), I am deeply concerned that the bill fails to fix a Medicaid funding shortfall in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. If this is not addressed early in the next session of Congress, thousands of Americans will be at risk of losing access to critical healthcare programs in 2018. The fed-eral government has a responsibility to provide the same standard of federal assistance to the American citizens living in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands as it does to states. As we debate this today, the Senate has already indi-cated they will not take up H.R. 4667 due to these same concerns. Mr. Speaker, Republicans need to stop lurching from crisis to crisis. These problems require bipartisan solutions, and we know from history that the only way appropriations bills are enacted into law is when Republicans and Democrats reach an agreement on funding levels. So I urge my Republican colleagues to put forward appropriate funding levels for all twelve appropriations bills and finally work with Democrats to meet the challenges our nation faces. APPLICABILITY OF THE FEDERAL EXCISE TAX ON AIR TRANSPOR-TATION TO AIRCRAFT MANAGE-MENT SERVICES COMPANIES HON. JAMES B. RENACCI 
OF OHIO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, December 22, 2017 Mr. RENACCI. Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Ways and Means Committee, I rise today to speak on the Congressional intent behind the exemption for aircraft management services (AMS) companies from the federal excise tax (FET) on air transportation included in Section 13822 of H.R. 1. This provision is based on H.R. 896, sponsored by Congress-man T
IBERI and co-sponsored by myself. AMS companies are paid to manage and maintain fleets of private aircraft, a service that is non-commercial. The FET on air trans-portation, on the other hand, is considered an airline ticket tax which commercial airline cus-tomers pay when they purchase a commercial airline ticket. Congress is exempting AMS companies from the FET on air transportation because fees paid for the maintenance and management of private aircraft are not analo-gous to the purchase of a commercial airline ticket. Likewise, Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) Part 91 recognizes that AMS compa-nies provide non-commercial aircraft oper-ations and thus are generally only subject to federal fuel taxes, and not the FET on air transportation. We included Sec. 13822 in H.R. 1 because the IRS has pursued a number of AMS com-panies for collection of the FET on air trans-portation. The result has been inconsistent outcomes, creating winners and losers among similarly situated AMS companies. To clarify the law, which has become quite muddled in this area, H.R. 1 seeks to set the record straight regarding the applicability of the FET on air transportation to AMS companies. In conjunction with prior legislation, H.R. 1 makes clear that the FET on air transportation is not applicable to payments for the manage-ment of aircraft that are wholly-owned, frac-tionally owned, or that belong to a fractional program. As such, with the enactment of H.R. 1, the IRS should cease its efforts to collect the FET on air transportation from AMS com-panies. The IRS should not infer that Congress be-lieves the FET on air transportation did apply to management fees paid to AMS companies prior to enactment of H.R. 1. On the contrary, Congress is finally clarifying an area of law that has become muddled, resulted in incon-sistent enforcement, and created winners and losers among similarly situated AMS companies.

HON. CEDRIC L. RICHMOND 
OF LOUISIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, December 22, 2017 Mr. RICHMOND. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of Mrs. Girlia E. White Sanders, a native of New Orleans, Lou-isiana, who passed away on December 19, 2017, at the age of 79. Mrs. Sanders loved the city and the people of New Orleans. Her legacy will forever be a part of the city and her dedication to commu-nity embodies the spirit of New Orleans. We cannot match the sacrifices made by Mrs. Sanders, but surely we can try to match her sense of service. We cannot match her cour-age, but we can strive to match her devotion. Mrs. Girlia E. White Sander’s survivors in-clude her husband of sixty years, Pastor Leroy Sanders, Sr.; six children, Janice S. Bennett, Connie S. Brider, Leroy, Jr. (Treva) Sanders, Diana S. (Eugene, Jr.) Barnes, Leslie S (Rahman) Martin and Pastor Dale J. Sr. (Kim-berly) Sanders; seventeen grandchildren, Clar-ence Bennett, Jr., Rev. Lorenzo (Carrie) Ben-nett, Antoine Bennett, Sr., Jazmm (Kendrick, Sr.) White, Monika Arceneaux, Leroy Regis Sanders, Javalyn Session, Ashley Brider, Gerae Vallery, Christian Booker, Eugene, III and Jaren Barnes, Destiny Estean, Jordan and Dale Sanders II, Kwinci Martin and Jeri-cho Ehsha Sanders; one honorary grandson, Minister Clyde Davis, Jr.; nine great-grand-children and one great-great grandchild; five sisters, two brothers, four brothers-in-law, four sisters-in-law, and a host of nieces, nephews, relatives and friends. Mr. Speaker, I celebrate the life and legacy of Mrs. Girha E. White Sanders a beloved wife, mother, grandmother, aunt, and daugh-ter.
