Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and work of Mrs. Sallie Baldwin Howard, a great North Carolinian, a nationally recognized academic, and a dear family friend. At 102 years old, Mrs. Howard transitioned to her heavenly home on Tuesday, September 25, 2018. Our community in Wilson, North Carolina, has lost a giant and a friend. Mr. Speaker, Mrs. Sallie Baldwin Howard was born on March 23, 1916, right in the midst of World War I, in Wilson, North Carolina, to Narcissus and Marcellus Sims. Even though I did not know Mr. Sims, I certainly knew Ms. Narcissus Sims Townsend, who lived directly across the street from me as a child. Though she was raised in the Jim Crow South as the daughter of sharecroppers, Mrs. Howard graduated as valedictorian from Wilson Colored High School, later renamed Charles H. Darden High School, in 1938, the same school that I graduated from in 1965. She attended Kittrell Junior College in Kittrell, North Carolina, before earning both a bachelor’s and a master’s degree in education from Hunter College in New York City. She also did extensive study at the New School of Social Research, as well as Columbia University. Mr. Speaker, Mrs. Howard taught for nearly 30 years as a firstgrade teacher in New York City. While there, she worked in the New York City American Negro Theater, which helped launch the careers of the likes of Sidney Poitier, Harry Belafonte, Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee, and Esther Rolle. There, she honed her acting and directing and writing talents, finding her voice through her art. Mrs. Howard’s offBroadway play, ‘‘The Passing of a Dinosaur,’’ is still performed today in local schools. Upon her retirement, Mrs. Howard returned to her beloved Wilson, North Carolina, where she became an active member of St. John African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, which is a church that just celebrated its 150th anniversary this past weekend, and I had an opportunity to speak for that program. She led the Christian education department and the church honor roll to encourage academic excellence among the youth in her community. Along with many other projects, Mrs. Howard founded the youth enrichment program with my good friend, Dr. JoAnne Woodard, in 1989, focusing the program on lasting scholarship, a commitment to the cultural heritage of African Americans, and promoting the arts. Mrs. Howard’s tireless work to enrich her community inspired Dr. JoAnne Woodard to create the Sallie B. Howard School for the Arts and Education in Wilson, naming the school in Mrs. Howard’s honor. Established in 1997, the Sallie B. Howard School for the Arts and Education is one of the first public charter schools in the State of North Carolina, and the only charter school to open in Wilson County after legislation passed in 1997 to approve charter schools in our State. The school, along with the youth enrichment program, has been an invaluable asset to our community. Mr. Speaker, the school’s mission is to provide every child, privileged or underprivileged, the kind of education that nutures students’ gifts, talents, and potential to become more than they ever thought they could be. At Sallie B. Howard School, they prepare students for careers in the performing arts, science, and humanities. They are a school to behold. Established as an academic and as a writer, Mr. Speaker, and as a playwright, avid traveler, and educator, Mrs. Howard used her vast array of talents and expertise to leave a lasting impact on thousands in our communities. Two years ago, we had the awesome opportunity to celebrate Mrs. Sallie B. Howard’s 100th birthday, and this picture that I have with me today depicts that moment as I escorted her into the auditorium of the school. We will have very fond memories of that day when she reached 100 years old. 
Finally, beyond her academic contributions, what is more illuminating of Mrs. Howard’s character was the way she connected with her students and her friends. She took a personal interest in the scholarship and mentorship of the youth that went far beyond success in the classroom. This is, indeed, a solemn occasion, but it is also an occasion to celebrate. At 102 years old, Mrs. Sallie B. Howard fought the good fight, served her community, and was a friend and mentor to many. I am thankful to God that she was able to touch so many lives. May she rest in peace. She now belongs to the ages. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating the extraordinary life, work, and legacy of Sallie Baldwin Howard. 
SUPPORT TAX REFORM 2.0 The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON ) for 5 minutes. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, last week, as I traveled the communities of my congressional district, I witnessed and saw firsthand the evidence of the great American comeback: the amount of jobs, the job growth that was available, the increase in wages, individuals who have left one job for what we call a new job, a better job, higher wages. The economic growth was absolutely incredible and inspiring, the great American comeback. Since the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was passed last December, the results in our economy have been historic. The unemployment rate is at 3.9 percent, the lowest it has been in decades. Job openings are at a record high. 213,000 jobs were added in June alone in this great Nation. In June, there were 6.7 million job openings—most recently reported, we are at 6.9 million job openings—marking the first time since 2000 that there have been more job openings than those who are unemployed. Over the past 12 months, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has added more than 65,000 new jobs. I witnessed a lot of those in my visits to manufacturers, refineries, and small businesses. It is just incredible, this great American comeback. Mr. Speaker, after years of struggling to get ahead, the American people are seeing more jobs, opportunity, and optimism come back. Smallbusiness owners are reporting increased employment and higher wages at record levels. Main Streets across America are thriving. People have more money in their paychecks, and the tax cuts are working for the middle class. Today and Friday, this House will vote on three bills and make the tax cuts permanent, make the great American comeback permanent. We need to double down on the success and pass tax reform 2.0. Through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we have doubled the standard deduction and lowered tax rates, which means that 90 percent of Americans are seeing more money in their paychecks this year. Plus, more than 4 million Americans at 642 companies see better wages, bonuses, and expanded retirement options. In fact, more than half of small businesses have plans to expand and boost hiring or increase employee benefits. This is tremendous news for American families. Too many Americans have been living paycheck to paycheck and have been doing so for way too long. Stagnant wages, growing debt, and the inability to save have plagued so many. Tax reform 2.0 will create and expand additional programs to help Americans save. For example, it creates a new savings account to offer a fully flexible savings tool that families can use at any time. It expands the 529 education savings accounts. It creates a new baby savings program to help with the birth of a child or an adoption. Mr. Speaker, I fundamentally believe that Americans should keep more of their hardearned money. They deserve that. Thanks to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Congress paved the way to create a tax system that is fairer, simpler, and one that establishes an environment where our country can thrive. We worked hard to do that. On Friday, we will vote to make those tax cuts permanent. If you support higher wages, if you support lower unemployment, if you support more jobs, if you support bigger paychecks, if you support the American people, then you will support tax reform 2.0. 
RECOGNIZING HOWARD SIMON The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ ) for 5 minutes. Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to recognize the tremendous and meaningful work of Howard Simon, executive director of the ACLU of Florida. Mr. Simon is retiring this year following a distinguished career defending civil rights and civil liberties that lasted longer than that of any other ACLU leader in the country. Prior to his appointment as executive director of the Florida affiliate in 1997, Mr. Simon led the fight to defend civil rights and civil liberties in Michigan, where he served as ACLU director for 23 years. His 21 years at the ACLU of Florida make him the longest serving ACLU director in the country, and his cumulative 44year career as a State director is the longest in the ACLU’s 98year history. As a student at City College of New York in 1965, Mr. Simon joined fellow student leaders to travel to Selma, Alabama, to march for voting rights alongside Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. This experience started a decadeslong career fighting for the rights guaranteed to all Americans under the United States Constitution. In his time as executive director at the ACLU of Florida, Mr. Simon oversaw landmark work defending the rights of LGBTQ Floridians, protecting immigrants, reforming our criminal justice system, protecting free speech, preserving women’s health, and strengthening the right to vote. The rights that Floridians enjoy would not be the same without the tireless work of this champion of liberty. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to call Howard Simon my dear friend, and I join my fellow Floridians in thanking him for his thoughtful and compassionate work to safeguard our civil liberties and for helping to make the United States a more perfect union for us all. f 
RECOGNIZING PAUL AND SWANEE DIMARE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN ) for 5 minutes. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, on October 2, the Dade County Farm Bureau is proud to honor Paul and Swanee DiMare, an agriculture powerhouse couple hailing from our south Florida community. For more than 90 years, the DiMare family has graced south Florida by providing some of the best quality produce our Nation has to offer, so much, in fact, that they have earned the title of Mr. and Mrs. Tomato. But where some may know them for their tasty and nutritious products alone, others know them for their worldclass philanthropy and public service. From protecting our beautiful botanical gardens, to advocating for organizations like the Red Cross, Paul and Swanee continue to serve as an inspiration to all those who call our slice of paradise home. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to recognize this extraordinary couple, and I thank Paul and Swanee for their tireless work in our community. 
Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the Alzheimer’s Association 2018 Walk to End Alzheimer’s in MiamiDade, being held in my congressional district on November 3. According to the Alzheimer’s Association, more than 5.7 million Americans are battling this brutal condition, 200,000 of whom are under the age of 65. b1015 Moreover, this disease is the sixth leading cause of death in our Nation. Sadly, Alzheimer’s, currently, cannot be cured, cannot be prevented, and cannot be slowed. That is why advocacy and awareness are paramount. Although scientific and medical advancements to fight the effects of dementia have made significant progress, we must not, and we cannot, rest. That 
is why this walk is being held to remind us all that the struggle continues. Day after day, we must continue to raise the benchmark and ensure that progress toward effective treatment and a cure continue. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my south Florida community to soak up some Sun—safely—on November 3 for a good cause, and participate in the Alzheimer’s Association MiamiDade Walk. Together, we can take the first step in a world without Alzheimer’s. 
Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize September as Alopecia Areata Awareness Month. Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disease, resulting in the loss of hair on the body, affecting about 7 million Americans. Additionally, of the 7 million Americans battling alopecia, almost 15 percent—or just over 1 million—are under 12 years of age. This is because alopecia often presents itself at an early stage in life, with no warning and no prevention to be had. It appears on the skin, most often as one or more small, round, smooth patches of hair loss on the scalp, and can progress to total hair loss. My constituent, Deirdre Nero, first informed me of the effects and seriousness of alopecia. Deirdre, who has alopecia, is a legislative liaison and secretary of the board for the National Alopecia Areata Foundation. Earlier this month, Deirdre and her fellow NAAF participants were on Capitol Hill advocating on behalf of a bill, H.R. 2925, that is called Legislation to Provide Coverage for Wigs As Durable Medical Equipment under the Medicare Program. That bill title says it all. It is a commonsense reform bill that will make a simple change to the definition of durable medical equipment under the Social Security Act to include cranial prosthetics, alleviating large outofpocket expenses for patients. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to have championed this cause during my time in Congress, and I am thankful for the work that the National Alopecia Areata Foundation continues to do on behalf of all patients. Furthermore, I humbly ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in recognizing Alopecia Areata Awareness Month and support this important legislation. 
COUNTRY ROADS ARE CALLING ME HOME The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. JENKINS ) for 5 minutes. Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I have been blessed these last 4 years to represent the people of West Virginia’s Third Congressional District, but now country roads are calling me home. My State is facing a crisis in our judicial system, and I believe back home is where I am needed most to best serve the people of West Virginia. This Sunday, I will be stepping down from the people’s House to serve as a justice beginning Monday on our State Supreme Court. We are proud West Virginians, always working to make sure the State we love is the very best it can be, and taking care of one another when times are tough. In Congress, I have tried to use that Mountain State cando spirit to help West Virginia grow and prosper. Here are just a few examples. Helping newborn babies. We have worked to help the most innocent victims of the drug crisis: newborn babies exposed to drugs during pregnancy. The cry of a precious, tiny baby suffering through withdrawal is heartbreaking. We were able to cut through Federal red tape and pass legislation, signed by the President, so facilities like Lily’s Place can help children get a healthy start in life. Protecting miner’s healthcare. Our government made a promise to our miners: You go into the bowels of the Earth, mine the coal that fuels our Nation, forge the steel that won world wars, and we will guarantee you a secure healthcare benefit. We kept that promise, passing legislation protecting healthcare for our retirees and their widows. As go the roads, so go the jobs. As a member of the House Appropriations Committee, I helped fund the FAST Act, bringing $2.5 billion of funding just to West Virginia. Now, we are fixing our roads and bridges, and investing in water and sewer infrastructure, transitioning the West Virginia economy. We are bringing broadband to our State in rural parts. Growing more jobs. My motto is a good job solves a lot of problems. You can feel hope and opportunity returning to the hills of West Virginia. In fact, our 2017 economic growth rate was one of the highest in the country. I will never forget standing in the Oval Office with President Trump, surrounded by our hardworking coal miners, as he signed the legislation I helped pass that saved onethird of all coal mining jobs in America. Coal trains are full again and paychecks are back in workers’ pockets. This has truly been a team effort. I want to thank the incredible staff for their hard work and dedication to our constituents. We have handled over 5,000 constituent service requests these last 4 years. We were able to help people like Wetzel Sanders, a true American hero. Wetzel was a corporal in the Army and was injured in the attack on Pearl Harbor. He took shrapnel to the knee, was bandaged, and went back into the fight. He is now 95 years old, and I was able to present him with a muchdeserved Purple Heart he should not have had to wait 76 years to receive. We have also helped people through some of their most difficult times. In a matter of hours in late June 2016, 23 people lost their lives and hundreds of homes were destroyed. Thousands of residents were left with nothing but the clothes on their backs, due to devastating floods. We worked hard to help our residents recover and rebuild to get their lives headed back in the right direction. Let me reassure the people of the Third Congressional District, my dedicated staff will continue to serve the people of West Virginia, and our constituent service won’t skip a beat. Mr. Speaker, I thank West Virginia House Members, my fellow colleagues, DAVID MCKINLEY and A LEX MOONEY , and Senator CAPITO and Senator MANCHIN for the opportunity to serve and work with them. They are dedicated public servants. I will miss hosting middle school students late at night, right here on the House floor, talking about the greatness of our country, and sharing a quiet moment with our heroes on an honor flight from back home at our war memorials here in Washington. I will not miss sleeping on a $99 cot each night these past 4 years in my office here in Washington, but I was never here in Washington to get settled in. Finally, I would like to thank my wife, E.B., and our children, Hollin, Charles, and Olivia, for supporting me each and every step of the way. They have been incredibly patient and understanding about the time public service has taken from our family time. I love them very much. Again, I thank the citizens of the Third Congressional District for the opportunity to serve them in the United States House of Representatives. God bless America and God bless West Virginia. 
RECOGNIZING KIDS’ ORCHESTRA The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. ABRAHAM ) for 5 minutes. Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the nonprofit organization Kids’ Orchestra for the positive impact it has had on the children throughout East Baton Rouge Parish. Kids’ Orchestra is located in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and is one of the largest after school programs for elementary schools in the entire United States. The program began in 2011 with 30 students from a few local schools. Now, 800 students from 21 schools participate each year, learning a musical instrument, performing in an ensemble, and/or singing in the choir. Kids’ Orchestra uses music as a way to teach students valuable lessons, both in and out of the classroom. Ultimately, they are successful, as 82 percent of their students say they feel more confident, part of the team, and like they are good at something after completing the program. Teachers and parents also see improvements in peer 
interaction, selfconfidence, school attendance, and classroom behavior from the participating students. These benefits translate academically also, as, on average, Kids’ Orchestra students receive 15 percent higher grades than students who do not participate in the program. The organization also aims to create a strong sense of community between the children from all different backgrounds, different neighborhoods, and different schools. Each class contains 25 students of varying ages, schools, and skill levels, all brought together for weekly lessons and regular performances. By forming a community based on musical training and enrichment, Kids’ Orchestra is making a positive impact on neighborhood schools and individual students. I am proud to have had this program in Louisiana, and I look forward to seeing the positive impacts from the organization for many, many years to come. 
Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate September as National Rice Month. Very few places in the world take their rice as seriously as Louisiana, where we produced 2.7 billion pounds of rice just last year. Rice is also a huge economic driver for the United States, as rice milling operations generate about $6 billion in wages and business profits, according to the LSU AgCenter. U.S. rice not only puts food on our tables, but also on tables across the world. We contribute 5 percent of the total rice exports in food aid to developing nations. This is the kind of international contribution our rice producers can be proud of. In turn, I am proud to represent the hardworking rice farmers across Louisiana. They produce highquality rice that feeds the world, gives jobs to their neighbors, and helps the community. These facts alone make rice worth celebrating all month long. 
BATTLING THE WILDFIRES THAT PLAGUE CALIFORNIA The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. ROHRABACHER ) for 5 minutes. Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, let me start by thanking the thousands of firefighters who, each year, put their lives at risk to battle wildfires like those that have plagued California and other western States. We owe it to them, as well as to the American people, to use every measure available to fight fires in ways that reduce the risk to those firefighters and the risk of losing lives and property among our population. Just in the last year, and that is in 2018, wildfires in California burned 1,117,000 acres. Nationally, there was 6.5 million acres burned. In California, we had six fatalities. Nationally, there were 16 fatalities. California property losses were 2,356 houses—those are people’s homes—and 1,239 nonresidential buildings. On that note, today, I would like to draw the attention of my colleagues and the American people to what I consider to be an inexcusable roadblock that is stopping the implementation of new, innovative, and tested effective firefighting technology. In 2008, I helped secure funding for research and testing of the technology that ultimately became Precision Containerized Aerial Delivery System, or PCADS. b1030 It was designed specifically for military aircraft, including the C–17s and the C–130s and others as well. It has been tested over the years and proven to deliver massive amounts of water or fire retardant onto fires using GPS and other expertise. It is safer, more accurate, and much more effective than traditional aerial firefighting. Yet a decade later, this technology has not been put to use despite the Air National Guard’s report determining that the PCADs are operationally effective and appropriate for the use of C–130 firefighting aircraft or military aircraft that can be made for firefighting. This has been deemed operational, yet for the last 8 months, while we have lost all of these homes and all of these lives, hundreds of these aircraft, C–130s and C–17s, have sat on the tarmac. This aircraft was designed for military use, but without modification, can save the lives and homes of American citizens throughout this country who are victimized by wildfires and other types of fires. The primary responsibility of our government is to protect the lives of our people with the best available tools, and it is certainly not doing so. I include in the RECORD , Mr. Speaker, letters that I have written to the Director of our Air National Guard; to Secretary Mattis, the Secretary of Defense; and to Heather Wilson, the Secretary of the Air Force. 
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES , HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , August 30, 2018. Lt. Gen. L. SCOTT RICE, Director, Air National Guard, Washington, DC. DEARGENERAL RICE: I draw your attention to our military’s bureaucratic inertia that has led to a needless loss of life and a tremendous loss of property. I am referring to the vast damage caused in the Western United States, specifically California, by outofcontrol wildfires which have plagued the region for the last few months. This loss of life and property could have been dramatically curtailed had our military acted upon an option that was, and is, readily available. Our inventory of C–130 and C–17 aircraft, with inexpensive and slight interior modifications, could be used as a major firefighting asset that could make a major difference. Instead, these potential incredible firefighting assets sat as California burned. Using these aircraft as valuable firefighting assets would not involve any alteration of the aircraft. This option however has been available and ignored. I call your attention to the Precision Container Aerial Delivery System (PCADS). I helped win Congressional approval in the 2008 appropriations bill wherein $2.3 million was provided for the research and testing of this system. It is ten years later, and I am frustrated that it has not been used to protect our citizens, our homes, our businesses, and our wildlands. The Air National Guard determined that PCADS is operationally effective and is appropriate for C–130 firefighting. The final report on PCADS that found it to be a reliable option was released in January 2018, yet seven months later there has been no action taken to deploy the system. During those seven months, we have suffered 109 large fires which have burned 1.9 million acres, caused 16 fire fatalities, and destroyed 2,356 houses. During this time, our C–130’s and C– 17’s equipped with this system could have had a major impact on these fires. This is utterly unacceptable when we have a proven technology that responds faster and delivers massive quantities of water and fire retardant with GPS directed drops in contrast to the status quo. Furthermore, military transport aircraft can be rapidly and easily reloaded with water or fire retardant as compared to any other system. When the American people discover how bureaucratic intransigence has caused such preventable wildfire damage they will be justifiably outraged. Today, I am demanding that actions be taken upon receipt of this letter to facilitate the use of this simple and inexpensive technology which will easily turn our inventory of C–130’s and C–17’s into firefighting water and fireretardant bombers. I hope you will take this letter seriously enough in order to prevent even more damage in the state of California and elsewhere. Yours sincerely, DANAROHRABACHER (CA 48), Member of Congress. 
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES , HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , August 30, 2018. Hon. JAMES N. M ATTIS , Secretary of Defense, Washington, DC.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, I would hope that we would get some support from these leaders who have been appointed by President Trump to protect the American people in any way they can. Having these airplanes sit on the tarmac in California and elsewhere throughout this country when they could drop fire retardant and massive amounts of fire retardant water saving homes—little cul de sacs that would catch on fire and be destroyed, one flight over those cul de sacs could have saved them. Thousands of people have lost their lives needlessly because of bureaucratic intransigence in our military, so we are calling on the Air National Guard, the Air Force, and, of course, our Secretary of Defense to unblock this impediment to protecting the lives of our people with U.S. military equipment that can do the job. 
RECOGNIZING OTHERWISE GIFTS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK ) for 5 minutes. Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a small business in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, that was recently recognized by the Lansdale Economic Development Committee as Business of the Month. Otherwise Gifts, located on Green Street, has been a fixture in Lansdale since its opening in 1979. Owner John Otherwise describes his shop as containing unique gifts for everyone. Indeed, Otherwise Gifts sells everything from antiques, woodworking items, lamps, furniture, and nearly everything else John believes would help beautify Lansdale community homes. A Philadelphia native, John previously worked in construction and in the nuclear industry before deciding to follow his passion and open his own store. At age 77, John continues to offer unique experiences and gifts to citizens of Montgomery County and throughout the region. I wish John and his wife, Cynthia, all of the best, and I send my congratulations to Otherwise Gifts on being named Lansdale’s Business of the Month. RECOGNIZING MARY , MOTHER OF THE REDEEMER  
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a school in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, that plays a tremendous role in the development of our youngest citizens. Mary, Mother of the Redeemer School in North Wales has provided educational growth and spiritual guidance since 2003. While the parish community has existed since the church was established in 1987, it is a testament to MMR’s parishioners’ devotion to their faith and community that a school was ultimately established. It also comes as no surprise that this school has some remarkable achievements. MMR is a nationally ranked Blue Ribbon, School of Excellence, a recognition of exceptional academic achievement bestowed by the U.S. Department of Education. Earning this award despite its mere 15 years in existence demonstrates the future is tremendously bright for this amazing school. Mr. Speaker, I commend Mary, Mother of the Redeemer School Principal Denise Judge and all faculty, staff, and parents for facilitating such a wonderful community school. We are grateful for your presence in our community, and we wish you all the best. 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a school in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, that plays a pivotal role in the development of our community’s youth. Montgomeryville Elementary, located in North Wales, is known for instilling in its students the value of academic success and the virtues of acceptance and appreciation. These ideas are ultimately culminated into the school’s motto: ‘‘Dream big. Achieve greatness.’’ Last year, Montgomery Elementary was ranked the 48th best elementary school in the State of Pennsylvania. This is no small feat, especially given that Pennsylvania contains over 4,000 elementary schools. These noteworthy milestones would not be made possible without the assistance of a dedicated staff and school community. I am especially grateful for the leadership of principal TJ Seidenberger, who has given Montgomery Elementary the tools they need to thrive and succeed since he took the helm at the school. We thank Montgomery Elementary for all they do for our community, and we wish them continued success in the future. 
RECOGNIZING THE SALVATION ARMY OF GREATER CHATTANOOGA The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. F LEISCHMANN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Salvation Army of Greater Chattanooga as they celebrate their 125th anniversary. This exceptional organization has been an integral part of the Hamilton County community, helping those in need with compassion and uplifting them during the most trying of times. The Salvation Army of Chattanooga opened its doors on March 16, 1893. Never pausing in their service to the community, the Salvation Army continued operations through World War I, the Great Depression, and World War II. For 125 years, members of the Salvation Army have worked to feed, clothe, and empower the great people of Tennessee’s Third District. On a number of occasions, I can reflect on many fond memories with the Salvation Army. During the holiday season, I have had the honor of being kettle cochairman with my wonderful wife of 32 years, Brenda—today we are celebrating our 32nd wedding anniversary—to serve this outstanding organization and its wonderful people. As a matter of fact, my wonderful wife, Brenda, serves on the board of directors with several outstanding Chattanoogans. Regardless of the time of year, whenever I spend time at the Salvation Army on McCallie Avenue, I witness Tennesseans coming together to provide help, hope, and healing to one another. That is the embodiment of the great Volunteer spirit. Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate the Salvation Army of Greater Chattanooga on 125 years of service. I am sure they will continue to do the most good for residents of Hamilton and surrounding counties for many years to come. 
RECOGNIZING GROVER C. FEWOX The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. NORMAN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of Grover C. Fewox, who died September 13, 2018. Mr. Fewox went to war at the age of 17. He was one of 16 million Americans who served in World War II. His wartime service was concentrated in the bloody ocean battlegrounds of the Pacific aboard the Sperry, a submarine tender and the first United States Navy ship to be launched after Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor. His career began on April 29, 1942, as a seaman apprentice in the United States Navy. He was honorably discharged on December 13, 1963, as a senior chief torpedoman, after 21 years of dedicated service. While serving in the United States Navy, Mr. Fewox was awarded the National Defense Service Medal and seven Good Conduct Medals. Like so many others answering America’s anxious calls to service, he found the experience of war to be rites of passage to manhood. He was never much for war stories, but he surely enjoyed a constancy of fellowship with his fellow travelers in organizations such as the Fleet Review Association and The American Legion. Mr. Fewox served in the Navy for 16 years after the war ended, and when he retired in 1962, he moved to Charleston to work at the naval weapons station. He had begun a second career of public service, and he and his wife, Neta, would raise three daughters in Hanahan, South Carolina. Mr. Fewox and Neta committed to their marriage in the early days of the war. He mailed her an engagement ring from a West Coast duty station. As the years passed, they had a date every day. It was a standing happy hour, of pause for undistractible table talk over refreshments of drinks and some snacks. It was a discipline that nurtures bonds; it was the practice of that love story that grew stronger after 72 years. Upon his retirement, he received a letter of appreciation from the commanding officer of the naval weapons station in Charleston, South Carolina. Among other things, the letter said: Your performance as an electronic mechanic was very professional, as evidenced by a Sustained Superior Performance Award and cash award for the period of June 5, 1967, through June 5, 1968, and again May 4, 1977, through May 4, 1978. In addition, you have received numerous letters of appreciation for superior performance and are a member of the 1,000 Hours Sick Leave Club. Your attention to duty, cheerful cooperation, adaptability, knowledge, and general attitude toward your work within the Ordnance Department have been most praiseworthy. Your contributions to the team effort of ‘‘Service to the Fleet’’ and the resultant high quality of accomplishments are greatly appreciated. Your dedicated service reflects great credit not only to yourself but to the naval weapons station as well. As you complete your civil service career, allow me to add my personal ‘‘Thank you and well done.’’ You can reminisce with pride that you have given your best to the naval weapons station in Charleston. I know that your fellow workers and your many friends join me in wishing you and Mrs. Fewox the blessings of a long, healthy, and happy retirement. 
It was signed D.M. Agnew, Commanding Officer of the naval weapons station. There are 7,200 World War II veterans still with us in South Carolina. Because of Mr. Fewox and others who made up the Greatest Generation, America won that horrible war and then led the rebuilding and reknitting of the world, kindling global trade patterns and commercial alliances. It was a postwar world order anchored by America’s strength and determination to nurture freedom and human dignity. Undoubtedly, America is a better place because Mr. Fewox answered the call. JUSTICE FOR BOTHAM JEAN The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. VEASEY ) for 5 minutes. Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to Botham Jean. Botham Jean was from the island of St. Lucia. He moved to Dallas, went to college, and got a good job. As soon as he moved to Dallas, he joined a church because he was a Christian and very much into the Word of Jesus Christ. On a Friday night a few weeks ago, he was in his apartment doing the right thing at 10 o’clock at night, probably trying to relax and unwind from the workday, and a Dallas police officer mistakenly came into his house and shot and killed him. My prayers are with Botham’s family and friends. Officer Amber Guyger, who killed Botham, has been charged with manslaughter, even though she aimed, pulled, and fired the trigger. The last five people in Dallas County who have been charged with manslaughter have been charged with that charge because of drunk driving. She was charged with manslaughter even though she aimed, again, and pulled the trigger. The Dallas Police Department fired Guyger on Monday amid overwhelming outrage in the community. I think it was the right decision, but it was long overdue. I want to be clear. I respect law enforcement in this country and their sacrifices. But also, if we look at the facts of this case, the facts show us that Officer Guyger shot an unarmed Black man in his own apartment, and she was able to go back to her apartment that night. She had days before police finally arrested her, and she was given the benefit of the doubt, something that was not given to Botham Jean. I firmly believe that if Officer Guyger had walked into that apartment and seen a White man or a White woman, she would not have pulled that trigger. I firmly believe that. That is the root of the problem. What I can say with certainty is that I am tired of waiting for a time when it is safe to be a Black man in America. b1045 I have a 12yearold son. Other Congressional Black Caucus members have kids and grandkids, sons and grandsons. Other people around the country have sons, grandsons, and nephews whom they love and want to be safe every day. America is at the brink of a prolonged watershed moment between the AfricanAmerican community and police officers in this country. We need action. We need to collectively break the dam. As a Nation, we need to fix the culture of police brutality and gun violence against communities of color that have lined the fabric of this country for over a century. Our criminal justice system is rooted in a systemic failure to prosecute the 
unjustified shooting of Black men and boys. I am deeply troubled that the Texas Rangers took so long to issue an arrest warrant for Amber Guyger. I am angry that people are actually calling Botham’s character into account because he had a very small amount of marijuana in his apartment: 0.3 ounces. We will never know what was in Amber Guyger’s apartment because, again, it was 36 hours before a warrant was issued for her arrest. Police didn’t go and search her apartment. She had days to clear out her apartment, if there was anything in there, but we will never know because it took them so long to issue an arrest warrant after she walked into someone’s apartment that was not her own and, again, aimed, fired, and pulled the trigger. I am heartbroken that this man was killed in his own apartment, a place where all of us should feel safe. But what gets me most upset is that nothing has changed. This is a story that we have heard on repeat, and the dial will keep spinning until we put an end to it. We all know the names, and there have been too many to share, but I just wanted to remind you of a few. In South Carolina, Levar Jones was stopped at a gas station. He was instructed by police officers to get his license. He had his hands up. As he was reaching for his license, the police shot him, after being instructed to get his license and insurance out of the car. In Florida, Charles Kinsey was shot while taking care of an autistic patient. Go back and look at the YouTube videos of these. You don’t have to take my word. He is sitting on the curb, taking care of this autistic patient, hands up in the air, and police shoot him. Antwon Rose from east Pittsburgh was 17 years old. He was unarmed, with his hands up, and shot by a policeman. Go and look at the videos. Their lives have all been cut short. Males in the Black community have been unjustly killed in our country at a staggering rate. We need law enforcement to be transparent in the line of duty and we need to work diligently to remove biases for those ranks. I hope that is something we can do together. Don’t think it can’t be your rights next. Don’t think they won’t tread on you. 
NATIVE AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH: HONORING THE LIFE OF JUDI GAIASHKIBOS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. BACON ) for 5 minutes. Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize one of Nebraska’s daughters for Native American Heritage Month, Judi Gaiashkibos, a descendant of Chief Smoke Maker of the Ponca Nation, who was a signatory to an early treaty between the United States and the Ponca people in 1825. Judi has served as the Executive Director for the Nebraska Commission on Indian Affairs since 1995, where she focuses on creating partnerships and coalitions with elected representatives, Tribal leaders, nonprofit organizations, and educational institutions. She has been the principal liaison to the Nebraska legislature in developing policy for the State’s four federally recognized Tribes and all its native citizens. In 2006, she was elected as the president of the Governor’s Interstate Indian Council. In fact, Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts praised Judi as ‘‘an advocate for Nebraska’s first people and a loyal spokeswoman for their priorities.’’ Judi earned a bachelor of arts degree in Human Relations and completed her master’s in Management, both from Doane College in Nebraska. In 2009, Judy was a lecturer and advisor for the first Native Daughters Project at the University of NebraskaLincoln College of Journalism and Mass Communications, and is currently an adjunct professor for the second Native Daughters project, focusing on the Indian women of Oklahoma. In her long and distinguished career, Judi has served on many advisory councils across the State, including the Nebraska Minority Justice Committee, the P–16 Leadership Council, and the Nebraska Partners in Prevention Coalition. In 2008, she was appointed to the University of Nebraska President’s Advisory Council. Additionally, Judi is a member of the Racial Profiling Advisory Committee, the U.S. Census Advisory Board, the Interchurch Ministries’ Grants to American Indians in Nebraska, the Nebraska Rural Development Commission, and recently completed a 3year term on the Board of the United Way. She is a member of the Sheldon Museum of Art’s Advisory Council and, in 2012, was appointed to the Doane University Board of Trustees. Judi is a leader. Because of her courageous leadership, she has garnered many prestigious awards, including the Douglas County Historical Society 2009 Door Keeper Award for opening new doorways in the spirit of unity, equality, and understanding. She was the 2012 recipient of the prestigious Nebraska Humanities Sower Award. She received the distinguished NEBRASKAlander Award at the 2017 annual Statehood Dinner. An enrolled member of the Ponca Tribe of Nebraska, Judi descends from a family of great leaders and role models, and credits much of her success to their love and support. Her mother was born in 1913, and as a young girl attended the Genoa Indian School. Following this, her mother returned to the Ponca homelands and served on the Ponca Tribal Council in her thirties, at a time when nonIndian women were not serving in these elected positions. Later, Judi’s mother and grandparents moved with her and her 10 brothers and sisters to Norfolk, Nebraska. Her mother and grandmother took turns working and caring for the family at a time when most women were not working outside the home. As other Ponca followed them off the reservation, Judi’s mother continued to serve as a leader to many of them, helping them get settled and find opportunities. Her mother was a liaison between the two worlds, much like Judi is today. Eager to share the history of the Ponca, Judi will eagerly tell you about two key historic moments. The first is the trial of Chief Standing Bear. After the forced removal of Ponca to Oklahoma and the ‘‘warm lands,’’ Standing Bear began the return journey home to bury his 16yearold son, keeping a deathbed promise he made. The Ponca were arrested in Nebraska by General George Crook’s soldiers. On May 12, 1879, Standing Bear won an important victory for himself and for all Native Americans, stating that he was a person under United States law. The second significant event in Ponca history was their Tribal termination in 1966, and the Ponca Tribe of Nebraska’s historic restoration on October 31, 1990. Judi believes we are all ambassadors for our people, and it is important that we show up each and every day for duty and live by our traditional principles. She is motivated each day by a famous quote by Wilma Mankiller from the Native Daughters publication and the women of Oklahoma that states, ‘‘The secret of our success is that we never, never give up.’’ We are inspired by the life and example of Judi Gaiashkibos. I can think of no one more fitting to honor for Native American Heritage Month. f 
RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess until noon today. Accordingly (at 10 o’clock and 52 minutes a.m.), the House stood in recess. 
b1200 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker at noon. 
PRAYER The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: Merciful God, we give You thanks for giving us another day. You alone can trace the deepest fault lines of history and read the highest aspirations of the human heart. Be with the Members of the people’s House this day. Give them sound judgment and make them as practical and streetwise as the American people who sent them here as their representatives. Help them to withstand open criticism when they know what is right before You and conscience. Often they 
are characterized by halftruths and attributed motives that are far beneath them. Uphold them at such times, with personal integrity and compassion for those most in need. Having called them to serve others to the best of their ability, lift them even higher by Your grace and power to live and work for Your greater honor and glory, both now and forever. Amen. 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. KIHUEN ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. KIHUEN led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. ROKITA. Mr. Speaker, recently, our friends in the Jewish community celebrated their holiest days. During these times, I know they have taken note of America’s strong support for Israel. Our two countries are tied by common values and joint interests as we share commitments to freedom and democracy, societal pillars in short supply in Israel’s immediate neighborhood. The history of the Jewish people is one of faith, one of honor, but, most importantly, survival. This week, President Trump reiterated our Nation’s strong support for Israel in his address to the United Nations General Assembly. He told the world that the United States will not stay silent against threats to Israel and made it clear that moving the American Embassy was a sign of peace. I am calling on the rest of the world leaders to acknowledge Jerusalem as the true capital of Israel and to protect God’s chosen people at their time of peril. It is time we all stand in solidarity for the Israeli nation. GREAT LAKES RESTORATION INITIATIVE (Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, since 2010, Congress has invested $2.5 billion to fund the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, a program that has protected and restored the largest source of fresh water in the world. A new study coordinated by the Great Lakes Commission and conducted by the University of Michigan has shown restoring our waterways is also restoring economic opportunity in the once struggling Great Lakes region. Every Federal dollar invested is producing three to four times that amount in regional economic growth and activity. Thirty years ago, the Buffalo River was declared biologically dead and ecologically destroyed because of industrial dumping of toxic waste directly into the river. In Buffalo and western New York, Great Lakes Restoration Initiative investments in and around the Great Lakes and the Buffalo River have led to more than $100 million in private sector investments along the water’s edge, new residential demand, increased tourism, and a waterfront rebirth. Time and again, I have stood on this floor and fought to maintain the Great Lakes restoration funding, and this is why: the investments made are bringing our waterways and our cities back to life. f 
HAYS COUNTY HONOR FLIGHT (Mr. WILLIAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Speaker, today, I would like to take a moment to recognize a special group of veterans from Hays County in the 25th District of Texas that will all board an Honor Flight to our Nation’s Capital today. For those who don’t know, the purpose of an Honor Flight is to transport American veterans to Washington, D.C., to visit the memorials dedicated to honor their service and their sacrifices. On this particular flight, we will have 6 World War II veterans, 18 Korean war veterans, and 17 Vietnam war veterans from central Texas. The flight is named in honor of Bill Kolbe, who was a World War II veteran who served in the Army Air Corps. As the representative of the veterans on this Honor Flight, I would like to take this opportunity to simply say we thank them, and we love them. We thank them for so selflessly serving this great Nation and for being the heroes we so desperately need today. Being able to serve these warfighters in Congress is one of my greatest honors, and I will continue to do everything I can to support our veterans in Hays County and around the Nation. God bless our veterans, and God bless the United States of America. f 
HONORING LIFE OF LORETTA MCKINNEY HARPER (Mr. KIHUEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize the life of my friend, Loretta McKinney Harper. Ms. Harper was a high school counselor at Desert Pines High School, where she counseled thousands of students over her 17 years there. But Ms. Harper was more than just a counselor. She was a friend, a mentor to her students, and an inspirational community leader. Ms. Harper cared deeply for her students and auctioned off personal memorabilia to assist her undocumented students with their DACA filing fees. Ms. Harper attended Know Your Rights training sessions so she could stand up for them when they were unable to do so for themselves. Ms. Harper instilled in her students a sense of civic duty and bragged about her students who registered to vote as soon as they became eligible to do so. Ms. Harper was a true patriot who loved our democratic process. During elections, Loretta devoted countless hours to voting registration, volunteering on campaigns, and getting out the vote. Her energy inspired others. Sadly, on September 18, 2018, Ms. Loretta Harper passed away. Today, I stand here to honor Loretta as a shining star of community service. Ms. Harper was driven by her love of her community and a burning desire to make it better. Mr. Speaker, as I reflect on her contributions to our community over so many years, I can attest that she left her community in a better place. I will miss my friend. 
HONORING EVAN HANSEN (Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Evan Hansen, a senior at Wabash College who ended his life on September 10. Evan epitomized compassion, charity, and loving his neighbor. He was the kind of young man who made customers feel special when he greeted them personally while working at Joe’s Butcher store in Carmel. His parents, Chuck and Mary, have been overwhelmed by the outpouring of love they have received from friends at home and from overseas. He had studied abroad, making lasting friendships from people all around the world. Evan was admired by his teammates as the captain of the Wabash football team. While he was tough as nails on 
the football field, he was truly as caring as Mother Teresa off the field. He organized the summer lunch program for children in need at his church, Our Lady of Mount Carmel. He was always ready to lend a hand to someone in need or offer his smile to friends and strangers. He planned on attending Marian University’s nursing program next year. September is National Suicide Prevention Month. It is my hope we can remove the stigma of mental health issues so that all of us can help people like Evan who believe their only way to finding peace is by making a decision that can never be undone. 
LARGE AGRIBUSINESS MERGERS (Mr. KHANNA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. KHANNA. Mr. Speaker, I rise to urge support for the Food and Agribusiness Merger Moratorium and Antitrust Review Act of 2018. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this bill introduced by Representative POCAN and an original founder of the Congressional Antitrust Caucus. This bill is good for our farmers. It would place a shortterm moratorium on the large agribusiness mergers that we are seeing across our Nation. Fewer farmers mean fewer choices for consumers and higher prices. Agricultural consolidation is a huge problem. Today, the top four beef packers control 82 percent of the market. Missouri had 23,000 hog farms in 1985, but only 2,200 in 2012. Four companies control 85 percent of soybean processing. I could go on and on. We need to temporarily stop these big mergers, and we need to start looking out for our farmers again. When the farm bill expires this week, small family farmers should be first. 
RECOGNIZING BILL PICKETT (Mr. SHIMKUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Bill Pickett of Danville, Illinois, who is celebrating 50 years of reporting the news for Neuhoff Media. Having recently graduated from Danville High School in 1968, Bill became one of the youngest newsmen in the business at 17 years of age. It wasn’t very long after he started that Bill went live with his first story: an explosion at the grain elevator in Danville. Bill witnessed the fireball erupting and the walls of the elevator slowly crumble into a heap of debris. All that night, Bill provided live updates on the disaster. As the fire subsided, it became apparent to Bill that he had found his calling. Over the past half century, Bill has gone from answering phones to being the news director for several news outlets. His duties require him to act as investigative reporter, news gatherer, copy editor, and broadcaster. Mr. Speaker, many voices have been raised in recognition of Bill’s remarkable career, and I am pleased to be able to add my own to the chorus. I wish Bill and Neuhoff Media all the best in the future as we celebrate Mr. Bill Pickett’s 50 years in radio. f 
RECOGNIZING LES JOHNSON (Mr. BACON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Les Johnson, who served as the police chief of the town of Bennington in my district from 2004 until his untimely death this past August at the age of 51. He died from head injuries related to an offduty incident. People who knew Chief Les Johnson said he had a steady hand and was a big man with a big heart, and that he was an extremely kind and thoughtful person. Former Mayor Gordon Mueller recalled how Johnson worked to bring upgrades to the police department, including finding a good deal on a car, as the two squad cars were continuously breaking down. The superintendent of Bennington schools said Johnson would help with traffic at the beginning of the school year. These are just a couple of stories representing his faithful service and work ethic. Johnson joined the Bennington Police Department as a parttime officer in 1992. While it is a small department, a big man with a big heart led it. Chief Johnson is survived by his wife, Alice Ann of Waterloo, and daughters, Paxton and Hannah. We send them our prayers and thoughts. We will miss Chief Johnson. 
REAUTHORIZATION OF THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION PROGRAMS (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to applaud the passage of H.R. 302, the Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization Act of 2018. This bipartisan legislation includes a 5year reauthorization of FAA programs that promote safety and American leadership in aviation. It also strengthens consumer voices and invests in our airport infrastructure. Importantly, the Essential Air Service program was reauthorized for an additional 5 years through fiscal year 2023. This program is vital for rural America. It ensures taxpayers in small, rural communities are connected to the national transportation system. This program provides links to hub airports at more than 170 locations in 36 States and territories, including three in my congressional district, which would otherwise lack commercial air service. Reliable transportation plays a key role in growing jobs all over the country, and rural America should be no exception. Additionally, this bill includes important reforms to the Federal Contract Tower Program, which has a proven record of enhancing aviation safety and provides significant cost savings to the taxpayers. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased the House approved this bill to keep all Americans connected to reliable and safe air transportation. f

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this rule and the underlying legislation. This rule provides for consideration of H.R. 6760, the Protecting Family and Small Business Tax Cuts Act of 2018; H.R. 6757, the Family Savings Act of 2018; and H.R. 6756, the American Innovation Act of 2018. Mr. Speaker, just yesterday we had members of the Ways and Means Committee and other Members who came to the Rules Committee. They came to the Rules Committee to discuss before the committee the important aspects of continuing the economic growth that we have currently right now in our lifetime in the United States of America. What a great time to be an American. Perhaps more importantly, what a great time to look forward to a great future, a future not only where the American Dream becomes available to each and every person, but even if you happen to be on the lowest end of the totem pole, perhaps beginning work today, those are the people who have benefited from not only the tax cut that President Trump, this House, and the Republican Senate made sure that we pass, but, more importantly, giving to the American worker the opportunity to have, not just a sense of accomplishment, not just a job, but potentially a career that moves forward. What has happened as a result of that is what brings us to where we are here today. They say that success has many fathers and mothers. In this case, it is aunts, uncles, and all sorts of people, Mr. Speaker, who can proudly look up and say: I am a part of what is probably the greatest economy that so many people can now enjoy. Instead of being isolated to one section of this economy, it will abound. You will hear me talk about even people who get up early in the morning, early risers. I used to be one of those because I threw a paper route. I would have to get up in the morning, and it gave me a lot of time to think about my future as I served what was my paper route, my small business, and my opportunity in second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth grade, as I developed myself as a young man—not just as a Scout, to become an Eagle Scout—but as a person who saw himself growing up in a great country, America. That is how I developed my American Dream. I developed my American Dream by sitting down with my family at a table and understanding Americanism and opportunity. It was about the free enterprise system. It was about a dream that I would have. For too long, Mr. Speaker, we have had those in government who controlled our lives. They controlled our lives with high taxes, more rules and regulations, and a demand that Washington knew more about our dream than we did. No more, Mr. Speaker, because last December there was an opportunity—a historic opportunity—that was seen as political because our friends on the other side did not vote for the bill. Even today they take advantage and talk about what are supposedly its frailties. But the American people know differently, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, we have today in America a higher GDP rate than we do unemployment rate. Today we have the opportunity to see that we are going to grow that GDP by asking this Congress to make permanent that which today is in law for only a short 10 years. We believe that what we have done is to give the American people—even people at the lowest end—the opportunity to take part in making America great again. At that same time, we will make their lives so much better. So, Mr. Speaker, what we are going to do is we are going to talk about this today, and you will see that there are two different visions. One vision wants to go back to higher taxation, rules and regulations, and government control—government control not just in taxation, but also in healthcare—and we are, as a Republican Party and as the free enterprise party, going to stand up and say that we will be there on behalf of all workers and that we believe that the free enterprise system in this country has produced much that has helped so many people. That is how we pay for Social Security. That is how we pay for Medicare. That is how we pay for Medicaid. It is done through more people working, not through higher taxes, higher unemployment, and more misery. So, Mr. Speaker, you are going to hear today the argument that is taking place all across this country on the floor of the House of Representatives, and you are going to see that you, Mr. Speaker, and every single Member, will have an opportunity to say that we believe that the economic opportunity 
for all Americans is equity. It is opportunity, and it is available at not just a theater near you but in your hometown. So we are proud of who we are. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. (Mr. MCGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Texas, my good friend, Mr. SESSIONS , for yielding me the customary 30 minutes. Mr. Speaker, 9 months ago, as the already unpopular Republican tax scam was making its way through Congress, Speaker RYANstood in this Capitol and made a bet. He wagered that ‘‘results are going to be what makes this popular.’’ Today the results are clear, and they are not what the majority and President Trump promised. Big corporations have gotten a windfall. Workers have gotten laid off. Jobs are being shipped overseas, and the richest 1 percent is getting 83 percent of the law’s benefits. Despite those realities, my colleagues seemed to be surprised recently when a survey commissioned by the Republican National Committee was released in the media. It found that the public believes their tax scam benefits the wealthy and large corporations over average Americans by a twoto one margin—61 percent to 30 percent. Let me repeat that before the President tries to tweet that it is fake news. It was a poll conducted for Republicans by a Republican polling firm. That is why we are here today with tax 2.1, Mr. Speaker, because the majority’s bet is turning out to be a losing one. b1230 Nine months ago, the Republicans were assuring themselves their tax scam was good politics. Back then, Senate Majority Leader MITCH MCCONNELL said, ‘‘If we can’t sell this to the American people, we ought to go into another line of work.’’ With polling like this, some Washington Republicans may have to. But first, they are here today with a package of bills that represents their lastditch attempt at trying to turn the tide before November. And the sequel is as bad as the original in three key ways. First, the original Republican tax scam added $2.3 trillion to the national debt to give the wealthy more tax cuts. 2.0 would add another $3 trillion to the debt. You won’t see its cost on the budget scorecard. Republicans think they can waive a magic wand and hide the costs. But I have news for them: this is Congress, this isn’t Hogwartz. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center says that this is going to cost $3.2 trillion. It is important that people pay attention to this. I have got to give the Republicans credit for their sneaky ways to try to avoid the realities. They have an amendment that says this massive giveaway to the wealthy magically doesn’t count. And here is the other thing. We won’t even get to vote on it. It is in the rule. It will be selfexecuted once the rule passes. So no one has to take any responsibility for adding all this to our debt. This is at a time when the U.S. Treasury is borrowing money at a rate of $5.4 billion a day. The Congressional Budget Office recently found that the majority and the Trump administration have blown a $900 billion hole in the Federal budget. The deficit will increase by nearly 32 percent this year alone, with one of the main causes being the first GOP tax law. Mr. Speaker, what happened to the Republican Party that claimed to care about fiscal discipline? This majority is drowning in red ink. And the list goes on. Second, the original Republican tax scam reduced the Medicare trust fund by 3 years. 2.0 could trigger an automatic 4 percent cut in Medicare. That means hundreds of billions of dollars for this program would be lost. My colleagues on the other side may stand here today and claim that they want to protect Medicare and Social Security. But don’t believe them. Don’t be fooled. Right after their tax law exploded the deficit, what did the President’s chief economic adviser do? He called for new cuts to Medicare and Social Security. It is no wonder that in the Republican poll I referenced earlier, many Americans worry that the tax law would lead to cuts to these vital programs. Make no mistake: under the majority, these earned benefits are on the chopping block so Republicans can give tax breaks to the wealthy. Third, the original Republican tax scam temporarily limited the State and local tax deduction, undermining funding for priorities like schools, firefighters, and police officers. Under 2.0, that deduction would be made permanent. More than 45 million Americans claim the SALT deduction, including those in Massachusetts, by the way. They will have a harder time doing things like buying a home if this package becomes law, all while State and local governments have a harder time investing in their communities. Even while making these harmful changes to the Tax Code, the majority apparently couldn’t be bothered to make changes that could actually help Americans who have become victims to natural disasters. In the wake of Hurricane Florence and the largest wildfires in California history, Democrats asked the majority to include an amendment that would provide to all eligible Americans the same type of relief that the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee provided his constituents last year after Hurricane Harvey. That request was denied. It is outrageous that, under the majority, the tax relief Americans get after a tragedy apparently depends on their ZIP Code. Mr. Speaker, there is a word for doing the same thing other and over and over again and expecting a different result. I think the majority would be hardpressed to find anyone watching today who thinks doubling down on such an unpaid for and damaging policy is anything other than insanity. The policies in these proposals are very similar, but there is one key difference worth noting, and that is the process. The first time around, the majority used special fasttrack procedures to provide tax cuts for the wealthy and large corporations. They pulled out all the stops to assure that it became law as quickly as possible. They couldn’t even find time to hold a hearing before voting on it. But now, on a proposal they are claiming is for the middle class, there are no fasttrack procedures. There is not even a guarantee that this proposal will even be considered in the Senate. Every middleclass American watching should realize this: with this majority, the wealthy and the wellconnected get a windfall under a special, quick process. Their tax cuts were virtually guaranteed under a rigged system. Your tax cuts aren’t getting that same urgency. There is no special process for you. This plan will be left in limbo on the other side of the Capitol. And we all know that. The fact is, their procedures give away the whole game. This isn’t about policy. This is about politics. The first tax scam isn’t paying the kind of dividends that the majority anticipated. It is unpopular. So they are trying to pass this to have another talking point on the campaign trail. The public didn’t fall for the majority’s spin with their last tax scam, and I think they will see through this one again. They will see what this is all about. They will see this for what it is: a proposal that continues the same, old Republican policies at a time when the public is demanding a new direction. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. As my colleague was talking about the dismal results, I turned to my phone here and it is all green up and down on the stock market, because the stock market knows that today we are talking about making permanent the things that work for the American people; things that work well for employers; things that work well for bringing stock market prices, not only back, but understanding that many, many Americans and our seniors across this country have invested in the stock market. It is up 40 percent since we have had an opportunity to pass the tax cut. The success of the free enterprise system is what my colleagues hate. They want to sell government, they want to sell defeat, they want to sell 
the things that are the fear about making progress. The facts of the case are real simple, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  an article from, of all places, The New York Times, that was dated August 3 of this year. On August 3, The New York Times, who does some inciteful reporting, said, ‘‘Workers Hardest Hit by Recession Are Joining in Recovery.’’ 
[From the New York Times, Aug. 2, 2018] WORKERS HARDEST HIT BY RECESSION ARE JOINING IN RECOVERY  (By Nelson D. Schwartz and Ben Casselman) The least educated American workers, who took the hardest hit in the Great Recession, were also among the slowest to harvest the gains of the recovery. Now they are a striking symbol of a strong economy. The unemployment rate for those without a high school diploma fell to 5.1 percent in July, the Labor Department reported Friday, the lowest since the government began collecting data on such workers in 1992. At the economy’s nadir in the summer of 2009, the unemployment rate for high school dropouts hit 15.6 percent, more than three times the peak unemployment rate for college graduates. Buffeted by technological change and seemingly out of place in an economy where skills and credentials are in ever more demand, this cohort struggled while more educated workers scored jobs and promotions and rose on the economic ladder. High school dropouts make up 7.2 percent of the labor force, and some experts doubted they and other lowskilled workers would ever fully recover from the effects of the recession, said Betsey Stevenson, a professor of economics at the University of Michigan. ‘‘As economists, we worried these workers would be shut out forever,’’ she said. ‘‘But the long duration of the recovery has pulled them back in. As the economy adds more jobs, employers have had to dig a little deeper.’’ 
REACHING FULLER EMPLOYMENT  Unemployment among the least educated, the group hit hardest in the recession, has been cut by twothirds since its peak of almost 16 percent in 2010. The improvement in the fortunes of less educated workers was a highlight in a jobs report that showed continuing gains across a broad variety of sectors. Over all in July, employers increased payrolls by 157,000, while the unemployment rate edged downward to 3.9 percent, near the 18year low achieved in May. The data echoed other positive economic news recently, including a report last week showing the economy grew by 4.1 percent in the second quarter. And the headlines about President Trump’s tariffs on steel and aluminum and a widening trade war with China seem to have done little to put a damper on hiring. The manufacturing sector, which is particularly sensitive to exports, was robust, adding 37,000 jobs. Although the payroll increase in July was slightly below what Wall Street was expecting, upward revisions for May and June alleviated fears of a slowdown. Several economists linked the shortfall to the shutdown of Toys ‘‘R’’ Us, and the loss of 32,000 jobs at sporting goods, book and hobby stores last month. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve upgraded its view of the economy’s underlying condition from ‘‘solid’’ to ‘‘strong.’’ The central bank remains on course to raise interest rates twice more this year, in September and December, to avert overheating. Other indicators suggest the recovery is finally extending its reach. The Labor Department’s broadest measure of unemployment, which includes workers forced to take part time jobs because fulltime positions are unavailable, fell to 7.5 percent in July, the lowest since 2001. All this has translated into better economic opportunities for workers without a college degree, who account for a majority of the work force. It is a contingent that was championed by Mr. Trump during his presidential campaign, and one that both parties want to appeal to in the midterm elections in November. The White House was quick to note that the economy is in the midst of the longest monthly streak of job growth in history. And after 94 consecutive months of job creation, bosses and human resource departments are recalibrating their requirements. ‘‘You definitely get the sense that employers are willing to look at workers they haven’t looked at in the past,’’ said Martha Gimbel, director of economic research at Indeed.com, the employment website. Unemployed Americans who might not have put feelers out in the past are also venturing back into the hunt for a job, she said. On Indeed’s search engine, much of the growth in queries lately has been for positions like fulltime cashier, mobile home park manager, maintenance person and fulfillment associate. ‘‘This is an indicator that lowskilled workers are seeing opportunities for themselves in the labor market,’’ Ms. Gimbel said. Until recently at Steel Ceilings in Johnstown, Ohio, the company’s president, Rick Sandor, insisted on a couple of years’ experience in metal fabrication before considering applicants. But he’s had a harder time lately finding workers for his company, where shifts run from 5 a.m. to 2 p.m. and temporary positions start at $14 per hour. He now settles for candidates who show mechanical skills, like carpentry or heating and cooling repair. Mr. Sandor is willing to waive the requirement for a high school diploma as well and has even hired applicants with what he terms ‘‘minor’’ prison sentences. ‘‘If a person was truly trying to get their life back together, we thought it would be helpful to offer them a job,’’ he said. Unemployment for lessskilled workers has been dropping for several years, with a pickup in hiring in sectors like manufacturing, construction and parts of health care. And to be sure, the monthtomonth figures for unemployment among high school dropouts are volatile. But the longterm trend is clear, as is hiring among the sectors responsible for it. Last month, the leisure and hospitality field recorded a 40,000 gain in positions, with half of that coming from restaurants. For example, Buffalo Wings & Rings, a restaurant chain with 60 locations in 13 states, has been stepping up hiring and opening new restaurants. Many outlets have seen doubledigit sales growth over the past year, and some are up as much as 40 percent, said Nader Masadeh, the company’s chief executive. The tax cuts that took effect in January are playing a role, Mr. Masadeh said—most families may have gotten a relatively small tax cut, but it is enough to fuel a few more nights out. ‘‘People feel good. They’re going out and spending more money,’’ he said. ‘‘In our segment, $50 feeds you and your family.’’ Still, the hot economy brings challenges of its own. At an annual gathering of the company’s franchisees in June, Mr. Masadeh said, he was bombarded with questions about how to retain talent when workers can readily walk out the door and find another job. And costs are rising throughout his business. ‘‘Right now the economy is great, but we’re also seeing higher construction costs, higher commodity items, shortages of labor, so there’s always something that counterbalances something else,’’ he said. That pressure, however, has not resulted in much fatter paychecks for most workers. The Labor Department said average hourly earnings ticked modestly higher in July, putting the annual rise at 2.7 percent. That’s below the pace of inflation in recent months. One reason for the lack of big raises is that a substantial number of workers remain on the sidelines, including the lessskilled ones who are now gradually coming back, said Simona Mocuta, senior economist with State Street Global Advisors. ‘‘We are bringing unemployment way below 4.5 percent, which the Fed considers full employment,’’ Ms. Mocuta said. ‘‘But we are getting very modest wage inflation. This is an issue not just for the U.S., but in every other developed market.’’ ‘‘Because the labor market is tight, less educated workers have more of a chance of getting hired,’’ she added. ‘‘For people with the highest level of education, it’s easier to find jobs even when the economy isn’t doing well.’’ A version of this article appears in print on Aug. 4, 2018, on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Robust Recovery Lifting Laborers Hit the Hardest. Mr. SESSIONS. All across this great Nation there are people who were tired of the loss of jobs in this country, the movement of jobs overseas, the continuation of a tax policy that did not allow jobs and money that was earned by American companies to come back here. This is what we have created a change in, and this is the essence of the argument: whether we, the free enterprise system, are going to win or whether it will be the government. I think today it is obvious to the American people that the Republican Party is on the side of the free enterprise system, small business, entrepreneurship, and people who want to be left alone, but make their lives work and make their communities work. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, it is nonsense to suggest that somehow Democrats don’t want the economy to work well. The difference here is we want the economy to work well for everyone, not just those at the top. Eightythree percent of the benefits in their tax scam go to the top 1 percent of this country. The people who are struggling are those in the middle and those struggling to get in the middle. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  a letter to the Speaker and to the minority leader from Feeding America, which basically says very clearly that the Republican tax bill ‘‘ . . . did not prioritize assisting those taxpayers who are most at risk of being food insecure, and as a result the new law provides little direct, tangible benefit to the individuals and families served by Feeding America.’’ 
FEEDING AMERICA , September 25, 2018. Hon. PAULRYAN, Speaker of the House, Washington, DC. Hon. NANCY PELOSI , House Democratic Leader, Washington, DC. DEAR SPEAKER RYAN AND LEADER PELOSI : We write to share Feeding America’s views about ‘‘Tax Reform 2.0’’ and the legislation recently approved by the House Ways and Means Committee. We previously expressed our concerns about the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (H.R. 1) and its impact on the millions of Americans facing hunger in every community across our country, and do not believe making its provisions permanent would ease the burden on those individuals and families As the nation’s largest private response to domestic hunger, and the country’s third largest charitable organization, Feeding America works to advance public policies that support food insecure individuals and families and that expand the resources necessary for them to access nutritious food. Given that the aggregate annual food budget shortfall for the more than 41 million food insecure individuals in the United States now stands at more than $21 billion, our highest priority is protecting the federal nutrition programs that help these families access the resources and nutrition needed to succeed. At the same time, a large percentage of individuals, including children, who struggle with hunger fall outside the public safety net, underscoring the profound need for private food assistance. In 2016, more than a quarter of food insecure individuals nationwide lived in households that earned too much to qualify for most federal nutrition assistance programs. For these working families, the generosity of individuals and corporations makes possible vital food assistance that might not otherwise be available. Regrettably, H.R. 1 did not prioritize assisting those taxpayers who are most at risk of being food insecure, and as a result the new law proves little direct, tangible benefit to the individuals and families served by Feeding America. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) beginning in 2021 taxpayers earning between $10,000 and $30,000 per year will see an increase in their average tax rate, a circumstance that will apply to all taxpayers earning less than $75,000 by 2027. Additionally, changes to the standard deduction and the availability of itemized deductions have effectively eliminated the charitable deduction for 28.5 million taxpayers, according to JCT. The result will be a decline in charitable giving of more than $17 billion per year, according to a recent American Enterprise Institute study, with human service charities likely to be especially hard hit. Of the 28.5 million taxpayers expected to no longer file itemized returns, 24.6 million earn less than $200,000 per year. Donors with incomes below $200,000 are responsible for 62% of annual charitable giving to all human needs charities. Simply put, the loss of this centuryold giving incentive will have a devastating effect on a wide range of charitable programs and services delivered in communities across the country, including those that provide muchneeded food assistance to hungry individuals and families who are not otherwise benefitting from the new tax law. H R. 1 represented a missed opportunity to provide relief for the millions of Americans who struggle to put food on the table, and we do not support making its provisions permanent. We do, however, encourage you to undertake Tax Reform 2.0 with the aim of enacting legislation that eases the burdens on lowerincome working families, continues to encourage Americans to give generously to charity, and ensures the government has the resources necessary to meet our collective obligations to provide for the health and wellbeing of our neighbors and our communities. We hope to serve as a resource to you as this process unfolds, and we look forward to the opportunity to share with you proposed tax code changes that we believe will have a positive impact on the people we serve.

Mr. M CGOVERN. Feeding America is the preeminent organization that feeds hungry families in this country. We have a hunger problem in this country. Nothing in this bill today or the bill that the Republicans passed previously does anything to help those people. So yes, we want the economy to work well, but for everybody. Not just the rich, but we want it to work well for those in the middle and those struggling to get in the middle. We don’t want to embrace a tax scam package where 83 percent of the benefits go to the top 1 percent. They may be good contributors, but that doesn’t represent the majority of America. Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up Ranking Member NADLER ’s bill, the Special Counsel Independence Act. This vital legislation will allow the people’s House to demonstrate that we as a body are capable of putting America’s interests over partisan politics. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the RECORD , along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Massachusetts? There was no objection. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. NADLER ), the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, to discuss his proposal. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I stand here because, earlier this week, we were confronted with the threat of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein’s firing. On Monday, Mr. Rosenstein was summoned to the White House, with rumors swirling that he had resigned or was about to be fired. Today, he was scheduled to meet with the President. But yesterday, the President said he may not fire him. He prefers not to, but he may. And he may meet with Mr. Rosenstein or not. Mr. Rosenstein is directly responsible for Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into alleged links between the Russian Government and the Trump campaign, as well as other related work, now in the Southern District of New York in the National Security Division of the Department of Justice, that could have a profound effect on the integrity of elections to come. 
The fear is that, if the President fires Mr. Rosenstein, a new Acting Attorney General will take steps to end the investigation by Mr. Mueller in order to protect President Trump and his associates. It is unacceptable for a law enforcement project of this magnitude to turn on the employment status of one official. As we have all seen, President Trump has spent his Presidency undermining every effort to understand what happened during the 2016 elections. He has shown no interest in safeguarding the 2018 elections from ongoing attacks by foreign adversaries. Instead, he attacks the intelligence community; attacks the Department of Justice; attacks career civil servants; and attacks Special Counsel Mueller, complaining about what he calls a ‘‘total witch hunt’’ and calling for the Attorney General to end the investigation. This is not a witch hunt. In a relatively short period of time, investigators have secured multiple convictions and guilty pleas from key Trump campaign personnel, including the President’s campaign manager, his deputy campaign manager, his national security adviser, and others. But President Trump and his allies in this Chamber are engaged in a broader strategy to undermine the legitimacy of any finding, guilty plea, or any conviction that may come out of the investigation. President Trump will take any opportunity to reign in, suppress, or end the Special Counsel’s investigation. We know this because President Trump has told us so. He told us that he fired the FBI Director because of the ‘‘Russia thing.’’ He is reported to have ordered the firing of Robert Mueller at least twice. He attacks his own Attorney General for quite properly recusing himself from the investigation. His surrogates compare the FBI to the Gestapo, and call for the police to raid the Justice Department. Fortunately, as a coequal branch of government, we have a way to protect our law enforcement officers from these threats and to protect the country from this barrage of misinformation from the White House. H.R. 5476, the Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act, would protect the Special Counsel from being unjustly fired and would allow for the courts to review any political interference. This is bipartisan legislation that has 126 cosponsors and is identical to Republican legislation that has a number of Republican cosponsors. The Senate counterpart to H.R. 5476 was introduced by Senators GRAHAM , BOOKER , COONS , and T ILLIS , and passed the Senate Judiciary Committee on April 26, 2018, by a vote of 14–7. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from New York an additional 30 seconds. Mr. NADLER. We have been calling on the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee to bring this important legislation before the committee for a vote, but he has refused to act. Democrats have taken the unusual step of invoking House rule XI, clause 2(c)(2) to force a markup. But other Republicans on the committee have sat on their hands and refused to join in this demand. But for three Republicans, the Judiciary Committee would be forced to consider this legislation. We cannot wait any longer. The stakes are too great. That is why I offer this proposal. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, it is not without notice to the American people that the discussion may be on great economic policy that is working for people, we are attacked here in Washington on the floor, and then the subject changes to something else, rather than the overwhelming evidence of how we are doing. b1245 Mr. Speaker, there was a discussion I put in the RECORD , that New York Times article about those at the very bottom who had been left behind before, under the previous administration’s tax increase, to where they lost jobs because we lost jobs in America with the massive spending spree that took place by President Obama and the Democratic Party. I am pleased to report not just what was said on August the 18th by The New York Times, but even today. African American and Hispanic unemployment rates are at some of the lowest rates that they have ever been. The Bureau of Labor Standards even passed out a report about the weekly unemployment claims. Those are the claims where people who were seeking jobs, we count those up across the country. They are at the lowest rates since 1969. That means, even though we have a larger amount of people in the country, a fewer numberwise—not percentage, numberwise—are seeking unemployment compensation. Mr. Speaker, it is working. There is success in the marketplace. What Republicans did is so good that we want it to continue, because people who have their jobs tend to want to protect those jobs. But the protection of the jobs is being done by this administration to make sure that we can sell more of our products overseas. About 40 percent of everything made in this country is made for export. We are for a larger export market. We are for jobs in this country. Over $50 billion has flowed back into the United States from overseas as a result of what we did last December 18 with the tax bill. The overwhelming success of people back at home, wherever we are from, is apparent. They are working. They have got an opportunity. Their savings are increasing. All over my hometown of Dallas, Texas, there are companies after companies after companies after companies that have reinvested in their businesses to make sure that not just ergonomics or new ways to mechanize are employed in their businesses, but, actually, many companies paid, doubling down the amount that they had contributed to a retirement fund or to a 401(k) or to giving company stock or, as in the case of many companies in Dallas, gave a $1,000 bonus and then said to the employee: For the $1,000 bonus I give each of the employees, I want you to know we are going to reinvest in making our business up to date and better, too. So, Mr. Speaker, no wonder—no wonder—the other side, as they come to the table today with an equal opportunity for time, changes the discussion point to something that is extraneous from how successful this tax bill has been. So we will stand here until the end of our time and say: We need to make it permanent because it works. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, the reason why we are offering this procedural motion is because the Republicans run this House like Putin. We are shut out of everything. So this is our only opportunity to try to get some important business done. The Republicans can spend every day trying to pass more tax cuts for their wealthy friends and big corporations, but maybe—just maybe—we can do something useful like protecting our democracy. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. SCHIFF ), the distinguished ranking member of the Committee on Intelligence. Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, the 115th Congress will soon come to an end. There is much work that we will leave undone, but none so consequential to our democracy as the failure to pass legislation to protect Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation from further interference by the President. Today may be our last chance to avoid the constitutional crisis that will come should this President fire Mueller or Rosenstein or otherwise act to obstruct justice while we are in recess. This is our opportunity, our responsibility, to uphold the rule of law and to make clear that no one, even this President—or any President—is above the law. My colleagues, the fig leaf is gone. If we leave this work undone, after all this President has said and done, if he fires individuals responsible for an investigation into which the President himself may be implicated, no Member of this Chamber can say they did not see it coming. For months, this President and his allies in Congress have sought to interfere with, obstruct, and manipulate this investigation: They have selectively leaked or declassified documents; They have sought to impeach the Deputy Attorney General to give the President cover to fire him; 
They have watched in silence as this President has demanded loyalty and public pronouncements of devotion from the Justice Department and law enforcement officials while he has denigrated judges based on their ethnicity, while he has told us that we cannot believe our free press, that we cannot believe what we see and what we hear, but that we can only believe him. All of this is an affront to the rule of law, and all of it has been met with almost absolute silence from my colleagues in the GOP, with the exception of a few brave people like John McCain. This is an administration that says the truth is not truth, that they are entitled to their own alternate facts. There is nothing more corrosive to a democracy than the idea that there is no such thing as truth, that the President is the law, that he is entitled to an Attorney General who will protect him and not the country or our system of justice. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from California an additional 30 seconds. Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, by defeating this previous question, we can bring to the floor a bipartisan bill to protect the special counsel’s investigation. Wake up, my colleagues. Our democracy, our rule of law, is under assault. Stand up to this President. Do your duty. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. SWALWELL ). Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to defeat this previous question so that we can immediately take up Mr. NADLER ’s legislation that would protect Bob Mueller’s special counsel investigation. The rule of law right now is under attack by a wreckingball President who does not respect it, who has fired his investigator and, as we speak, seeks to hire a judge who would protect him. But Bob Mueller, despite the attacks that I hear in this Chamber, is making progress. His investigation started in May 2017. Since May 2017, he has obtained a lot of guilty pleas and indictments. October 5, 2017: a guilty plea against General Michael Flynn, campaign adviser and national security adviser to Donald Trump; December 1, 2017: the statement of offense from Michael Flynn detailing what he had done; October 5, 2017: statement of offense and guilty plea from George Papadopoulos, senior adviser to candidate Trump; February 2, 2018: indictment against Richard Gates, adviser to the President; February 23, 2018: guilty plea from Richard Gates; February 12, 2018: guilty plea from Richard Pinedo; February 16, 2018: guilty plea from Alex van der Zwaan; Indictment, February 16, 2018, against 16 Russians for weaponizing social media to help the Trump campaign, including the Internet Research Association, directly tied to Vladimir Putin; February 22, 2018: superseding indictment against Paul Manafort, campaign chairman for Donald Trump and Richard Gates; February 23, 2018: guilty plea from Richard Gates; June 6, 2018: superseding indictment against Paul Manafort, chairman to Donald Trump, and Konstantin Kilimnik, associated with the Russian intelligence services; September 14, 2018: guilty plea, campaign chairman Paul Manafort, just about 1 month after he was found guilty on a number of counts by a jury of his peers; And, finally, July 13, 2018: 12 Russians indicted for the hacking and stealing of Donald Trump’s opponent’s emails. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. Speaker, the special counsel is making progress. The best thing we can do to uphold the rule of law in this country, to allow him to continue to investigate who attacked us, who worked with the Russians, and to make sure we know all we can do to protect this great democracy is to protect that investigation, to not allow the President to threaten it, and to do our job: protect our great democracy. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity for all the lawyers in the House on the Democratic side to come down and argue their case, but I would politely disagree with them. The way you save this great democracy is by making it economically sound and powerful and prepared so that we can pay for this government, so that we can understand that America’s greatest days lie in our future, so that we can understand it is the American people who want and need to make success, that they want their dream to succeed, not just the government. What we are hearing today is they have abdicated this debate today from what was an economic debate all the way to a political debate. Economics, you see, has that side of it where people can see what works and what doesn’t work, and that is why they have abdicated this fight today on the floor. The fight that they thought they were bringing is not about the success or failure of this; it is about another issue. Mr. Speaker, the bottom line is that America is economically stronger. We have more people working today than in the history of the country. There are companies that are making money, and there are employees who are making money, and there are employees who are successful. When that happens, Mr. Speaker, you get an increase in takehome pay, and that is also what Republicans understand about what we have done: an increase in the amount of takehome pay to where the American people gain benefit not just for their hard work, but for their families; to pay for their families to be able to go to a Boy Scout outing; to make sure they are prepared to send their children to school, so that they can pay themselves, not looking to the government to make the payment for them; not looking for a handout, but, rather, making sure that people have the dignity of work, the dignity of opportunity, an honest day’s work, an honest day’s pay, an opportunity for the free enterprise system, the American Dream, to work. That is what we are talking about today. We are talking about the success and the limiting success. And the limiting success is, if we make these tax policies permanent, it creates an opportunity for wiser choices, wiser decisions, wiser longterm attributes of success, not for the government, but for the American people. b1300 And that is what the debate is on this side: helping the middle class of this country to achieve a strong footing to where they can make their American Dream work not only for them, but for their children and grandchildren. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, with all due respect to my colleague from Texas, tax cuts for the rich and big corporations aren’t going to protect this country from another attack by the Russians on our elections and on democracy. But here is the deal: You can do both. You can debate your tax scam 2.0 for the rich, and if you vote to defeat the previous question, we can also vote to protect the Mueller investigation. So we can do both, and I hope my colleagues will vote to defeat the previous question. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. TORRES ), a distinguished member of the House Rules Committee. Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Speaker, the GOP tax scam has been nothing but a giveaway to millionaires and corporations. This Republican majority is adding trillions—trillions—of dollars to our 
national debt, debt that our children and grandchildren will have to pay for for years to come, trillions in debt that will put Medicare and Social Security at risk. Already, we can’t provide the minimum funding to the ACA, making it harder for our constituents to get health insurance and access to care. Now, how are the Republicans trying to pay for this debt? By attacking—by attacking—the hardworking taxpayers like those that I represent in the great State of California. That is right, so millionaires and corporations can have a tax break. I call that welfare for the most affluent people and corporations in America at the cost of the hardworking taxpayers in California. And let me say that again. Millions of Californians will see their taxes increase with this GOP tax scam. Now, today, as if we haven’t already done enough, the Republican majority is voting to make this tax increase permanent, a permanent tax increase to our hardworking taxpayers. California is the fifth largest global economy. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from California. Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Speaker, California is the fifth largest global economy and a donor State. We should be trying to make every other State more like the great State of California. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the frailty of the arguments from my opponents is staggering. The newest report out, ‘‘the ACA healthcare market stabilized nationwide for most customers,’’ and yet we are told we are not even funding it. It is funded by the government. It is mandatory spending. But the good part is is that they now have an idea of who is in the marketplace and what those correct rates are, and it is stabilizing. It is stabilizing because what we have done is made the opportunity available for people to have a job to pay for their healthcare. And the ability to have a job means that you not only have a chance to pay for your car, your home or apartment, your daughter or your son’s college, but you also have an opportunity to pay for your own insurance, your own healthcare, your own needs to take care of your own family. This is where we see America, right now, has the largest number of people who are employed in America. Every single economic and social indicator indicates that more people at the highest level are employed. More people at the highest level are having an opportunity to get up and go to work, a chance to make their lives and their family better. This is the essence of what we are talking about today: making life better for people, giving them a better opportunity back home to have a job that is available. In Dallas, Texas, where I am from, last week, 2 weeks ago, we had a seminar whereby people talked about and demonstrated what this economy is doing. I had several employers who stood up and said to the media, that was never reported: We have 10 jobs that are available at a starting salary of $60,000, but you have to be able to pass a drug test and you have to come to work every day. We will train you. We will do the training. We don’t need the government or someone else to do that, but you have to do two things: You have to be able to pass the drug test, and you have got to come to work every day, and you have got to be able to go be willing to be a part of a team that is about your success and theirs also. 
What a great deal the free enterprise offers today. Instead of us begging for jobs and wishing they were here, they abound, Mr. Speaker. It is called great economics. It is called making America great again. That is why we want to make it permanent. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, if I can inquire of the gentleman from Texas how many more speakers he has on his side? Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I have one. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I kind of figured, if this was so popular, that there would be tons of Republicans down here. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. MOORE ). Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, hallelujah. Let the Republican majority tell it. The American people are just going to be so thrilled with tax scam 2.0 where we permanently lock in obscene tax advantages for corporations and the wealthy, where we lock in inequality, where we directly threaten Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Now, Mr. Speaker, the American people are just going to be bereft of this economic security and retirement security, but they are going to spontaneously break out in a Depressionera George Gershwin opera, like I did on the stage of North Division High School: 
I got plenty o’ nuttin’, And nuttin’s plenty for me. I got no car, got no misery. 
Meanwhile, the folks with plenty of plenty are getting 80 percent of this tax cut, increasing the debt by another $3 trillion in just 3 years’ time. Mr. Speaker, no singing, no dancing, no tax scam. My constituents want our country’s wealth back. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, there is a lot of song and dance on the floor, but it is revisionist history. What some of our colleagues have forgotten is that the African American unemployment during President Obama’s Presidency was 15.5 percent. It was called misery. It was called no job. It was called unemployment. It was called more government assistance. It was called, unfortunately, demise. Mr. Speaker, what we have done by passing the tax cut is to make sure that employers had an opportunity to hire employees. All across this country, there is a marketplace available to people who were ready and willing to come to work, and they have. The figures are, to us, as Republican, normal and regular. We were told by President Obama and Ms. PELOSI : ‘‘We can’t get the 4.2 percent GDP rate.’’ That is right. You can’t get to 4.2 because your policies and procedures won’t let the country do that. We are going to be stuck in the ones. But, Mr. Speaker, what happened is that a new energy abounded in this country, and it is called optimism and opportunity and success and redevelopment of ideas to bring the American spirit back to the top. And that was, instead of Uncle Sam telling us what to do, we are getting that opportunity to have the success back home. That is why the largest number of African Americans ever in the marketplace or, thereto, the largest number of women, the largest number of Hispanics in the marketplace today. This is yet another reason, Mr. Speaker, why Republicans are on the floor talking about the economy and my friends are talking about another issue. Mr. Speaker, we need to be very clear about this. I will be asking all 435 Members of Congress, for them to see the reality and the truth of what is available back home, and that is opportunity can abound for a longer period of time with more success and more opportunity. The next chance to make sure that the contract that is won by their company or the next successful quarter or the next opportunity that they get to get a pay raise can come because we are making sure that the free enterprise system is sound and secure for the future. And that is how you save Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid: by working today and protecting American jobs. It is an effort that the Republican Party has had, will have, has today, and we can’t wait to see the vote to see who is for the free enterprise system of seeing that success. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. YARMUTH ), the distinguished ranking member of the Committee on the Budget. Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, just 8 months ago, the Republicans jammed through their massive, unpaidfor tax cut. Not a single Democrat voted for that bill, and for good reason. Nonpartisan experts told us that the tax cut would overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy and big corporations while threatening our fiscal and economic health. It would 
add more than $1 trillion to the Nation’s debt. And the newest reports on the impact of the tax law further confirm those dire warnings: Corporate profits have soared, along with stock buybacks, while workingclass wages remain stagnant and income and wealth inequality continue to grow. Yet today, Republicans want to go even further, pushing their tax cut 2.0 legislation. It is not a surprise that they are extending the provisions of their tax bill. The expirations were always gimmicks to hide the true cost of the tax cut and evade the constraints on reconciliation bills. This new legislation, once again, benefits the wealthiest Americans and adds trillions of dollars more to the Nation’s debt in decades to come, further jeopardizing the Nation’s already rocky longterm fiscal outlook. This new tax cut 2.0 package, just like the one before it, is being rushed through the House with no hearings and no input from the American people. The Republican tax cut 2.0 legislation is another irresponsible tax cut for the wealthy that threatens our long term fiscal and economic health, and we know how that story ends. As Republicans have often demonstrated, they are committed to cutting more taxes for the rich, fretting when deficits rise, and then attacking crucial programs American families rely on, such as Medicare and Social Security, to pay for the debt increase. Let’s not add more to this threestep process. This is not the time to rush through another round of tax cuts. The rule before us would allow for passage of this irresponsible legislation, and I urge my colleagues to oppose the rule. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the American Dream should be available to everybody: young, old, African American, Hispanic, Native American, even those people who have come to our shores. To make America work, American business has to work. Making American business work— which is why we have business schools, why we have collegeeducated people, why we have entrepreneurship, why we have small business owners, why we have people who dedicate themselves to that free enterprise system—comes about as a result of their opportunity to work within a series of rules, regulations, and tax policy that is balanced. A balanced tax policy would tell you that, if you have the highest taxes in the marketplace, your opportunity levels diminish. Likewise, it would say and tell you that, if you do not pay an honest day’s work for an honest day’s pay, you would not have employees and would be searching to try and make up that deficit another way. b1315 Today, American business and American workers have more work than we can get done in 1 day, and numbers of orders and opportunities for our future abound. That is what we are here about also. We are here about the youngest of people who we have in our midst who are second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth grade. We are about those people who are in college, who are studying hard because they want to be a part of a workforce. They want to be part of making their dream better. But if there are no jobs, that is an indictment on this body. That is an indictment of elected officials and of an administration, many of them unelected, but who have a policy that fits their political ideology, rather than what is intended for success of people back home. Today, I am going to ask every Member of this body, and I will do it right now, to please understand that you will have an opportunity to vote to make what we have today even more successful for a longer period of time; and to grow the amount of GDP; to grow the amount of investment; to believe in the American worker; to expect the opportunity for there to be an equal marketplace share, where the employer and the employee can both gain, not only in the ability to pay their own bills, but the ability to sustain what we do. Mr. Speaker, let’s not show the short side of this and talk about the negatives or the frailties or the things that really, I don’t think, will come to bear, but let’s talk about the success. The success is that we are going to move our stock market, as it is doing today, with the evidence that they have that we can, as a body, move our business. Just this week, we had an opportunity to do what hadn’t been done for 21 years. Those pesky Republicans in the House and the Senate and our President are going to sign a bill funding 80 percent of the government to avoid not just a continuing resolution, but to get it done on time, expecting this government, in their balance, to do their job that we have entrusted them with. Today, we are taking part on the other part of that equation, to the free enterprise system saying: Keep producing jobs. Keep doing the things that small business does; whether you are in Weatherford, Texas, and own a car dealership, and you sell your product and make it available to customers back home, and you expect them to pay and your product to sell and win, or whether we expect to produce products that we sell overseas. Mr. Speaker, it is the other half of the equation. This same week that we gave 80 percent of the government, including the military and Health and Human Services, the things that they have asked for and need to produce, today, we are asking the other side of the equation, the American people, to continue fighting, continue working, continue believing, not only in your American Dream, but continue to believe that the future of this country is bright and going to be successful for you and your family. They can drown out the detractors. They can drown out people who brought a different idea to the table, because that brought us 15 percent unemployment for African Americans when we had a President who claims he was there for equality also. Equality is a job and an opportunity. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. COHEN ). Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I am here to urge this House to defeat the previous question so that we can hear H.R. 5476, a bipartisan bill to protect the Special Counsel, Mr. Mueller. It is important for democracy and for the rule of law for which we are respected around the globe that Mr. Mueller’s investigation goes on and not be impeded by the firing of Mr. Rosenstein and the imposition of somebody who is inimical to Mr. Mueller’s investigation. I want to quote Bill Frist, former Republican majority leader in the Senate. ‘‘Congress must never abandon its role as an equal branch of government. In this moment, that means protecting Mueller’s investigation. We’re at our best as Senators and Republicans when we defend our institutions. But more than that, it’s our best face as Americans. ‘‘People around the world admire not just the material wellbeing of the United States but our values, too. The rule of law is something many die trying to secure for their countries. We can’t afford to squander it at home.’’ Defeat the previous question. Protect Robert Mueller. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, if I could just inquire of the gentleman from Texas one more time, just to make sure there is nobody else who wants to speak. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, as a matter of fact, the gentleman is correct. I will be closing for us, so anytime the gentleman chooses to do that, he may expend his time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the Republicans have so diminished this House of Representatives. We are being told that tomorrow may be our last day in session before the election, that the Republicans will adjourn 2 weeks early so they can go home to try to convince voters that they deserve to be reelected. What we are doing today, this tax scam 2.0, is a joke, because they know it is going nowhere in the Senate. They are frightened by the fact that their original tax bill is so terribly unpopular, and rightfully so, because the American people object to a tax bill where 83 percent of the benefits go to the top 1 percent. That is just not fair. People understand things like fairness. Mr. Speaker, we are asking people to defeat the previous question to protect 
the Mueller investigation. Since we are adjourning most likely tomorrow, this may be our only time to do it. You can vote to defeat the previous question. You can still vote for this tax scam bill, but you also can vote on whether or not to protect the Mueller investigation. We ought to do that. But there is another thing I want Members of both sides to appreciate, as this may be the last rule we bring to the floor. What we are considering today is recordshattering. The majority broke the record for the number of closed rules in Congress earlier this year. The record they broke, by the way, was their own. This restrictive process has often shut out debates here on the House floor that the American people desperately want this Congress to have, on issues like gun safety, protecting the Dreamers, and lowering the cost of prescription drugs. Now, today, the majority is taking is the most closed Congress in American history to a whole new level because, tucked inside this measure, is the majority’s 99th, 100th, and 101st first closed rules of this Congress. There has never ever been a moment like this in American history, more than 100 closed rules in a single Congress. This isn’t some arcane legislative matter. Consider what the majority has brought under closed rules, things like their first tax scam and their disastrous healthcare repeal bill. There are still months to go before the 116th Congress begins. Who knows what other disasters the majority of President Trump will dream up next. Now, Mr. Speaker, I am not suggesting that everything that the House considers should be under an open rule. There are times when a closed rule might be necessary. But more than 100 closed rules? There is no justification for that. Now, I don’t know who will run this place in January, but if Democrats are trusted with the majority, we will have a more accommodating process. This place will be run like professionals. Ideas will be allowed to come forward, and the House of Representatives will actually debate again. But we don’t have to wait until next year to force a more open process. We can start right here today. My Republican colleagues have voiced frustration with their majority’s closed process. Well, we have the chance here to do more than just talk. We can vote. So when a closed rule goes down, Speaker RYAN will actually have to start upholding his promise of a more open, more inclusive, more deliberative, and more participatory process. It would be better late than never. While calling for a more open process, virtually every Republican voted for every closed rule we have considered. The rank and file Republicans are part of the problem. Mr. Speaker, if they are not going to take a stand on the 101st closed rule, will they ever be able to back up their talk with their vote? So I ask the majority, as we stand on the doorstep of this dubious distinction, join us in voting against this recordshattering closed rule. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, before I start, could you please advise me on how much time remains for me. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. WILLIAMS ). The gentleman from Texas has 2
1⁄2minutes remaining. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, the opportunity that we have to be on the floor today is about one thing. They want to make it about something else, and that is within their purview and their decision. What it is about is whether we are going to continue to have the highest rates of employment in this country; the highest and best opportunity for people to continue takehome pay increases; the opportunity for American jobs, workers, and business to have more work than we have employees for; the opportunity to take and have, all across this country, the opportunity for reinvestment; the opportunity for people to be successful; the opportunity for people who are in school today to look up and know they see a bright future. That is the way the world sees it, at least I think we do here in America, not in Washington. We might be a drugfree work zone up here, but what we have is the ability for this majority to keep pushing its opportunity for success for the American people. So this week, we took care of making sure we fund, on time, perhaps a little bit early, the government for next year. But we are also going to fund the American people and the free enterprise system. So, Mr. Speaker, what a fun day, what a great opportunity for people all across schools, and in schools, and people who work to say, one party is going to vote for me and one party is going to vote against me. I am asking every Member to do it, so that we get together on economic outlook and view. I urge my colleagues to support the rule. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak out against H.R. 6760, the Protecting Family and Small Business Tax Cuts Acts of 2018, along with the two other bills packaged into what is being called Tax Reform 2.0. H.R. 6760 is a continuation of the GOP’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was pushed into law in December 2017. This 2017 tax law is a scam on the American public, and the legislation before us today is more of the same. The fundamental problem with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is that its goal was never to help the average American. Instead, it helps out large corporations and wealthy individuals by dramatically decreasing their tax rates. H.R. 6760 doubles down on these regressive policies, doing nothing to even the playing field for millions of working Americans struggling to enter or stay in the middle class. Like the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, H.R. 6760 continues to favor highincome individuals over middle and workingclass Americans. To make matters worse, H.R. 6760 adds to the large debt we have as a nation. According to the Congressional Budget Office, H.R. 6760 alone would increase the deficit by $631 billion over the next ten years. At a time when the deficit is already too high, we need to start figuring out ways to stop the deficit from growing, not adding to it. A growing deficit only means that critical benefits that Americans use every day, like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid will be diminished or demolished as a way to pay for this unfair and flawed tax legislation. Ending crucial benefits that Americans rely on every day is another attack on the very people who sent us here. Instead of continuing to hurt Americans, Congress must come together to create a tax code that is fair for all American workers and the middle class. I urge my colleagues to create a tax code that evens out the playing field for American workers, strengthens working families, and helps our economy benefit all Americans. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H. Res. 1084, the rule governing debate for H.R. 6756, the American Innovation Act of 2018,’’ H.R. 6757 ‘‘Family Savings Act of 2018,’’ and H.R. 6760 ‘‘Protecting Family and Small Business Tax Cuts Act of 2018’’. I must oppose this rule and urge the defeat the previous question, not because we do not support innovation for our small businesses and entrepreneurs, but because defeating the previous question will enable this House to consider and pass H.R. 5476, the ‘‘Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act’’. This is an opportunity we do not want to misuse. For the last sixteen months, our nation has watched as the Special Counsel investigating the attack on our democracy during the 2016 election has returned dozens of indictments against foreign actors suspected of interfering in our democracy. Tellingly, the investigation has also returned a series of guilty pleas, including: allocutions from the President’s former personal lawyer; his campaign chairman; his deputy campaign chairman; his first national security advisor; a top foreign policy advisor, and many more. Americans have come to the conclusion that the 2016 election was a crime scene. The 2018 election could be one too. While the Special Counsel—appointed by officials from the Trump Administration—has been diligently returning pleas and indictments, and unearthing the extraordinary efforts that a hostile foreign power had on our election, the President has been busy berating the effort, and those whom he believes are assisting in attempts to get at the truth of what transpired in the 2016 election. Yet, beyond guilty pleas and indictments, the Special Counsel has also been performing an essential service for the American people: he has been telling the American people a story of how our democracy is susceptible to outside influence. He has done this by sharing certain, critical facts such as: the President’s son, soninlaw and campaign manager attended a meeting with 
agents of the Russian government promising to have ‘‘dirt’’ on the President’s 2016 opponent, Secretary Hillary Clinton; we also learned how Russians funneled money through stalwart Republicanleaning organizations to influence our campaign; and we learned that Russians selectively leaked and indeed weaponized stolen emails in order to influence our electorate. Alongside this parade of developments, the American people have watched as this president has tried to wrestle control—either functionally or formally—of the investigation into the Russian interference in the 2016 campaign, and whether and to what extent the effort was aided and abetted associates of the Trump Campaign. For good reason, Americans are suspicious of this president’s ability to abide by longstanding norms to which all prior American presidents have adhered: the need to abstain from interfering in law enforcement investigations. Most infamously, the President breached this norm when he fired the former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, James Comey in May 2017. Between that date and now, the President has: ridiculed the Attorney General, who recused himself from overseeing the Russia investigation and, in the process, drew the ire of the president; terminated or forced the retirements of several senior law enforcement officials; and has threatened or attempted to take extraordinary steps—like the selective dissemination of classified information—for the purposes of tainting the investigation into his possible criminal activity. Along the way, House Republicans have refused to exercise even the slightest amount of oversight on this president or this president. One significant way the Congress can do this is by protecting the Special Counsel and his investigation. This has long been a concern of mine. This is why, alongside the JERRY NADLER , the Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee, I introduced H.R. 5476, the Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act. If enacted into law, H.R. 5476 permits a terminated Special Counsel to challenge his termination in court and would stay the investigation pending the challenge. The Special Counsel would be given a notice stating the reasons for the removal. The matter would be heard by a three judge panel who would determine whether the removal was for misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest, or other good cause. If it is, the removal is affirmed. If it is not, the Special Counsel is reinstated. In the face of this president’s bellicosity towards the law enforcement institutions investigating him, the Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act is a measure of oversight we can place on this president, who increasingly feels emboldened to flout longstanding norms in the name of covering up his past conduct. This is an Article I moment—it is time for all in this chamber and across the Capitol in the Senate to seize it. Through their elected representatives, the American people must harness the constitutional apparatus created by the Framers and provide oversight on a president sorely in need of it. The material previously referred to by Mr. MCGOVERN is as follows: 
AN AMENDMENT TO H. R ES. 1084 O FFERED BY  MR. MCGOVERN  At the end of the resolution, add the following new sections: SEC. 9. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. 5476) to ensure independent investigations and judicial review of the removal of a special counsel, and for other purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary. After general debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the fiveminute rule. All points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the bill. SEC. 10. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the consideration of H.R. 5476. 
THEVOTE ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION : WHAT ITREALLY MEANS  This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the House of Representatives (VI, 308–311), describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.’’ To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition’’ in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R–Illinois) said: ‘‘The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.’’ The Republican majority may say ‘‘the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.’’ But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here’s how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ‘‘Although it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.’’ In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled ‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ‘‘Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon.’’ Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Republican majority’s agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous question.

net operating loss carryforward which arose in such startup period taxable year as— ‘‘(I) the net operating loss (if any) which would have been determined for such startup period taxable year if only items of income, gain, deduction, and loss properly allocable to such trade or business were taken into account, bears to ‘‘(II) the amount of the net operating loss determined for such startup period taxable year. ‘‘(ii) SPECIAL RULE FOR LAST TAXABLE YEAR IN

ARISING IN YEAR OF OWNERSHIP CHANGE .—Sub paragraph (A) shall apply to any net operating loss described in paragraph (1)(B) in the same manner as such subparagraph applies to net operating loss carryforwards described in paragraph (1)(A), but by only taking into account the amount of such net operating loss (and the amount of the net startup loss) which is allocable under paragraph (1)(B) to the period described in such paragraph.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill, as amended, shall be debatable for 1 hour, equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means. The gentleman from Florida (Mr. BUCHANAN ) and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. JUDY CHU) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. 
Mr. BUCHANAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 6756, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. BUCHANAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am grateful this bill has been brought to the floor for consideration. I rise in support of H.R. 6756, the American Innovation Act, which supports and encourages entrepreneurs to start new businesses. The United States recently dropped out of Bloomberg’s list of the top 10 most innovative countries in the world. New business formations in the United States have taken a dramatic downturn since the 2008 recession. Between 1977 and 2007, those 30 years, the economy added 120,000, net, new businesses each year. Since 2008, however, the economy has added only about 2,000, net, new businesses each year since. We should all be committed to making the United States the innovation leader of the world. The American Innovation Act is a down payment towards reaching that goal. The American Innovation Act encourages entrepreneurs in two ways: First, H.R. 6756 allows new businesses to immediately deduct more of their startup organizational expenses. It simplifies the Code and allows businesses to deduct up to $20,000 of startup and organizational expenses when their new business begins. This doubles the amount of the expenses that a business may write off in its first year. Second, the American Innovation Act helps new businesses innovate by preserving valuable tax benefits, like the R&D credit, that are generated from activities conducted in the business’ early years. As any entrepreneur knows, starting a new business requires hard work and a lot of capital. During its early years, many businesses operate at a loss, and these losses are used in later years when the business matures and becomes more profitable. To fund their innovation and growth, entrepreneurs and business owners may seek equity capital from other investors. Today, the infusion of this new investment may trigger limits on the use of a corporation’s valuable losses and credits from the business’ earlier years. Under the American Innovation Act, our country’s businesses may fund their growth and innovation with equity investments from new shareholders without limiting the use of these valuable losses and credits. Mr. Speaker, the American Innovation Act supports our entrepreneurs and innovators and facilitates the creation of new businesses. I urge support for this important bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the American Innovation Act. But before I talk about the underlying bill, I want to make clear that this bill is part of the Republicans’ larger tax scam 2.0. Instead of increasing opportunity or addressing the income inequality for Americans, the Republicans are doubling down on their failed policies that benefit the wealthiest Americans and are ultimately paid for by the middle class. As a result of the Republicans’ tax law, health insurance companies in 
State after State are announcing higher premiums for next year, while health coverage for those living with preexisting conditions is on the chopping block. To make matters worse, the Medicare trustees cut 3 years off the life of the Medicare trust fund because of the Republican tax bill. But instead of backing away from their mistake, the Republicans are doubling down. Their second round of tax cuts for the wealthy will further compromise the future of Medicare and Social Security, depriving seniors the benefits they have earned. Not to mention, Republicans are cutting taxes for the rich for the second time in less than a year. By simply making permanent the cut to the top individual tax rate, Republicans are providing a huge tax cut for just a fraction of the top 5 percent of taxpayers. At the same time, the Republicans have doubled down on their attack on the middle class by making permanent the limits to the State and local tax deduction. In fact, in my home district in California, 37 percent of tax filers claimed the SALT deduction in 2016, and the average SALT deduction was $18,517 according to IRS data. This is nearly double the cap that Republicans have put in place, and that means that middle class families in my district are footing the bill for the wealthy’s permanent tax cuts. In addition, Republicans are also permanently limiting the mortgage interest deduction and casualty loss deduction. Furthermore, the socalled party of fiscal conservatism will be passing over $3 trillion in tax breaks in less than a year. Because of the Republican tax law and President Trump’s irresponsible policies, the U.S. Treasury is now borrowing money at a rate of $5.4 billion per day. This package, like the one before it, is being rushed through with no hearings and no input from stakeholders. A rushed and lopsided process resulted in tax bill 1.0, and, in fact, Democrats have identified over 100 problems with the Republicans’ tax law. Republicans are doubling down on their flawed policies with this exercise, with bills guaranteed to be dead on arrival in the Senate. Tax scam 2.0 is another reckless tax cut for the wealthy that leaves behind average, hardworking families. Now I would like to discuss H.R. 6756, the American Innovation Act. This bill has never received consideration in a public committee hearing. Last year, the Republicans’ rushed process created the end result of a disastrous tax law that is riddled with problems. Yet rather than learn from their mistake, the Republicans are, once again, moving forward with legislation without the appropriate oversight. Mr. Speaker, I strongly believe in American innovation and entrepreneurship. As the only member of both the House Small Business Committee and the Ways and Means Committee, I know just how critical small businesses are to the growth of our economy. They create two out of every three new jobs and allow people to be their own bosses. I know that my Democratic colleagues and I would have enthusiastically and actively participated in the construction of bipartisan legislation to help small businesses deduct more of their startup costs. This is something I care deeply about because access to capital is one of the biggest challenges facing our entrepreneurs today. However, Democrats were shut out of the process once again as the bill was rushed to the floor. With only a few days left for Congress to be in session, the Republicans have yet to address rising healthcare costs and how to pay for innovation and value in our healthcare system. b1415 They have done nothing to stop the haphazard and reckless trade policy coming out of the White House. And this week, the Republicans are driving these socalled tax reform 2.0 bills down a road to nowhere. If they were serious about helping small businesses and innovative startups, they surely would have not treated these provisions like an afterthought to their 2017 tax bill. Therefore, I oppose H.R. 6756 and encourage my colleagues to do the same. We should work together to ensure that small businesses and innovative startups have the tools to not just survive, but actually thrive in the economy. We can do better in a fiscally responsible manner that does not recklessly add to the deficit. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BUCHANAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Texas (Mr. BRADY ), chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6756, the American Innovation Act of 2018, and thank Chairman BUCHANAN and others for his leadership for America’s startup businesses and innovation. The truth is, startup businesses are huge contributors to innovation and productivity as well as job creation here in America. But the business environment since the great financial crisis has been tough for those looking to take a risk and start a business. In fact, new business formation here in America took a dramatic downturn during the recession, with startups only accounting for 8 percent of all businesses in 2015. That is cut in half from 1977. The United States also dropped out of Bloomberg’s list of the top 10 most innovative countries in the world. We know that the nation that wins the innovation race wins the future. This is a problem and, more importantly, it is a call to action. The American Innovation Act, led by Chairman BUCHANAN , will help our entrepreneurs move a business from their kitchen table to their first office by allowing them to write off more startup costs in their early years—years where every dollar matters. This bill will also allow startups to expand and go to the next level here in America by bringing in new investors without triggering tax limits on their access to tax benefits like the R&D tax credit for activities conducted in their early years. With a renewed focus on innovation and entrepreneurship, the American Innovation Act will help America’s risk takers create jobs, invest in their communities, and continue strengthening America’s economy. Mr. Speaker, this is a very simple bill. It can be read in just a couple of minutes. It focuses on America’s entrepreneurs and startup costs. A ‘‘yes’’ vote is in support of startup businesses here in America. A ‘‘yes’’ vote is for innovation expansion here in the United States, not somewhere else. A ‘‘yes’’ vote is for economic growth. Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. WELCH ). Mr. WELCH. Mr. Speaker, it is with some sadness that I have to say I believe this is an absolutely terrible tax bill. The economy is growing. That has been a claim that has been made by proponents of this tax policy. But it is growing for the few. It is not growing for the many. We have the lowest unemployment rate we have had in years. We have had the highest profits in corporations that we have had since before the Great Depression. Yet, right now, in this country, childhood poverty is increasing relentlessly. Relentlessly. How does that happen when we have such a great socalled economy? It happens because we have created the hydraulic system that is transferring money from the low income and middle class to the very wealthy. That is what this Congress has done. And there are consequences to the children who are now in poverty and will be in poverty, but also to those everyday families who aren’t on the right side of the digital divide and whose wages for the past 20 years have been stagnant or declining, even as the things they need—college education for their kids, prescription medication for their families—those prices are exploding. And by the way, Pharma gets a huge giveaway. They have got the highest profits they have ever had, and we are passing a tax bill that gives them more. We are shoveling money to them when they are sticking price increases to all of us. This doesn’t happen by accident. This has nothing to do with the socalled entrepreneurial economy. This has to do with a Congress that has no conscience, that doesn’t stand up for everyday people and say: We want policies that let you have a chance. 
Mr. Speaker, defeat this bill. Mr. BUCHANAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Let me say to the gentleman that I am not sure how the economy works in Vermont, but I can tell you that in terms of the tax package—the original one and this one, 2.0—Florida is on fire, in terms of growth. There is more energy and more excitement about the tax thing. Ninety percent of people are getting a tax break. For families of four in my area, it is $2,400. We have seen little or no growth for the last 10 years. Now we are at 2 to 3 percent. We have got real growth. It is tough to get the amount of workers that we now need in Florida, in general. That is pushing paychecks. So I don’t know what is going on in Vermont or different parts of the country, but I can tell you that in Florida it is making a huge difference in terms of the confidence with a lot of startups and entrepreneurs. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. MITCHELL). Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I am changing my comments because I was offended by the last speaker. I grew up in a family where dad built trucks on the line and mom worked at the Salvation Army. In my district alone, people get to keep $2,700 of the money they earn in their pocket rather than being sent to the Federal Government so our colleagues on the other side of the aisle can find a way to spend it. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was the first major reforms and major tax cuts in 31 years. I was young the last time Congress was actually able to do something about taxing people, taxing money that they earned so we could figure out how to spend it here—and, frankly, some days, I am convinced not well. Since that tax cut jobs have grown. As is noted, unemployment is down record levels across all demographics. The class warfare kind of amazes me, frankly. This week, we are building on those achievements by advancing three critical pieces legislation. First, the bill now, the American Innovation Act, will allow startup businesses to double the writeoff amount of startup costs to encourage new business, exactly the type of people we want to grow businesses and create jobs in this country. It will bring in new investors and doesn’t trigger limits on their tax benefits. Today, we will also consider the Family Savings Act, which gives broader options for retirement savings for people that go to work and want to know what happens when they get older. Tomorrow, we will be debating the Protecting Families and Small Business Tax Cuts, which makes permanent the individual and small business tax cuts from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, tax benefits that were denied in the Senate because it was determined they needed 60 votes. I will tell you where the 60 votes did not come in. It did not come in from our colleagues on the other side of the aisle. So when we were criticized that they are not permanent at this time, it is because our colleagues on the other side of the aisle decided they would use it as a political talking point rather than make permanent the benefits that would have helped my family, my parents, when they worked. Mr. Speaker, I am a cosponsor of all three bills, and I ask my colleagues to support them. Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. KIND). Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise reluctantly in opposition to this legislation. I say reluctantly because there are some good, decent provisions that are contained in this legislation. The first year expensing for new businesses, the net operating loss and tax credit carry over to new ownership and small businesses. There is a lot of bipartisan support for doing more to support entrepreneurs and the startup of businesses in that early stage capital that this bill, in part, is meant to address. Unfortunately the process is all wrong. Instead of holding hearings, instead of getting feedback, instead of soliciting bipartisan support—and I am confident that if time were in order to build support for this bill, there would be wide bipartisan support—this legislation is being driven for one reason and one reason only: the political calendar. That is a missed opportunity. We ought to get back to doing our business on the Ways and Means Committee and start holding hearings, start getting feedback, and doing it in a fiscally responsible manner. This bill, because of no effort to find an offset, will increase our debt by over $5 billion. Again, it is for some press releases leading to the midterm elections. Who cares what the impact is going to be for our children and grandchildren or on future financial obligations that our Nation shares. Apparently, that fiscal responsibility is out the window right now, based on the tax cut that passed last year and the next two bills coming up out of the Ways and Means Committee this week. But what else is also unfortunate is that during the markup of this bill, our good friend, the gentleman from California (Mr. THOMPSON ), offered a very important and I thought thoughtful amendment that would allow tax credit deductibility for small businesses that were impacted by natural disasters. My district in western Wisconsin just got slammed with major flooding this past month. Unfortunately, there is not a lot of help at the Federal and State level, whether it is FEMA or State agencies, when it comes to helping small businesses get back on their feet. There just isn’t. There are small, lowinterest SBA loans and maybe some nointerest loans that the State can offer that all have to be repaid. Other than that, there is really nothing. Representative THOMPSON offered an amendment that said: Let’s have the Federal Tax Code work with these small businesses rather than against them. Instead of that being thoughtfully considered, it was rejected out of hand because of the rush to get this bill on the floor. Again, another missed opportunity of how we should be conducting business around here and recognizing the needs of small businesses throughout the country. Let’s slow down. Let’s reject what is before us today. We still have time. The Senate is not planning on taking up these bills. Let’s go back to doing it the right way. Let’s talk to one another and find some common ground. And let’s do it in a fiscally responsible manner so we are not saddling future generations with huge debt, especially given the aging population in our country. What we have before us today is the result of a bad process. We can do better. I encourage my colleagues to reject it. Let’s do it the right way. Mr. BUCHANAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I just want to mention to the gentleman from Wisconsin that there were no amendments offered on this bill, if he wants to check that. I also have a list of groups who are supportive of this bill, such as Associated Builders and Contractors, the Chamber of Commerce, Biotechnology Innovation Organization, and Angel Capital Association. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  this document listing organizations in support of the bill.

Mr. BUCHANAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LAHOOD). Mr. LAHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman BUCHANAN for all his hard work on this legislation. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in support of H.R. 6756, the American Innovation Act. Over the last 9 months since we passed onceinalifetime tax reform, small businesses have been empowered by those positive changes to expand operations, hire new workers, reward employees with bonuses or increased pay, and keep jobs here at home. In central and west central Illinois, in my district, we have seen firsthand how the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has alleviated businesses of the burdensome Tax Code we were under before, giving companies all across different sectors and sizes the ability to innovate and grow into businesses. They are companies such as Rivian Automotive in BloomingtonNormal, Illinois, who is creating stateofthe art full electricpowered pickups and SUVs. They announced in May they will be manufacturing their trucks in BloomingtonNormal, bringing jobs and economic opportunity to our community. AutonomouStuff in Morton, Illinois, has evolved into a worldwide leader in the development of innovative software and engineering technologies that enable robotics and autonomy. Precision Planting in Tremont, Illinois, is testing agriculture practices so that farmers all across the heartland can find innovative ways to increase production and sustain equipment, making central Illinois the Silicon Valley of the Midwest. With the largest medical community in downstate Illinois, the innovative breakthroughs at our local healthcare systems, such as OSF HealthCare’s Jump Trading Simulation Center in Peoria, or the Memorial Center for Learning and Innovation in Springfield, serve as catalysts for reforming how healthcare is delivered by making healthcare safer, more accessible, and affordable. b1430 The American Innovation Act, which we are presenting today after a lot of thoughtful work by the committee, builds upon the economic successes small businesses have seen over the last 9 months, unleashing entrepreneurs’ innovative spirit, so they can continue to grow, prosper, and succeed. Since the recession, creation of new businesses has taken a significant downturn, and it is time we reform our Tax Code so entrepreneurs have the ability to achieve their goals. Mr. Speaker, I commend Chairman BUCHANAN and Chairman B RADY for their hard work and urge my colleagues to support this bill. Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, first, I would like to clarify something. I appreciate the comment from Chairman BUCHANAN regarding Mr. THOMPSON ’s amendment, but that does not change the fact that, during tax bill 2.0 and its markup, every Republican present voted against permanent natural disaster relief on H.R. 6760. Mr. Speaker, Democrats are strong believers in the power of American innovation and entrepreneurship. Democrats support small businesses, which are the backbone of our economy and create two out of every three new jobs. My Democratic colleagues and I would have loved to participate in the drafting of bipartisan legislation to help small businesses and innovative startups succeed, but that is not the process that the majority adopted. This bill, just like tax scam 1.0, has never received the scrutiny it deserves in a public committee hearing. A rushed and lopsided process resulted in the disastrous tax law. Yet, rather than learn from their mistakes, Republicans are once again rushing through legislation without the appropriate oversight. This process should tell you how serious the majority is about helping small businesses, which is not very. If the Republicans were serious about helping small businesses last year, they surely would not have enacted their socalled small business tax benefit to disguise a massive tax cut for millionaires. If Republicans were serious about helping small businesses and innovative startups today, they surely would not have treated these provisions like an afterthought, guaranteed to be dead on arrival in the Senate. Mr. Speaker, I believe we should work together to ensure that small businesses, ranging from momandpop shops to cuttingedge startups, have the tools they need to thrive in this economy. But we should do it the right way, with hearings and input from stakeholders, and in a fiscally responsible manner, not by saddling future Americans with more debt. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BUCHANAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, as someone who has been in business 30 years, I can just tell you that, in the last couple of years, our economy in Florida and I think all over America has exploded. People are excited. They are enthusiastic. In fact, I did a roundtable of all women in my district. Why did I do that? Because 57 percent of startups in the next 10 years will be women led. So why would we want to not support giving them additional deductions? Instead of just writing off $5,000, they can write off $20,000. In terms of opening businesses, it is as little as 2,000 a year. It used to be 100,000plus new startups a year. That is where the jobs are created. I chaired the local chamber in Sarasota, Florida. I can tell you, out of the 2,400 businesses, most of them were 15 employees or less, 90 percent. I also chaired the Florida chamber. There were 126,000 businesses in that federation, and most of them were 15 employees or less, many times 1, 2, 3 employees. It is tough when you open a business. Usually, you have losses for a couple of years. This bill helps to address that, especially as they try to attract capital. They could use some of those losses to attract capital. This is all about probusiness and growth. We have had little or no growth for the last 10 years. Now we are starting to take off and be much more competitive in the world. That is what this bill is all about. Mr. Speaker, let me just close with this thought. For too many years, the United States has been lagging in the creation of new businesses. Startup businesses are vital to the American economy, because they are significant contributors to innovation, productivity, and job creation. Together, we should all support the legislation. This makes it easier and less costly for hardworking Americans to realize their American Dream of starting businesses. The American Innovation Act does just that. It supports innovators, entrepreneurs, workers, and the economy with commonsense policy solutions. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 1084, the previous question is ordered on the bill, as amended. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on passage of the bill. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. BUCHANAN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill, as amended, shall be debatable for 1 hour, equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means. The gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. KELLY ) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DOGGETT ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 6757, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Pennsylvania? There was no objection. Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume and thank leadership for bringing this bill to the floor. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in support of H.R. 6757, the Family Savings Act, which will make it easier for American families and individuals to save for their future, whether it is retirement, education, or healthcare, helping them to make sure that they are keeping more of their hardearned income, more of their own money, and planning for their future. This bill will also help local businesses provide retirement plans to their workers and help workers participate more in all those plans. Now, according to the Department of Labor and the Federal Reserve, about 69 million American workers have formal retirement plans, which, together, have almost $14 trillion in savings for them. This bill will incentivize hardworking American taxpayers to continue to put away more of their own money for their future. One of the things I remember so clearly from growing up is my parents talking to us all the time and saying: The one thing we never want to be for you kids is a burden. We never want to be a hardship for you as we go into our senior years. I thought to myself at that time: How could anybody look across the table at people who had worked so hard, had come through the Great Depression, had come through World War II, had come through the Korean war, had gone through all kinds of difficulties and had always provided for us and think that? How in the world could they ever think that they would be a burden to me or to my brothers and sisters? It was unimaginable for me, but that is what they thought. That is what they worried about. They never wanted to be a burden to anybody. Just think about that for a minute. That generation, often described as the Greatest Generation, was telling us, the next generation, that they never wanted to be a burden. What we are talking about today is relieving the burden on the next generation by making it easier for people to go into their retirement feeling that they have enough income to actually enjoy their golden years. H.R. 6757 would allow for every American worker, at all income levels, to save money in universal savings accounts, in which those earnings would be taxfree and could be taken out at any time without a penalty. How unique to be able to take your own money out and use it without being penalized by the Federal Government. It would also allow Americans to use their 529 plans to pay for costs associated with home schooling, apprenticeships, just like they now can for primary and secondary schools thanks to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. And if one sibling has more money in a 529 account than he or she needs, another sibling can use some of that money to help pay down their student loans. This bill would allow younger taxpayers to take out some of their own money in their retirement account without penalty when they have a new baby or have an opportunity to adopt a child. This way, younger Americans will feel secure in starting to save for their retirement, knowing that the money could still be there for them at one of the most expensive times in their lives. H.R. 6757 would also make it easier for small employers to pull together and offer retirement plans to their team, to the folks they work with, their associates. This would help bridge that divide between what benefits large employers might be able to offer to their employees but smaller employers may only wish to be able to do but really can’t. The bill also allows for older Americans to continue saving in their IRAs if they choose to continue working in their later years, and it allows them to keep their own money in their IRAs if those accounts are relatively modest. For those workers who want their savings accounts to be in conservative investments, such as annuities, this bill reduces the cost of doing that. Finally, this bill would also help our brave men and women in the Reserves put away more of their retirement by letting them contribute the maximum amount to their military retirement accounts while also contributing to a retirement account from the private sector. Mr. Speaker, let me tell you why we are really here today. We are really here today because of the overwhelming success of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. It has worked. It is incredible, the growth in our economy. The number one priority from the beginning of everything we did was about progrowth legislation that actually made it easier on hardworking American families. You know what, despite what you may hear and the rattle from the other side, it worked, and it is working every day. We can see it in every measurable event of what is happening in America. Thanks to tax reform, middleincome families in western Pennsylvania and across America are seeing bigger paychecks, more takehome money. How 
odd that we allow them to keep more of their own money. That is just who we are as Americans. Democrats have chosen to distort this success. Republicans are choosing to secure the success by making the tax cuts for middleincome families permanent. We keep hearing: Yeah, yeah, but you are not really taking care of them. The idea that we use identity politics every day in every way in this House is absolutely deplorable. Tax reform 2.0 is all about that. The truth of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is its success. The saddest part of it all is not one of our Democratic colleagues voted for it. For that, they will continue to distort the future and use identity politics. Mr. Speaker, I think we have other people who want to talk on this, but for now, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 5 minutes. Mr. Speaker, America does, in fact, face a retirement crisis. Nearly half of Americans approaching retirement years have absolutely no retirement savings. There is not much gold in their golden years. Four out of 10 Americans in a recent survey indicated that they are living paycheck to paycheck. They are barely making ends meet. They had little or nothing available in reserve. When they were asked if they could meet a sudden, unexpected $400 medical emergency, 4 out of 10 Americans said they could not even do that. b1445 Those are the individuals who certainly do not have the resources to save enough to set up a standard of living in retirement comparable to what they had before retiring. So, as usual, our Republican colleagues are masters at naming bills. It is just what they put in the bills that is a problem. Now, this bill is a good example. This is the Family Savings Act, but whose family gets the savings? Well, if you are out there listening, probably not your family. For families that have little or nothing in savings, this bill does nothing. Much like the bloated Republican tax scam and its sorry sequel that AARP condemned this very day, this Republican bill is all about helping those at the top and doing little or nothing for those who are struggling to have a golden year in retirement. There are, in fact, some modest measures that they have got tucked in this bill that I support and that AARP supports. And I agree with AARP that we should encourage more small employers to offer retirement plans. I am all for the little good parts in the bill. It is just the giant omissions that I oppose. The first of those omissions is the almost half of Americans that they forgot about, that they left out of this bill. As usual, the second big problem is they haven’t got the slightest care about how this bill is paid for. They are going to go out and borrow more money from the Saudis and the Chinese and anybody else we can beg for to pay for the debt in order to pay for this. They don’t pay for a penny of it. That is consistent with their approach, the proud success of this past year, adding trillions of dollars to the public debt because they don’t care about it anymore. All their budget deficit hawks, they flew south for the winter, and they stayed there. The people who can’t save at the moment for retirement, they are the folks who rely on one of the most important programs and set of programs that this Congress ever approved, and that is, of course, Social Security and Medicare— over Republican objection. Now everybody seems to be for those programs, but they are jeopardized when you add trillions of additional dollars to our debt, and that is what this bill contributes to. It adds $21 billion in debt. Nearly half of its cost is for what they call ‘‘universal savings accounts.’’ They should be better known as universal tax shelters. And they will do little to increase retirement savings. Rather, they will be universally exploited by people who are already saving to get a little bit more tax benefit. Over the next five years, existing tax incentives—before this bill is ever approved, those that are already in the law—for retirement savings will cost us over $1 trillion. One study found that twothirds of the benefits of this $1 trillion of tax expenditures goes to the top 20 percent of Americans. I don’t begrudge any of them. One of them is me. One of them is every Member of this Congress. I think we need to encourage Members of Congress and all Americans to save more. I expect that those of us who are using these taxadvantaged accounts now don’t need a great deal of additional incentive to use them to the maximum. What we do need is to help those Americans who couldn’t afford that $400 emergency or who have nothing in retirement savings except their Social Security check. It is not that they don’t want to save. It is that, if you can’t pay $400 for a doctor bill you didn’t expect, you are not going to have very much saved when it comes time to retire. Now, surely this Congress can do more for these families. I must say, I don’t really mean this Congress. I mean the one that is coming in January that cares about the retirement crisis we have now, not the one that has shown indifference to half of Americans. What we get today, instead, is just another tax incentive for shifting retirement savings around. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself an additional 2 minutes. Mr. Speaker, to take full advantage of this bill, you need to have about $100,000 in income. If you even look at this bill, as the Joint Committee on Taxation has done, you will see that two out of three Americans are not expected to use it at all because it doesn’t help them. And what about the onethird who will use it? They are the people, like me, like the other Members of Congress, who earn, on average, twice the median income in this country. So it does help those of us who have been successful, those at the very top who are the wealthiest. It doesn’t help the rest of America. For those with the resources, the Joint Committee on Taxation looked at the huge price tag on this bill, and they said that what we are basically looking at, and I quote it, is it ‘‘derives from taxpayers shifting savings that are allocated to other types of taxable accounts into a universal savings account’’, so just moving the money around. And we now have a study that really shows what a great job these guys have done with reference to this concept. It is a study that shows, for every dollar of additional debt you get—a little bit of a similar program that was studied— you get 1 penny of additional savings. That is the bargain they are offering us today, really. Spend a dollar, borrow a dollar from the Chinese, and you will generate 1 cent of additional savings. So under this socalled universal tax shelter, the earning returns from their investment portfolio allow them to avoid some capital gains tax, cost the Treasury, but the Republican universe just doesn’t include many ordinary Americans. It is those who don’t have retirement savings in taxadvantaged accounts, who rely on Medicare and Social Security, we need to protect that basic framework for retirement for, and you don’t protect it by borrowing ourselves into further debt. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I remind my friends on the other side that a rising tide lifts all boats. There happens to be 6.9 million jobs now looking for somebody to fill them. And when we talk about going into retirement, could we please stop trying to divide, divide, divide America? Could we please start being the United States of America instead of the divided States of America? Every single American benefits from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. That is the fact. I am sorry you didn’t sign on for it. We are going to give you a second chance today to show your true colors, which needs to red, white, and blue, not just blue. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. RENACCI ). 
Mr. RENACCI. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my good friend Representative MIKEKELLY ’s H.R. 6757, the Family Savings Act. Mr. KELLY and I have been champions of helping more Americans gain access to retirement savings since coming to Congress in 2011, and I am proud of the bill before us today. Included in this legislation is the bipartisan Retirement Security for American Workers Act that I introduced along with my friends Representatives BUCHANAN , NEAL, and K INDfor the past two Congresses. Unfortunately, there are still too many Americans who do not have access to a retirement savings plan through their employer. In fact, nearly a third of the privatesector workforce lacks access to an employersponsored plan, with even less Americans having access if they work for a small business. Not having access to an employer sponsored plan significantly increases the chances that an individual fails to put aside money for retirement. For many Americans, this means that they are vastly unprepared to retire comfortably. From an employer’s perspective, not being able to offer a retirement plan makes it much more difficult to recruit and retain employees. I heard from CBIZ, a financial services and business consulting company headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio, that too often small businesses want to provide retirement plans to their employees but that the cost and administrative burden are significant roadblocks when making this decision. That is why it is important that Congress act to remove some of the red tape under current law that makes it difficult for business owners to provide retirement savings. The Retirement Security for American Workers Act that is included in this bill before us today will help do just that. This provision will allow two or more companies that may be in the same industry to join together in order to offer either a defined contribution retirement plan or an IRA, often referred to as open multiple employer plans. Under current law and Department of Labor interpretation, employers who do not have a nexus are not able to ban together and provide a pooled retirement plan. By eliminating this Department of Labor requirement, this bill will allow more companies to provide retirement plans by allowing businesses—especially small businesses—to take advantage of cost and administrative efficiencies that often prevent businesses from offering a 401(k). Additionally, the open MEP’s language in the bill will provide relief from the one bad apple rule that punishes all employees in a pooled retirement plan if just one employer fails to meet requirements. This legislation will incentivize more businesses to join together and provide retirement plans to their employees. These commonsense proposals, along with the other provisions within the Family Savings Act, will unlock the opportunity for more persons to save for their future. I thank my friend, Mr. KELLY , for his leadership in bringing this legislation to the floor today. I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation. Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds. Mr. Speaker, before yielding to Mr. DAVIS, let me say this is not about lifting all boats; It is about lifting all yachts. And the 40, 50 percent of Americans who have only a leaky rowboat going into retirement don’t get a dime out of this bill. As to the tax bill as a whole, Republicans came out and bragged, the President put it in writing: You will get $4,000 in additional income trickling down to you every year from this corporate tax cut. Now we know that only 4.4 percent of Americans have gotten a dime of additional compensation as a result of this tax bill. If you have got anyone in Ohio, in Pennsylvania, or in Texas who got their $4,000, I hope you will call us, because I am looking for the first person. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS), a distinguished member of our committee. Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague. Mr. Speaker, only 39 percent of Americans have enough savings to cover an emergency costing $1,000. The median savings of workers earning the median income of $54,000 in my congressional district is only around $2,000. The median savings of women is $2,000. The median savings of African Americans is $1,000, and of Latinos, it is $1,500. Yet this bill bestows tremendous tax benefits on the wealthy who can stockpile tens of thousands of dollars in multiple savings accounts, leaving the working class out in the cold. When hard work in one or two jobs isn’t enough for most Americans to escape poverty because wages have stagnated for decades and because recovery from the Great Recession is concentrated in the small percentage of Americans who invest in the stock market, when we know that low and moderateincome families have a harder time saving for college because they have less extra cash available to put away in a savings account, the Republican solution embraces the privileged and fails the working families. What is absent from this bill is telling. The 529 plan does not cover childcare for apprentices, one of the number one costs they face with training. This bill throws crumbs to apprentices by allowing 529 plans to cover minor training expenses like books and supplies. Given that employers pay for the coursework of apprentices, the remaining education costs are relatively small. That is why apprentice advocates asked for and why the original bill included coverage for childcare, yet childcare is not covered in this bill. What also is absent is the Jenkins Kind provision to help middleclass families save for college by allowing employers to match up to $600 a year in 529 contributions, which could help families who can’t afford to put much aside for college or increase their savings. I cannot understand how, when our citizens are struggling under crushing student loan debt, the Republican solution is to allow the elite, with impressive 529 plans, to pay off their student debt while leaving the working class out in the cold. Absent is a true investment in helping working and middleclass families pay for college. Rather than helping working families, this Republican bill additionally, ideologically attacks the reproductive freedom of women by unnecessarily defining unborn children as beneficiaries of 529s. I agree that we should help families cover the cost of needed health services to help students learn, such as speech and language services, occupational therapy, or physical therapy. b1500 Yet, rather than requiring that insurance companies cover these health services that help students learn, the Republican solution is to allow the privileged, with thousands of dollars in savings, to pay for these costs, while working and middleclass families must forego the services for lack of funds. When 67 percent of Americans say that they will outlive their retirement savings, the Republican solution to helping families pay for expenses associated with a new child or adoption is to undermine these families’ retirement security. The Republican tax approach gives corporations and millionaires tens of thousands of dollars directly, but working Americans must take money from their retirement. Government should strengthen the economic security of working and middleclass Americans whose wages have stagnated, not the very wealthiest. This bill fails that charge. Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. WENSTRUP ). Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, I stand here today in support of Mr. KELLY ’s bill. Our colleague across the aisle just gave us some very sad statistics that so many of our fellow Americans have when it comes to savings in their lives, so I am surprised that they would want to keep things the same. You see, tax reform has brought opportunity and hope and a positive energy to America. Our national economy is booming. Wages are on the rise. Americans are taking home bigger paychecks, and businesses are investing more in their employees. But how can we help families invest in their future, invest for their retirement? 
The opportunity is now. With wages up, now is the time. Today, 40 percent of Americans say they cannot cover an unexpected expense of $400. Many Americans are unprepared for upcoming retirements, awaiting a Social Security check that may be smaller than they ever expected. Others may be unprepared for a medical emergency. Sadly, 32 years ago, when I started my business, almost $200,000 in debt, I was advised to pay off my student loans, pay off my debt and, as I looked down the road, don’t count on Social Security to even be there. We need to use the economic success that we are seeing today to alleviate the widespread savings crisis in American communities and in American families. The Family Savings Act of 2018, on the floor today as part of Tax Reform 2.0, is one opportunity to do just that. Millions of Americans would gain access to new savings vehicles: Universal Savings Accounts offering withdrawals at any time, in any amount, for any purpose; joint small business 401(k) plans; expanded 529 education accounts to pay for apprenticeships, homeschooling, or student loan debt. This is an opportunity to break down the barriers that limit businesses’ ability to offer retirement plans and individuals’ ability to save is enhanced. By eliminating the maximum age limit for IRA contributions and exempting individuals with small retirement accounts from making mandatory distributions, this legislation encourages workers to save and enables them to do so. These reforms offer flexibility for families to save, when able, and spend, when needed; and they offer options for employers—to help local businesses provide retirement plans for their employees. Let’s help our fellow Americans be on the path to financial security, especially during our later years. Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. KIND), who has been a leader on retirement issues and was one of the sponsors of the original form of this bill, which has changed a good bit, and on other retirement legislation. Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Texas for yielding me this time. I am an original sponsor of the original bill, which became the basis of this bill, the Retirement Enhancement Security Act. Unfortunately, today this bill is not that bill. A lot has changed, a lot was taken out, and a lot was removed from it because the process is broken. We didn’t have hearings. We didn’t have consultation. We didn’t have the back andforth that is needed to build bipartisan support for an important measure such as this. We do have a retirement savings in this country. We can be doing more to make it easier for individuals and small businesses to offer retirement savings plans for their employees. I have been proud to work with my friend from Pennsylvania, Mr. KELLY , on legislation to try to correct it. Part of the original bill, the RESA bill, it has been called, was based on legislation that I have offered for years with my friend and colleague from Washington State, Mr. REICHERT , another Member of the committee. In fact, the original RESA bill, when it was up before the Senate Finance Committee, passed 26–0. That is how controversial it was. But unfortunately, again, this bill does not reflect what was done there. An important provision that would have provided PBGC premium pension relief from rural electric coops, from nonprofits, like the Boys and Girls Club of America, or the Jewish Federation of North America, the Christian Schools International, was mysteriously stripped from this legislation with very little explanation. That is a problem that we could easily fix right now, as just one example. Another problem we have is that the payfor that was recognized and identified in a bipartisan manner, the so called stretch IRAs that we could be shutting down to help pay for this legislation, was also stripped. Now, I get the fact that fiscal responsibility is out the door with the majority party. They don’t believe in paying for things. But when we come up with a bipartisan payfor, after vetting it and getting feedback from the various stakeholders, and they still can’t accept it, that tells me that, not only don’t they care about fiscal responsibility but they are hostile to fiscal responsibility. This is one of three bills now that the Ways and Means Committee is bringing to the floor, with no opportunity for amendments or other Members to contribute to help form this legislation. They are here before us in what is called a closed rule; no amendment opportunity, and none of the bills will be paid for which, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, will, when these three bills are implemented, cost our Nation over $3 trillion in new debt; $3 trillion. And this comes on the heels of the tax cut 1.0 that passed late last year which, again, wasn’t paid for, which will add $2.3 trillion to other national debt. Now, I don’t know about you, but you give me the opportunity to write $5 trillion worth of hot checks, and I will give you the illusion of wealth and growth in this country. But there is a day of reckoning that will come from all this because this is happening at the wrong time. When we have got growth, we have got virtually full employment, and you guys can’t throw enough fiscal stimulus at this economy. You are taking our fiscal tools away from us. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. DOGGETT. I yield an additional 2 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin. Mr. KIND. You are taking all the fiscal tools away from us, so when there is another recession, and there will be, unless somehow we repeal the economic cycle in this country, the Federal Reserve will be the only institution standing that can actually take corrective action, probably with extraordinary measures, which we all hated in 2008 and 2009. But this bill, and the three bills this week that are before us are here for three reasons and three reasons only: Because of the election calendar, with the midterms coming up in early November, and vulnerable Members’ names being attached to these bills, so that they can do their ads and they can do their press releases back home, knowing that it is not going to go anywhere in the Senate. Then finally, we are here this week because tax cut 1.0 went over like a wet blanket with the American people because they know what that was about; where 83 percent of that tax cut is going to large corporations and the wealthiest 1 percent of our Nation. The American people get that. And what did these corporations do with their huge tax windfall? They are doing exactly what they said they would do, share buybacks, dividend distribution, executive compensation salaries. They are all buying private jets because of the additional money that they have for their executives right now. Very little has gone into increased wages or salary increases, and this is what corporate America said they would do, so no one should be surprised by that. So I say, let’s slow down here. Let’s think about the fiscal future of our country, more importantly, the fiscal future of our children and grandchildren because right now we have 10,000 baby boomers retiring every day. When these three bills are fully implemented, all 70 million baby boomers will be completely vested in the retirement system, drawing on Social Security and Medicare. And we have set those programs up for failure with these reckless tax cuts that aren’t paid for and are going to leave a legacy of debt, which will invariably lead to huge cuts to Social Security and Medicare, because, guess what? We don’t have money anymore to support those programs. That is what is going on around here right now. But we still have time to correct it because the Senate is not going to take it up. Let’s vote ‘‘no’’. Let’s do this the right way. Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I share my colleague’s concerns over the debt. In fact, I started to really become alarmed with it under the Obama administration when we went from being $10.6 trillion in debt to nearly $20 trillion in debt. I just wonder, where were you when this was going on? And why was there not any alarm sounding then? But again, it is just politics masquerading as fiscal discipline. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. ESTES), a good friend of mine. Mr. ESTES of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6757, the Family Savings Act. Since the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was implemented and signed into law, our country has seen historic economic growth and millions of families now have more money in their pockets. In fact, in Kansas, a middleclass family of four will get to keep $2,144 of their hardearned money of this year. Thanks to the law, families from the heartland in Kansas and around the country are better off now. But we know there is more to do. With historically low unemployment and more and more Americans going to work, now is the time to continue growing our economy and to help families prepare for the future. As my colleagues have mentioned earlier, far too many Americans have struggled to save for their key life events such as retirement, an emergency, or education. This bill makes savings a reality for these Americans. As part of the tax cuts reform 2.0, this Family Savings Act will help families save for all of these events by expanding access to new and existing savings methods. To help businesses provide retirement plans for workers, the bill allows small businesses to join together to create 401(k) plans more affordably. It gives employers more time to put new retirement plans in place, and simplifies the rules for participation in employer plans. It also includes reforms to help workers participate in retirement plans such as: exempting small retirement accounts from mandatory payouts; eliminating the age limits on IRA contributions; and allowing military reservists to maximize their retirement contributions. In addition, the bill allows provisions that help families start saving earlier and save more throughout their lives, including creating a new Universal Savings Account, a USA account, to offer a flexible savings tool that families can use any time that is right for them. It expands 529 education accounts by providing families with flexibility to use their education savings to pay for apprenticeships, homeschooling, and help pay off student loans. As the former Kansas State Treasurer, I can attest to the value of helping parents save for their children’s education. And it creates new baby savings, allowing families to access their retirement accounts on a penaltyfree basis when welcoming a new child into the family, whether by birth or adoption. All together, these measures will help families in Kansas and around our country prepare for retirement and save for education. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. JUDY CHU), a valued member of our committee. Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 6757, the Family Savings Act. It is outrageous that, after our markup, a provision was snuck into the bill, behind closed doors, through a manager’s amendment that seeks to further an extreme antichoice agenda and has no place in this tax bill. Chairman BRADY ’s manager’s amendment, offered behind closed doors in the Rules Committee, has added language that would allow parents to open 529 college savings accounts for unborn children. The term ‘‘unborn children’’ is defined as a child ‘‘in utero’’ at any stage of development carried in the womb. This provision is completely unnecessary because, under current law, parents are already able to open 529 savings plans for future children in their own name, and then change the name of the beneficiary after the birth of their child. The implications of this insertion, however, is serious. In the landmark Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade, the Court declared that ‘‘the word person, as used in the 14th Amendment, does not include the unborn.’’ So let me say, there is no ambiguity here. This is a thinlyveiled attempt to circumvent the Supreme Court’s decision by inserting the words ‘‘unborn child’’ in, of all places, the Tax Code, so that codifies in law a legal concept of the unborn child, therefore, establishing the fetus is protected separately from the mother. b1515 This is the same language that anti choice advocates tried to insert into the GOP tax scam bill 1.0, but where the language was ultimately stripped out. At that time, a spokesperson for the antichoice March for Life group stated that H.R. 1, the GOP tax scam bill, ‘‘. . . we hope that this is the first step in expanding the child tax credit to include unborn children as well.’’ This language is, therefore, obviously, an attempt to lay the legal groundwork to undermine a woman’s constitutional right to an abortion, plain and simple. Based on this language alone, women’s groups NARAL and Planned Parenthood are opposing this bill. This is nothing more than a political gimmick conducted in secret in order to score political points for Republicans trying to placate their extreme base. Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to reject this bill and vote ‘‘no’’. Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BRADY ), chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, the hero of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Promoting Family Savings Act of 2018, and thank Congressman KELLY for leading this important bill that helps families save earlier and save more throughout their life, something each party should be in support of. Far too many have struggled to save for key life events such as for retirement, for education, or for unexpected emergencies. In fact, I know, back home, almost 40 percent of Americans say they wouldn’t even be able to carry and cover a $400 emergency expense. The Promoting Family Savings Act will help more middleclass Americans and younger workers save for key life events by expanding access to new and existing savings vehicles. For example, the bill includes expanded education savings accounts, 529 accounts, as we use in our family, to give families the flexibility to use their education savings to pay for apprenticeship fees for those trade schools; to cover the costs of homeschooling; and to help pay off, for the first time, student debt with their own savings. It also includes new universal savings accounts, called USAs, which offer fully flexible savings tools that families can use any time for what is right for them. We think this is very important to millennials in entering the savings culture. This bill will also help families by allowing them to access their own retirement accounts on a penaltyfree basis to use when welcoming a new child in the family, whether by birth or adoption, allowing them to replenish those retirement accounts in the future. It seems to me that we have heard two complaints today. One is that this small provision adds to the debt. But I ask you: Where were the Democrats when they and President Obama doubled America’s national debt? They added $2 trillion to the debt in 1 year, but that was adding debt when they were spending your money. But now under tax reform, when we allow families and small businesses to keep more of what they earn, all of a sudden, they are concerned about the national debt. They are really not worried about tax cuts for the wealthy. They are worried about tax cuts for middleclass Americans, because if your earnings and your dreams come first, Democrats’ dreams and Washington’s dreams come second. So this is a small investment to help families, small businesses, and younger workers save. But it does more than that. The gentlewoman from California is confused. This bill is extremely family friendly, and one of the ways we do it is the education savings accounts, which we use for our two boys, is expanded. This amendment simply makes clear that families can set up a 529 account and designate an unborn child as a beneficiary. So the moment you know ‘‘we are pregnant,’’ you can begin saving. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. BYRNE ). The time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, you would think it would be a bipartisan thing to start saving early. We think starting to save early is a good thing. This amendment simplifies it for families. Right now, when you learn those magic words, ‘‘We are pregnant,’’ and you want to begin saving, we actually force families to set up an account for someone else and then later they transfer it to the child after birth. All this does is eliminate that extra step, reduces the paperwork, and makes savings for family and that new addition, whether it is by birth or by adoption, in our case, it makes it easier to do. The savings bill by Mr. KELLY for the first time allows families who welcome that new child to access their retirement if there are extra medical costs, or if your child has special needs and needs new equipment, or if you want to simply stay home sometime with your family. Maybe the business you work for can’t afford to pay you. For the first time, millions of American families will have a Tax Code that works for their young family, not against them. Mr. Speaker, you would think that would be supported by both parties. I urge Members of Congress to set aside this silly partisanship and join together to help families save more. Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to engage in a colloquy with the chairman. Mr. Speaker, one topic that has been discussed in the context of the savings and retirement bill is the level of premiums paid to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the PBGC, by rural electric coops and by charitable organizations. I know the Ways and Means Committee included a study that was intended to provide information relevant to the proper level of PBGC premiums. That study was removed by the manager’s amendment. Could the chairman provide some insights about how this issue will be resolved as we move forward? Mr. BRADY of Texas. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. I yield to the gentleman from Texas. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I will be glad to provide my perspective. The gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. KELLY ) is correct. The study was removed. The question of PBGC premium levels is not directly within the jurisdiction of the Ways and Means Committee. Here, in the House, the committee of jurisdiction is the Education and the Workforce Committee. I have had numerous discussions with the excellent chairwoman of the committee, Dr. FOXX of North Carolina. She knows our interest in determining the proper premium levels for these organizations. Premiums, as you know, that are too low threaten the ability of the PBGC to provide protections for the workers and beneficiaries. At the same time, if premiums are set too high, they really impose an inappropriate burden on pension plans and the workers who participate in them. This issue will come up again as we negotiate a final agreement with the Senate on the overall retirement and savings package, because many Senators, too, are also interested in finding the right level of premiums. So I would say to the gentleman that I have full confidence that Chairwoman FOXX and her colleagues as the committee of jurisdiction will be engaged in working on the overall retirement security agreement and will work to provide appropriate input in determining the right outcome. Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman, as always, for his insights and his clarity, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, so I will close at this time and initially yield myself 5 minutes. Mr. Speaker, the Republican tax bill has given us trillions of dollars of additional debt, and so, tomorrow, they propose to freeze in some additional provisions that will add hundreds of billions of additional debt to what they have already incurred. They would depart for the elections, carefully timed with tomorrow’s debate, so that the last thing the voter hears is that the Republicans have passed another tax bill. Of course, none of its provisions will affect any American for 7 years. That is what they have to offer us: freeze in some inefficient provisions that are not really targeted to ordinary American families that have a special provision in there specifically for Donald Trump and other real estate magnates, a provision they hid and tucked in the conference committee and then put in the final law, one special interest provision after another. They want to freeze all of that in and offer the American people the mirage of relief in 7 years. This bill that they signed into law as their big tax deal will cost this generation and future generations a huge amount of money just paying the interest on the debt that they have achieved, and having done nothing in this Congress to advance retirement security, having done nothing in this Congress to encourage more savings by more Americans. They come here on the eve of our departure for the elections with this big family savings account bill. It also proposes to borrow more. It has a great new universal savings account in it. The only problem is that twothirds of Americans won’t take advantage of this universal savings account because it offers them no advantage whatsoever. As usual, those Americans have been excluded from the Republican version of what the universe of Americans really is. The cost of doing this is not only in terms of new debt, but a very inefficient approach where you pay, as indicated by the study of a similar program, you have $1 lost, $1 cost in this borrowing, and you get 1 penny of additional real savings. Now, I am amused a little bit to hear my colleagues come and agree with me about the challenge that American families face of not having $400 to meet an emergency medical expense. How in the world are any of those Americans going to benefit in the slightest from this proposal? It advantages people who have $100,000 or more with the universal savings account. They are not in that category. If they can’t afford a $400 medical expense, exactly how much savings do you expect them to have under this bill? A big zero is what we are talking about. It is a big zero in large measure because, despite this great tax bill they approved, real wages in America have remained stagnant during the Trump administration. He has not been able to raise real wages because he continues to engage in supporting programs, just like the one before us today, that are aimed at those at the top and think somehow the benefits will trickle down to everyone else. It is those people who will not benefit from today’s legislation, who are excluded from the great universe that Republicans see. It is those people who rely on Social Security and Medicare, which Republicans have proposed changes in, in their budget proposals, have discussed a variety of ways to trim them, that we can’t afford them in their current form. Well, what, precisely, have Republicans accomplished about Medicare in this Congress? Well, they have a rather significant accomplishment that I have to note. As a result of their tax bill, they have reduced the solvency of the Medicare trust fund by 3 years, 3 years taken right off the Medicare trust fund’s future as a result of their tax bill—by a variety of independent sources that have evaluated the impact. Meanwhile, they are using that tax bill and the debt they have accumulated with reference to the amount of money that we have for Pell grants and other student financial assistance, for Medicaid and the role that it plays, and for other vital services saying: We just can’t afford them because we borrowed these trillions of dollars from abroad, and we don’t have the resources to meet our other needs. With every tax policy that they propose, Republicans seem to insist on leaving working families behind. And they have the gall then to turn around and tell those same working families: You have to pay for it in interest, in cuts to Medicare and Medicaid, and other services. 
Now, there is another really important point about this, which Mr. KIND addressed, because just like the bill we will take up tomorrow, just like the bill we are taking up right now, just like this huge Republican tax sham, there is much in common. The number one thing in common is that not one official in any of the departments in the Trump administration had the guts to come over and face our committee and answer questions about it. They did not bring a single Trump administration official to discuss, explain, justify, how any of this conforms with all his ridiculous campaign promises. There was none of that on any of these bills. They kept their bills in secret until the last minute after having no public hearings, inviting no businesses, no academic experts from around the country. They plopped these bills out and rushed them through just as quickly as possible, so there will be as little consideration as possible. Then they talk about the desire for bipartisan comity after doing this kind of thing. Well, there are many bipartisan ideas out there that could have been considered. Mr. KIND’s proposal is designed to help poor people, working people save for college or retirement, and give them some incentive for that. That is an idea that could have been considered. b1530 Mr. NEAL, the ranking member of our committee, has advanced some other important ideas concerning savings to expand the savers credit that would help many of these working families get the savings that they need to prepare for their golden years. Mr. LARSON , another member of our committee, has worked on cutting taxes for many people under Social Security with modest incomes and seeing that those who have been more successful pay the same rate on all their income that those who are not at the top of the economic ladder pay on theirs. He has a plan to ensure that Social Security will be solvent through the end of this century. Those are the kind of creative proposals that we have advanced, but we can’t get a hearing on them. We can’t get an opportunity under today’s bills or any of these others to offer an amendment to add them. The only way we are going to have an opportunity to address those creative proposals and do something for a universe that we define as including all Americans, not just those perched up comfortably on the top of the economic ladder, the only way we will do that is with a new Congress of caring, concerned people who are willing to listen, regardless of whether they agree to divergent views, and try to come up with a truly American answer to resolve this retirement security problem. I believe that those Americans who are working out there today, trying to make ends meet, who won’t benefit from this bill are worried about the tax breaks that have gone to those up at the top, how they will threaten all that they have worked and paid for in their future, and the callous indifference it shows to their children and their grandchildren, who will be saddled with this Republican debt for decades. The late Texas Senator Ralph Yarborough, a distinguished servant of our State, talked about putting the jam on the lower shelf so that everybody could reach it. Well, this bill puts the jam at the top for the onethird of Americans up there at the top who might use some portion of this bill, but it leaves out the twothirds who can’t reach quite that high. This bill is not what America needs to achieve retirement savings. In so many ways, Republicans are ignoring the needs of working families. They are ignoring prescription price gouging, doing nothing about it, and they are ignoring our healthcare needs. In fact, their tax bill actually weakens, significantly, access to healthcare and jeopardizes Americans with higher premiums as a result of a healthcare provision that they snuck into their tax bill. They show no concern for a living wage for Americans. This bill is just part of that same narrowmindedness and that same refusal to look at a universe that applies to all Americans. They are leaving families that are struggling to make ends meet behind. They are certainly not letting them reach the jam that they deserve to be able to access, as Senator Yarborough talked about. Let’s reject this bill and look forward to a day, a very hopeful day, for Americans in which all Americans can have their say and we can get a Congress that will resist the injustices of the Trump administration and will reach out to support a better future for our country. Mr. Speaker, I urge rejection of this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I include in the RECORD a letter from AARP in strong support of H.R. 6757. 
AARP®, September 27, 2018. Hon. PAULD. R YAN, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. NANCY PELOSI , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR SPEAKER RYAN AND LEADER PELOSI : AARP writes to support H.R. 6757, the Family Savings Act of 2018 that will promote a more secure retirement. AARP, with its nearly 38 million members in all 50 States, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories, is a nonpartisan, nonprofit, nationwide organization that helps empower people to choose how they live as they age, strengthens communities, and fights for the issues that matter most to families, such as healthcare, employment and income security, retirement planning, affordable utilities and protection from financial abuse. Notably, the Family Savings Act seeks to encourage more employers, especially small employers, to provide retirement savings opportunities for American families, a goal AARP shares. Small employers have lagged in offering retirement plans to their employees. The U.S. private employerbased retirement system, which supplements Social Security, has not significantly expanded coverage for decades. Only half of all employers, primarily large employers, offer retirement plans to their workers, and only half of all employees are saving for retirement. In recent years, new industry practices and technology have made the savings process simpler. AARP encourages Congress to adopt tested ideas to make supplemental savings easy and affordable for both employers and employees. The Family Savings Act includes a promising retirement savings initiative, known as a multiple employer or pooled provider plan—a single plan operated by a group provider who will act as a fiduciary, making it easier for small employers to offer a plan and providing workers with prudently selected retirement investments. AARP is hopeful that qualified firms will be willing to create pooled arrangements that enroll and assist interested employers and employees. Small employers are not retirement experts and need an impartial advisor to take responsibility for automatic payroll contributions and negotiating with and monitoring investment firms. In addition, the bill contains several other helpful retirement savings improvements for the military, graduate students and older investors. We also are pleased that the bill preserves ready access to paper documentation of important retirement plan documents. We appreciate your efforts to encourage improvements in our retirement system, and look forward to working with Committee members on further bill refinements and enhancements as the bill moves forward to conference. If you have any questions or need additional information, please feel free to contact me. Sincerely, NANCY A. L EAMOND, Executive Vice President and Chief Advocacy and Engagement Officer. 
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, it is interesting to be here in the people’s House on the floor hearing two differing views of America. I really appreciate about putting the jam on the lower shelf. We have actually put it on the table with the lid off so that every single American has benefited. I know that sometimes we look at things, and people are entitled to their own opinion, but what they are not entitled to are their own facts. The fact is that, under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, every single American has benefited. This is not just about Democrats and Republicans; this is about Americans. I am hoping that Americans are watching what is going on here right now, where the game plan is always: If we can divide them, we can win. If we don’t have any facts, let’s just come up with anything and throw it out there and think that maybe the way we use the Gruber effect in the healthcare plan, we are going to rely on Americans not to really look beyond what is going on. Well, I will tell you what. In every segment of our society right now, we are seeing the lowest unemployment in 
history. It doesn’t matter if these are hyphenated Americans—I don’t know why we have to be this way, because I look at people as being red, white, and blue Americans, not White, not Black, not tan, not yellow. I am talking about red, white, and blue Americans, the same people who provide every single penny to run this marvelous government of ours. And now what we are proposing today is to allow these same hardworking people the opportunity not to have to rely on a government program, but to be able to rely on their own hardearned savings. What an incredible, unusual idea to come out of this House. Look, we know that it is absolutely crucial that, as more and more Americans enter their golden years, they have the security and peace of mind to enjoy those years and not have to worry about whether they have saved enough money. We should be doing everything we can to help them save more of their hardearned money—it is their own money, by the way—for themselves and for their families. H.R. 6757 does that by giving every single American the tools that he or she needs to help them save for their future and to save for their retirement. I have heard today the tax sham. I have heard today about growing deficits. I have heard today about the rich, the elite, the people who have private boats, and the people who have jets. But what I haven’t heard today is how this incredible piece of legislation, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, has increased and how our economy has taken off. Now, you can say anything you want, and I understand why you are upset. Not one of you could vote for this. So if you couldn’t vote for it and you couldn’t be part of the team that won, what you have to be now is the team that says: Do you know what? We could have done it better. My question is: Where the heck were you in the previous administration? Where were you in all those years when the debt grew from $10 trillion to $20 trillion? Now, all of a sudden, the light comes on: Oh, my God, the debt is increasing. It is these doggone Republicans. Do you know what they are trying to do? They want hardworking American taxpayers to be able to keep more of their own money. That is just not the way Washington works. I thank God every day that I didn’t start off as a local politician, then move into a county position, then move into a State position, and then wander into D.C. using that same philosophy that we are going to put this on the backs of our taxpayers. We never tell these people that the hand they feel in their back pocket is the government taking their wallet out. Then we decry this fact that: Oh, my goodness, how could we ignore the debt? Thanks for waking up. Where were you when it was $10 trillion? Why did you let it get to $20 trillion before the bells went off? Look, there is so much in this bill that just makes sense. This bill was not crafted for Democrats. It wasn’t crafted for Republicans. It was crafted for Americans, hardworking Americans, who put all their life into a job, who look forward to retirement. We are giving them that opportunity not to rely on some government program that may or may not be there when they reach retirement. We are telling them: Do you know what? You get to keep more of your own money now. You get to put it away in a lot of pretax opportunities. You get to know that you can draw down on some of that money without being heavily taxed for needing it. And while we decry all these inequities, and when we continue to divide Americans and say, ‘‘It is always about the rich; it is always about the elite; it is all about those who have more than you do,’’ that is not what it is about. It is about helping every American get to retirement. Good Lord, how did we get to this position? How did we get to this point in America’s history that we will pick and choose and we will decry anybody who has been successful and always label them as the rich, the elite, these horrible, horrible people who have done so much with their life. They just don’t deserve that. Well, do you know what? This is America. There are more stories in this country and throughout our history of people who started with absolutely nothing but an opportunity, an equal opportunity, not guaranteed an equal outcome, but guaranteed an equal opportunity. What we are doing today is guaranteeing for every hardworking American out there that they can put more of their own hardearned money into a retirement plan that serves them. Now, every time we come on this floor, I hear this: divide, divide, divide. We can’t possibly be the America that 1.4 million of our fellow citizens died to protect. No, no, no. This is not about America’s future. This is about midterm elections. We are more worried about getting reelected than changing the direction of this country. I would ask my colleagues on the other side, look, I know you are sorry you didn’t vote for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. That is why you throw it down all the time and say this is horrible. What did happen is that we are giving you another chance to hop on this train. I have only been here 8 years, but I will tell you what. I have heard enough in 8 years, coming from the private sector where you have to make it on your own every single day. You have to make payroll. You have to put food on the table and a roof over the heads of your children. I don’t want a government program that does that for me. I want a government program that allows me to save my own money, take less of my hard earned money and allow me to save for my wife, for my kids, for my grandchildren, and for my greatgrandchildren. That is what this is all about today, Mr. Speaker. It is plain and simple. One group thinks that the whole idea of government is to make each and every citizen rely on them and depend on them for their very existence. We are offering a chance for every single American—I don’t care where they are from, I don’t care the color of their skin, the shape of their eyes, or how they vote. What I do care about is that they can go into their retirement knowing that their hardearned money over the years is going to be accessible to them. That is what this is all about. I am hoping America is watching. I will go back to what I said in the beginning. I remember very clearly my mom and my dad sitting there and saying: The one thing we pray for is that we are never a burden for you and your brothers and your sisters. And I will repeat what I said today. I could not believe that the people who raised me, who fed me, who clothed me, who gave me a future, thought that somehow they would ever be a burden to me, my brothers, or my sisters. The one thing I know that they were sure of: They could save on their own, and they could get ready for their future and for their retirement years. That is all we are trying to do today. We are trying to make sure that every single hardworking American gets to keep more of his or her money for their own retirement without the government taking advantage of them. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, but I do still have the passion to bring this forward, and I have the passion and I have the belief that, if you can get beyond politics and talk about people, that you can come to a conclusion that this is a solid bill that helps our fellow Americans go into their retirement. I know that is in your heart. I know you can’t speak it sometimes because we are so polarized. Isn’t that a shame? But I will say this. Today we have the opportunity, and what you can show it on—there will be a big screen up there. It will have everybody’s name. And you can put a green ‘‘yes’’ on there, which says: I am voting for America’s future. I am voting for America’s retirees. I am voting to make people have peace of mind. Or you can put a red up there and say: Do you know what? I would have voted for it, but it wasn’t our bill. And if it is not my bill, if it is not my party’s bill, I can’t vote for that because there is an election coming up and we have got to polarize this. Mr. Speaker, I know I am out of time, but I am not out of breath, and I will tell you what, I am sure as hell not out of passion. I know what this country means for everybody, and we are making it possible for them every day in every way.

It is the sense of Congress that the President should— (1) support research and development on systems and materials that reduce— (A) derelict fishing gear; and (B) the amount of solid waste that is generated from landbased sources and the amount of such waste that enters the marine environment; (2) work with representatives of foreign countries that discharge the largest amounts of solid waste from landbased sources into the marine environment, to develop mechanisms to reduce such discharges; (3) carry out studies to determine— (A) the primary means of discharges referred to in paragraph (2); (B) the manner in which waste management infrastructure can be most effective in preventing such discharges; and (C) the longterm impacts of marine debris on the national economies of the countries with which work is undertaken under paragraph (2) and on the global economy, including the impacts of reducing the discharge of such debris; (4) work with representatives of the countries with which work is undertaken in paragraph (2) to conclude one or more new international agreements that include provisions— (A) to mitigate the discharge of landbased solid waste into the marine environment; and (B) to provide technical assistance and investment in waste management infrastructure to reduce such discharges, if the President determines such assistance or investment is appropriate; and (5) encourage the United States Trade Representative to consider the impact of discharges of landbased solid waste from the countries with which work is conducted under paragraph (2) in relevant future trade agreements. 
SEC. 103. SENSE OF CONGRESS SUPPORTING GREAT LAKES LANDBASED MARINE DEBRIS ACTION PLAN. 
It is the sense of Congress that the Great Lakes LandBased Marine Debris Action Plan (NOAA Technical Memorandum NOS– OR&R–49) is vital to the ongoing efforts to clean up the Great Lakes Region and getting rid of harmful debris, such as microplastics, abandoned vessels, and other forms of pollution that are threatening the survival of native marine animals and damaging the Great Lakes’ recreation and tourism economy. 
SEC. 104. MEMBERSHIP OF THE INTERAGENCY MARINE DEBRIS COORDINATING COMMITTEE.

‘‘(a) I NGENERAL .—There is authorized to be appropriated to the Administrator 
$10,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2018 through 2022 for carrying out sections 3, 5, and 6, of which not more than 5 percent is authorized for each fiscal year for administrative costs. ‘‘(b) AMOUNTS AUTHORIZED FOR COAST  GUARD .—Of the amounts authorized for each fiscal year under section 2702(1) of title 14, United States Code, up to $2,000,000 is authorized for the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating for use by the Commandant of the Coast Guard to carry out section 4 of this Act, of which not more than 5 percent is authorized for each fiscal year for administrative costs.’’. TITLE II—MARITIME SAFETY 
This title may be cited as the ‘‘Hamm Alert Maritime Safety Act of 2018’’. 
Congress finds the following: (1) On September 29, 2015, the SS El Faro cargo vessel left Jacksonville, Florida bound for San Juan, Puerto Rico, carrying 391 shipping containers, 294 trailers and cars, and a crew of 33 people, including 28 Americans. (2) On the morning of October 1, the El Faro sent its final communication reporting that the engines were disabled and the ship was listing, leaving the ship directly in the path of Hurricane Joaquin and resulting in the sinking of the vessel and the loss of all 33 lives. (3) The National Transportation Safety Board and the Coast Guard made recommendations to address safety issues, such as improving weather information and training, improving planning and response to severe weather, reviewing the Coast Guard’s program delegating vessel inspections to thirdparty organizations to assess the effectiveness of the program, and improving alerts and equipment on the vessels, among other recommendations. (4) Safety issues are not limited to the El Faro. For 2017, over 21,000 deficiencies were issued to United States commercial vessels and more than 2,500 U.S. vessels were issued ‘‘nosail’’ requirements. (5) The maritime industry, particularly the men and women of the United States merchant marine, play a vital and important role to the national security and economy of our country, and a strong safety regime is necessary to ensure the vitality of the industry and the protection of current and future mariners, and to honor lost mariners.

MOMENT OF SILENCE IN REMEMBRANCE OF CAPTAIN CONNOR BEDNARZYK (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, it is with profound sadness that I rise today with my colleagues to honor the life and the memory of Connor Bednarzyk, who tragically passed away on September 7 in an armored vehicle accident near Fort Benning, Georgia. Connor was 25 years old. Captain Bednarzyk grew up in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, where, even at a young age, he demonstrated superb leadership. A 2011 graduate of Central Bucks East High School, where he lettered in football, baseball, and wrestling, he went on to attend Penn State University on an ROTC scholarship. He graduated with a degree in security risk analysis, graduating in the top 10 percent of ROTC graduates in the entire United States. An Army Ranger, Captain Bednarzyk was assigned to the 3rd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment, at Fort Benning. In his time in the Army, he was awarded the Ranger Tab, the Air Assault Badge, the Army Parachutist Badge, and the Expert Infantryman’s Badge. He previously deployed to Kosovo, where he conducted training exercises and led U.S. troops on a peacekeeping mission with NATO forces and local military. Captain Bednarzyk is an American hero. While his life was tragically cut short, his service to our community and to our Nation will forever live on. His courage and his determination to succeed are truly inspirational. We send our deepest condolences to Captain Bednarzyk’s parents, Casey and Ruth, along with his brother Kevin and grandfather Francis. Thank you for sharing his life with us. Rangers lead the way. Connor Bednarzyk led the way. I now ask my colleagues to join me in a moment of silence for an American hero, Connor Bednarzyk. f 
HONORING MS. LAURA WOOTEN (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Ms. Laura Wooten for her dedication and service to America’s voters. Ms. Wooten has been a poll worker in New Jersey for 79 consecutive years. She has dedicated her life to helping people vote, regardless of their party or position. Ms. Wooten is the longest serving poll worker in New Jersey. She is likely the longest serving poll worker in our Nation. In fact, she has helped administer elections through the administration of 14 Presidents, from Franklin Delano Roosevelt to Donald J. Trump. Ms. Wooten is 97 years old, and she will once again perform her duties as a poll worker in New Jersey in November with her characteristic pride, grace, and smile. Ms. Wooten is a role model for all people and a reminder that every vote counts. And, as she likes to say, voting is important. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Ms. Laura Wooten by reminding all Americans, regardless of party or position, to just vote. 
WORLD PHARMACISTS DAY (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate September 25 as World Pharmacists Day 2018. I am glad we have a day to recognize the pharmacy profession, which plays a crucial role in keeping American people healthy. Across our country, there are around 67,000 pharmacies that fill an average of 12.2 million prescriptions every day. Further, pharmacists are consistently ranked among the most trusted healthcare providers, an important statistic because of the responsibility the profession carries. With the current opioid epidemic, pharmacists are possibly more important than ever before because of their position on the frontlines of patients’ access to prescription drugs. As the only pharmacist currently serving in Congress, I am glad to see the growing number of young people entering the pharmacy profession, working to make people healthier every day. Thank you to all our pharmacists across the country. f 
b1630 NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY AWARENESS MONTH (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate National Cybersecurity Awareness Month, which begins October 1. As the cofounder and co chair of the Congressional Cybersecurity Caucus with my good friend Chairman MIKEMCCAUL, I firmly believe that cybersecurity is the national and economic security challenge of the 21st century. I also believe that each of us has a role to play in staying safe online. During each of the 4 themed weeks of Cybersecurity Awareness Month, the Department of Homeland Security and its partners across the government and the private sector will highlight different aspects of cybersecurity, from the challenges faced by our critical infrastructure to the steps individuals can take to make their homes a safe haven for online safety. I encourage all my colleagues to take the opportunity to bring these messages back to their home districts. From senior centers to local chambers of commerce, the cybersecurity awareness events that I hold with our State cybersecurity officer, Mike Steinmetz, and the great team at the Rhode Island Joint Cyber Task Force have helped people across the Ocean State better protect themselves online. I look forward to another successful Cybersecurity Awareness Month. 
TAX REFORM PACKAGE (Mr. WILLIAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Speaker, I take this time to speak about a piece of legislation on the floor tomorrow, H.R. 6760, the Protecting Family and Small Business Tax Cuts Act of 2018. 
This is the third and final bill of the tax reform 2.0 package that Republicans have been working so hard on. As the constituents of Texas’ 25th District know, I have been fighting for a commonsense business owners’ perspective on tax reform since day one. Less than a year ago, we passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Since then, there are more jobs; Americans are seeing higher wages; and Main Street can finally breathe again. While all this is great, there has always been the uncertainty of knowing that these cuts would expire in 2025, something I have been fighting to change. I am happy to report that with tax reform 2.0, tax cuts will be made permanent for families, workers, and smallbusiness owners across this country. Regrettably, Mr. Speaker, I will be unable to cast my vote in favor for tax reform 2.0 tomorrow. My youngest daughter, Sabrina, is getting married. While I have a duty as a United States Congressman, I first have a duty as a father and would not miss her wedding day for anything in the world. I hope everyone understands my decision back home and here. This vote is historic, and I am excited to watch this economy flourish to grow because of it. In God we trust. 
HONORING AIRMAN APPRENTICE JOSEPH NAGLAK (Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay respect to the remarkable life of Airman Apprentice Joseph Min Naglak of Navy Station Norfolk. Airman Apprentice Naglak was born in South Korea and adopted by Kenneth M. and Jeanne Rand Naglak of West Windsor, New Jersey. He graduated from West Windsor Plainsboro High School in 2015 where he lettered in varsity football and took time to learn automotive restoration. Airman Apprentice Naglak studied homeland security at Monmouth University before enlisting in April of 2017. He lived with his fiancee, Nicole Weber, and was an active and energetic volunteer with the Special Olympics. His life was cut short in an accident last week aboard the USS George H.W. Bush. In speaking of his courage and patriotism, his sister said: ‘‘He wanted to join the Navy to give back to a country who gave him so much. He was everything that I hoped to be one day, and he should always be remembered as a hero with a big heart.’’ I send my condolences to the family and the friends of Airman Apprentice Naglak. I express my sincere gratitude for his service and his sacrifice, and I ask that my colleagues join me in a moment of silence recognizing his heroism and his sacrifice to our country. Rest in peace, Airman Naglak. f 
NATIONAL SUICIDE PREVENTION MONTH (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, September is National Suicide Prevention Month, reminding us that we lose too many to suicide each and every day. Unfortunately, suicide is all too common among the men and women who have served our Nation in uniform, a population that is particularly at risk of suicide. In fact, the VA estimates that 20 veterans and servicemembers lose their lives each and every day, and veterans are 22 percent more likely to commit suicide than nonvets. Among female veterans, the risk of suicide is a staggering 250 percent higher. Veterans are just 10 percent of the U.S. population but constitute 20 percent of suicides. Measures like the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention Act, which we have already passed into law, are already making a difference, but even one veteran suicide is too many. We should always remind our veterans, Mr. Speaker, and those who are in need, that there are always ways to get help. Veterans can always call the VA’s crisis hotline 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. 
50TH ANNIVERSARY OF FRONT RANGE COMMUNITY COLLEGE (Mr. POLIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in recognition of the 50th anniversary of Front Range Community College in Colorado, which I am proud to represent. The college first opened in 1968 with only 2,000 students enrolled in a few programs. Today, they have campuses in Fort Collins, Westminster, Longmont, and Brighton—28,000 students, over 160 degree and certificate programs. Over the years, FRCC has seen continual enrollment increases, serving even more students. Go, Wolves. During my time in Congress, I have worked with FRCC to reduce the cost of textbooks, expand access to dual and concurrent enrollment programs with our school districts, support career and technical education, and ensure students who have obtained credits are able to get their associate’s degree. We recognize the hard work and perseverance of the students and the staff at Front Range Community College as we celebrate the 50th birthday of Front Range Community College and how it has helped transform people’s lives and communities across Colorado. For 50 years, Front Range Community College has fostered successful lives and strong futures for everybody. Congratulations and happy birthday, FRCC. f 
RECOGNIZING CREWMEMBERS OF NAVY FLETCHER CLASS DESTROYER COMMISSIONED 1942– 1969 (Mr. YOHO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor and privilege to recognize the crewmembers of the USS Cony, a Navy Fletcher Class destroyer that was commissioned from 1942 to 1969. I would like to welcome the esteemed shipmates and their families to Washington, D.C., as they celebrate their 36th annual reunion. During World War II and the Korean war, the USS Cony protected and transported goods throughout Asia and the Pacific. The USS Cony received 13 battle stars for its service and outstanding achievement that deserves recognition today. The Cony and its crewmembers also played a crucial role in defending the U.S. during the Cuban Missile Crisis, and I commend the valiant efforts of the men and women who served this country while aboard the USS Cony. Although the Cony was decommissioned long ago, her legacy lives on today. Thank you to all the members, past and present, of the United States military for your service and sacrifice. 
WORK HIGHLIGHTS (Mrs. BEATTY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I stand with Democrats for the people. Republicans want to repeal the Affordable Care Act, risking healthcare for 24 million newly enrolled Americans and 129 million with preexisting conditions. I stand with the people. That is why I held a healthcare roundtable listening session where 53 healthcare administrators attended, talking about strengthening the ACA, improving the delivery and access to healthcare, and addressing social detriments. Making homeownership a reality for Americans, I stand with the people. Democrats on the Financial Services Committee want to expand affordable housing and provide more homeownership opportunities to people like Mrs. Joyce Mayne, who, at 75 years of age a few weeks ago, purchased her first home on her birthday. Happy birthday, Mrs. Mayne. It was with the help of a nonprofit, Homeport, and the lowincome housing tax credit. We are working to fix our broken immigration system. Right now, Mr. Speaker, families in my district are being ripped apart, like Edith Espinal and members of the Mauritanian, Somali, Latin American, and Central 
American communities. In the nearly 365 days, Edith has been in sanctuary, my staff and I have met with her family, legal representatives, advocates, and community stakeholders. 
#KEEPINGTHECRUMBS (Mr. OLSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, like every American, every Member of Congress has a lower tax rate because of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Every Democrat voted against this law. It was mocked as mere crumbs. Well, folks back home have a question for House Democrats: #keepingthecrumbs? The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ended the death tax. The junior Senator from California said repealing the death tax is ‘‘a giveaway to those at the top, not something that will create jobs.’’ Here is a response from a friend back home in Fort Bend County, Dan McDonald. Dan says, ‘‘EIEIO.’’ Dan’s comments are echoed by those of Rosenberg Tractor’s Gary Allred. Gary says, ‘‘Getting rid of the death tax keeps jobs right now and adds jobs in the future because Texans can keep their lands, pass them on to their kids, grandkids, and greatgrandkids for all eternity. Let’s step up and pass version 2 and get #keepingthecrumbs. 
HONORING WARREN G. GOSS (Mr. ROTHFUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize U.S. Army Private First Class Warren Goss. A western Pennsylvania native, Warren answered the call to defend his country and joined the U.S. Army in July of 1943 at the age of 18. He was deployed to the European theater where he underwent training for the Dday invasions as a rifleman. Under heavy enemy fire and without air support, Warren and his fellow comrades were some of the first soldiers to bravely storm the beaches of Normandy, succeeding in their mission to secure a German communications tower. Afterward, Warren was transferred to the 70th Division’s 274th K Company, where he continued to fight in France and across Europe until the end of the war. Upon returning home, Warren met his wife, Mary, and fathered two daughters, Rhonda and Paula. For his heroic actions to liberate France, Warren was recently made a Chevalier of the National Order of the Legion of Honour, France’s highest order of merit for military and civil merits. Congratulations, Warren, on receiving this distinct honor, and thank you for your valiant and selfless service to our Nation. f 
PAKISTAN IS STILL HARBORING TERRORISTS (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the State Department has released its annual country report on terrorism. Terrorist attacks are down worldwide, but there are still frustrating details that we must expose. The biggest frustration is that Pakistan, a so called major nonNATO ally, continues to harbor terrorist groups that target the United States and its allies. The report says that the Taliban, the Haqqani Network, LeT, and JeM, all terrorist groups, they all still operate in safe havens in Pakistan. Some are able to raise money, recruit, and train in Pakistan. For too long, I, as well as others, have come to this floor to point out Pakistan’s duplicitous behavior. When will we stop appeasing Pakistan and sending billions in American money to these fake friends, money that ends up in the hands of terrorists who make war on America? We must designate Pakistan as a state sponsor of terrorism, then revoke their major nonNATO ally status. Then we must go after these terrorist groups. And that is just the way it is. 
b1645 THE TRAJECTORY OF GOVERNMENT SPENDING The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. SANFORD ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Speaker, with due respect to my colleague from Oklahoma who has been kind enough to yield me a bit of time, what I am going to do is yield to him, ultimately, and he will take the bulk of this time. I just was thinking the other night about the larger issue of government spending, and I would just like to walk through a couple of numbers here in a few minutes on its importance, because we have a big tax vote tomorrow. We had one today, and we had a vote before that, I guess the day before that, tied to spending and what the trajectory looks like on that front here at the Federal level. But I want us to step back for one second and look at the bigger picture on why containing spending is so important and why it is not so important in our kids’ or grandkids’ time, but why it is so important right now. I think it is interesting, if you were to look at the words of Erskine Bowles, the words of Sir Alex Fraser Tytler, the words of Paul Kennedy, and the words of your local fifth grade elementary school teacher, what you would find is an amazing correlation between all four of them. It was Erskine Bowles, who was, I guess, former President Clinton’s former Chief of Staff who said that we are walking toward the most predictable financial crisis in the history of man. As we remember, they put together the BowlesSimpson Commission of 2010. That ultimately led to the sequestration that we are in the process of getting rid of, but it was a ‘‘nuclear weapon’’ that said we have got to do something, yet we haven’t. If you look at the words of Sir Alex Fraser Tytler, he was a Scottish historian who lived in the 1800s, and his words, after looking at world history over the whole of his life, were that a democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only exist until the voters discover that they can vote for themselves largesse from the public treasury, with the result that a democracy always fails under loose fiscal policy and is generally followed by a dictatorship. The average age of the world’s great civilizations has been 200 years. These nations have progressed through this sequence: from bondage to spiritual faith, spiritual faith to great courage, great courage to liberty, liberty to abundance, abundance to selfishness, selfishness to complacency, complacency to apathy, apathy to dependency, and dependency back again into bondage. And indeed, if you look at the timeline of civilizations across the annals of history, what you see is that up and down of the way that civilizations have come and gone. And it was Paul Kennedy, in his book ‘‘The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers,’’ who talked about how, traditionally, open political systems have basically spent their way into oblivion and that the largest thing that you used to be able to buy was a standing army— nowadays, the largest thing that you can buy is entitlement spending—but that in every instance, a civilization came to a tipping point wherein they had to decide: Do we go back to what made us competitive and, perhaps, a world power in the first place or not? And that dovetails, actually, with another book that was written, entitled, ‘‘This Time It’s Different,’’ by professors from Harvard and University of Maryland. They looked at the last 800 years of financial history and they found, in every instance, civilizations got to this same point, which brings me back to the local fifth grade math teacher. One plus one equals two, period. Numbers always work. Can they be manipulated? Yes. But at the end of the day, in the same way that gravity works, numbers work. So I think that we just need to acknowledge that we are living in a weird 
time. Debt, deficit, and government spending are not things that are talked about in Washington, D.C., as they should be, and what we are doing is we are hoping that things will get better. We are hoping that economic growth will take care of the problem. Well, it might, but it was Gordon Sullivan, former Chief of Staff of the United States Army, who wrote a book entitled, ‘‘Hope Is Not a Method.’’ Hope, indeed, is not a method. It may work out that way, but it may not, and, therefore, we have got to be really prudent with the way that we budget and spend going forward, given the implications of what history has said will come our way if we don’t get the numbers right. So that leads me to a few numbers I would just like to share with you, and these numbers are interesting in what they point to. They point to the fact that this is not a problem for our grandchildren or for our children. This is a problem that is coming down the pike really fast. If you look at the Congressional Budget Office numbers over the next 10 years, what they show is that we are running trillionplus deficits on a yearly basis and that there is going to be a snowballing effect with regard to debt to GDP, that we are going to get to spaces that we have never been to before in peaceful times. That is what this chart refers to right here. A lot of people say we don’t really need to do something that much because we got into a real problem—if I pull that chart over this way—back at the time of World War II. We were over 100 percent debt to GDP, and we are just not that far right now, 79 percent. But that doesn’t include the social safety net promises that are built into the budget. If you include those offbalance sheet promises that are realworld promises and that do have to be paid, we are actually up around 107 percent, which is not that far from the 106 percent or 119 percent that we saw in the wake of exhausting ourselves after World War II as we fought against the Japanese and Nazi Germany for our very survival. If you do an applestoapples comparison and include, again, the social safety net payments that weren’t in place at the time of World War II, we are eerily close to that alltime high that we saw in the wake of World War II. That is just sort of a little bit longer perspective. Going back to the CBO numbers that I was just referring to, again, we are going to be hitting the trilliondollar mark year in and year out, year in and year out, and that is without a recession, which is really the point of what I wanted to get to. Well, before I get to it, actually, let me take one last snapshot. If you look at sort of blood and turnips, you can only squeeze so much blood out of a turnip is the saying. If you look at the long run, we have taken about 17
1⁄2, a little shy of 20 percent of the gross product of everything that we do in this country has gone off to the Federal Government, and we have been consistently spending a little bit more than that 20 percent here over the last 50 years. Those numbers really begin to grow as we have the baby boomers retiring. So what we have is a math and demographic trap that, unless we get ahead of it, is going to, again, have profound problems and implications in terms of the value of the currency, in terms of, ultimately, the future inflation, in terms of the value of everything that you or I may have saved to date. We have been on a spending binge and a debt binge not just as a country, but around the world. So if you look at the numbers that we were all troubled by back in 2007, the spike that we saw in 2008, 2009 with the financial crisis, which was the worst crisis that we have seen since the Great Depression, we thought that there would be a deleveraging after that, but, in fact, the reverse has occurred. There is $68 trillion worth of new debt around the globe, and so we have seen roughly 300 percent increases in China. We have seen that, more than that in the United States. We have seen that in Spain. We have seen well more than that in Japan. Debt has gone up, not down. In other words, we are more susceptible to a financial storm than we were at the time of the financial crisis back in the mid2000s. Add to that, if you look at what is happening in most of the developed world, they are actually doing a bit of deleveraging. America is outside of that norm on that front. But here is the part that I want to get to, and there are a lot of other charts on a different night that I would like to walk through. But if you look at, again, the numbers, those CBO numbers basically anticipate that we are not in for a recession right now. If the recession comes soon, our numbers balloon in terms of debt and deficits going forward, so that makes it that much more relevant if you look at the history of recessions. The average recession, basically over the last 50 years—excuse me—the average economic expansion has been about 58 months before a recession came along. We are now in the second longest economic recovery in American history. Now, when it ends, I don’t know. But what I do know is that trees don’t grow to the sky, and when you begin to go to the point where you are, in essence, double the average that we have seen since World War II, you know that we have to be not too far from the next recession, which, again, will have incredible implications in terms of debt and deficit going forward. Let me give you a few other indicators that say that that recession and, again, the spiking of deficits and the spiking of debt that will come with it is not too far. We are now in the longest bull market in American history. Again, think about that. Think about the wealth effect that comes with that and, again, the multiplier effect that that has in a consumerdriven economy, which is what we have in this country. We have had quite the run on that front. And not only has there been duration, there has been levity, if you want to call it that, not in terms of humor, but we have seen the numbers really rise. We are now, in terms of PE, our pricetoearnings multiples, up around where we were at the time in 1928 of Black Tuesday, at about 32 times in terms of the average market pricing. This chart, I think, is really interesting. What it shows is that there have only been two other occasions in the history of our Republic over the last 70 years when we have had the kind of wealth effect that we have right now. One occurred—and this is, again, household net worth as a percentage of disposable income in our country. Once it occurred just prior to the tech bubble bursting. The other time it occurred was just prior to the real estate boom bursting in 2008. Now we are at a level that is, again, more than 600 percent of household net worth as a percentage of disposable income, again, the highest level that we have ever seen over the last 70 years and a number that has only been prefaced twice: once, just prior to the tech bubble bursting, and the other time, just prior to the real estate bubble of 2008 bursting. Now, what does that mean? I don’t know exactly what it means, but if I am looking at any kind of trend line, you would say: I don’t know that it is good. It says the obvious. When I drive to Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, and I go into Sea Pines, the mansions of the 1970s are being torn down to make way for big houses now. The mansion of the 1970s is no longer a mansion; it is a little house that is a teardown. People are wealthier than they have ever been. But what comes up oftentimes goes down, and I want to go into some of the wealth effect that has taken place here, which is what you have seen with this number right here. The Fed balance sheet has exploded, from about $800 billion in size to over $4 trillion in size. As we go on the opposite side of the curve, deleveraging, it is going to have an impact on interest rates, which, again, is going to impact this debt and deficit number. This is yield curve flattening. In every instance over the last 70 years, within 10 months of the yield curve flattening, there has been a recession. Ours happens to be flattening right now. Finally, I would make this point in these couple of slides that I wanted to show, which is that the unemployment rates are bottoming out right now. In every instance over the last, again, 70 years, when that has occurred, there has been a recession within 9 months. There are a lot of other indicators for a different night that I would like to 
walk through in terms of walking through why, again, the economic challenges that are before us are, again, not in our grandkids’ time, not in our kids’ time, but in our time, which makes spending restraint that much more important. I have taken up more than my share of time for my dear colleague from Oklahoma, and I don’t want to burn through the entirety of his time, so I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma profusely for allowing me to walk through a couple of slides this evening. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
UNIFYING AMERICA The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. RUSSELL ) is recognized for the remainder of the hour as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, he was a soldier who had given 45 years of service to his country. 222 years ago, this month, he crafted a farewell address to the Nation. In it, he made no attempt to recount his time as a businessman, warrior, lawmaker, founder, Framer, battlefield commander, or President of a United States that he, more than any other, helped to create. b1700 Instead, George Washington, chose to offer ‘‘disinterested warnings of a parting friend,’’ which he felt were, important to the permanency of our felicity as a people. Leaders today departing public service might recount their personal journey and thank those who shared some of their path. Washington’s final words were nothing of the sort. He chose, instead, to look far into the future and address all of us, the future. None of us can know it. We get occasional glimpses of it by talking to older people, those a little further down the road. From them, we gain wisdom and counsel. Yet, sadly, each generation imagines that it faces unprecedented problems only to dismiss the counsels of the generation or two before them. We find it tough to absorb the Wisdom of Solomon when he stated, ‘‘There is nothing new under the Sun.’’ Another way to put it is this: Times change, people don’t. Taking this truth, what would George Washington say to us if he were here today? What counsels would he give our Nation? What relevance would it have? Fortunately, in this gleaming alabaster city that bears his name, we have rich archives to continue to hear from George Washington. Whether we are wise enough to heed Washington, is another matter altogether. Surprisingly, he gave no recommendation for us to love liberty, as liberty is in the very fiber of the human race, and was certainly heightened among the early Americans whose efforts had recently secured it. Instead, Washington made a vital observation while trying to give future Americans a headsup. Here it is: Liberty does not secure independence. Washington knew a fallen mankind would flourish in liberty, and as such, Americans would be enticed to reduce and erode our independence for temporary gain or perceived future benefit. Instead of liberty, he identified unity as the essential factor to retain American independence. At first ponder, this seems counterintuitive. After all, unified efforts require a certain accommodation to one another for greater good, necessitating an occasional deferential voluntary reduction in one’s personal liberty. Unity achieves result without reducing liberty through power, pen, statute, or sword. For these reasons, Washington told America that unity was the, ‘‘main pillar in the edifice of your real independence, the support of your tranquility at home, your peace abroad, of your safety, of your prosperity, of that very liberty which you so highly prize.’’ Even after 242 years as a Republic, we still embody this idea in our national motto: e pluribus unum, a Latin phrase meaning, out of many—one. We see it in our pledge, with terms like ‘‘one Nation,’’ ‘‘indivisible,’’ but what of our behavior today? We still, on occasion, employ the words, but we deploy actions that could better be described as e pluribus pluribus. One hyphenated nation and divisible. Washington warned of it: ‘‘But as it is easy to foresee that, from different causes and from different quarters, much pains will be taken, many artifices employed to weaken in your minds the conviction of this truth . . . that you should properly estimate the immense value of your national union to your collective and individual happiness; that you should cherish a cordial, habitual, and immovable attachment to it; accustoming yourselves to think . . . of it as . . . your political safety and prosperity; watching for its preservation with jealous anxiety; discountenancing whatever may suggest even a suspicion that it can in any event be abandoned; and indignantly frowning upon the first dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the rest, or to enfeeble the sacred ties which now link together the various parts.’’ Washington’s words today read like stinging rebuke to all Americans. Instead of guarding our institutions jealously with cordial, habitual, and immovable attachment, we in these august Chambers across every aisle allow disruption to displace discourse, polarization to pass for politics, and resistance to replace result. Mr. Speaker, we stand condemned, but not irredeemable. Like any first step, admitting the problem is the path to recovery. How did we allow these congressional Chambers to suffer such infiltration? Our own history contains sharp lessons of discord, the loss of our own lawmakers by caning and shooting—sometimes by our own selves; a preference for conflict over Constitution, and a division so great that we ended up destroying each other on America’s fields and farms from Gettysburg to Vicksburg. Washington’s warnings went unheeded a mere 100 years after he gave them. We selfcorrected, but only after great harm to ourselves. It has been 150 years since we nearly destroyed each other. Are we on any more secure a path? It would appear from our treatment of each other and our view of our own Nation’s future that we are tempted to walk an old path. If that be the case, then taking counsel from George Washington might be a timely exercise. With regard to unity, we must realize we are all in the ship of state together. Crashing it on the rocks as we fight each other for control of the helm will deny any safe harbor we wish to obtain. Washington believed that we must view our unity as a sacred tie that links together the various parts. ‘‘Citizens by birth or choice of a common country, that country has a right to concentrate your affections. The name ‘American,’ which belongs to you in your national capacity, must always exalt the just pride of patriotism more than any appellation derived from local discriminations. With slight shades of difference you have the same religion, manners, habits, and political principles. You have a common cause fought in triumph together; the independence and liberty you possess are the work of joint counsels and joint efforts of common dangers, sufferings and successes. . . . your union ought to be considered as a main prop to your liberty, and that the love of one ought to endear you to the preservation of the other.’’ If the unity of our people be the main prop of our liberty, what was it that George Washington believed would knock out that prop? Warning number one and number two from George Washington, Geographical and Party Disunion: Washington believed, ‘‘a government for the whole is indispensable.’’ When various parts of the country come to feel that they are more important than the others, they will ‘‘acquire influence within particular districts to misrepresent the opinions and aims of other districts.’’ Disregarding government for some regional or geographical preference to suit our own interest is a sure way to erode our unity. Washington’s view of our government was to show ‘‘Respect for its authority, compliance with its laws, acquiescence in its measures, are duties enjoined by the fundamental maxims of true liberty.’’ Washington believed that the Constitution and its authentic amending was an act by the people upon themselves, and that every American would naturally have an obligation to obey the established government for the experiment even to work. 
‘‘All obstructions to the execution of the laws . . . designs to direct, control, counteract, or awe the regular constituted authorities, are destructive of this fundamental principle and a fatal tendency. They serve to organize faction, to give it an artificial and extraordinary force; to put, in the place of the delegated will of the Nation the will of a party, often a small but artful and enterprising minority of the community; and, according to the alternate triumphs of different parties, to make the public administration the mirror of the illconcerted and incongruous projects of faction, rather than the organ of consistent and wholesome plans digested by common counsels and modified by mutual interests.’’ Washington foresaw that geographical interests could coalesce around party preferences, with urban and rural, coastal and inland, northern and southern, eastern and western, forming the basis by which we would try to empower ourselves with party faction to obtain the interests of one rather than the interests of all. For our government to work for the whole Nation, he encouraged us to ‘‘remember that time and habit are at least as necessary to fix the true character of governments as of other human institutions.’’ For example, we understand that it takes time for a child to become an adult, or that an adult, in time, must master his or her skills and experience to succeed in work or creativity. Yet, somehow, we imagine that the difficult things of government can be solved in months, when in the natural flow of life, it takes years and decades to secure true accomplishment. Even if we were able to accept this wisdom, we find ourselves provoked to what Washington called, ‘‘the spirit of revenge’’ among parties as one faction would alternate domination over the other. Washington warned that it was, ‘‘natural to party dissension, which in different ages and countries has perpetuated the most horrid enormities, is itself a frightful despotism. But this leads at length to a more formal and permanent despotism. The disorders and miseries which result gradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the absolute power of an individual; and sooner or later the chief of some prevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his competitors, turns this disposition to the purposes of his own elevation, on the ruins of public liberty.’’ Washington warned that party faction would always distract public cooperation, weakening our government’s ability to function. Loyalty to party over the Nation would, in his phrases, agitate communities, kindle animosity, foment occasional riot and insurrection, and open the door for foreign influence and corruption to weaken the Nation. He also warned of those using patriotism and liberty as their justification to stress the Nation, rising in their deep conviction with the spirit of party and urgency. Admitting that there would be some indulgence for this, if not favor, he warned that such a spirit was not to be encouraged. He called upon all Americans to not fan these embers as they were ‘‘a fire not to be quenched, it demands a uniform vigilance to prevent its bursting into flame, lest, instead of warming, it should consume.’’ Warning number three, The Encroachment of National Leaders: Washington warned that national leaders ‘‘to confine themselves within their respective constitutional spheres, avoiding in the exercise of the powers of one department to encroach upon another . . . The spirit of encroachment tends to consolidate the powers of all the departments in one, and thus to create, whatever the form of government, a real despotism . . . If, in the opinion of the people, the distribution or modification of the constitutional powers be in any particular wrong, let it be corrected by an amendment in the way which the Constitution designates. But let there be no change by usurpation; for though this, in one instance, may be the instrument of good, it is the customary weapon by which free governments are destroyed.’’ Warning number four, Religious Abandonment: For all of Washington’s warnings about political and party faction, his remedy was very clear. So clear, in fact, that its absence, he said, would guarantee that our Nation would lack human rights. ‘‘Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, religion and morality are dispensable supports. . . . Let it simply be asked: Where is the security for property, for reputation, for life, if the sense of religious obligation desert the oaths which are the instruments of investigation in courts of justice? And let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds of peculiar structure, reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle. . . . virtue or morality is a necessary spring of popular government. Who . . . can look with indifference upon attempts to shake the foundation of the fabric?’’ b1715 Warning number five, Public Debt and Weakened Defense: Washington had much to say about public credit. He believed it should be used as sparingly as possible. He also believed one sure way to preserve the national treasury would be to promote peace, but also to fund the government on time. Proper funding would secure the Nation, preventing greater cost to repel danger and burden the Nation with debt. Toward all national debts, Washington reminded all Americans that it took revenue to pay them. ‘‘The execution of these maxims belongs to your representatives, but it is necessary that public opinion should cooperate. To facilitate to them the performance of their duty, it is essential that you should practically bear in mind that towards the payment of debts, there must be revenue; that to have revenue, there must be taxes; that no taxes can be devised which are not more or less inconvenient and unpleasant.’’ For these reasons, Washington warned that our motives must be decisive in the expense of government and to choose wisely the objects that we should fund. To ignore this would weaken our Nation as a whole. Warning number six, Entangling and Favored Alliances: Washington’s view of foreign policy was to: ‘‘Observe good faith and justice towards all nations; cultivate peace and harmony with all. Religion and morality enjoin this conduct; and can it be, that good policy does not equally enjoin it? It will be worthy of a free, enlightened nation, and at no distant period, a great nation, to give mankind the magnanimous and too novel example of a people always guided by an exalted justice and benevolence.’’ Washington believed good morality would naturally create good foreign policy, fairness, and impartiality. He urged to treat all nations equally, initially. He warned that adverse relations with nations would result in poor policy and unnecessary conflict. Unnecessary favor to particular nations might pull us into conflict with some other where we may have had no quarrel at all. Washington was passionate here: ‘‘Against the insidious wiles of foreign influence, I conjure you to believe me, fellowcitizens, the jealousy of a free people ought to be constantly awake, since history and experience prove that foreign influence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government. But that jealousy to be useful must be impartial.’’ His final warning, warning number seven, Partiality in Commerce: Washington instructed: ‘‘The great rule of conduct for us in regard to foreign nations is in extending our commercial relations, to have with them as little political connection as possible.’’ Washington believed strong relations could be built upon commerce, keeping us in a fair and neutral position, preventing entanglement in disputes between other nations. He urged to steer clear of permanent alliances, but, rather, that ‘‘we may safely trust to temporary alliances for extraordinary emergencies.’’ Washington argued commerce should be equal and impartial, neither seeking nor granting exclusive favors; to consult the natural course of things; to handle gently the natural streams of commerce; to force nothing; to define the rights of our merchants; to enter upon agreements in a temporary fashion, recognizing that from time to time such commerce could be abandoned or modified as needs and circumstances might dictate. 
Washington foresaw that, if we expected disinterested favors from other nations without an equal benefit, there would be an accounting. He warned: ‘‘There can be no greater error than to expect or calculate upon real favors from nation to nation.’’ George Washington had no illusions that his warnings would endure to control the Nation’s passions. He did hope, however, they ‘‘may be productive of some partial benefit, some occasional good; that they may now and then recur to moderate the fury of party spirit, to warn against the mischiefs of foreign intrigue, to guard against the impostures of pretended patriotism.’’ So where do we stand, Mr. Speaker, as a nation in these areas of warning? How are we doing on geographical and party disunion? We stand guilty of it. The average American citizen has only been to 8 of her 50 States, and our national leaders and our own people disrespect our Nation’s Capitol as a swamp. We see coastal cities referring to interior rural towns as ‘‘flyover country,’’ not realizing that nearly all of their food comes from it, while rural areas declaring coastal regions would not be missed if they simply fell into the ocean, not realizing that these areas represent the bulk of national trade and economy. We see Americans electing the most polarized to the left or to the right, sending them to work in Washington, D.C., wondering why they can’t get along to get things done when they get here. We see elected leaders calling for disruption and resistance rather than discourse and result. We see chairs thrown through campus windows because we cannot abide free speech. We see history expunged because we cannot abide free thought. We have abandoned accommodation, bypassed toleration, encouraged isolation, organized intimidation, and are set to pursue a path to castigation. What is next? Elimination of our Republic? We must get reacquainted as Americans with unity, with the idea that the Nation comes before region, before party, before self. A republic is a mutual enterprise. We must relearn how to keep it. How are we doing on Washington’s warning of national leaders encroaching on each other’s branch of government or each other’s business? We complain of judges legislating from benches while we judge from our legislatures. We see executive branches move by power of decree rather than by power of consent. We see people ignore Federal authority while demanding Federal aid. We have eroded respected institutions as elected leaders abandon civil conduct in hearings, confusing disruption, disrespect, and division somehow with democracy. We have deluded ourselves that rudeness is now a form of representation. If we cannot respect these hallowed institutions that we ourselves, as Americans, control, how can we possibly receive respect in return from our fellow citizens as we look to lead government? If we spent as much effort to watch our own lanes and make government business efficient rather than inflammatory, we might just restore some respect to the greatest constitutional republic that has ever existed. And, Mr. Speaker, it starts with us. And how about Washington’s warning on expecting morality without religion? We have traded accommodation for castigation, abandoning the very religious principles adorning all 13 of our original State constitutions, our own Declaration of Independence, Constitution, and Bill of Rights. Every Chamber, hall, ceiling, nook, and corner of our Capitol is adorned with these foundational beliefs. In this very Chamber, ‘‘In God We Trust’’ is over the Speaker’s podium, and 97 percent of the Members of Congress claim these principles in their personal beliefs. Why then have we become silent on free exercise of religion guaranteed in our Constitution? We have imagined that we can show respect without being respectful. We have encouraged and exchanged truth for a lie and now wonder why people are so uncivil to one another, and why we have faded hope, unclear vision, purpose, or reason to be a force for good in the world as a United States. Contrary to Washington’s warning, we imagine we can have morality without the free exercise of religion. We foolishly believe we can fix moral problems with political solutions. I am of the belief we need to ask God’s forgiveness. What of Washington’s warning on public debt, $20 trillion and counting? We demand thrift from each other but not from ourselves in our personal pocketbooks. The problem is so great today, but not greater than our people if we lead by our individual examples. We, the nationally elected leaders, are a reflection of America as a whole. Until Americans demand fiscal discipline in themselves, it will be a long wait to expect it from those whom we elect. We, the people, have put ourselves into this situation by making demands of government to pay for all of our shortcomings. At some point, that payment becomes due. We must ask less from the government and more from ourselves, solving our problems locally, together, without an invitation for government control. What of Washington’s warning on alliances and trade? Rather than a fair and bilateral approach to nations, we have entangled ourselves in multinational permanent agreements on trade, without the vision to think that the circumstances may change. We have pledged longterm favored status by treaty as opposed to short term agreements and objectives. We have a moral obligation to honor the agreements we have enjoined, but we would do well to heed Washington’s counsel to approach foreign relations commercially and have as little political connection to them as possible. Mr. Speaker, George Washington’s counsel is sorely needed today. We stand guilty in all seven of his warnings. We are guilty but not irredeemable. Americans have a history of self correction. Unfortunately, it often comes with some great distress or disaster. We can and must heed Washington’s warnings now and correct by choice rather than by circumstance. As a combat infantryman, a warrior, returning home from more than two decades of personal service, who now has a political life, I have asked myself this question: How did we as Americans allow our voice to be coopted by selfproclaimed cynics and critics on both sides of the political spectrum who have divided our great Nation? When did American zeal for innovation, sweat, and determination become replaced with intimidation, threat, and extermination of meaningful dialogue by pathetic keyboard commandos eating their bags of Cheese Puffs while sunken into their couches? America has never been built on the labor and counsel of cynics and critics. Americans, we need to wake up. It is time to rekindle that spirit that united our country, ended enslavement, enriched our land, advanced our arts and sciences, granted women’s suffrage, protested inequality, and protected the defenseless. Americans know the difference between what is evil and what is good. b1730 The question we must now ask is whether we will unite and continue to live free or continue to attack ourselves, give way to cynicism, and watch America’s liberty and place in the world die. Thank God America is still full of men and women who know it is not the cynic and critic who dig the ditch, teach the child, inspire the solutions, or create the future. It is time for Americans to put America before self again, to inspire, to lead, to unify, and to sacrifice. It starts with each of us sacrificing a few things, sacrifice doubt, sacrifice anxiety, sacrifice cynicism. America cannot allow warriors like me to come home from a decade of fighting and war to see our Republic overcome by the selfindulgent, the divisive, and the visionless. As visionary as we Americans and lovers of liberty claim to be, we will make little headway if our only answers to our friends and neighbors are mere sideline snipes about what is wrong with this country. 
Are we so shortsighted that we cannot accommodate dialogue, exchange ideas, and show some deference and respect to one another and rebuild our Nation? It is time for the American people to embrace what is right about our wonderful country, not what is wrong with it. Let us heed Washington’s warnings and get to work. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
GEORGE WASHINGTON The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. CHENEY). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT ) for 30 minutes. Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, I appreciated so much hearing the fantastic presentation about George Washington. It was interesting in the last several months to hear a presentation by a biographer of Benjamin Franklin over at the Library of Congress. He was asked: Do you see anybody in America today, in politics, that reminds you of Benjamin Franklin? He said: 
Well, I see, basically, a lot of different people with different parts of Franklin. He was brilliant, genius, funny, and clever. But it is not like he was George Washington. There was only one of those. 
We heard from the director of the Society of the Cincinnati, which has been around since the Revolution and is dedicated to the study of the Revolution. It is particularly named for the Roman General Cincinnatus who had come from the farm, won a great campaign, and went back to the farm. George Washington, it is very clear, could have been emperor or czar, whatever title he wanted. There were at least a couple efforts to have a military coup when the government was falling apart. Washington replied to one effort. They told him he didn’t even have to participate in the coup. They would even agree, when he didn’t want to serve or passed away, that they would honor whomever he chose as his subordinate. Basically, his response was: If you have any regard for me or this Nation, you will never mention such a notion to anyone again. What an incredible man George Washington was. He was a man of honor and a man of integrity. His word was his bond. That is why, for example, when he found out about Benedict Arnold, a man who was really the hero of the Battle of Saratoga—it wasn’t General Gates; it was really Benedict Arnold— he couldn’t believe it. It just crushed him to his soul that this great leader, Benedict Arnold, had turned on him and was ready to surrender him to the enemy. He just couldn’t believe, as such an incredible person of honor, that somebody he trusted would be such a traitor. We had a service in what was the largest Christian church in Washington for 60 or so years. That happened to be the old House Chamber down the hall. We had that last night led by Pastor Dan Cummins; his wife, JoAnne; and an incredible singer, Steve Amerson. I told people about the story of Isaac Potts. The big Potts family had land in Pennsylvania where Washington wintered his Army at Valley Forge. That was mainly on Potts land. Isaac Potts himself was a Quaker. He didn’t believe Christians should ever fight. He was out in the woods. A painting that depicted that scene was painted by Friberg. I am advised that there had been more prints made of that painting than any other American painting in history. It was Washington down on one knee beside his big, gray horse. He was praying to God. He had made mistakes as Commander of the United States, the Revolution. Potts heard him pray. He prayed out loud. In the painting he is seen with eyes closed basically looking down. My understanding is normally he looked up and spoke out in prayer. Alexander Hamilton found him on his knees praying in his tent many times early in the morning when he had to interrupt him for something important. But there he was, out in the snow. Potts listened to him. When Washington got on his big, gray horse and rode back into Valley Forge, Potts hurried home. First, he told his wife and told others. This was something that was passed from Potts and his wife. They told it, and they retold it. It had an incredible impact on this strong, Christian Quaker, because he was totally against the Revolution. He thought it was a disastrous mistake. He felt like no one who was a Christian could participate in a revolution, in any kind of military operation. But there was fake news back in those days, too. There was a biographer in the early 1800s who was trying to disprove that George Washington was a man of faith, a Christian. Peter Lillback in his big, wonderful book regarding George Washington takes on all of that fake news back in the day. That includes the early biographer’s account that everyone had heard the story about Isaac Potts. But he said that, in essence, he had talked to witnesses or people who thought it actually may not have ever happened. Kind of like news today, you don’t talk to the people who were actual witnesses. You talk to people who don’t know firsthand anything. All they know is hearsay, and they just happen to support your particular position. By the way, ‘‘George Washington’s Sacred Fire’’ is the name of Peter Lillback’s book. That night, Potts came back. We know what was said because it was repeated over and over again by Isaac Potts and by his wife. His granddaughter reduced it to writing. He said that Washington prayed out loud, and in his prayer, and this is quoting, ‘‘He utterly disclaimed all ability of his own for this arduous conflict.’’ We are talking about George Washington, 6 foot 4, even though Chernow’s book said he was a little shorter than 6 foot 2. That was one of the numerous mistakes in Chernow’s book. There is no question at all. It is indisputable that when Washington in 1799 was flat on a slab, he was 6 foot 31⁄2. But, in any event, this big, athletic, courageous man of faith, according to Potts, ‘‘wept at the thought of that irretrievable ruin which his mistakes might bring on his country.’’ Potts said: ‘‘And with the patriot’s pathos spreading the interests of unborn millions before the eye of Eternal Mercy, he implored the aid of that arm which guides the starry host.’’ Now, that is an incredible human being. His biographers, as the director of the Society of the Cincinnati had pointed out, say that there has never been anybody like him. When I was on islands south of India some years back on a trip where we had gone to check on our Special Forces, I had a leader there tell me: 
We are a new democracy, and we are always hearing about a potential military coup to overthrow our elected government. 
He paused. He looked at me, and he said: 
We never had a George Washington to set the proper example here, so we are always worried about a coup. 
He was an incredible man. Potts said: ‘‘I have seen this day what I shall never forget. Till now, I have thought that a Christian and a soldier were characters incompatible; but if George Washington be not a man of God, I am mistaken, and still more shall I be disappointed if God do not through him perform some great thing for this country.’’ So Isaac Potts was talking about a man known since 1755 in the French and Indian War for his relentless courage, his leadership, and his faith. As he said of a battle of the French and Indian War: 
That night when I took off my coat, I had bullet holes through and through my coat, but I had not a scratch on me. I took off my hat, and it had bullet holes through it. 
But he shook out his hair. Fragments flew everywhere. He said: Truly, I was protected by divine providence. And he truly was. Indians referred to him from that battle as the man God would not let die. He was such a man of honor and integrity that set this country on a path to freedom and into being a light on the hilltop. As a former President of the Czech Republic told me last night here, he said: America has always been seen, even when we disagreed with it, as that light on the hilltop. It was a beacon. It was showing the way for truth. He said: You don’t have that light on the hill here anymore. We can get it back. But Washington, of course, in his ‘‘Farewell Address’’ 
warned about the dangers of political parties. He encouraged us not to use them and not to have them. But we have. b1745 As I think about things that I was told by Africans in West Africa, what the former President of the Czech Republic said last night, and so many comments in so many parts of the world about even when they disagreed with this, they knew America wanted to do what was right. They wanted to create fairness in the world. Yet, they provided hope for people around the world, like Natan Sharansky talked about in the Soviet Gulag when he heard the courageous comments of President Reagan. But when political parties, political operatives have more of the characteristics of the former hero of the Battle of Saratoga when he became a traitor, more desirous of their own political gain, their own personal gain, their own political power, than just doing what is right, this country as we have known it as a light on the hill, as so many countries around the world have known us for so long, it won’t be there. I deeply regret when I hear how some of our children have been educated, and you talk to some young people who think that socialism is a better way to go. They have never been taught that socialism, though it sounds lovely, has never worked. The only way you can have a socialist country is if the government has all the power; the individual has no rights against the government; and the government takes all, provides all, has complete discretion in what it thinks is fair and what is not fair. Individual rights, as we have been afforded in our Bill of Rights and our Constitution, have to go, in order to have a socialist country. It is heartbreaking to hear even people on this House floor talk about how important it is to move on to being a progressive—meaning a socialist, communist country—which basically is a denial of the rights and the limited power in the Constitution. It is actually a breach of our oath to our Constitution to be pushing such an idea as socialism, communism, or progressivism, because you can’t have the rights under our Bill of Rights and have socialism, progressivism, communism. Back around 1960, 1961, Khrushchev appointed a committee to come up with a plan of how the Soviet Union would conveniently move to that nirvana type of state where there was no more government and everyone shared and shared alike. But he eventually realized you can never have socialism or communism without a totalitarian government that does not afford its citizens rights that Americans have had in our history. Victor Davis Hanson has a great article from September 25, entitled: ‘‘We Are Living Orwell’s 1984.’’ It is well written, well reasoned. I said some months back—and was actually accurately quoted—when I said the only thing Orwell appears to have gotten wrong was the date. It wasn’t 1984. Instead of the eye in our homes watching for the government, they do it through our phones; they do it through our computers. They can do it through listening devices. Of course, what did we do on the House floor yesterday? We voted to given more power to the Federal Government to get our bank records. Without the need of honoring the Fourth Amendment, honoring the doctrine, the requirement of probable cause, without a warrant, the government can get your bank records. It won’t be too difficult to do, as if we needed to add more power to the Patriot Act at a time when we have seen how weaponized the Department of Justice, the FBI, and, to a lesser extent, some of our intel has been weaponized. They need more power to just disregard warrants? Really? Hanson says: ‘‘Truth, due process, evidence, rights of the accused: All are swept aside in pursuit of the progressive agenda. ‘‘George Orwell’s 1949 dystopian novel ‘Nineteen EightyFour’ is no longer fiction. We are living it right now. ‘‘Google techies planned to massage Internet searches to emphasize correct thinking. A member of the socalled deep state, in an anonymous oped, brags that its ‘resistance’ is undermining an elected President. The FBI, CIA, DOJ, and NSC were all weaponized in 2016 to ensure that the proper President would be elected—the choice adjudicated by properly progressive ideology. Wearing a wire is now redefined as simply flipping on an iPhone and recording your boss, boy or girlfriend, or coworkers. ‘‘But never has the reality that we are living in a surreal age been clearer than during the strange cycles of Christine Blasey Ford’s accusations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. ‘‘In Orwell’s world of 1984 Oceania, there is no longer a sense of due process, free inquiry, rules of evidence and crossexamination, much less a presumption of innocence until proven guilty. Instead, regimented ideology— the supremacy of state power to control all aspects of one’s life to enforce a fossilized idea of mandated quality— warps everything from the use of language to private life. ‘‘Senator DIANNE FEINSTEIN and the other Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee had long sought to destroy the Brett Kavanaugh nomination. Much of their paradoxical furor over his nomination arises from the boomeranging of their own past political blunders, such as when Democrats ended the filibuster on judicial nominations in 2013. They also canonized the socalled 1992 Biden Rule, which holds that the Senate should not consider confirming the Supreme Court nomination of a lameduck President . . . in an election year. ‘‘Rejecting Kavanaugh proved a hard task, given that he had a long record of judicial opinions and writings—and there was nothing much in them that would indicate anything but a sharp mind, much less any ideological, racial, or sexual intolerance. His personal life was impeccable, his family admirable. ‘‘Kavanaugh was no combative Robert Bork, but congenial, and he patiently answered all the questions asked of him, despite constant demonstrations and preplanned street theater interruptions from the Senate gallery and often obnoxious grandstanding by ‘I am Spartacus’ Democratic Senators. ‘‘So Kavanaugh was going to be confirmed unless a bombshell revelation derailed the vote. And so we got a bombshell.’’ He goes on to talk about what has happened to Judge Brett Kavanaugh. He, in part, basically has indicated today, still showing class and respect, that he doesn’t doubt the allegations by Ms. Ford, but it certainly was not him. But if you look at her testimony, she has no hesitation in pulling out what she claims was an incident 35 years ago, maybe it was 34, maybe it was 36. Maybe it was at a home, maybe it wasn’t. Yet, she regales us with statements like she will never forget these details. Basically, they have haunted her whole life, even though we had been led to believe this was some type of repressed memory that didn’t come out until she needed marital counseling and she was trying to save her marriage. But there was a time in America when someone who was shown to be a class person, a true, iconic judge, a Justice, would have hesitation by anyone wanting to destroy or assassinate their character. In America, if you are going to destroy the reputation of someone who spent a life building an excellent reputation as demonstrated by all those who knew him well, then you would be reluctant to come forward with a very hazy memory that had all kinds of holes in it. You would be reluctant to call names and name names that you haven’t named for 36 years. There was a time when character mattered so much. For someone who felt an injustice, a terrible thing, had been done to them, they would care so deeply and have such sympathy for others, wanting to avoid the kind of heartache they say they had experienced, that they would never want to falsely accuse anyone with a very faulty memory of something decades before. That was back, though, at a time when America was that light on the hill that other national statesmen from other countries had seen the United States as being. That was a time when character mattered. 
That was a time when people felt that our Founders had the right idea. We are not going to be like England and say you are guilty until you can prove yourself innocent. We were not going to take up such Orwellian standards. Under the Founders’ principles, they felt it would be better to let somebody guilty go free than to imprison an innocent person. But things have changed. I think the light on the hill is still there. It is flickering. It may go out soon. But God has given us a chance to rekindle the fire. It won’t be rekindled, and it will be snuffed out for good if people in this building continue to put partisan politics ahead of truth, honor, justice, and decency. b1800 So what happens from here is up to us. Those of us who are elected to serve in this government, we can follow the track that has been laid in recent days, or we can say we are going to get back to where character matters, people are innocent until proven guilty, and we don’t assassinate characters simply because we disagree with them politically, so any allegation we make, as Ted Kennedy once did of Robert Bork, as Harry Reid did of Mitt Romney—it is okay to lie about people if you are able to prevent them from serving honorably in government. We are at a crossroads, and I hope and pray—as Robert Frost was able to say—we can say someday, ‘‘. . . and I took the road less traveled by. And that has made all the difference.’’ Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

Help them to see their legislative work as a divine calling and mission. We pray in Your sacred Name. Amen.
