Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 7, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act. This bill is an unprecedented attack on a woman’s right to make her own healthcare decisions and another attempt by Republicans to undermine the Affordable Care Act (ACA). This legislation goes far beyond the long standing Hyde Amendment which Congress passes every year during the Appropriations process preventing taxpayer dollars from being used for abortions. The Hyde Amendment is included in each Appropriations bill every year. This bill stretches increase taxes on millions of individuals and small businesses that purchase private healthcare plans that include abortion coverage. It takes away protections for rape survivors and pregnant women whose lives are in danger, and bans women in the military from abortion care in a military hospital overseas, even if they use their own money to pay for that care. This will deny millions of American women access to truly comprehensive health care. A woman’s right to choose whether to end a pregnancy is protected constitutionally. The decision is private. It is a matter of faith and it is a matter of conscience. I believe women already have the right to make decisions about reproductive health care, that it is protected constitutionally. This legislation should be rejected for its overly broad reach, its false advertising and its attack on the constitutionally protected right to privacy. 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, January 24, 2017, I was absent for Roll Call vote 63. Had I been present for Roll Call vote 63, H. Res. 55—Providing for consideration of the bill (H.R. 7) to prohibit taxpayer funded abortions, I would have voted ‘‘no’’. THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH FUNDING DEFICIT HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to clarify a statistic I inadvertently misstated on the House Floor on January 3rd. I intended to highlight how medical research at the National Institutes of Health has been cut by $7.5 billion since 2003, when adjusted for inflation. The cost of conducting medical research increases each year, yet the NIH’s budget has not kept up with this pace. As a result, the NIH has been able to support less research each year. Thankfully we started to reverse this trend in 2016, when we provided a $2 billion increase however that is not nearly enough to close the gap. Even with the money provided by 21st Century Cures for the next decade, Congress has barely put a dent in the NIH’s funding deficit. For example, in 2017, with the increase provided in the House Mark and the Cures bill, the NIH would still be over $7 billion short of the 2003 level. I would also note that the Cures funding is a gimmick—there is no guarantee that Congress will provide that funding each year. I regret my error in omitting the term ‘‘when adjusted for inflation.’’ But it is clear that when you look at the cost of research and the money we appropriate for the NIH, we have a long way to go. 
Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, due to numerous flight delays caused by weather along the southeast, I was not present during the vote series held on Monday, January 23, 2017. Had I been present I would have voted YEA on Roll Call No. H.R. 423 and YEA on Roll Call No. H.R. 582. 
Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Mr. Speaker, I proudly rise to recognize the March for Life on Friday January 27th, 2017 here in Washington D.C. This is a gathering of thousands of Americans from across our great country, all who are standing up for the protection of unborn children. Ever since the abysmal ruling by the Supreme Court in Roe vs. Wade, the barbaric practice of abortion on demand has been rampant in our country. All too often we fall into the trap of conflating women’s health with abortion, assuming that if one supports protecting life, then we’re failing to care for women’s health. Nothing could be further from the truth. I stand here today with the millions of Americans across our country who believe that the lives of innocent children must be protected. I have long been a staunch advocate for prolife issues despite vocal opposition. As Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, I shepherded the partialbirth abortion ban through Congress. It was one of my greatest honors to watch President George W. Bush sign it into law, and I was relieved that the Supreme Court upheld it. I have fully supported every effort in Congress to stop federally funded abortions, both in the United States and abroad, and will continue to fight efforts to federally fund these horrific practices. f 
Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, on January 23, 2017, I missed roll call vote 60 due to unavoidable delay. Had I been present, I would have voted ‘‘yes’’ on final passage of H.R. 423, the AntiSpoofing Act. 
TRIBUTE TO THE ASSYRIAN AMERICAN CIVIC CLUB OF TURLOCK 
Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Assyrian American Civic Club of Turlock as we celebrate its seventiethyear anniversary. Since the club’s founding in 1946, it has provided service to Assyrian Americans in the City of Turlock through the promotion and protection of the Assyrian culture, education, religion and humanitarian rights. The club was established in the fall of 1946 to help families preserve their deep rooted culture that can be passed on to future generations. It is progressive in nature not only to the benefit of Assyrian Americans, but also to all in California’s 10th Congressional District. The members of the Assyrian American Civic Club of Turlock recognize civic responsibility to their people and allegiance to the United States of America. It is in their core interests to uphold the principles of freedom and 
democracy, support the Constitution, instill a sense of individual obligation and responsibility for Assyrian unity, and support programs that perpetuate Assyrian cultural heritage. The club is dedicated to promoting goodwill and understanding among Assyrians and nonAssyrians alike. The club also recognizes and values the importance of education. On March 13, 2002, it created the Assyrian Civic Club Education Foundation. This 501(c)3 nonprofit continues to provide hundreds of scholarships to high school and university students, as it has done so for the past 15 years. The foundation educates, informs, and enhances cultural values for Assyrians in the community through their own local radio and television programs. Additionally, the civic club has its own facility that the community at large utilizes, while also serving as a place for Assyrian Americans to come together for social, recreation and educational activities. Mr. Speaker, please join me in honoring and recognizing the seventieth anniversary of the Assyrian American Civic Club of Turlock for its service and outstanding contributions to the Assyrian community as we celebrate this important milestone. 
CELEBRATING 75 YEARS OF THE UNITED WAY OF GREATER AUGUSTA 
Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, it’s the people who make a community a great place to live, work, and in my case, represent. The generosity of the community and their care for their neighbors defines this part of Virginia. Over the past 75 years, the United Way has harnessed these values and used them as a catalyst to improve the lives of people in the community. Around 1942, United Way organizations were founded in Staunton and Waynesboro. As these organizations continued to grow, in 2004 they merged to become the United Way of Greater Augusta, Inc. in order to offer more effective services to the community. This organization has long worked toward positive change in their community, and I am honored to pay tribute to the United Way of Greater Augusta, Inc. as they celebrate 75 years of service to the people of Staunton, Waynesboro, and Augusta County. Through grants, workplace campaigns, corporate partnerships, and individual donations, the United Way has raised funds to help make a positive impact in the community. They have helped families and individuals in the Greater Augusta region by providing support to local agencies like the Valley Children’s Advocacy Center, the Daily Living Center, Valley Hope Counseling Center, and Renewing Homes. The United Way has also made targeted investments in programs such as Stuff the Bus, the Financial Stability Center, and Imagination Library. The work of the United Way has evolved throughout its 75 year history, and I am confident that it will continue to do so to meet both the shortterm and longterm needs of those it serves in the Greater Augusta region. There are many people responsible for the continued growth and success of the United Way of Greater Augusta. Countless volunteers have donated their time to serve the community. Board Members have served as active voices in the community for the United Way’s work. Staff members have worked hard to promote the work of the United Way and make sure the wheels run smoothly on a daytoday basis. While I extend my gratitude to all of these individuals, I also want to specifically recognize Cynthia Pritchard for her service as President and CEO of the United Way of Greater Augusta. As she prepares to leave this position, it is clear that much of the good work of this organization would not have been possible without her guidance and leadership over the past seven and a half years. Congratulations to the United Way of Greater Augusta on this momentous occasion. I wish them all the best, and look forward to the positive impact they will continue to make. f 
IN RECOGNITION OF THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE SOUTHERN WAYNE COUNTY REGIONAL CHAMBER DURING ITS 50TH ANNIVERSARY 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Southern Wayne County Regional Chamber’s 50 Year Anniversary on the date of its Business to Business Exposition Best of Downriver Black Tie Event. The SWCRC has played a critical role in promoting business and economic development by providing training and leadership opportunities to the Downriver community. Since its founding in 1967, the SWCRC has helped the Downriver business community grow and prosper. The SWCRC today has over 650 members and provides them with a variety of networking, business development and education programs. The SWCRC gives emerging leaders in Southern Wayne County education and training through its Leadership 21 initiative, a six month program that gives individuals multidisciplinary training in the fields of economic development, government and healthcare. Additionally, the Chamber offers opportunities to network and meet other members of the business community, as well as promotional events and roundtables with leaders in a variety of fields. These services have allowed businesses to better serve the individuals in the Downriver area, have helped to improve the business climate in Southern Wayne County and have contributed to the economic revival of southeast Michigan. The SWCRC’s efforts have been instrumental in creating a strong business community that effectively serves the Downriver area. Its efforts have inspired a new generation of business leaders who are uniquely equipped to address the issues facing the community. It has also allowed organizations in the area to share best practices and better serve Downriver. I am proud to recognize the outstanding efforts of the SWCRC and its members, and it is my hope that they continue to make Southern Wayne County a great place to live and work in the coming years. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the Southern Wayne Regional Chamber and its 50 years of success. Its work on behalf of the Downriver community has played a key role in helping the area grow and develop while providing jobs and other opportunities. f 
RECOGNIZING THE 8TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE LILLY LEDBETTER FAIR PAY ACT 
Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, Sunday, our country recognizes the eighth anniversary of the landmark Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which former President Obama signed into law on January 29, 2009. Congress passed and President Obama signed this legislation into law, the first of his Administration, in response to the U.S. Supreme Court decision, Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 550 U.S. 618 (2007) , that severely restricted the time period for filing pay discrimination complaints against one’s employer. In the underlying case, Lilly Ledbetter, a production supervisor at the Goodyear Tire and Rubber plant in Gadsden, Alabama, discovered that she was being paid less than her male counterparts for nearly two decades. Then and there, she made the decision to fight back for paycheck equality. Unfortunately, the U.S. Supreme Court undercut her fight in ruling that Ledbetter could not bring a wage discrimination suit under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 simply because she did not file her claim within 180 days of a discriminatory salary decision. Despite the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling, Ledbetter’s fight was not in vain because Congress, in 2009, passed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which helps ensure fair pay for all Americans by expanding the time period in which employees may challenge an employer’s compensation decision. Because of this law, women today have the right to pursue legal action for pay discrimination—whenever it occurs. Unfortunately, equal pay for equal work has not become a reality. In 2015, the pay gap between men and women still remains, as women made only 83 cents for every dollar earned by their male counterparts. And for women of color, that gap is even wider. During the same time, AfricanAmerican women made 65 cents to every dollar earned by men. Hispanic women, faring even worse than black women, made only 58 cents to every dollar earned by their White male counterparts. Pay disparities not only affect women during their careers, but follows them into retirement, reducing pensions and Social Security benefits because of a lifetime of lower wages and less money to invest. This negative impact is lasting because it affects generations yet unborn. As we mark this anniversary, let us recommit ourselves to ending discrimination against women in all forms. 
In the 115th Congress, I will proudly join the Democratic Caucus in continuing the fight for equal pay for equal work, investment in employment opportunities for women, and raising the minimum wage. Because as we know, when ‘‘Women Succeed, America Succeeds.’’ 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the celebration of Mr. Leon A. Thompson’s 100th birthday. With nearly a century passing, Mr. Thompson has dedicated his life to his family, St. Mark’s the Evangelist Catholic Church, the City of New York, and giving back to his Harlem community. Mr. Thompson was born on January 28, 1917 in Washington, D.C. At 18 years old, Mr. Thompson and his three sisters moved to New York City where he has lived since. For 32 years, Mr. Thompson operated the Number 3 and other train lines comprising the original A Division of the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT). These lines later became incorporated into the modern day New York City Transportation Authority. As a subway motorman for over three decades, he contributed to an era of growth and modernization of a thriving, welcoming and inclusive New York City. Throughout his life, Mr. Thompson has dedicated all the time and effort he could exert for St. Mark’s the Evangelist Catholic Church in Harlem over the last 82 years. This makes him one of the longest practicing parishioners to the church and an indelible figure serving on many boards and ministries. Mr. Thompson has known and worked with every pastor in St. Mark’s the Evangelist Catholic Church during its 109year history. For a time, Mr. Thompson worked as an electrician at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. When his work day ended he spent his remaining time working to improve St. Mark’s the Evangelist Catholic Church installing a public announcement system, lighting system, and refurbishing the pews for the benefit of parishioners and students of St. Mark’s the Evangelist School whose space was shared. In his spare time, Mr. Thompson taught many young men in his church and community commercial, labor and vocational skills that they employed building and improving New York City. Mr. Thompson has dedicated his life to his fellow parishioners at St. Mark’s the Evangelist Catholic Church, his neighbors and residents of Harlem, and New York City for 82 years. His contributions to the Harlem community and New York City has made him a role model for all persons, regardless of creed or affiliation, as a public servant and exemplary citizen. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to have had the time to recognize and celebrate the tremendous life of Mr. Leon A. Thompson and his 100th birthday celebration. THE APOLLO 1 MEMORIAL ACT HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON 
Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce the ‘‘Apollo 1 Memorial Act’’. Today is the 50th Anniversary of the tragedy which claimed the lives of three brave American heroes. This piece of legislation is meant to honor their legacy and ensure we never forgot by creating a memorial for them in our national shrine for heroes, Arlington National Cemetery. On January 27, 1967, Astronauts Command Pilot Virgil I. ‘‘Gus’’ Grissom, Senior Pilot Edward H. White II, and Pilot Roger B. Chaffee were killed in an electrical fire that broke out inside their Apollo I Command Module on Launch Pad 34 at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. The accident led to a detailed internal investigation and congressional hearings. As a result of their sacrifice NASA made improvements and changes to the Apollo program which ultimately resulted in Apollo 11 landing on the moon two years later. Although all three astronauts were posthumously awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor, these three fearless astronauts who were set to be the first Americans into space under the Apollo program have not received a memorial at Arlington as was done for the Space Shuttle Challenger and Colum bia crews. This bill would redress that unfortunate omission which continues to be a burden on the hearts of those who loved them. Arlington National Cemetery is where we recognize heroes who have passed in the service of the Nation. It is fitting that on the 50th anniversary of the Apollo I accident we acknowledge these astronauts by building a memorial in their honor. This bill would direct the Secretary of the Army, in consultation with the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), to construct at an appropriate place in Arlington National Cemetery, a memorial marker honoring these three heroic men. In addition to $500,000 from the Army’s fiscal year 2017 operations and maintenance appropriated funds, the bill provides the NASA Administrator with the authority to accept donations of services, money, and property to help allay the cost of the memorial marker. In closing, Mr. Speaker, on the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 1 accident, we have the opportunity to honor these three brave men and their contribution to America’s preeminence in human spaceflight. It is time to build a memorial so that current and future Americans never forget their sacrifice. I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle can come together to support this legislation honoring these heroes. INTRODUCTION OF JOHN TANNER FAIRNESS AND INDEPENDENCE IN REDISTRICTING ACT HON. STEVE COHEN 
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the John Tanner Fairness and Independence in Redistricting Act, a bill I introduced earlier today. The President of the United States has said our elections are ‘‘rigged.’’ When it comes to the drawing of Congressional districts, he may well be right. In most states, districts are drawn by the state legislature, and as a result, whichever party controls the state legislature ends up drawing Congressional districts specifically designed to maximize the number of Congressional seats that party can win. In other words, the elected officials choose the voters, instead of the voters choosing the elected officials. If enacted, the John Tanner Fairness and Independence in Redistricting Act would fix this by requiring states to use bipartisan redistricting commissions to draw maps. No single party would get to control the process. Historically, both parties have engaged in gerrymandering to some extent or another. But that does not make it right. In a representative democracy, the people need to be able to freely and fairly choose their elected representatives. Unfortunately, that is not always happening. In 2012, Democrats received more than 1.1 million more votes across the country than Republicans for the House of Representatives, but because of the way the maps were drawn, Republicans won almost 54 percent of the House seats. In 2016, it has been estimated that Republicans won approximately 51 percent of the votes cast across the country for the House of Representatives, but won more than 55 percent of the House seats. This is not what the Founders envisioned. They designed the House of Representatives to be the Congressional chamber that most accurately reflects the views of the people. The failure of the House to more accurately reflect the will of the electorate is a formula for the electorate to lose faith in the institution. It makes people cynical and discourages them from participating. We can do better. A democracy is supposed to be a marketplace of ideas. The playing field is supposed to be fair and competitive, not gerrymandered and monopolized. I urge my colleagues to pass this bill, and help restore some much needed faith in Congress.
