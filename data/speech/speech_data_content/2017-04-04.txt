Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, there has been a lot going on around here lately. We have been conducting inves-tigations, holding hearings, and some of us have even tried and failed to fun-damentally change the way we provide health care in this country. It has been easy to get distracted by the dozens of different headlines and breaking news stories we see each week. But no matter what else is going on here in Washington, one thing con-tinues unabated: each day, the United States, like every other country on Earth, continues to release tons and tons of carbon dioxide into the atmos-phere, and now we are starting to see the effects. Over the last couple of years, the U.S. has joined 20 other countries from around the world in growing its econ-omy while reducing its annual emis-sions into the atmosphere. This is not a small feat, and decoupling emissions from growth is the first step toward the substantive action needed to ad-dress the growing climate crisis. But I find this concept of reducing emissions can sometimes be a little misleading. In the last few years, the U.S. has re-duced the rate that it emits greenhouse gases. But even if we are doing it more slowly, we are still emitting harmful pollution into our air. Imagine, Mr. Speaker, standing at the edge of an empty swimming pool with a garden hose. For a while, water was spewing out of that hose at a tor-rent; and each year, the volume got greater and greater. Now, the water is still running, but we have begun to turn the speed down. However, even if we manage to slow the rate of water going in, the pool still has more water than when we started and is still filling up. Our atmosphere is that pool. For nearly 100 years, it has been filling up with greenhouse gases. And they don’t just go away when the calendar flips. Reducing the annual emissions is vital, but we can’t lose track of all the gases that have been accumulated year after year. If we are going to hit the inter-national goal of limiting climate warming to 2 degrees Celsius, we need to start acting now. Yet, this august body has been behind the curve on this issue for years. Our colleagues seem content to ig-nore the climate crisis, to hold hear-ings with discredited, crank pseudoscientists bought and paid for by corporate interests, or to deny the value of scientific thinking altogether, an approach that is all too familiar given the post-research, post-intel-ligence, post-truth mindset that we have seen from this administration. They have adopted a ‘‘hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil’’ approach to cli-mate change, hoping they can ignore it until it goes away. Sadly, that is not the way the world works. We can’t unfill the pool by pre-tending there is no such thing as water. This form of denial has been evolving over time. First, we heard that there was no way that climate is changing at all. Now that the changes in the atmos-phere are beyond doubt, we are start-ing to hear that climate is changing but there is nothing we can do about it. In addition to being flat out false, that type of thinking is unbecoming of a na-tion that put the first man on the Moon, pioneered instantaneous com-munication, and has led the world in the fight against countless deadly dis-eases. Last month, we heard the Adminis-trator of the Environmental Protection Agency question the very fundamen-tals of atmospheric science, a particu-larly dismaying thing from the man charged with leading the fight against climate change. This type of willful scientific ignorance has serious con-sequences. It will cost lives. Children will be exposed to harmful, asthma-inducing pollution because we didn’t act fast enough to clean our air. They will die because crops that could be counted on for generations will no longer grow. They will be forced from their homes because melting polar ice is driving sea levels higher and higher. We cannot deny these impacts. We cannot continue to hear no evil and see no evil when these changes are hap-pening all around us, resulting in dev-astating consequences that affect every aspect of our life.

RECOGNIZING VICTORIA RIOS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. R
OS-LEHTINEN ) for 5 min-utes. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize an outstanding young lady from our south Florida community, Victoria Rios. Vicki is the winner of the 2016 Con-gressional App Challenge from my con-gressional district, and she is a re-markable senior high student at Gul-liver Preparatory. Her app, Simple Sign, was created out of the most noble and sincere de-sire to help those with hearing impair-ment, and her app was inspired by her special needs younger sister, Zoe. Simple Sign is an easy-to-use app that includes photos and videos that helps individuals easily and quickly learn sign language through a cell phone or tablet. The future of our great Nation relies on innovators from all backgrounds and walks of life in STEM careers, and I could not be more proud of Vicki choosing this extraordinary calling. I hope that this accomplishment will in-spire her classmates, friends, and other young women across south Florida to pursue a career in STEM fields. Congratulations, Victoria, and I can-not wait to see all of the amazing de-signs that you will create in the future. 
2017 AIDS WALK MIAMI  
Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage all of south Florida to participate in the 2017 AIDS Walk Miami on Sunday, April 23, at Soundscape Park located in my con-gressional district of Miami Beach. This 5K walk through the streets of beautiful South Beach seeks to cul-tivate a culture of awareness and pre-vention, as well as help provide serv-ices for the more than 15,000 individ-uals who have been impacted by HIV/ AIDS in our south Florida community. Since 1989, this AIDS walk has been one of Miami’s largest HIV/AIDS awareness charity event and continues to attract thousands of participants from all over the Nation who walk to-gether to raise funds to prevent new in-fections, maximize the health out-comes and quality of life of those in-fected, and ultimately end the HIV/ AIDS epidemic in south Florida. Unfortunately, last year, south Flor-ida led our Nation in AIDS-related deaths, and Miami was one of the Na-tion’s top HIV hotspots. This walk lends vital support to local groups and organizations, such as Care Resource and the Food for Life Net-work, that are working to transform the lives of patients and caregivers throughout our south Florida commu-nity. The Food for Life Network food bank provides and delivers groceries, meals, and nutritional education to men, women, and children living with HIV/ AIDS in Miami-Dade County. Since 1987, its staff and volunteers have pro-vided over 1.5 million meals and gro-ceries as well as other crucial services, such as free screening for sexually transmitted diseases, free medical and dental care, access to health and nutri-tion specialists, and so much more, Mr. Speaker. Care Resource is improving the health and quality of life of our diverse south Florida community, especially those impacted by HIV/AIDS, by pro-viding essential health services, such as pediatric and dental care, immuni-zations, HIV primary care, and more. It is because of the work and com-mitment of organizations like these that AIDS is no longer a death sen-tence and patients can live long and fulfilling lives. So, again, Mr. Speaker, I invite ev-eryone in south Florida to come out to the 2017 AIDS Walk Miami and help celebrate our great success against this disease and the great progress that we have achieved for the thousands living with HIV/AIDS in south Florida and to reaffirm our strong commitment to the work that is yet to be done. Together we can achieve the goal of an AIDS-free generation in the near fu-ture. COMMEMORATING THE WORK OF THE HUMANE  
SOCIETY  
Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate one of the Na-tion’s largest animal protection orga-nizations, The Humane Society of the United States. Each year, The Humane Society and its affiliates provide sanctuaries, vet-erinary programs, emergency shelters, and rescues to over 100,000 animals, leading in efforts to confront animal cruelty and providing care and services to many animals in need. In addition, The Humane Society works tirelessly to educate and advo-cate by providing essential training and services to local shelters and ani-mal groups lacking resources and through policy initiatives on both the State and national level. Animal welfare and wildlife con-servation are vital to our south Florida community. That is why, Mr. Speaker, I am so pleased to pay tribute to the outstanding commitment of all the volunteers of The Humane Society of the United States and wish all of them great success as we continue working together to combat animal cruelty and negligence to create a better world for all animals.

MILITARISM, MATERIALISM, AND RACISM The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. C
OHEN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, this is the 49th anniversary of the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Dr. King, Jr., was, sadly, struck down in Memphis, Tennessee, by an aberrant individual who wanted to kill him and chased him all over the country. It so happened that Memphis was the spot that he had that final opportunity. In Memphis, there will be activities today celebrating the life of Dr. King and commitments to community serv-ice in his spirit. Ironically, today, while it is the 49th anniversary of his assassination, it is also the 50th anniversary of his great-est speech, in my opinion. Not the ‘‘I’ve Been to the Mountaintop’’ speech that he made the night before in Mem-phis, the great speech where he said: I have been to the mountaintop, and I may not get there with you; but I want you to know tonight, that we, as a peo-ple, will get to the promised land. His greatest speech, in my opinion, was the speech at the Riverside Church in New York, in Manhattan, on April 4 of 1967, when he spoke of the three isms that bother this country and are the enemies of this country: militarism, materialism, and racism. The speech was called ‘‘Beyond Viet-nam.’’ A prescient Dr. King saw the need to get out of Vietnam, to make a unilateral step, cease the bombing, save lives. He was indeed right about that. We should have gotten out of Vietnam then, but we didn’t. It was months later that Richard Nixon interfered with the peace process for political reasons and got word to Vietnam not to participate; that they might get a better deal from Nixon; and that stopped President Johnson from possibly concluding the war in 1968. The racism, the militarism, and the materialism are still pervasive. Dr. King wouldn’t like what he sees today. We have a budget giving 56 or $57 bil-lion extra to the military and cutting away from diplomacy efforts, foreign aid efforts that militate against war. And it takes away from funding for people, African Americans and poor people in America, who need govern-ment assistance. That is part of what Dr. King was concerned about in this ‘‘Beyond Viet-nam’’ speech. And here it is 50 years later and we still suffer with the same tight budget and the same misguided priorities. We have an Attorney General who is looking at ending consent decrees on police violence against African Ameri-cans in Baltimore, Maryland, and also in Ferguson, a suburb of St. Louis, Mis-souri. We are going the wrong direction, and it is sad that one of our greatest prophets and one of our greatest lead-ers told us about it 50 years ago. Have we learned. The disparity in wealth is greater than ever in this country. The rich are getting richer and richer and richer. It is incomprehensible that there are bil-lionaires—and there are lots of them out there—and that the tax breaks that we offer in the Tax Code are going to give millionaires and billionaires hun-dreds of thousands and millions of dol-lars of tax breaks at the expense of

government programs for people who don’t have enough. There is no consideration of a min-imum wage. And Dr. King was strong on believing that if people worked a full-time job, they shouldn’t be paid a part-time wage. b1015 We need to go a lot further. We need to reflect on Dr. King’s Riverside speech and understand that it is still a guide for us, and we need to look at a more understanding budget that cares about people first and not the military industrial complex that President Ei-senhower warned us about; that we try to avoid wars through diplomacy and foreign aid and goodwill; and that we support our people with WIC programs and LIHEAP programs and Meals on Wheels and health care and public edu-cation; and that we try to give tax breaks to the middle class—large tax breaks, and not tax breaks to those who already have enough. Thank you, Dr. King. You served us well. We mourn your loss. We remem-ber your words.

CELEBRATING THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF WIC The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. T
HOMPSON ) for 5 minutes. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children—or WIC—is a short-term intervention program designed to help ensure pregnant women and their chil-dren are able to meet healthy nutri-tional needs. WIC began in 1972 as a supplemental food pilot program aimed at improving the health of pregnant mothers, in-fants, and children in response to a growing concern of malnutrition among low-income families. By 1974, WIC was operating in 45 States and be-came a permanent program in 1975. WIC provides participants with monthly benefits redeemable for spe-cific foods to supplement their diets, as well as related nutrition and health services. WIC provides quality nutri-tion education and services; breastfeeding promotion and edu-cation; a monthly food package; and access to maternal, prenatal, and pedi-atric healthcare services. WIC has served 8.3 million participants each month through 10,000 clinics nation-wide in 2014; 806,000 pregnant women; 592,000 breastfeeding women; 575,000 postpartum women; 2 million infants; and 4.3 million children. Mr. Speaker, numerous studies have shown that pregnant women who par-ticipate in WIC have longer preg-nancies, leading to fewer premature births. They have fewer low and very low birth weight babies. They experi-ence fewer fetal and infant deaths, and they seek prenatal care earlier in preg-nancy and consume more of key nutri-ents, such as iron, protein, calcium, vi-tamins A and C. WIC has been addressing the nutri-tion and health needs of low-income families for more than 40 years. I rise today as chairman of the Agriculture Subcommittee on Nutrition but also as someone who knows firsthand how im-portant WIC is for many Americans. In the early 1980s, when my wife, Penny, and I were just starting out, we were eligible for WIC based on our in-come. We used WIC to supplement our personal resources at the time to en-sure that Penny, who was expecting our first son, was healthy. Back then, WIC truly helped us supplement what we needed after our personal resources and the family assistance and support came into play. Nutrition influences health at every stage of life. Good nutrition during pregnancy is especially important to support fetal development and protect mothers from pregnancy-related risks of gestational diabetes, excessive weight gain, hypertension, and iron de-ficiency anemia. Good nutrition in early childhood can promote develop-ment and foster healthy behaviors that may carry over into adulthood. Mr. Speaker, the facts are clear: WIC works. Let’s ensure this program re-mains viable for generations to come. WIC truly provides a competitive edge that will give everyone a fair shot at life—a fair start in life, and the Amer-ican people deserve no less.

TRUMP’S GROWING LIST OF PER-SONAL AND BUSINESS ENTAN-GLEMENTS The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. N
EWHOUSE ). The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. K
APTUR ) for 5 minutes. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to President Trump’s ever-growing risk of personal and business entanglements. They call into question his ability to serve im-partially in the interests of the Amer-ican people. Both he and his adminis-tration remain closely linked to pri-vate companies and foreign entities whose interests are often in direct op-position to those of the United States. For example, we are well aware of the increasing boldness of the Chinese regime and its efforts to extend their economic and military influence. De-spite portraying China publicly as a threat to economic growth of the United States, the President has se-lected Goldman Sachs’ executive, Gary Cohn, to be his director of the National Economic Council. That is about one of seven individuals from Goldman Sachs who have been brought into this ad-ministration. Mr. Cohn has just sold his $16 million holding in a Chinese bank. This same state-owned Chinese bank also happens to be the largest tenant in Trump Tower in Manhattan. Isn’t that a coincidence? Wilbur Ross, President Trump’s choice for Commerce Secretary, pre-sents similar conflicts of interest. As a man who will play a major role in shaping U.S. trade policy, Mr. ROSS continues to hold a stake worth tens of millions of dollars in the international shipping company, Diamond S Ship-ping Group, a company that not only operates ships that fly the Chinese flag, but those ships also call on ports in countries, such as Iran and Sudan, that are under U.S. sanctions for being state sponsors of terrorism. We also know that The Trump Orga-nization was recently awarded sole rights to the President’s name for products sold in China. He had waited 10 years to get those rights. The case was settled just mere days after Presi-dent Trump’s phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping, when the Presi-dent reversed his prior stance on Chi-nese unification and gave a full- throated endorsement to what he termed ‘‘One China’’ policy. That was a reversal from what he had done just after the election. Meanwhile, according to The New York Times, President Trump’s son-in- law, Jared Kushner, was recently nego-tiating a real estate deal worth hun-dreds of millions of dollars with a Chi-nese company closely tied to its gov-ernment. And while it has been re-ported that the deal was called off, the fact that Mr. Kushner is continuing to negotiate private real estate deals while serving as a White House em-ployee is deeply troubling. It was announced last week that Ivanka Trump will now be joining her husband in the White House as an ad-viser to the President with top secret security clearance. While she has stepped down from her former role at her fashion licensing company that uses the Trump name, her decision to transfer her brand’s assets into a trust run by her own brother-in-law—and her arrangement to continue to receive fixed payments from the company—is a matter of serious concern given her role in the administration. The ever-growing list of valid con-cerns about the Trump administra-tion’s conflicting entanglements are taking place at the same time that the President is proposing $18 billion in re-ductions for the 2017 appropriations process—while he himself, his daugh-ter, son-in-law, and his Cabinet mem-bers continue to benefit off the Amer-ican taxpayer. While the President spends millions of tax dollars on securing his resi-dences in New York and in Florida and flying to his so-called southern White House almost every weekend, he is slashing to zero the Great Lakes Res-toration Initiative—an absolutely crit-ical program that directly impacts my district and many others responsible for preserving the world’s largest body of fresh water from serious and grow-ing environmental threats. What is right about that? President Trump also wants to elimi-nate TIGER grants, a highly successful transportation program that provides

funding for communities across Amer-ica with backlogged infrastructure projects that create jobs and produce robust economic benefits. Everyone agrees on that. He has also called for a nearly $3 bil-lion draconian reduction to foreign op-erations endangering our national se-curity. We are the leader of the free world the last time I looked, and, meanwhile, he and his family spend millions of American taxpayer dollars on travel and security costs for them-selves. With an investigation into President Trump’s possible entanglements with Putin’s Russia already underway, and members of the President’s family and administration engaging in increas-ingly brazen conflicts of interest, this Congress should pass legislation to pre-vent these increasingly apparent con-flicts of interest from endangering our Nation and the American people. It is only a matter of time before his con-flicts of interest harm our country. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-bers are reminded to refrain from en-gaging in personalities toward the President.

PLANNED PARENTHOOD V. WOMEN’S HEALTH CLINICS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. W
AGNER ) for 5 minutes. Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of life and in respect for the conscience rights of all citizens of this free Nation. I was proud to preside over the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives a few short weeks ago as we voted in favor of No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act to strike down an Obama administration policy that forces Americans to fund abortion providers. We also passed H.J. Res. 43, which is another step closer to restoring the rights of States to decide how to dis-tribute title X funding for women’s health care. The measures ensure that States are not forced to fund abortion providers like Planned Parenthood. Based on its own annual report, Planned Parenthood performs the most abortions in the United States. It com-mits more than 320,000 abortions every year, 887 each day. Mr. Speaker, that is one abortion every 97 seconds. Three unborn children’s lives will be taken by Planned Parenthood as I stand here this morning. Recently, Planned Parenthood has begun attacking me as a supposed enemy of women’s health care. Nothing could be further from the truth. All Missourians deserve quality health care, which is one reason I oppose tax-payer funding of Planned Parenthood. This organization does not provide gen-eral women’s health or mammogram screenings. That is a fallacy. In the State of Missouri, there are 12 Planned Parenthood facilities scat-tered across our 114 counties. However, Mr. Speaker, we are grateful to have 588 healthcare clinics that prioritize women’s health and wellness. That is 49 healthcare clinics for every 1 Planned Parenthood health center. So instead of driving 100 miles or more to a Planned Parenthood in Missouri, women can receive the quality care they need within their own commu-nities. Last Congress, I voted to increase funding to those very clinics by hun-dreds of millions of dollars. Congress has a sincere duty to not only defund big abortion but to radically change the conversation around life issues. Members of Congress and this admin-istration understand that life is beau-tiful, that children are a blessing, that abortion is not healthcare. It kills chil-dren, and it hurts women. Rest assured that our work to pro-tect life, all life, has only just begun. f 
HONORING SACRIFICES OF AFRI-CAN-AMERICAN WOMEN DURING WORLD WAR II The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California (Ms. L
EE) for 5 minutes. Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, each year dur-ing Women’s History Month, we pause to commemorate the contributions women have made to this country, but we should really commemorate women every day. So I am here today in April to amplify the contributions of women of color, particularly African-American women. Far too often, the blood, sweat, and tears sown by women of color goes unrecognized. So many are truly hid-den figures. Mr. Speaker, this morning, I want to honor the sacrifices African-American women made for this country during World War II. Sadly, to this day, their sacrifices have gone unacknowledged, and as the daughter of a World War II veteran and a Korean veteran, I am honored to shed light on a few of the tremendous contributions of African- American women during World War II. I want to rise to highlight the coura-geous efforts of more than 800 African- American women from the 6888th Cen-tral Postal Directory Battalion, which was the first all-women, all-Black unit deployed in World War II. The 6888th, its nickname ‘‘Six Triple Eight’’, was an all-women, all-Black unit that helped boost morale among Allied troops by working through major mail backlogs in Europe during World War II. b1030 To sort through the major backlog of mail in Europe, the women were di-vided into three subunits that allowed them to run the postal service 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, processing 65,000 pieces of mail per 8-hour shift. The battalion endured the harsh win-ter of Europe, dimly lit rooms, and rat- infested headquarters to carry out their mission. Adding insult to injury, these courageous women also faced seg-regation and discrimination from the very country they were working to de-fend. The women were forced to run their own mess halls, hair salon, re-freshment bar, and other facilities be-cause of segregationist Department of Defense policies. Yet despite the harsh conditions of war and unequal treatment, the women of the 6888th Battalion cleared a 6- month backlog of mail in just 3 months while posted in Britain. In France, they cleared a 3-year mail backlog in just 6 months. Thanks to their tireless efforts, United States soldiers were fi-nally able to receive lost letters from loved ones during the war. The courage exhibited by the 6888th proved once again that senseless acts of cruelty are no match for the will and determination of African-American women. But in July 1945, tragedy struck Pri-vate First Class Mary J. Barlow, Pri-vate First Class Mary H. Bankston, and Sergeant Dolores M. Browne, who lost their lives in a Jeep accident. Recog-nizing their fellow comrades’ sac-rifices, the women of the 6888th pooled their personal resources to properly bury these women. These women who tragically lost their lives while serving in Europe are buried at the Normandy American Cemetery, which I was privi-leged to visit a couple of years ago. Their contributions and sacrifices de-serve to be celebrated. These Black women proudly sacrificed their lives for a country that did not value them due to racial discrimination and big-otry. So it is with great pride that I speak their names today, hoping that more people will come to acknowledge their sacrifice and the sacrifices of their fellow sisters during World War II. I want to thank our Military Con-struction, Veteran Affairs Appropria-tions Chair Congressman C
HARLIE  D
ENT, then-Ranking Member S ANFORD  B
ISHOP , as well as our full committee Chair R
OGERS and Ranking Member L
OWEY for their support in the Appro-priations Committee to help us un-cover this great history, and also the American Battle Monuments Commis-sion. These great sheroes need to be brought to the attention of the Amer-ican people so that they can properly be recognized for their sacrifices and their legacies. It is my hope that the United States will no longer be shy about recognizing the value, accomplishments, and sac-rifices of Black women in history. I am hopeful that we will come to know the many nameless sheroes of the Black community. These hidden figures have fought many battles, have sacrificed so much, and have paved the way for Black women to move forward in spite of the barriers which we are still trying to break. On today, Equal Pay Day, I am re-minded that African-American women earn 63 cents on the dollar. We are still at the bottom of the economic ladder. I urge my colleagues to fight for pay

A TRIBUTE FOR ROBERT ‘‘BOB’’ RAWLINGS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. T
IPTON ) for 5 minutes. Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the life of Robert ‘‘Bob’’ Rawlings of Pueblo, Colorado. Bob passed away at the age of 92, on March 24, 2017. Born in 1924, Bob graduated from Bent High School in 1942. He imme-diately pursued a college education at Colorado College in Colorado Springs, but, ultimately, he decided to enlist in the Navy that same year. Bob received a commission from the University of Colorado Boulder in 1943 and served honorably as the executive officer of subchaser 648 in the Pacific campaign of World War II. Bob was part of an effort to liberate over 100 British and Dutch prisoners of war dur-ing his time in service. After receiving an honorable dis-charge from the Navy in 1946, Bob re-turned to school at Colorado College and earned his bachelor’s degree in eco-nomics in 1947. Bob took a job as a re-porter at the Pueblo Chieftain, the place he would work for the next seven decades, ultimately climbing the lad-der to serve as chairman and as editor of the paper. Bob always championed his home-town and used his career with the Chieftain as a platform to advocate his passion for Pueblo and for the sur-rounding region. A vocal supporter of protecting Pueblo’s resources, Bob spent 70 years delivering news to the people of southern Colorado. His char-acter and his life’s work represent the very best of Pueblo and the entire State of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, Bob Rawlings served his community as a philanthropist, a jour-nalist, a sailor, and as a family man. Although Bob referred to himself as the world’s worst golfer, Bob will be re-membered by so many in his hometown as one of its best citizens. While I am saddened by his death, I am honored to have known Bob. His presence will be missed by so many, but his impact in the community, how-ever, will be remembered forever.

SPEAKING FOR EQUAL PAY DAY The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. C
LARKE ) for 5 minutes. Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of women and men of New York’s Ninth Congressional District on this, the an-niversary of the signing of the Equal Pay Act by President John F. Kennedy. It has been 54 years since the Equal Pay Act was signed into law, yet women in the United States who work full-time, year-round, on average still only earn 80 cents for every dollar earned by men. This amounts to a yearly gap of $10,470 between full-time working men and women. For African-American women like myself, the pay gap is even larger. Afri-can-American women working full- time, year-round, on average still only earn 63 cents for every dollar earned by White, non-Hispanic men. In my own district, in Brooklyn, men earn $49,691, while women earn only $42,487. Mr. Speaker, that is just not acceptable. On Equal Pay Day 2017, we are call-ing upon Congressional Republicans to work with Democrats in getting the long overdue Paycheck Fairness Act enacted into law. Pay inequity not only affects women, it affects children and families and our national economy as a whole. That is because so many women in our country are the sole or co-bread winner in two- thirds of families with children. Fami-lies increasingly rely on women’s wages to help make ends meet, and with less take-home pay, women have less for the everyday needs of their families: groceries, mortgages, rent, child care, and doctor visits. President Barack Obama signed sev-eral orders to address gaps in Federal equal pay protections, protecting seg-ments of the civilian workforce from pay discrimination, despite congres-sional gridlock. Rather than working with Democrats to promote equal pay, House Republicans have voted nine times since 2013 to block the Paycheck Fairness Act from being considered on the House floor. So let’s see whether Donald Trump, who claims he respects women more than anyone else, demonstrates through his deeds in real and sub-stantive plans to do more to help work-ing women and their families. Mr. Trump, it is time to put the money where your mouth is. f 
THE REMARKABLE LIFE OF EDNA YODER The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Y
ODER ) for 5 minutes. Mr. YODER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to honor the life and legacy of a Kansas pioneer woman. Last week I joined my family in Yoder, Kansas, to celebrate the life and legacy of my grandma, Edna Yoder, who recently passed at the age of 105 years old. I was very close to my grandma, as many of us are to our grandparents. She was a sweet and kind woman who could tell a good story, never met a stranger, and had an infectious laugh. I spent much of my childhood listening to her hum church hymns while cook-ing a country meal or quilting another masterpiece. As one of 14 children, born in 1911, she grew up in another era, attending school in a one-room schoolhouse, a time without cell phones or television or even electricity and the other mod-ern conveniences we take for granted today. Yet somehow she survived and had a remarkable life. She saw hard times from the Dust Bowl to the Great Depression to countless world events over the past century. When she was born, women didn’t have the right to vote in America; but even well past turning 100 years old, she was voting in local elections, even for President of the United States. She saw a lot of Presidents come and go— 19, as a matter of fact. She saw America progress from a country really still recovering from the deep wounds of our Civil War to the world’s most indispensable, vital, and vibrant nation. She saw us defeat Hit-ler in Nazi Germany. She saw us bring freedom and peace around the globe to men, women, and children who had never experienced it before. She was born less than 10 years after Orville and Wilbur Wright took off on their first flight at Kitty Hawk, and yet she would watch Neil Armstrong set foot on the Moon while she was just in her fifties. But as the world changed around her, she quietly lived her entire life near Yoder, Kansas, where she raised her children on the same farm that I grew up on. She worked tirelessly on that farm, milking cows at dawn and bringing in the Kansas wheat harvest in the hot sun. She didn’t ask for much: food on the table, a roof over her head, and a better life for her children and grand-children. Mr. Speaker, we like to call them the Greatest Generation. She was a living embodiment of the values that help make America the greatest country in the world. She was guided every day by her faith in God, and she was truly blessed with more than a century of good health and good spirits in return. She loved her family and deeply be-lieved in hard work and self-determina-tion. She and her husband, Orie, were mar-ried for 49 years, and together they raised their four children and nine grandchildren, and they even watched one of them make it all the way from that farm in Yoder, Kansas, to the United States House of Representatives here in Washington, D.C. Family al-ways came first for her. In her later years, she passed the time reading her Bible, playing in the bell choir, and, of course, quilting and playing lots of games. In fact, the last time I saw her recently, we played bingo together, and we wiped out the competition at her retirement home one last time. She was sharp into her final hours. She was born into a home that did not have a telephone, but in her final days, we were also able to commu-nicate from Kansas to Washington via FaceTime so I would have a chance to speak with her. We recently had her services at the Yoder Mennonite Church, built just

after she born. This was the church she was raised in, was baptized in, was married in, and the church in which we laid her to eternal rest. From 1911 to 2017, what a ride, what a remarkable life and unforgettable woman. Through it all, she stayed true to what was important to her and what makes America such a strong nation: her faith, her family, and her Kansas prairie values. Grandma, we were so blessed to have so many years with you. You lived an amazing 105 years. I think if we look closely and we listen closely, you gave us a roadmap for a long and happy life. As you pass on to eternal life, please know that you are an inspiration to all of us every day. May you rest in peace, Grandma. Mr. Speaker, may you and my col-leagues in this body join me in keeping her in your prayers.

PRAYER The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: Dear God, we give You thanks for giving us another day. Bless abundantly the Members of this people’s House. During this season of new growth, may Your redemptive power help them to see new ways to productive service, fresh approaches to understanding each other, especially those across the aisle, and renewed commitment to solving the problems facing our Nation. The disagreements on the Hill are profound. Send Your spirit of hope and goodwill upon those who are struggling through current, contentious issues. May all Members, and may we all, be transformed by Your grace and better reflect the sense of wonder, even joy at the opportunities to serve that are ever before us. May all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory. Amen.

THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER. The Chair has exam-ined the Journal of the last day’s pro-ceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Jour-nal stands approved. PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER. Will the gentle-woman from North Carolina (Ms. ADAMS ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Ms. ADAMS led the Pledge of Alle-giance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Repub-lic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. KINZINGER. Mr. Speaker, we woke up this morning to yet more hor-rific images of dozens of people killed by another chemical weapons attack in Syria. Mr. Speaker, this included children who were gasping for their last breath as they perished because of the brutal, murderous dictator Bashar al-Assad, who decided that chemical weapons would be used to extinguish their life. Mr. Speaker, for 6 years, we have failed in the Western world to address this horrific act. In fact, for the first time since World War II, we are accept-ing the use of chemical weapons as just a normal part of everyday life. Mr. Speaker, the Western world, the free world, needs to stand up, needs to make clear that Assad needs to go, and needs to stand up for humanity, lest we see these images again. We wonder how to defeat terrorism. Mr. Speaker, you do it by denying ter-rorists the recruits of the next genera-tion, of which Bashar al-Assad is cre-ating many.

HAWAII’S PUBLIC SAFETY DIS-PATCHERS AND RADIO TECHNI-CIANS (Ms. GABBARD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, I would like to extend a warm mahalo to Ha-waii’s public safety dispatchers and radio technicians who provide an essen-tial service to our community. These hardworking men and women process more than 1.4 million 911 calls each year in Hawaii and are literally the first line of response in an emer-gency situation. Their ability to relay accurate and up-to-date information is essential to the success of our police officers, firefighters, paramedics, and to the safety of those in desperate need of help. Last year, Hawaii’s public safety telecommunicators helped our State become one of the very first in the Na-tion to implement a text-to-911 pro-gram that is helping to close the gap in emergency response. This program ad-dresses a very real need for situations where you may have a home invasion or domestic violence scenario where making a phone call to 911 safely is simply not possible. Mahalo to our telecommunicators for leading the way on this initiative and for your work every single day on be-half of Hawaii’s people. f 
MOMENT OF SILENCE HONORING DONALD BURGETT (Mr. BISHOP of Michigan asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speak-er, I rise today to honor the memory of World War II veteran, noted author, and longtime Eighth Congressional District resident Donald Burgett, who recently passed away at the age of 81. Don was an Army paratrooper, and he participated in the opening oper-ations of the Normandy invasion with A Company, 506th Parachute Infantry of the 101st Airborne Division. After his service, Mr. Burgett pub-lished four books, including ‘‘Currahee!’’ published in 1967 and en-dorsed by President Dwight D. Eisen-hower. Mr. Burgett used his photo-graphic memory to paint vivid scenes during the chaos of war. In addition to his writing, he also was an active member of several vet-erans organizations, including the VFW, American Legion, Disabled American Veterans, and the Military Order of the Cooties. He was a local builder and loved spending time out-doors. Don is survived by his wife, Twyla, his 5 children, 12 grandchildren, and 28 great-grandchildren. A memorial is being held for him this week in his honor in his hometown of Howell, Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I ask for a moment of silence for this great American patriot. May God bless Don and his family.

OUR DEMOCRACY UNDER ATTACK (Ms. KELLY of Illinois asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, it pains me to come to this Chamber this morning to say that nothing was done as our democracy came under at-tack. We know Russia intervened in our Presidential election. This was not done in the interest of the people, by the people, or for the people of Amer-ica. It was done to make America a ve-hicle for Russian interests. You know that, in 2016, President Trump said he hoped Russia would hack our former Secretary of State’s emails. You know General Michael Flynn was forced to resign due to his

unreported contact with Russian agents, who he also had business ties to. Yesterday, you learned that the President had a contractor meet with Russian officials on his behalf to have a back channel to the Kremlin. Where is the transparency from the White House? How is it that Meals on Wheels is the enemy, but you turn a blind eye to an attack on democracy by Vladimir Putin? Russian spies have long attacked American businesses. Now they are at-tacking our freedom. You must inves-tigate the Russian grip on our govern-ment. We must investigate swiftly and seriously. Mr. Speaker, this is on your watch. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. P
OE of Texas). Members are reminded to ad-dress their remarks to the Chair.

CELEBRATING THE MASTERS (Mr. ALLEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, as you know, I have the honor of representing the 12th Congressional District of Georgia and the good people who live and work there. This week, thousands will gather in Augusta to take part in a tradition un-like any other. Beginning in 1934, the Masters, hosted by the Augusta National Golf Club, has become the most prestigious golf tournament in the world. Known for its lightning-fast greens and gor-geous azaleas, this tournament cap-tivates the world for both the talent of those playing and its beauty. Since its inception, many legends have con-quered the greens to prove their skill and earn the coveted green jacket. This year will be a little somber, as we will deeply miss another of the great legends, four-time Masters cham-pion Arnold Palmer. His presence will certainly be missed on that first tee as an honorary starter and throughout this great week. I wish the best to all those competing in this truly remarkable event and in-vite those who are traveling from far and wide to experience and enjoy the wonderful hospitality of the 12th Con-gressional District of Georgia and my home, Augusta. 
f 
REJECT THE NEW HEALTHCARE BILL (Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, word coming out of the White House and House Republicans is that there is a new healthcare bill, and this bill would obliterate the patient pro-tections for preexisting conditions and eviscerate essential benefits and cost controls. Under the new healthcare scam, in-surance companies could opt out of all consumer protections. In other words, insurance companies could write fake policies with big premiums and little or no coverage. Mr. Speaker, under this plan, a par-ent of a kid who is struck with child-hood cancer could still buy a policy, but the policy is worthless because the policy would not have to cover their children’s cancer treatment. This is how House Republicans and the insurance lobby plan to get out from under their obligation to cover preexisting conditions. This means more power for the insur-ance companies and less protection for good people, the American people, who play by the rules. This plan should be rejected again. It is deceitful, cold, cruel, and wrong. f 
GORDIAN KNOT (Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight legislation I re-cently introduced, the VA GORDIAN KNOT Act, which would help improve and reform the Department of Veterans Affairs. In Greek mythology, the Gordian knot represents a complex problem that needs out-of-the-box thinking to solve, and that is exactly what we need. The VA’s Gordian knot is its re-peated manipulation of key data and overall lack of accountability. The VA has been known to yield less-than- truthful information when it comes to collecting and reporting data about pa-tient care, appointment wait times, and employee hiring and firing prac-tices. This behavior is an erosion of public trust and a disservice to our Nation’s veterans, our true heroes. It also makes it difficult to properly address the VA’s shortcomings and enhance its successes because there are successes as well. The VA GORDIAN KNOT Act re-quires the VA to standardize its data collecting and reporting mechanisms and increases oversight of the integrity and accuracy of the information. I believe this bill is absolutely nec-essary to reform the VA and assist in its mission to care for our true Amer-ican heroes. 
f 
EQUAL PAY DAY (Ms. ADAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, it is Equal Pay Day. I rise to support not only women but the American family and the economy. Women drive our economy. We buy more goods. We own more small busi-nesses, and we earn more degrees. De-spite this, we still earn less than men. This should embarrass every lawmaker in this Chamber and every person lis-tening. In 2017, Mr. Speaker, how can we jus-tify underpaying women across this Nation? Women still earn 20 percent less than their male counterparts, and it is even worse for Black and Hispanic women. Shortchanging women shortchanges our children and our economy. When women succeed, we all succeed. Women and our families demand paycheck fair-ness. We stand boldly united today em-bracing the words of Florynce Kennedy who said: We won’t agonize. We will or-ganize. We will show up and cut up until Molly earns the same pay as Billy. As Susan B. Anthony said: ‘‘Men, their rights and nothing more. Women, their rights and nothing less.’’ I urge you to call your Representa-tives, demand that we support you by supporting the Paycheck Fairness Act. f 
RECOGNIZING SERVICE ACADEMY APPOINTEES (Mr. DUNN asked and was given per-mission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize three outstanding young people from Florida’s Second Congres-sional District who will be continuing their education serving our country next year at the Naval Academy and at West Point. Sean Moriarty and Zachary Moser will be attending the United States Naval Academy. Sean plays football at Arnold High School, and Zac is on the swim team at Rutherford High School. Shane Ferry will be attending the United States Military Academy, West Point. He attends Mosley High School and is a member of the wrestling team. The bar is high and the competition is stiff to earn entry into our service academies, and it should be. I am con-fident that each of these young men possess the character, ability, and de-termination to excel at Annapolis and West Point and to earn the privilege to do extraordinary things for our Nation and for those who they will one day command. As they join their Federal fellow ca-dets and midshipmen, they also have our support and our gratitude for choosing this life of service. Thank you and good luck.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH2640 April 4, 2017 
By working hand in glove with the White House around an investigation that centers on the President and his administration, the chairman has blown the integrity of this investiga-tion. Through his actions, he has shown he cannot lead an impartial in-vestigation. His actions demonstrate why Congress must establish a bipar-tisan, independent commission to in-vestigate President Trump’s political and personal business ties to Russia. The majority of the American people favor an independent commission, out-side of Congress, according to polling done by the Associated Press. This is a serious matter. Our democracy is at stake. Our national security is at stake. Congress must call a bipartisan, inde-pendent commission to investigate these troubling connections between President Trump and Russia.

HONORING STEPHEN P. COUNIHAN (Mr. MEEHAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of Stephen P. Counihan, and I rise with my colleagues all around the greater Boston area, as we seek to raise the spirits of Stephen, who is cur-rently battling cancer. ‘‘Couhni,’’ as he is affectionately known, is currently the tennis coach at Suffolk University, where he has led four championship teams to great renown in the greater Boston area. But it was in the 1970s, as a standout defenseman at Bowdoin Col-lege where Counihan got the name ‘‘Couhni-Orr’’ because of his remark-able presence on the ice and his cool capacity under pressure. Now, Stephen is facing one of the great challenges of his life, as he deals not only with the chemotherapy, but the potential surgery that we are look-ing at in the month of April ahead. Couhni, I want you to know that all of your colleagues from Beta Theta Pi, from Bowdoin College hockey team, from the greater Bowdoin community, in fact, the entire Boston area, stand with you today. Win one more cham-pionship for us, Couhni, so we can all celebrate together when we have you back collectively.

UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA: NCAA CHAMPIONS (Mr. PRICE of North Carolina asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill’s men’s basketball team for winning the 2017 NCAA Division I Na-tional Championship, in the face of a spirited challenge from Gonzaga Uni-versity. As a proud alumnus of UNC-Chapel Hill, the Nation’s first public univer-sity, I was delighted to cheer on the en-tire team—players, coaches, and staff— during their outstanding performance yesterday in the Nation’s most com-petitive and most popular collegiate athletic tournament. The Tar Heels have now played in a record 20 NCAA Final Four games, the most of all time, and last night marked their sixth NCAA National Champion-ship and seventh overall National Championship. The years 1957, 1982, 1993, 2005, and 2009 are seared in the minds of North Carolina basketball fans, and I know I speak for our entire State when I say how delighted we are to add 2017 to that list! The teamwork, camaraderie, and de-termination of this year’s team were evident throughout the entire season as they struggled to overcome their heartbreaking defeat in the last sec-onds of the 2016 National Championship game. While their tournament finishes may have been a little closer than we wished, the team managed six wins against a formidable slate of oppo-nents. These 15 young men played hard, played smart, and played together. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  the names of the players, coaches, and staff.

THANKING SNAPa (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to ad-dress the House for 1 minute and to re-vise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, this afternoon I will meet with leaders from the School Nutrition Association of Pennsylvania, com-monly called SNAPa, which is a state-wide organization of school nutrition professionals. SNAPa works to advance quality child nutrition programs through edu-cation and advocacy. Organized in 1955, SNAPa is an all-volunteer board of di-rectors elected by its member, which currently stands at more than 2,300 in-dividuals. As chairman of the Agriculture Sub-committee on Nutrition and a senior member of the House Education and the Workforce Committee, I know the essential services that SNAPa works to provide. Students throughout the Com-monwealth receive high-quality, low- cost meals thanks to SNAPa. Mr. Speaker, it is important to re-member that, for some students, the only meal that they receive is at school. This organization works to keep our children healthy and ensure that they have healthy food options through school meal programs. SNAPa is recognized as the authority on school nutrition in Pennsylvania. I sincerely thank SNAPa for advanc-ing the availability, quality, and ac-ceptance of school nutrition programs as an essential part of education in Pennsylvania for more than 60 years. f 
RECOGNIZING THE ACHIEVEMENT OF HENRY HALGREN (Mr. POLIS asked and was given per-mission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise today to recognize the achievement of Henry Halgren from Fort Collins, Colorado. Henry is a sixth grader at Liberty Common School, a middle school, a public charter school that is very high-performing in my dis-trict. He is the victor from all of Colo-rado in the National Geographic Bee this last week. He competed against over 100 kids at the University of Denver, and he was able to answer as a sixth grader the fol-lowing question: Altamira Cave, known for its prehistoric paintings, is found in the province of Cantabria in the north part of what European country? Henry knew that the answer was Spain. He got it right. He won a $30,000 scholarship to CU, some prize money, and an atlas. I am proud to say he will be coming here to Washington, D.C., to represent the Second Congressional District of Colorado in May. And if he is able to win against the competitors from other States, the prize for that is a $50,000 scholarship and a family tour to the Galapagos Islands. Congratulations not only to Henry, but to all the participants who showed such a keen interest in learning about the world around them and about our planet. Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate Henry and his family and everybody who participates in furthering the knowledge about geography.

These children make sac-rifices—relocations, new schools, and the absence of a parent on deploy-ment—and they deserve our gratitude. Due to the unique circumstances the children are put under, I stand before you today to commend the children of those currently serving in my district at Fort Riley in Kansas, and the chil-dren of those serving around the Na-tion.

CONGRATULATIONS TO READING RED KNIGHTS’ VICTORY (Mr. SMUCKER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Reading High School men’s basketball team on their first State championship in school history. The Red Knights fin-ished their historic season with a 30–3 record, and beat Pine-Richland 64–60 in the Class 6A Boys Final to bring a championship to the city of Reading. This is a group of outstanding young men led by senior guard and McDon-ald’s All-American Lonnie Walker. This team is a staple in the Berks County community. Lonnie may have said it best himself after the championship victory: ‘‘What we did wasn’t even about Reading High basketball. It was about the city of Reading. It was about the community, all the schools, the young kids we in-spired. This is for them.’’ I couldn’t be more proud today to represent these young men. I look for-ward to the continued success of this team, and I look forward to watching Lonnie continue his basketball career at the University of Miami. Congratulations to the Reading Red Knights team, the coaches, their fami-lies, the faculty, staff, and students that made this championship possible.

AMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize that on this day, April 4, 49 years ago, Martin Luther King, Jr., was assassinated on a hotel balcony in Memphis, Tennessee. We all know the story: the most prominent civil rights activist in the sixties, if not of our entire Nation’s history, was shot dead in cold blood at the still very young age of 39 years old. It is a tragic tale of a man who had ac-complished much and still had more to accomplish, but we should note this day as remembrance to honor the sac-rifice he risked and he made during a very difficult time in our Nation’s his-tory. He demonstrated to the world that it was not the color of a person’s skin that we should be judged, but by the nature of their character. He led by ex-ample in an era of violence that vio-lence was not the answer. The peaceful protests he organized were an illustration of how to go about achieving social change in America, building bridges of understanding. The image of the Selma bridge comes to mind. His strong Christian beliefs helped him to see what many others could not, and opened the doors for millions to follow in his path. Mr. King’s work is not done. It is very saddening to still see so many in racial strife in these days in our Na-tion, but he showed the right way to lead, the right way to peacefully pro-test, and the right way to inspire to fulfill his famous dream. f

OLIS), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unani-mous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Colorado? There was no objection. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the under-lying legislation. Americans have al-ways been a people known for taking ownership. We take ownership of our lives and livelihoods, working hard to provide for our families. We take own-ership in our communities, setting standards of conduct. We take owner-ship in all our political process, voting for the right candidates. We have even taken ownership in our world, fighting evil actors and regimes to maintain peace. b1230 H.R. 1343, the bill we are discussing today, allows employees to take owner-ship in their companies. This is the American way. Under SEC rule 701, private compa-nies can offer their own securities to employees, enabling those employees to take a stake in the company. This is a great deal for both businessowners and employees. I doubt either side of the aisle would disagree. Rule 701 allows employers to better recruit talented employees and pay them without having to borrow money or sell securities. For some companies, especially younger ones, compensating employees through equity is vital for survival. These younger companies need the top talent but often can’t pay the top salaries. Rule 701 allows them to offer potential recruits a tradeoff: accept a lower salary now for more equity in the company later. By giving the employees a stake in the company, businessowners reward the employees for their continued hard

work and innovation. Workers have an opportunity to buy into the mission and future of the company. They have the opportunity to reap what they sow, making their work more meaningful and fulfilling. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1343 simply raises the reporting threshold for companies who issue securities to their employees as compensatory benefits. Right now, any company that issues more than $5 million of securities in a yearlong pe-riod faces significant reporting require-ments, including financial statements and disclosure of risk factors. These re-quirements cost small businesses time and money, making them less likely to issue stock as compensation for their employees. That is why this legislation moves the threshold up to $10 million. The original $5 million threshold was added to rule 701 in 1999 and hasn’t been updated since. By easing the threshold and indexing it to inflation every 5 years, we allow companies to increase the amount of stock they offer to employees. Additionally, raising the threshold will prevent private compa-nies from having to disclose confiden-tial financial information. America is known for taking owner-ship, but we are also known for innova-tion. Our technology industry, espe-cially, has propelled our economy and quality of life forward. But so many great tech companies started as small startups, struggling along from month to month before the financial rewards of their hard work could be achieved. Thinking about the young companies right now that have grand innovative visions for improving our quality of life, this legislation will help them thrive. The employees already pour so much of their livelihoods into the ven-ture. This bill will reward those work-ers with equity so that their persever-ance and investment will pay off. Mr. Speaker, before I close, I would like to discuss the broad support for this bill. I indicated earlier that both sides of the aisle can support this legis-lation, and I want to highlight that bi-partisan support for the bill. H.R. 1343 has equal numbers of Re-publican and Democratic sponsors. Further, the bill passed out of the Fi-nancial Services Committee 48–11. A majority of the Democrats on the com-mittee supported the bill. A similar bill passed with a bipartisan vote last Congress, with more than two dozen Democrats joining Republicans to pass the bill. And in the Senate, this same basic proposal passed the Senate Bank-ing Committee by a voice vote just a few weeks ago. Mr. Speaker, it is clear to see why this proposal is generating so much bi-partisan support. With a higher thresh-old, companies can focus their time on innovating and creating jobs instead of filling out paperwork. Employees, meanwhile, can take a stake in their company and their own future. I urge my colleagues to vote for this impor-tant rule and the underlying legisla-tion. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the cus-tomary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule, one that provides for consid-eration of H.R. 1343, the Encouraging Employee Ownership Act. I strongly support the underlying legislation. I wish it had been brought forward to the floor under an open rule that allowed Democrats and Repub-licans to freely offer amendments that could be adopted by a simple majority vote. Before we get to the specifics of the bill, I want to talk about the impor-tance of employee ownership. I join my friend and colleague from my neigh-boring district in Colorado in extolling the virtues of employee stock owner-ship, of ensuring that employees in the company are stakeholders and able to benefit from the value that is being created. You know, we have different stake-holders in our economy, and when you look at a company, you have different stakeholders that that company is re-sponsible to and caters to: You have the shareholders, you have the employ-ees, and you have the customers. In running a company, as I have done, it is always a constant balancing act to make sure that you are able to satisfy the legitimate demands of all those various stakeholders. Now, one of the things that has been out of whack in our economy the last few decades is that a disproportionate share of the value creation has gone to the shareholders and the customers, often to the detriment of the employ-ees. Now, everybody has benefited as con-sumers and as customers with revolu-tions in prices and consumer tech-nology. It is so exciting to see people, you know, where a flat screen tele-vision used to be out of reach, you now see them in nearly every home; and, in many cases, they cost less than a tele-vision would have cost that was signifi-cantly smaller 10 years ago—not to mention the remarkable mobile com-puting devices that middle class fami-lies and working families carry in their pockets with them that contains more processing power than a $3,000 com-puter did just a decade ago. Consumers have benefited and share-holders have benefited. There has been an unprecedented increase in private equity markets, in stocks, a huge amount of value creation in the Amer-ican economy, both on the balance sheet as well as in the market valu-ation of companies. Now, the issue is that, while all of this has happened, wages have largely stagnated. A lot of the increases in effi-ciency and economic growth have gone to benefit consumers and shareholders. Employees and workers have felt, le-gitimately so, that they haven’t seen their share of value creation. Now, there are a number of reasons for that. One of those has been the weakening of the union movement that gave workers a collective voice. But if you look at what some of the remedies are, really none can make a bigger im-pact than employee stock ownership. This bill doesn’t change the ball on that. It is a positive step. There are a lot of other ideas that I hope we can talk about in a bipartisan way. Fundamentally, we need to create an economy that works for everyone, one in which employees and workers can directly benefit from the increase in value of the firm that they helped create. And what better way to do that than employee stock ownership in a va-riety of models and options for that. This bill deals with one; but we have ESOPs, we have co-ops, we have em-ployee stock option plans, to name a few. Companies find that it is in their in-terest to help improve morale and maintain a stable employee base to align the incentives of employees with shareholders and, of course, to help align the success of our economy with the success of all the stakeholders in our economy. H.R. 1343 is a bipartisan bill. It was passed last year; it will pass again overwhelmingly this year. It sends a strong statement that Democrats and Republicans in the House of Represent-atives want to make employee stock ownership easier. Hopefully, this is a starting point rather than an ending point. The two other bills the Chamber is considering are also bipartisan, and I am hopeful that they can move forward expeditiously. Now, that stands in stark contrast to some of the other actions of this Cham-ber, for instance, the 15 Congressional Review Act resolutions which simply sought to undo some of the positive steps that President Obama took rath-er than put forward a proactive agenda of where Republicans actually want to lead the Nation. We also spent countless hours debat-ing healthcare legislation that, thank-fully, didn’t go anywhere because it would have left 24 million Americans without health insurance and increased premiums by 15 to 20 percent for those who were lucky enough not to lose their insurance altogether. I am glad that we have been able to move past that towards a more bipar-tisan discussion here that will fun-damentally help American innovators and entrepreneurs and help lead to a fair economy that works better for ev-erybody, that shows that Democrats and Republicans can work together to create a real solution that addresses a real problem and takes a first step to-wards creating an economy that works for workers, consumers, and share-holders. I am hopeful that we can continue this trend after the district work pe-riod and move forward on bipartisan legislation that will simplify our com-plex Tax Code and realign incentives in

a positive way, fix our broken immi-gration system, and make sure that we have the infrastructure we need for our country to succeed in the 21st century. I hope that my colleagues are encour-aged by the strong bipartisan show of support for H.R. 1343 and we can work together to bring more bipartisan leg-islation to the floor instead of divisive bills that make problems even larger. This bill, very simply, updates an SEC rule from 1999 that will allow pri-vate companies to offer employees a greater stake in the place they work without requiring additional paper-work or regulation—a simple and good idea. Currently, a private company that offers over $5 million in securities through compensation for employees is required to provide additional disclo-sures which can, A, often serve as a detriment to going over the $5 million in compensatory stock for their em-ployees, and, B, take up costs, adminis-trative overhead, should they choose to proceed. H.R. 1343 simply raises that threshold from $5 million to $10 mil-lion, and this legislation gives a pri-vate company more flexibility to re-ward and retain employees of all levels. Employee ownership of various struc-tures has benefits to both the com-pany, the employees, and the overall economy. It helps align the interests. It results in more productivity, higher employee retention. It can help make a business more profitable and more sus-tainable. It helps make the American economy and the amazing value that is created work for everybody rather than just one of the stakeholder groups. For many startups and small busi-nesses, giving employees a stake in the business is a great way to provide an additional benefit, an incentive. It gives companies flexibility to attract new employees when they are starting up, to retain talent as a company grows and matures. Providing workers stakes in their company helps strengthen their retire-ment savings. Employee stock owner-ship plans, or ESOPs, are a type of re-tirement plan that offers employees an ownership stake without upfront costs. In Colorado, there are 118 businesses that use employee-owned ESOPs as a way to promote employee ownership. A good example of an ESOP is Fire Safety Services. The owner, Jeff, want-ed to offer his employees a stake in the business. He converted his business to an ESOP, an employee-owned com-pany, that allowed him to create a suc-cession plan so the business can stay locally owned by the people who worked to create the value. Jeff noted that, after the conversion, employee morale was up and sales were up. One of our most famous examples of employee-owned companies is in my district in Fort Collins, Colorado: New Belgium Brewing. From the perspec-tive of the employees, New Belgium has a very strong corporate culture of personal and collective growth. The employee owners are concerned about their own professional development and that of their colleagues. They have a vested stake in the management, eco-nomic health, and stability of the com-pany. This bill is a commonsense approach and makes it easier for companies to give their employees ownership oppor-tunities. It is a small first step towards encouraging an economy that works for everybody. Now, I want to make sure that this legislation helps employees at all in-come levels have access to ownership opportunities and that workers’ retire-ment savings are not put in jeopardy by an overconcentration in company stock. That is why I offered an amend-ment requiring GAO to do a study on the impact of this legislation on em-ployee participation and ownership and the effect this legislation has on secu-rities held by retirement plans that are governed by ERISA. I very much look forward and am grateful that the rule has made in order my amendment. This study will give us important information on how these changes impacting employee ownership also affect retirement. It will give this body information that we need to move forward. The example of my amendment is an example of the many great ideas that Democrats and Republicans could have brought forward had this been brought forward under an open rule. What bet-ter bill to bring forward under an open rule than this kind of bipartisan bill where there is nobody in this body who is trying to undermine or sabotage this bill? There may be some Members who vote against it on both sides, I don’t know, but the overwhelming majority are for it. I think there are Democrats and Republicans with great ideas who would love the opportunity to take 10 or 15 minutes—10 minutes as I am af-forded under this rule. How many other Republicans and Democrats would love that same opportunity to offer amend-ments to improve this bill to make it even better? The good news is employee ownership is not a partisan issue. Employee own-ership strengthens our economy, helps small and medium-sized and large busi-nesses across our entire economic spec-trum create and retain jobs, and pro-motes an increased retirement savings for the middle class. These companies are often anchor businesses in our com-munities that go beyond offering jobs but are involved with sponsoring Little League or being involved with commu-nity nonprofits by giving back, by helping local charities and helping sup-port an ecosystem of entrepreneurship by helping other entrepreneurs get off the ground through mentorship net-works and angel funding networks. I am a strong supporter of this bill and, of course, want to point out that it is simply a starting place. We have a long way to go with encouraging em-ployee ownership in all of its forms— ESOPs, co-ops, stock options, outright stock grants—and any other ways that we can come up with or that the pri-vate sector can come up with that allow a stake in the company and in the value being created to reside with the employees, aligning their incen-tive, making our economy work for ev-erybody, and ensuring that stake-holders have balanced benefits from our overall growth. I support this bill. I wish it had been brought to the floor under an open rule. I oppose the rule. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. b1245 Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I just want to respond briefly to my friend from Colorado’s comments about the nature of the rule. The Rules Committee did make in order every single germane rule that was offered to this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. H
ULTGREN ). Mr. HULTGREN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friends, colleagues from Colorado for their work on this, for their support of this important legisla-tion. I rise today to speak in support of the rule providing for consideration of H.R. 1343, the Encouraging Employee Ownership Act of 2017. I am proud to be a sponsor of this legislation, and I am grateful for the consideration it has been given by the House, and I am en-couraged by its strong record of bipar-tisan support. The bill has passed the House in prior Congresses as part of larger capital markets packages, but this is the first time the legislation will be considered on its own. We have had very constructive de-bate on the bill in the Financial Serv-ices Committee over the last few years. This debate has allowed us to build a strong consensus around this uniting principle: What is good for the com-pany should also be good for the em-ployee, and vice versa. We want it to be easy for companies to offer stock compensation to their employees. This is a company issue, and this is a jobs issue, but this is also a workforce issue. The title of this leg-islation does not betray its intent. We believe encouraging employee owner-ship is important. Agreement on the benefits of em-ployee ownership has contributed to the strong bipartisan support enjoyed by this legislation. It has three Repub-lican and three Democratic original co-sponsors. Furthermore, the majority of Republicans and Democrats voted in favor of the Encouraging Employee Ownership Act when it was considered in the House Financial Services Com-mittee just last month. We are simply expanding on something that is work-ing. The Securities and Exchange Com-mission, the investor protection regu-lator, has never raised issue with re-duced disclosures available under rule 701, so we are simply saying this tool

should be made available to more com-panies and to their employees. We do this by adjusting for inflation the threshold for the amount of securities that can be issued each year under rule 701. Again, I want to thank my colleagues from Colorado. I want to thank all for the work in the Financial Services Committee, and I look forward to the House’s consideration and, hopefully, passage of this important legislation. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-self such time as I may consume. You know, the beauty of an open rule, which we did see when the Demo-crats had the majority and we have not seen since the Republicans took the majority, is it allows the floor debate to inspire good ideas. It allows Demo-crats and Republicans to bring forward amendments, subject to germaneness, that can be considered and voted upon. Frankly, it seems like the Repub-licans didn’t have much for us to do this week. This would have been a per-fect week to try an open rule; and I know that Democrats and Republicans would have, consistent with the spirit of an open rule, brought forth good ideas and offered them. Good ideas would have been included in the bill. But most importantly, we could have set a precedent that open rules work and an open process that values our contributions as legislators and as rep-resentatives of 750,000 Americans who would be able to work to improve legis-lation. So I think that we need to move in that direction. Let the debate on the floor and the back-and-forth inspire new collaboration between Democrats and Republicans, new ideas, new ways of working together. Here you have a concept that Demo-crats and Republicans join together in support of. How can we reduce the costs or the red tape around admin-istering employee ownership? We would love to remove barriers to employee ownership that exist across all forms of employee ownership. We would love to see an economy that works for everybody, one that val-ues employees and workers as stake-holders that share in the economic growth that they helped create. That is a big part of the answer to the discrep-ancies in our economy and the simple fact—yes, fact—that the majority of the benefit of our economic growth has resided with a few and, generally, with shareholders and executives rather than workers. So at the same time we can continue to move forward with conveying value to consumers, I think we can also find a way to make sure that workers are able to participate in the value that is created in our economy. But to be able to do so, we should have an open proc-ess that allows Democrats and Repub-licans to bring forward germane amendments that improve the bill, to create an even better and more com-prehensive effort to encourage em-ployee ownership. Employee ownership ultimately touches a number of different commit-tees. There are issues around employee ownership that affect government pro-curement. There are issues that would reside in the Ways and Means Com-mittee under taxes. There are issues that reside in the Judiciary Com-mittee, and, yes, Financial Services and regulator issues as well. I am hopeful that Democrats and Re-publicans can work together to create a comprehensive omnibus approach to improving access to employee owner-ship for firms across our country. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Michi-gan (Mr. H
UIZENGA ). Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, small businesses and entrepreneurs are what drive the American economy. I meet with these folks all the time when I am back home in the Second District, as I know my colleagues do when they are back in their districts, and we see first-hand the benefits that these people’s dreams, their innovations, their hard work, and as they provide to our com-munities that inspiration. These innovators, entrepreneurs, and risk-takers are critical to our coun-try’s economic growth and prosperity. In fact, small businesses are respon-sible for more than 60 percent of all of the net new jobs. Let me repeat that. Small businesses are responsible for more than 60 percent of all the net new jobs over the past two decades. This isn’t just a one-time blip. This is over the last two decades. So if our Nation is going to have an economy that provides opportunities for every American, then we must pro-mote and encourage success and growth for our small businesses, our startups, and our entrepreneurs. It is this notion that I think brings us to this legislation we are discussing here today. H.R. 1343, the Encouraging Employee Ownership Act, would simply level the playing field for small companies by updating Federal rules that allow small businesses to better compensate their employees with ownership in those businesses. Currently, the SEC rule 701 permits private companies to offer their own securities as part of written compensa-tion agreements with employees, direc-tors, general partners, trustees, offi-cers, or other certain consultants with-out having to comply with rigid Fed-eral securities registration require-ments. The SEC rule 701, therefore, al-lows small companies to reward their employees. Despite the SEC having the author-ity to increase the $5 million threshold via a rulemaking, the SEC has once again chosen to prioritize what, I would argue, are highly politicized reg-ulatory undertakings instead of focus-ing on its core mission, which includes the facilitation of capital formation. That is one of the key core jobs of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Well, if the SEC isn’t going to focus its priorities, then Congress will help them do that. So that is why we are here today on this bill. I believe it is imperative that small businesses not only in West Michigan, but across America, have the ability to compete. A critical element of com-petition and success is, first, that small businesses be able to offer com-pensation packages that attract and retain top-tier talent in their fields. In today’s world, that includes rewarding employees with stock options. To me, this is common sense. Small-business employees have a clear and vested in-terest in the success of their employ-ers, and oftentimes they are attracted to it. I know, having some younger chil-dren myself that are coming into adulthood, they are looking for that excitement. They are looking for that opportunity. They are looking to be builders themselves. Well, by increasing the rule 701 threshold to $10 million, it will give these private companies more flexi-bility to attract, reward, and retain those employees. This simple change would allow companies to offer twice as much stock to their employees an-nually without having to trigger addi-tional disclosure information to inves-tors about those compensation pack-ages that include securities offerings. By reforming this regulatory burden, Mr. Speaker, startups, small busi-nesses, and emerging growth compa-nies will be better equipped to attract highly talented individuals from com-panies that are better capitalized and able to provide cash compensation. By incentivizing employees with stock op-tions, small businesses will now be able to compete on a more level playing field in order to retain those valuable employees rather than seeing them flee to cash, frankly. This bill is an example, I believe, of positive, bipartisan results that can be achieved when Republicans and Demo-crats reach across the aisle. I commend our sponsors of the bills, Representa-tive H
ULTGREN , who spoke a little ear-lier; Representatives D
ELANEY , H IG-
GINS, M ACARTHUR , SINEMA , and S TIV-
ERS, for their leadership on this issue; and my friend from Colorado, as well, and what he is doing. I encourage all my colleagues to sup-port this rule and the underlying bill. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-self such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I have had the oppor-tunity to convene several roundtables in my district featuring employee- owned businesses, and it has been great to hear their stories, whether it is New Belgium Brewing, talking to employee owners who are excited to spend their time building value for themselves and creating stability in their own job and bringing a wonderful craft brew prod-uct to people in all the States in which they distribute, or medical care compa-nies and so many others that have dif-ferent variations of employee owner-ship.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2645 April 4, 2017 
As a private sector entrepreneur be-fore I came to Congress, I founded sev-eral companies in the technology sec-tor. My companies used stock options for every employee, ranging from entry-level front desk and telephone all the way to executive positions; and, frankly, Mr. Speaker, that has become the standard in the tech industry. So many venture-backed companies and technology companies provide stock options across the board such that people who participate in building that value are able to also participate in sharing the value that is created. That is one of the great aspects of the technology sector, in particular, and the startup sector that I hope can ex-port to other sectors. On the margins, this bill will make it a little bit easier for small and mid- sized companies to provide equity com-pensation to employees. But again, we need to do a lot more. We need to do a lot more culturally to make this the norm. We need to do a lot more from a tax perspective and from a regulatory perspective to make it easier for com-panies to share ownership with employ-ees so that employees can benefit from the value that is being created. It is considered the cultural norm and the best practice within the tech-nology entrepreneurship sector, and I hope that that can carry across to other sectors as well. It is very impor-tant to have an economy that works for everybody, and employee ownership is a critical linchpin of that effort. Mr. Speaker, we are debating on a rule and a bill that makes it easier for companies to offer employee stock as part of their compensation; but, unfor-tunately, the backdrop to this discus-sion is that there continues to be an enduring wage gap in which women are simply not paid the same as men for doing the same job. Any efforts by us to strengthen compensation packages continue to remain hollow for 51 per-cent of the country—women. Today is Equal Pay Day. I wish you, Mr. Speaker, a happy Equal Pay Day, and it is time that we do something to address pay and equity in our country. If we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up Representative D
ELAURO ’s Paycheck Fairness Act in addition to the legislation we have been debating, H.R. 1343. So what that means is I will still bring forward this legislation. I will just also bring forward the Pay-check Fairness Act, which I am a proud cosponsor of. Sometimes when we move the pre-vious question, we bring forward a piece of legislation in lieu of the legis-lation that we bring to the floor under the rule. In this case, once we defeat the previous question, I will offer both of those bills: this employee stock own-ership bill and the bill to address pay-check inequity, the Paycheck Fairness Act. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-sent to insert the text of my amend-ment in the R
ECORD , along with extra-neous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Colorado? There was no objection. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, the gentle-woman from Connecticut (Ms. DELAURO ) may be joining us on the floor in a few minutes to talk about her proposal. I have an article written by Ms. D
ELAURO that I include in the R ECORD . 
[From Cosmopolitan, Apr. 4, 2017] W
EWILLWIN THE FIGHT FOR EQUAL PAY (By Rosa DeLauro) Think about 20 cents. It doesn’t feel very significant—there isn’t much you could buy with it. But over a lifetime, those 20 cents add up in a major way. Today, we have reached yet another Equal Pay Day—the day on which the average woman’s earnings finally catch up to what the average man made last year. This year’s Equal Pay Day falls 94 days into 2017—94 days too late. Women are nearly half the workforce—yet they still only earn about 80 cents on aver-age, to a man’s dollar. The gap widens even further when you consider women of color— African-American women make 63 cents on the dollar, while Latinas make only 54 cents on average, compared with what white men earn. This is unacceptable. The National Women’s Law Center found that based on today’s wage gap, a woman starting her career now will lose $418,800 over a 40–vear career. For African-Americans, the losses are $840,040. And for Latinas, the life-time gap is over $1 million. These disparities exist at all levels of edu-cation and occupation—even at the very top. The world champion U.S. women’s soccer team is fighting for pay equality, as are Academy-Award winning actresses from Emma Stone to Viola Davis and Patricia Arquette, who have used their platforms to call for equal pay in Hollywood. Men and women in the same job should have the same pay. Period. Wage discrimina-tion takes place not just on the soccer field or the silver screen, but in the board room, on the factory floor, and in countless other workplaces across the country. That is why I am fighting for equal pay—for all women. I am fighting for AnnMarie in Massachu-setts, who found out, years into her job, that the university she worked for was paying men more for the same work. I am fighting for Terri in Tennessee, who only discovered she was making less than she deserved be-cause her husband held the exact same job and was paid more! And I am fighting for ReShonda in Iowa, who discovered that her own father was paying women less when she went to work in the family business. Pay dis-crimination in the workplace is real—and it is happening everywhere. Pay inequity does not just affect women— it affects children, families, and our econ-omy as a whole. That is because women in this country are the sole or co-breadwinner in half of families with children. The biggest problem facing our country today is that families are not making enough to live on— and closing the wage gap would help address that problem. Over 50 years ago, Congress came to-gether—in a bipartisan fashion—to pass the Equal Pay Act and end what President John F. Kennedy called ‘‘the serious and endemic problem’’ of unequal wages. The Equal Pay Act made it illegal for employers to pay men and women differently for substantially equal work. Yet we still have so far to go to close the wage gap. In 2009, we took a critical step forward with the passage of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which kept the courthouse door open to sue for pay discrimination. But we must continue the fight and finish the job by passing into law the Paycheck Fairness Act. I first introduced the Paycheck Fairness Act on June 24, 1997—almost 20 years ago. The Paycheck Fairness Act will mean real progress in the fight to eliminate the gender wage gap and help families. The act ensures that employers who try to justify paying a man more than a woman for the same job must show the disparity is not sex-based, but job-related and necessary. It prohibits em-ployers from retaliating against employees who discuss or disclose salary information with their coworkers. The bill would also allow women to join together in class-action lawsuits where there are allegations of sex- based pay discrimination. The bill actually passed the House twice, with bipartisan support. Yet it has never made it to the president’s desk—despite the fact that this is an issue that affects every single state in this country. In the last ses-sion of Congress, I was proud to have every single Democratic member of Congress signed onto the Paycheck Fairness Act—and even one Republican! But we need to keep fighting. When women raise their voices, we get results. Take the recent victory for the U.S. women’s national hockey team who were able to negotiate a historic new contract to address pay inequal-ity. They spoke up—even threatening to boy-cott the International Ice Hockey Federa-tion World Championship games—and their voices were heard. In January, I attended the Wonnen’s March in Washington. The organic energy—the real, tangible power of the people—was unlike anything I have ever seen. It was a stark re-minder of what we can achieve together, when we speak with one voice and demand what we deserve. When I looked out at the sea of pink hats and powerful, handmade signs, I thought of my mother. When she was born, women could not even vote. Yet today, her daughter is a congresswoman. When we fight for equal pay for equal work, we carry on the legacy of all the women who have fought before us. And when we finally succeed, we will create a better future for all the women who will follow us. Equal pay is an idea whose time has come—in fact, it is long overdue. But we have the power. We have the momentum. And I believe that we will win. 
Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, Congress-woman D
ELAURO ’s article from Cos-mopolitan magazine, dated April 4, 2017, today, talks about how, over a lifetime, the 20 cents that women are missing every paycheck on a dollar earned by men adds up. In fact, the Na-tional Women’s Law Center found that a woman starting her career now will lose over $400,000 over a 40-year career. That could be a house. That could be college for two kids or three kids. That could be a family vacation every year. That means a lot, which is why we need to defeat the previous question and move forward on both of these wor-thy bills. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. b1300 Mr. BUCK.

say to the gentleman that I do have one other speaker on the way. Mr. Speaker, this bill under consider-ation is a small but significant step to help companies increase worker owner-ship to help improve the overall equity of our economy. I hope that this bill, along with the other two coming to the floor later this week, are the start of something. I hope they are a sign that this body will actually consider mean-ingful, bipartisan, practical, and com-monsense legislation to address the issues the American people sent us to Washington to fix: creating jobs, grow-ing our economy, reforming our Tax Code, and fixing our broken immigra-tion system. I hope my colleagues support the un-derlying legislation, H.R. 1343, oppose the rule, and defeat the previous ques-tion so I can bring forward not only the employee stock ownership rule, but also the Paycheck Fairness Act here on Equal Pay Day across America so that we can make sure as we are talking about making sure that women receive the same cash and ownership in rec-ognition of their efforts as employees across the country. This bill will hopefully pass over-whelmingly. I just wish it could be an example of how we could work under an open rule and give Democrats and Republicans a chance to build upon and improve legislation. There have been zero open rules under Speaker R
YAN since he has taken over the Speaker’s gavel promising, ironically, a more open process. It is about time. If not this bill, what bill, Mr. Speak-er? If not a bill with strong bipartisan support that Democratic and Repub-lican leaders are committed to bring-ing across the finish line, when can we have an open process that allows us as legislators to bring forward our amend-ments in response to debate on the floor in realtime? I wish that this would have been that bill. And I hope that by defeating this rule, we can send a message back to the Rules Committee that we should consider open rules for these kinds of bipartisan legislation. Promoting employee stock ownership is incredibly important. To have a multistakeholder economy that works for everybody will help address a lot of the legitimate concerns that Ameri-cans have, that workers and employees have not shared, and the great amount of value that has been created. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from Con-necticut (Ms. D
ELAURO ) to further dis-cuss our proposal on the previous ques-tion on Equal Pay Day and the Pay-check Fairness Act. Ms. D
ELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the previous ques-tion and to the rule. If we defeat this rule, we can enable the House of Rep-resentatives to vote on the Paycheck Fairness Act. Today is Equal Pay Day. This is the day that the average woman’s earnings finally catch up to what the average man made last year—and we are 94 days into 2017. Women are nearly half the work-force, yet they still only earn about 80 cents, on average, to a man’s dollar. The gap widens even further when you consider women of color. African- American women make 63 cents on the dollar, while Latinas make only 54 cents, on average, compared with White men. This is unacceptable. The National Women’s Law Center found that, based on today’s wage gap, a woman starting her career will lose $418,800 over a 40- year career. For African-American women, the losses are $840,000. For Latinas, the lifetime gap is over $1 mil-lion. This disparity, by the way, exists at all levels of education and occupa-tion—even at the very top. The world champion U.S. women’s soccer team is fighting for pay equity, as are Acad-emy Award-winning actresses like Emma Stone and Viola Davis, who have used their platforms to call for equal pay in Hollywood. The fact that women at the top of their field feel the repercussions of this issue speaks to its pervasiveness. Women from the board-room to the factory floor and in every industry in every State are hurt by the wage gap. The biggest issue of our time is that people are not making enough to live on, and their jobs just don’t pay them enough money. Pay inequity does not just affect women; it affects children, families, and our economy as a whole, and that is because women in this country are the sole or co-breadwinner in half of families with children today. I first introduced the Paycheck Fair-ness Act on June 24, 1997, almost 20 years ago. The Paycheck Fairness Act will mean real progress in the fight to eliminate the gender wage gap and help families. The act ensures that employ-ers who try to justify paying a man more than a woman for the same job must show the disparity is not sex- based but job-related and necessary. It prohibits employers from retaliating against employees who discuss or dis-close salary information with their co-workers. The bill would allow women to join together in class action law-suits where there are allegations of sex-based pay discrimination. This bill, by the way, has passed the House of Representatives twice in a bi-partisan way. Today we have 198 co-sponsors of that bill, and, yes, it is bi-partisan. We can pass this piece of leg-islation in this body. We have not been able to get it to the President’s desk despite the fact that this is an issue that affects every single State in this country. Every year I hope we never have to recognize this day again because equal pay will be the law of the land. Men and women in the same job deserve the same pay. It is true in the House of Representatives; it should be true all over this country. We are men and women in this body who come from dif-ferent parts of the country with dif-ferent skill sets, different educational backgrounds, and different philoso-phies, and, yes, we get paid the same amount of money. Let’s make sure that the Paycheck Fairness Act is the law of the land. The time has come for equal pay. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-self the balance of my time. I want to thank Ms. DELAURO for her tireless advocacy on behalf of equal pay. I would also encourage my col-leagues to join me in cosponsoring the Equal Rights Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It is about time. Today, on Equal Pay Day, let’s enshrine equal-ity between men and women into the U.S. Constitution. If we can defeat the previous ques-tion, we will bring forward H.R. 1343, the employee stock ownership bill, but we will also bring forward the Pay-check Fairness Act so that we can do a little more work of the people’s work here in the House of Representatives and help make sure that we can look ourselves in the mirror knowing that men and women will both benefit equally from a hard day’s work. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the rule to de-feat the previous question and to vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 1343 as a first step to en-couraging an economy that works for everybody and employee stock owner-ship. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-self the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, we often talk about coming together in support of good pol-icy. We all have friends on both sides of the aisle, and we routinely promise to work together on issues upon which we agree. Most of us speak in front of our constituents about our desire to work with the other party. However, we all know that Americans perceive us to be constantly engaged in partisan con-flict. It is unfortunate that we are not able to work together on good legislation more often. It is understandable that Americans feel disappointed by Wash-ington’s partisan sniping. But here be-fore us today is a bill with wide bipar-tisan support. Not only has it already received numerous bipartisan votes, there were only two amendments of-fered to the bill. One amendment was withdrawn because it was not germane. The other amendment from my good friend from Colorado and the Rules Committee, Mr. P
OLIS, is simply re-quiring a report. Why is this bill so noncontroversial? I believe it has to do with the process by which we received this legislation. The Committee on Financial Services held hearings as far back as 2015 in which problems with the SEC rule were raised by small-business owners. The sponsor of this bill, Mr. H
ULTGREN , worked with his Democratic

colleagues on the committee and intro-duced a proposal to reform the SEC rule. Chairman H
ENSARLING held a full committee markup last month which allowed for full debate and amendment, and now we have the bill on the floor this week. Good process produces good policy. But perhaps equally as impor-tant, good process helps instill faith in this institution. When Americans see us take up an issue, hear their con-cerns, and work together to find a com-monsense solution, they will trust us to tackle even bigger problems. This may not be the largest legisla-tive product that Chairman H
EN-
SARLING and the Financial Services Committee produce in this Congress, but, nevertheless, it is an important work that is helping us solve problems faced by American small businesses. This legislation ensures that the em-ployees of America’s small businesses can take ownership in their companies and their jobs. It reduces regulatory encroachment on America’s job cre-ators and helps our small businesses expand and grow. I thank Representative H
ULTGREN for bringing this bill before us. I commend Chairman H
ENSARLING for working with both sides of the aisle and for fol-lowing a good process on this legisla-tion. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on the rule and vote ‘‘yes’’ on the bill. The material previously referred to by Mr. P
OLIS is as follows: 
ANAMENDMENT TO H. R ES. 240 O FFERED BY  M
R. POLIS At the end of the resolution, add the fol-lowing new sections: S
EC. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for consider-ation of the bill (H.R. 1869) to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to provide more effective remedies to victims of dis-crimination in the payment of wages on the basis of sex, and for other purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Education and the Workforce. After general debate the bill shall be consid-ered for amendment under the five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion of con-sideration of the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage with-out intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and re-ports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the bill. S
EC. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the consideration of H.R. 1869. THEVOTE ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION : WHAT I
TREALLY MEANS  This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against or-dering the previous question is a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an altemative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the House of Representatives (VI, 308–311), de-scribes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.’’ To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject be-fore the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the de-mand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition’’ in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party of-fered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R–Illinois) said: ‘‘The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitz-gerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.’’ The Republican majority may say ‘‘the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy im-plications whatsoever.’’ But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Repub-lican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Rep-resentatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here’s how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ‘‘Al-though it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member con-trolling the time will not yield for the pur-pose of offering an amendment, the same re-sult may be achieved by voting down the pre-vious question on the rule....  When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the pre-vious question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amend-ment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.’’ In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled ‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amend-ment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, sec-tion 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ‘‘Upon re-jection of the motion for the previous ques-tion on a resolution reported from the Com-mittee on Rules, control shifts to the Mem-ber leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for de-bate thereon.’’ Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy impli-cations. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Republican major-ity’s agenda and allows those with altemative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan. 
Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous question. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. f 
PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1304, SELF-INSURANCE PROTECTION ACT Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, by direc-tion of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 241 and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as fol-lows: 
H. R ES. 241 Resolved, That upon adoption of this reso-lution it shall be in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 1304) to amend the Em-ployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, the Public Health Service Act, and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exclude from the definition of health insurance cov-erage certain medical stop-loss insurance ob-tained by certain plan sponsors of group health plans. All points of order against con-sideration of the bill are waived. The amend-ment in the nature of a substitute rec-ommended by the Committee on Education and the Workforce now printed in the bill shall be considered as adopted. The bill, as amended, shall be considered as read. All points of order against provisions in the bill, as amended, are waived. The previous ques-tion shall be considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and on any further amend-ment thereto, to final passage without inter-vening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Com-mittee on Education and the Workforce; and (2) one motion to recommit with or without instructions. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-tleman from Alabama is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the cus-tomary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. H
ASTINGS ), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-tend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Alabama? There was no objection. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, in 2010, then-President Obama said: ‘‘If you like your health insurance plan, you can keep it.’’ Unfortunately, at least 4.7 million Americans now know that was simply not true. ObamaCare was a takeover of the American healthcare system. The law’s mandates have been burdensome, destroying 300,000 small-business jobs and forcing an estimated 10,000 small businesses to close. Premiums are sky-rocketing, and choices are dwindling.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH2648 April 4, 2017 
House Resolution 241 provides for the consideration of H.R. 1304, the Self-In-surance Protection Act, an important part of the Republican effort to repair the damage ObamaCare has done to in-surance markets. More than 150 million Americans—62 percent of workers—re-ceive their health insurance from their employer. In fact, almost all firms with at least 200 or more employees offer health benefits, and just over half of smaller firms with 3 to 199 employees offer health insurance. Overwhelmingly, Americans and their employers like this system of em-ployer-sponsored health care; and for many years, employer health plans have been successfully regulated by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA. b1315 Typically, small and large employers offer healthcare coverage to employees either in self-funded arrangements or purchase fully insured plans from an insurer. Under self-insurance plans, employ-ers cover the costs of their employees’ medical expenses. Employers can ei-ther process claims in-house or work with a third-party administrator to oversee and implement the plans. ERISA regulates both fully insured and self-insured plans, but only self-in-sured plans are exempt from the patch-work of mandates imposed under State insurance law. Furthermore, employer- sponsored self-insured plans are not subject to the same requirements under ObamaCare, as are fully insured plans. Thus, self-insurance plans are desir-able and successful because they are free from many government restric-tions and regulations and allow em-ployers to tailor their plans to meet the unique needs of their employees and to innovate. For example, these plans do not re-quire employees to purchase govern-ment-mandated coverage options that their employees do not want or need. This helps lower costs for working fam-ilies while ensuring access to high- quality health care. In hearings before the Education and the Workforce Committee, on which I sit, we heard testimony that today self-insurance is often the only way employers can afford coverage, thanks to the burdens of ObamaCare. Mr. Speaker, in Alabama, we like to say: if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. Prior to ObamaCare, there were problems in our Nation’s healthcare system, but the successful model of employer self- insurance wasn’t one of them. Today, self-insurance remains perhaps the best way for employers to provide health care to their workers. Unfortunately, the prior administra-tion seemed intent on disrupting this successful healthcare model. Rather than leave self-insurance plans alone, they repeatedly explored ways to im-pose new regulations that would nega-tively impact self-insurance. Specifi-cally, the Obama administration want-ed to disrupt the model by regulating stop-loss insurance and treating it as if it were health insurance. Employers who self-insure often pur-chase stop-loss insurance to cover large medical claims and to protect against the financial risks such claims can pose. Despite decades of Federal regu-lation on employer health plans under ERISA, stop-loss insurance has never been regulated by the Federal Govern-ment. That is because stop-loss insur-ance is actually a financial risk man-agement tool designed to protect em-ployers from catastrophic claim ex-penses. Remarkably, in a regulatory grab, the Obama administration tried to reclassify it as ‘‘group health insur-ance.’’ Mr. Speaker, if the last 7 years have taught us anything, it is that more Federal control over health insurance does not make health care more afford-able for the American people. Stop-loss insurance is not health insurance, and it should not be regulated like it is. The Self-Insurance Protection Act simply updates the law to make clear that Federal bureaucrats cannot rede-fine stop-loss insurance as group health insurance. This is about reaffirming longstanding policies and ensuring workers continue to have access to a health insurance model that is proven to lower costs and provide flexibility to consumers. This bill will provide workers and employers alike with the regulatory certainty that they have desperately wanted and needed. They shouldn’t have to worry about unelected Federal bureaucrats stepping in and destroying their healthcare system. To put it simply, this bill is nec-essary in order to prevent future bu-reaucratic overreach that would de-stroy the self-insurance model that has been so successful for so many working families. I also think this bill is an area where we should have some bipartisan co-operation. It passed out of the Edu-cation and the Workforce Committee earlier this year on a voice vote, and I hope it earns bipartisan support here in the full House. As we continue our efforts to in-crease choices, lower costs, and provide better healthcare options for working families, let us not forget to shore up and protect the health insurance pro-grams that are actually working and getting the job done. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 241 and the underlying bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30 minutes for de-bate. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to debate a rule for a piece of legislation that many on this side of the aisle do not necessarily have a serious issue with. The attempt here today is to ensure that a thing that is already happening continues to happen. I suppose that, the next time we meet, we will take up a bill that de-clares that the Moon is not the Sun. Doing so is a complete waste of time, but that does not seem to necessarily be dispositive when deciding whether we should legislate on an issue these days. Look, I get it. My friends across the aisle took one on the chin the other week when their Affordable Care Act repeal bill—a bill they spent 17 days working on, even though they had 7 long years to prepare for it—went down in flames in a most public and spectac-ular fashion, and now they need some time to dust themselves off and become reoriented. The problem is, while they are doing that, while they are recovering from the miserable failure that was their at-tempt to strip 24 million Americans of their health care, they are burning val-uable time—time that should be used to tackle more pressing issues like ad-dressing the debt ceiling and fixing our crumbling infrastructure. Let me also take this opportunity to remind my Republican colleagues that, while we spend our time here today de-bating these filler bills, there are only 7 legislative days, including today, re-maining before the government runs out of funding. But are we tackling any of these importance issues or ensuring the government remains open? No. Instead, we have before us a bill that addresses an issue that is not an issue. On top of that, this legislation was ac-tually supposed to be the third bucket of their three-bucket strategy to end health care for millions of Americans. We saw how sturdy the first bucket was a couple of weeks ago. In fact, the bucket we are talking about today was actually referred to as the ‘‘sucker’s bucket’’ by Senator C
RUZ. That is not exactly a glowing endorsement. Indeed, some, like Senator C
OTTON , have referred to all this bucket talk as simply a bunch of political spin. What-ever it is, it is certainly a bucket that has a hole in it. In all of the uncertainty facing my Republican friends, one thing becomes crystal clear: they have no plan what-soever to help working Americans achieve the American Dream. They are adrift, in general, and most particu-larly when it comes to health care. What do they really want? At first, it was repeal, then it was repeal and re-place, then it was repeal and delay, fol-lowed finally by access to coverage, and would you believe another one: pa-tient-centered. That is repeal, repeal and replace, re-peal and delay, access to coverage, and patient-centered. We still don’t have a plan. Then it turned toward a three- bucket strategy that makes little to any sense, let alone to the American people but even to powerful elected leaders in the Republican Party. At the end of the day, Mr. Speaker, do you know what all this talk was?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2649 April 4, 2017 
Exactly what Senator C OTTON said: nothing but political spin. My fear is that it will all come down to whatever it takes to win in the eyes of the other side of the aisle, regardless of the consequences to the American people. While we were told there was no plan B, we now hear there is a plan B. Don-ald John Trump ‘‘doesn’t lose,’’ and doesn’t like to lose. So I guess they are going to pass something, even if it is just this bill that does absolutely noth-ing, just so our Republican friends can say they did something. I am sure Don-ald John Trump will tweet about this great victory. Mr. Speaker, Republicans must end their secretive plan B option and em-brace the opportunity to do what is right, which is to pursue a path that strengthens and builds upon the strong foundation that has been set by the Af-fordable Care Act. Democrats stand ready to work with my friends in the Republican Party on this task to continue to provide afford-able coverage to millions of American citizens. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-self such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, my colleague from Florida said that the Moon is not the Sun. Well, stop-loss insurance is not health insurance, but the Obama ad-ministration tried to make it so. Be-cause they tried to make it so, we need to put into statutory law what I think we all agree on both sides of the aisle not only is the law but should be the law so that there is no question about it in the future. It is unfortunate we have to do that, but, because of some of the actions of the prior administration, it is necessary. He talked about the strong founda-tion of the ACA, ObamaCare. That foundation is crumbling beneath the program. We now have more insurers jumping out of exchanges. My home State of Alabama is down to one car-rier on the exchange. Soon enough, we may find that, in Alabama, like some other States, there are no carriers. This isn’t a foundation. It is a founda-tion made of sand—and the sand is leaking out. Something has to be done. Today’s bill is a step—not the only step—in that direction. I know my col-leagues on the other side of the aisle agree with what we are doing here in substance, and I wish we would just come together and get this bill done so that we can assure that the self-in-sured smaller employers and larger em-ployers have the protection that they need for the working families that par-ticipate in their programs. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, Donald John Trump signed into law a measure that eliminates Americans’ internet pri-vacy. With Trump’s signature, internet service providers will now be able to sell your personal information to the highest bidder. Mr. Speaker, we stand here ready to fight for the privacy of the American people. If we defeat the previous question, I am going to offer an amendment to the rule to bring up legislation which would reinstate the Federal Commu-nications Commission’s internet pri-vacy rule. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-sent to insert the text of my amend-ment in the R
ECORD , along with extra-neous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Ne-vada (Ms. R
OSEN ), a member of the Armed Services and Science, Space, and Technology Committees to discuss our proposal. Ms. ROSEN. Mr. Speaker, if today’s vote on the previous question fails, we will have the opportunity to vote on my bill, H.R. 1868, Restoring American Privacy Act of 2017, which will reverse last night’s disastrous action by Presi-dent Trump when he signed a partisan congressional resolution allowing internet providers to sell their cus-tomers’ personal information without their knowledge or consent. Before my time in Congress, I started my career as a systems analyst. I have firsthand experience writing code, and I can tell you that the first thing to protect vulnerable and sensitive data is to make sure it is kept private. S.J. Res. 34, which the House passed last Tuesday, unraveled those vital protections for sensitive information belonging to millions of Americans na-tionwide. b1330 The resolution negating essential protections for private citizens was signed by President Trump last night. The October 2016 FCC rule was the only rule that required internet service pro-viders to obtain consumers’ permission before selling their private internet browsing history and other sensitive information. I am simply shocked that my col-leagues across the aisle would vote for a measure that violates American pri-vacy by selling your most personal and intimate information, including your email content and your app usage, all without your consent. Not only is this wrong and a blatant violation of pol-icy, but it jeopardizes Americans’ per-sonal data and puts them at risk of hacking. Repealing the FCC rule with S.J. Res. 34 allows broadband providers to turn over your info to the highest bid-der or anyone else they want, including the government, without a warrant, without ever telling you. That is right. I will repeat it. Repealing the FCC rule with S.J. Res. 34 allows broadband pro-viders to turn over your private infor-mation to the highest bidder or anyone else they want, including the govern-ment, without a warrant, without ever telling you. Even worse, S.J. Res. 34 also tells providers they no longer have to use reasonable measures to protect con-sumers’ personal information. This is absolutely unacceptable. We are living in a time where identity theft and internet hacking has become the new norm. We must provide consumers with these protections. No American wants their most personal information to be up for grabs. Eliminating this rule prevents the FCC from publishing rules that are substantially the same absent addi-tional legislation, establishing a very dangerous precedent for private citi-zens. Americans should have the right to decide how their internet providers use their personal information. What this bill does, Mr. Speaker, is simple. This bill makes clear that the American people’s browser histories are not for sale. The American people’s health information: not for sale. The American people’s financial informa-tion: not for sale. And the American people’s location data: not for sale. It is a simple concept and one I hope my colleagues across the aisle will rec-ognize and support. The American peo-ple don’t want the legislation that was signed last night. In overwhelming numbers, they are calling Congress and letting it be known that they want to keep their private information private. I am proud to stand up for the Amer-ican people by introducing the Restor-ing American Privacy Act of 2017, which reverses this misguided resolu-tion and says, once and for all, that ISPs cannot sell customers’ personal information without their knowledge, without their permission. This bill says that your privacy is not for sale, pe-riod. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time to close. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. It is time for my friends on the other side of the aisle to end their self-pro-claimed political spin designed to be-wilder and confuse average Americans, making them believe that their Repub-lican representatives are fighting for the future of their health care and the health care of their families, when what they are really doing is fighting for powerful corporate interests. Now is the time for us to face facts and accept truths. Fact: House Republicans made an at-tempt to replace the Affordable Care Act with a bill that caused such an out-cry from their own constituents that they were forced to pull it. Truth: There are serious issues in health care that need to be addressed for the betterment of all Americans, and it is going to take the effort of both parties in both the House and the Senate working together to strengthen our healthcare system.

No more smokescreens, no more po-litical rhetoric, only collaborative dis-course using only the well-being of the American people as our compass. It is this approach that will steer us back onto course for the betterment of this and future generations. Unfortunately, this bill does not further that effort. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the rule and underlying measure, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BYRNE. I yield myself the bal-ance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Florida for his remarks. I com-pletely agree with him. Both parties should be working together to make sure that we provide what we can rea-sonably for the health care of the peo-ple of America, and we should be col-laborating, not just in this House across the aisle but in the Senate as well. I think it is a good place to start right here with this bill because we really don’t have a substantive dis-agreement about this bill. Both sides understand that stop-loss insurance is not health insurance. It is just the Obama administration tried to turn it into that. This bill would stop that and bring the certainty we need back to these self-insured plans that mainly small employers have and make sure that we have in place for working families across America a sys-tem that is working for them and maintain that. I hope that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will join with us, will collaborate with us, and that our colleagues in the other House, in the Senate, will do as well and pass this legislation because it truly is bipar-tisan in substance and, I hope today, in the vote. Mr. Speaker, I again urge my col-leagues to support House Resolution 241 and the underlying bill. The material previously referred to by Mr. H
ASTINGS is as follows: 
ANAMENDMENT TO H. R ES. 241 O FFERED BY  M
R. HASTINGS  At the end of the resolution, add the fol-lowing new sections: S
EC. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for consider-ation of the bill (H.R. 1868) to provide that providers of broadband Internet access serv-ice shall be subject to the privacy rules adopted by the Federal Communications Commission on October 27, 2016. The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce. After general debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consid-eration of the bill for amendment the Com-mittee shall rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amend-ments thereto to final passage without inter-vening motion except one motion to recom-mit with or without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the bill. SEC. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the consideration of H.R. 1868. T
HEVOTE ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION : WHAT I
TREALLY MEANS  This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against or-dering the previous question is a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the House of Representatives (VI, 308–311), de-scribes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.’’ To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject be-fore the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the de-mand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition’’ in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party of-fered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: ‘‘The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitz-gerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.’’ The Republican majority may say ‘‘the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution .. . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy im-plications whatsoever.’’ But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Repub-lican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Rep-resentatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here’s how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ‘‘Al-though it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member con-trolling the time will not yield for the pur-pose of offering an amendment, the same re-sult may be achieved by voting down the pre-vious question on the rule....  When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the pre-vious question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amend-ment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.’’ In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled ‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amend-ment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, sec-tion 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ‘‘Upon re-jection of the motion for the previous ques-tion on a resolution reported from the Com-mittee on Rules, control shifts to the Mem-ber leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for de-bate thereon.’’ Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy impli-cations. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Republican major-ity’s agenda and allows those with alter-native views the opportunity to offer an al-ternative plan. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the res-olution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous question. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-ant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule XX, this 15-minute vote on ordering the previous question will be followed by 5- minute votes on adoption of the resolu-tion, if ordered; ordering the previous question on House Resolution 240; and adoption of House Resolution 240, if or-dered. The vote was taken by electronic de-vice, and there were—yeas 232, nays 188, not voting 9, as follows:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH2664 April 4, 2017 
Congressman F RANK LUCAS , Chairman L
AMAR SMITH, and former Environment Subcommittee Chairs J
IMBRIDENSTINE  and C
HRIS STEWART , who were great partners in getting us here today. The National Oceanic and Atmos-pheric Administration is responsible for important work at the cutting edge of science and public service. Weather forecasting is one of the most critical tasks for our country. At a time when budget uncertainty jeopardizes some of the most fundamental services NOAA provides to our Nation, it is imperative that we support legislation like H.R. 353 to give the agency the resources and flexibility needed to fulfill its mis-sion. The northwest Oregon communities I represent and communities across the country rely on timely and accurate weather forecasts to decide when to harvest their crops, when to go to sea to fish, how to navigate the roads safe-ly when there is freezing rain or snow and to prepare for possible flood condi-tions. The National Weather Service pro-vides excellent forecasting products to support our economy, but with the in-creasing frequency and severity of se-vere weather events, there can be and should be improvements in our fore-casting capabilities and delivery. Im-provements in forecasts can provide more lead time to allow communities to prepare, especially in severe weather events. More effective communication of forecast information to the public and those in harm’s way can reduce the loss of life and property. This bill connects the research side of NOAA—the Office of Oceanic and At-mospheric Research—more effectively to the forecasting needs of the Na-tional Weather Service, cultivating a research-to-operations pipeline that is essential for the continued improve-ment of our weather forecasting enter-prise. The bill contains several provi-sions that will improve interactions and information sharing between NOAA’s researchers and the National Weather Service. It improves commu-nication between NOAA and the broad-er research and private weather com-munities. The bill also formally estab-lishes the pilot program currently op-erating at NOAA to engage in con-tracts with the commercial sector for weather forecasting data. Even the best forecasts will not ade-quately serve the public’s needs unless there are effective communication sys-tems in place. H.R. 353 directs NOAA to do more research, listen to experts, and improve its risk communication tech-niques. The bill also establishes interagency coordination through the Office of Science and Technology Policy across multiple agencies outside NOAA that share responsibilities for weather re-search and forecast communications. This is essential, and it highlights the important role the Office of Science and Technology Policy and NOAA share to help speed the adoption of best tools and practices across the various agencies of the Federal Government. The legislation before us today also includes the Tsunami Warning, Edu-cation, and Research Act, legislation I have introduced over the past three Congresses. The Tsunami Warning, Education, and Research Act seeks to improve our country’s understanding of the threat posed by tsunami events by improving forecasting and notifica-tion systems, developing supportive technologies, and supporting local community outreach preparedness and response plans. This bill helps to ad-dress the risk faced by communities on both coasts and in the Gulf of Mexico by improving our mitigation and re-search program and enhancing commu-nity outreach and planning. Many, if not most, of my colleagues represent districts that have experi-enced some kind of natural disaster. The threat of a catastrophic earth-quake and tsunami is real because of the Cascadia Subduction Zone. West Coast Members take this threat very seriously. I have heard from coastal commu-nities, people who fish, the tourism and maritime industries, marine and public safety officials, sheriffs, emergency managers, small-business owners, older Americans, and students who are con-cerned that their communities are not prepared for a tsunami. Students at Seaside High School, a coastal community in my district, en-gaged in a year-long project to educate Oregonians about the threat a tsunami has on lives and property. Three of the four public schools in Seaside are still located inside the tsunami inundation zone. The high school students have practiced their evacuation route, and they know that, in the projected time between a major earthquake and the devastating wave of a tsunami, they couldn’t make it to higher ground. That is unacceptable. The University of Oregon and Oregon State University are working on seis-mic warning systems and tsunami pre-paredness to help make sure that our communities are prepared and have the best research available to give the most warning time possible, and this bill compliments their work. I am proud to have worked on this legislation which is so important to the people of northwest Oregon and all coastal communities, but I do remain very concerned that the funding level is below current spending. This cut would have serious consequences. The operation and maintenance funding for the buoy network we rely on to detect tsunami could decrease, adding hours of delay in appropriately warning coastal communities. Tsunami warning centers in Alaska and Hawaii are likely to see a reduc-tion in staff, resulting in gaps in cov-erage and creating greater risks be-cause of time delays in sending out ac-curate warnings and, in some in-stances, not being able to provide ade-quate warning at all. Tsunami are among the most deadly natural disasters. In the past two dec-ades, tsunami have caused the deaths of roughly a quarter million people around the world. These disasters also have profound economic consequences. The 2001 tsunami in Japan caused more than $200 billion in economic losses. We are fortunate, in the United States, to have been spared these ca-tastrophes so far. b1445 But our coastlines, from the Gulf of Mexico to Alaska, are very susceptible to the same kind of disasters we have seen in Indonesia and in Japan. It is not a matter of if, it is a matter of when. Tsunami program activities protect coastal Oregonians just as hurricane forecasting protects coastal Floridians, Carolinians, and others up and down the East Coast of the United States. It is important that we reauthorize these lifesaving activities, and just as impor-tant to provide the necessary funding to support them. I will work tirelessly with my col-leagues to make sure this program re-ceives the full funding it needs to serve our communities and save lives and property. Although there are always areas where we can do more, this underlying bill, the Weather Research and Fore-casting Innovation Act, with the tsu-nami bill, is a good bipartisan agree-ment and one that I am proud to sup-port while continuing to ask for cur-rent levels of funding. I ask my colleagues to join me in voting ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 353. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. L
UCAS ), who is the vice chairman of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, and also the sponsor of this legislation. Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Texas, Chairman S
MITH, for his continued leadership on the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, and for bring-ing forward this important legislation. H.R. 353, the Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act of 2017, prioritizes improving weather fore-casting for the protection of lives and property at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. This is a core program of the agency that has been in need of improved direction and investment for years. The bill directs NOAA to develop plans to restore our country’s leader-ship in weather forecasting. It is no se-cret that many people in our weather community are distraught that our forecasting capacities have deterio-rated in recent years. Some even say that America no longer has the best weather prediction system in the world. In fact, we routinely rely on forecasts of other countries to predict what will happen in this country. This

is unacceptable, but I am glad we are here today to pass legislation that will dramatically improve our weather forecasting system. The bill before us today enhances our ability to predict severe weather by fo-cusing research and computing re-sources on improved weather fore-casting, quantitative observing data planning, next generation modeling, and an emphasis on research-to-oper-ations technology transfer. As a Representative from Oklahoma, I understand the need for accurate and timely weather predictions firsthand. Every year, the loss of life from deadly tornadoes in my home State are a stark reminder that we can do better to predict severe weather events and provide longer lead times to protect Americans in harm’s way. I am proud that this legislation has a dedicated tornado warning improve-ment program. The goal of this pro-gram is to reduce the loss of life from tornadoes by advancing the under-standing of fundamental meteorolog-ical science. This will allow detection and notifications of severe weather that are more accurate, effective, and timely. Constituents in my home State will benefit greatly from longer tor-nado warning lead times, which will save lives and better protect property. Being better prepared for severe weather events is of the utmost impor-tant. The bill will improve our fore-casting by encouraging innovations and new technologies through a joint technology transfer fund at NOAA’s Of-fice of Oceanic and Atmospheric Re-search. This transfer is essential to get new forecasting, models, and tech-nologies out of the research side of NOAA and into the operational fore-casts to better protect our country. Furthermore, the legislation will en-hance our forecasting by directing NOAA to engage new commercial data and private sector solutions. This legis-lation includes a pilot project, which will provide NOAA a clear demonstra-tion of the valuable data from commer-cial technologies. The private sector has the potential to aid our forecasting skill while reducing government cost with innovative solutions. In order to increase our weather skills, we must not limit ourselves by solely relying on government data. This legislation packs in multiple ef-forts to protect lives and property from severe weather. From encouraging new technologies both inside and outside of NOAA to the careful planning and prioritization of weather research, this legislation will put our country back on track to be a world leader in weath-er prediction. The time has come for Americans to have the most accurate and timely weather predictions. They deserve nothing less. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for the bill. Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. E
DDIE BERNICE JOHNSON ), the ranking mem-ber of the Science, Space, and Tech-nology Committee. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 353, the Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act of 2017. Climate and weather are not fun-damentally partisan concerns; they af-fect all of our constituents, regardless of their party affiliation. The bill we are considering today, which is the cul-mination of more than 4 years of bipar-tisan compromise and negotiation, demonstrates what can be accom-plished when we work together to ad-dress the concerns of our constituents. Mr. Speaker, weather affects all of us each and every day. It is a constant presence in our lives. Extreme weather events, which are becoming more se-vere and more frequent, are damaging lives and property in my home State of Texas, across the continental U.S., and all the way to the islands of Hawaii. Sadly, the devastation caused by tor-nadoes, hurricanes, and other severe weather incidents have become a far more familiar occurrence and, really, too much of it for far more Americans. It should go without saying that we need to help Americans avoid and cope with these potentially devastating events by utilizing the very best weather forecasting and warning capa-bilities. In that regard, the National Weather Service and the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, or NOAA, play a central role in protecting the lives and property of every American. H.R. 353 will help accelerate innovation that NOAA can make use of, turning cut-ting-edge weather research into essen-tial weather forecasting tools and prod-ucts; tools the forecasters can then use to protect American lives. The legislation improves collabora-tion and cooperation within NOAA and removes barriers that exist between the weather research community, our Nation’s forecasters, and the private sector weather enterprise. Improving these relationships will strengthen the accuracy and timing of our weather predictions and, ultimately, will save lives and make our communities safer. H.R. 353 also reauthorizes NOAA’s tsunami warning activities. Commu-nities along our Western Coasts are particularly impacted by the threat of tsunamis. While this bill reauthorizes tsunami warning and research activi-ties at NOAA, it does so at a level far below current agency spending. Such a cut makes little sense. Even in a tough fiscal climate, we should be wary of cuts to programs that negatively affect our ability to protect American lives and property from natural disasters. I want to applaud Environment Sub-committee Ranking Member S
UZANNE  B
ONAMICI for her fight to retain fund-ing for these programs at their current level, and I hope that we can work to-gether with our colleagues to maintain current tsunami funding when it comes time for appropriations. Mr. Speaker, strengthening our resil-ience to severe weather events is both vital and necessary to strengthen our Nation’s economic security. H.R. 353 will advance our weather forecasting capabilities, and I urge my colleagues to support its passage. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. BIGGS), who is the chair-man of the Environment Sub-committee. Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas, Chairman S
MITH, for yielding me time to speak on this important legislation. It has become increasingly apparent with every major weather event that our forecasting services are des-perately in need of a major overhaul. I am happy to support legislation that will do just that. H.R. 353, the Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act, will put our country’s weather forecasting back on track to provide citizens with life-saving predictions and warnings. I specifically point to this bill’s inno-vative language on weather technology planning. H.R. 353 calls on NOAA to evaluate the combination of observing systems it needs to meet weather fore-casting requirements. It also requires the agency to conduct experiments on different observing systems to evaluate their costs and benefits. Such reforms will grant NOAA more flexibility to develop new technologies while scrapping older approaches that do not bring enough value to our fore-casts. We need to better assess our ob-serving system resources instead of continuing to rely on outdated meth-ods. This bill will help push NOAA to con-sider new approaches, including those from the private sector. For its part, the growing private sector has signaled it is ready and willing to work with NOAA to bring better weather fore-casting to our citizens, and we should welcome this development. I am confident that H.R. 353 will cre-ate the kind of meaningful change that we want to see at NOAA. This bill will better protect American lives and prop-erty with more accurate weather fore-casting. I applaud the sponsors. I en-courage all Members to support this bill. Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I con-tinue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. P
ITTENGER ), who is also a member of the Financial Serv-ices Committee. Mr. PITTENGER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his exceptional leadership on this very important leg-islation. In 2012, 7-year-old Jamal Stevens was in his bed when a tornado tore through the house, tossing him onto the em-bankment along Interstate 485, hun-dreds of feet from his room. The warning from the National Weather Service came 10 minutes later,

after the tornado had already touched down. This is because my hometown of Charlotte relies on radar nearly 100 miles away, meaning that the National Weather Service is using weak or inac-curate readings when issuing crucial safety warnings for Charlotteans. In 2013, the current system provided a tornado warning, but for citizens in an entirely wrong neighborhood. More recently, a tornado in December of 2015 struck neighboring Union County with no warning from the National Weather Service. Fortunately, our region has not suf-fered any fatalities due to the inad-equate coverage, but we shouldn’t wait for tragedy to act. The Weather Research and Fore-casting Innovation Act requires the Commerce Department to identify weak coverage areas and identify solu-tions to the problem by improving ex-isting government radars or incor-porating non-Federal radars into the National Weather Service’s operations. Americans across the country rely on the National Weather Service to detect and provide warning for severe weather such as thunderstorms and tornadoes. But Charlotte is currently the largest metropolitan area without an adequate radar coverage. Addressing this short-coming is an important step for public safety. With that in mind, I do urge my col-leagues to support H.R. 353. I thank the chairman so much for his support on this critical legislation. Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I con-tinue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. H
IGGINS ), who is a very active member of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee. Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas, Chairman S
MITH, for yielding me time to highlight my support for H.R. 353, the Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act of 2017. This past weekend, deadly storms ravaged Louisiana’s Third District, my district, tragically taking the lives of Francine Gotch and her 3-year-old daughter, Nevaeh Alexander, when their singlewide trailer flipped during high winds produced by a tornado. The United States was once at the forefront of weather forecasting; how-ever, that ability has diminished over the years with the capabilities of some other countries now paralleling or even exceeding our own. I do not know if a better weather forecasting service would have made a difference this past weekend. However, as elected officials, we must make it a priority to protect American lives and property to the fullest extent. b1500 We must never waver in this most significant responsibility. This legisla-tion will put America back on track to lead the world in accurately predicting severe weather events with a renewed focus on increasing weather research and placing new technologies into oper-ation. More specifically, this bill also cre-ates a tornado forecasting improve-ment program to develop more accu-rate, effective, and timely tornado forecasts that will allow for increased tornado warning lead times, which is crucial to saving lives and would per-haps have saved the lives of that moth-er and her young daughter this past weekend. Mr. Speaker, with the number of hur-ricanes, floods, and tornadoes that have hit Louisiana in the last few dec-ades, my constituency knows all too well the danger that mother nature can pose, as well as the need for reliable in-formation to adequately prepare for such occurrences. Constituents in my district need good, commonsense legislation like this to protect their families and their property. I applaud the efforts of the Science, Space, and Technology Com-mittee Chairman SMITH and Represent-ative L
UCAS for leading this effort to protect Americans from severe weath-er. Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I re-serve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. B
ANKS ) who is the vice chairman of the Environment Sub-committee. Mr. BANKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his leadership on important issues like these. Unfortunately, my home State of In-diana is no stranger to severe weather. As we enter peak tornado season, my constituents are vulnerable to tornado outbreaks which could lead to loss of life and destruction. Protecting lives and property from severe weather needs to be a top priority at NOAA. I am glad we are addressing this issue for that reason today. This legislation will greatly improve our ability to predict severe weather, like the tornadoes that affect my dis-trict, through a focused program to en-hance forecasting. When mere seconds make the difference between life and death, my constituents deserve the most accurate and timely forecasts available, and I am confident that this legislation will help give them that in-formation. I am also pleased that this bill gives NOAA the ability to incorporate data and forecasting skill from private sec-tor companies like Harris Corporation in northeast Indiana, which employs about 450 engineers and technicians in my district. These talented profes-sionals build the world’s most ad-vanced weather satellite instruments. Many government-operated systems are slow and costly, and the private sector can be used to fill critical weather data needs. Directing NOAA to integrate next-generation commercial solutions improves our ability to pro-tect lives and property. The time to think outside of the gov-ernment-only-weather-data box is now. That is why I applaud the chairman of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, Mr. SMITH, as well as my colleague from Oklahoma (Mr. L
UCAS ) for bringing this important legislation to the forefront. I look forward to its passage into law. Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, in addition to thanking all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who have worked so hard on this legislation, I want to take a moment, also, to thank all of the staff in our of-fices and committee on both sides of the aisle who worked so hard on this legislation. I encourage all my colleagues to sup-port the Weather Research and Fore-casting Innovation Act, which includes the Tsunami Warning, Education, and Research Act. This legislation will im-prove weather forecasting and tsunami preparedness. Mr. Speaker, I encourage everyone to support this bipartisan legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. Mr. Speaker, this bill is the culmina-tion of hard work and negotiations that have spanned 5 years. Today, we finalize this House-initiated weather policy reform legislation that will ben-efit residents throughout the United States. H.R. 353 greatly improves our ability to predict short-term severe weather events. It better protects lives and property, a core mission of NOAA that has needed greater attention in recent years. Again, I want to thank Mr. L
UCAS  and Mr. B
RIDENSTINE for their initia-tive on this issue. I thank the former Environment Subcommittee chairman, Representative C
HRIS STEWART , for his years of commitment to this subject as well. I especially appreciate Ms. B
ONAMICI  and her 5 years of effort to make this a bipartisan bill. I would like to thank the Science, Space, and Technology Subcommittee on Environment staff for their years of effort on this bill, es-pecially Taylor Jordan, who worked diligently to ensure that this bill be-came a reality. I also recognize the mi-nority staff who were central to the process as well. Mr. Speaker, this legislation will transform our weather forecasting abil-ity. It ensures that we, once again, have a world-class forecasting system that will protect lives and property from the dangers of severe weather. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. S

Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-bers may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their re-marks and submit extraneous mate-rials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1343, the Encouraging Employee Own-ership Act. I also want to commend the Republican and Democrat sponsors of this important bill: Mr. HULTGREN of Illinois, Mr. D
ELANEY of Maryland, Mr. H
IGGINS of New York, Mr. M ACARTHUR  of New Jersey, Ms. S
INEMA of Arizona, and Mr. S
TIVERS of Ohio. Their bipartisan efforts resulted in a bipartisan bill that will help small businesses, including startups, to suc-cessfully reward their hardworking em-ployees; and, while doing so, this bill will allow small businesses to effec-tively deploy their capital to grow and to create jobs on Main Streets all across our country. We all know, Mr. Speaker, that small businesses are the heart and soul of the American economy. In fact, they helped create more than 60 percent of the Nation’s net new jobs over the past two decades. So if our Nation is to have a healthier economy that offers more opportunity to more Americans, then we must encourage small-business growth and small-business startups, and this starts with ensuring they have access to the capital and credit they need to grow. Yet as we have heard from countless witnesses who have appeared before the House Financial Services Committee, community banks and credit unions in particular—the primary source of our small-business loans—are simply drowning, Mr. Speaker, in a sea of com-plicated and costly regulations. The same occurs with the maze of burden-some securities regulations that are written with the largest public compa-nies in mind but end up hurting small-er companies. Although small companies are at the forefront of innovation and job cre-ation, they often face significant obsta-cles in obtaining funding in our capital markets. These obstacles often result from the proportionately larger burden that securities regulations place on small companies when they seek to ac-cess capital both in the public and pri-vate markets. These small companies also face dif-ficult challenges on how best they can deploy their limited resources and cap-ital—to grow and thrive or to be able to sufficiently compensate their work-force, which is a critical component of their success. Currently, the SEC allows private companies to offer their own securities to employees as part of written com-pensation agreements without having to comply with burdensome Federal se-curities registration requirements under what is called SEC rule 701. Now, unfortunately, one of the rule’s thresh-olds has not been adjusted in two dec-ades. What the bipartisan supporters of this bill are proposing is simply to modernize this SEC rule with a modest increase in that threshold. Increasing the rule 701 threshold gives private companies more flexi-bility to reward and retain employees and permits private companies to keep valuable, skilled employees without having to use other methods such as borrowing money or selling securities. Updating this rule can encourage more companies to offer more incentives to more employees. As one witness who testified before Congress said, this bill ‘‘would support a valuable compensation practice that allows small businesses to hire the most highly skilled workers’’ and bet-ter enable small, emerging growth companies that are at a competitive disadvantage with bigger businesses to attract and retain employees. Allowing employees to become own-ers in the company also benefits those employees. As startups and small com-panies reach success, we all want their employees to also reap the benefits of that success. That is what is happening with companies that are able to offer stock options as part of their employee compensation plans. For example, when Google was in its early stages, it hired someone to be an in-house, part-time masseuse and com-pensated her with both cash and stock options. That masseuse is now worth millions today. Another example is from an ad-tech company, MoPub. Thirty-six of its 100 employees became millionaires when the company was ac-quired by Twitter because MoPub’s CEO set his employees up for success by offering them performance-based stock-option grants. So, Mr. Speaker, shouldn’t we want more American workers to have the op-portunities like at Google and MoPub? Don’t we want more Americans to have an opportunity to obtain an ownership stake in the places that they work? That way the workers can earn the large financial upside that comes when the company performs well, and the company benefits by being able to at-tract talented workers. Unfortunately, again, Mr. Speaker, too many companies right now shy away from offering employees greater ownership opportunities because an ex-pensive, bureaucratic, burdensome, top-down regulation in Washington hasn’t been updated in nearly 20 years. Mr. Speaker, we can fix that today. We can fix that by passing this common-sense, bipartisan bill, the Encouraging Employee Ownership Act. We can provide American workers with more opportunities to share in the successes and profits of companies they work for. We can help to foster capital formation so more Americans can go back to work, have good careers, pay their mortgages, plan for a secure re-tirement, and ultimately give their families a better life. Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting this common-sense bipartisan legislation, and I re-serve the balance of my time.

b1515 Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. H.R. 1343, Encouraging Employee Ownership Act of 2017, eliminates im-portant disclosures that private com-panies must provide to their employees in the event they are compensating those employees with stock. This bill would limit transparency. If companies want to pay their employees in stocks, they should have to simply disclose to their workers the risks as-sociated with those investments. Currently, private companies can provide up to $5 million worth of stock compensation annually to their em-ployees and are not required to provide any financial disclosure. This bill would lift that cap to $10 million. If companies choose to provide an employee with stock compensation, they should be required to inform that employee of the appropriate financial information, benefits, and the risks as-sociated with that investment, includ-ing 2 years of company financial state-ments. All of this information is com-monly available to typical investors. Let’s be clear: this stock is com-pensation for their work. Employees deserve to understand the value of their compensation prior to accepting it. They deserve the same protections that other investors would get. I agree with Professor Mercer Bullard, who is a professor of law at the University of Mississippi School of Law, who testified before the Capital Markets, Securities, and Investments Subcommittee voicing his concerns about the bill. In his testimony, he noted that to take advantage of the terms of this legislation, an issuer would have to have at least $34 million in total assets. Surely, such minimal disclosures are not too burdensome for those sort of companies. I do also understand that some pro-ponents of this legislation argue that such an exemption is needed because disclosure of company information to employees runs the risk that confiden-tial information could be leaked to competitors. Employees with access to such infor-mation could simply be subject to non-disclosure agreements, which are typ-ical today. Indeed, nondisclosure agree-ments are a simple solution that pro-tects the company, but does not deny the employees the right to understand the worth of, or the risks associated with, the compensation they are re-ceiving. Unfortunately, this bill would limit that transparency and those pro-tections. Mr. Speaker, I oppose this legisla-tion, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. H
UIZENGA ), and I ask unanimous con-sent that he may control that time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I thank the chairman for his lead-ership on this particular issue. Mr. Speaker, small businesses and entrepreneurs are what drive the American economy. I meet with them in my district, the Second District of Michigan, all the time. I know my col-leagues do as well back in their dis-tricts. We see them firsthand. We see first-hand the benefits that their dreams, their innovations, their inspiration, and their hard work provide to our communities. These innovators, entrepreneurs, and risk-takers are critical for our coun-try’s economic growth and prosperity. In fact, small businesses are respon-sible for 60 percent of the Nation’s net new jobs over the past two decades. Not 2 years, not 10 years, but over the last 20 years, the last two decades. If our Nation is going to have an economy that provides opportunity for every American, then we must promote and encourage success and growth in our small businesses and our startups. It is this notion that brings us this leg-islation we are discussing today. H.R. 1343, Encouraging Employee Ownership Act, would simply level the playing field for small companies by updating Federal rules that allow small businesses to better compensate their employees with ownership in their own businesses. Currently, Securities and Exchange Commission rule 701 permits private companies to offer their securities as part of written compensation agree-ments to employees, directors, general partners, trustees, officers, or certain consultants without having to comply with rigid Federal securities registra-tion requirements. SEC rule 701, there-fore, allows small companies to reward its employees. Despite the SEC having the author-ity to increase the $5 million threshold disclosure via rulemaking, the SEC has once again chosen to prioritize highly politicized regulatory undertakings in-stead of focusing on its core mission. That mission includes facilitating cap-ital formation. If the SEC cannot or will not focus its priorities, Congress will. It is imperative that small businesses in west Michigan, all of Michigan, and across America have the ability to compete. A critical element of com-petition and success is for those small businesses to be able to offer com-pensation packages that attract and retain top-tier talent. In today’s world, that includes re-warding employees in stock options. To me, this just makes common sense. Small-business employees have a clear and vested interest in the success of their employer. By increasing the rule 701 threshold to $10 million, it will give private com-panies more flexibility to attract, re-ward, and retain those highly valuable employees. This simple change will allow companies to offer twice as much stock to their employers annually, as they currently can, without having to trigger additional disclosure informa-tion to investors about compensation packages that include these security offerings. By reforming this regulatory burden, startups, small businesses, and emerg-ing growth companies will be better equipped to attract highly talented in-dividuals from companies that are bet-ter capitalized and able to maybe pro-vide some additional cash compensa-tion. By incentivizing employees with stock options, small businesses will now be able to compete on a more level playing field with older, larger, and maybe more established companies. They are going to be able to retain their invaluable employees as well. This bill is an example of the positive bipartisan results that can be achieved when Republicans and Democrats reach across the aisle. I commend the spon-sors of the bill, Representatives Hultgren, Delaney, Higgins, Mac-Arthur, Sinema, and Stivers for their leadership on this issue. I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 1343. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from Min-nesota (Mr. ELLISON ), a member of the Financial Services Committee. Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, the value of companies doesn’t always go up. It is not true that the stock market always goes up and only goes up. It would be nice if Methuselahs at Google and every other company in America could get stock options and end up mil-lionaires, but the truth is the world doesn’t work that way. That is why disclosure is very important. That is why there is nothing wrong and no one objects to employees being com-pensated with stock options, but those employees ought to at least know the value of those stock options. If you give me a check and it has a monetary value, I can read it and I know how much it is. If you give me stock options and you don’t tell me be-cause you don’t have to disclose how much they are worth, then that is not fair, and that is what we object to. This bill simply allows companies to avoid disclosure to employees of what those stock options are worth. That is wrong, and that is why we oppose it. Let me just start in terms of the con-text, Mr. Speaker. Today we consider yet another bill in favor of the moneyed interests. Today we consider another bill that basically helps out people who have a lot while so many Americans are struggling to get by and problems abound almost everywhere. I have got to wonder, of all the things the American public want, why is a revision to the SEC’s rule—section 701, to be precise—the priority for this week? We have been here for about 3 months now. The Republicans have set

the agenda. They are in the majority. They get to decide which bills come up. Why do they keep on bringing up bills that only the moneyed interests want? Mr. Speaker, in the past few months, congressional Republicans—I almost called them corporate Republicans— who decide which bills are the priority, have brought forth a hodgepodge of pieces of legislation. I will just review a few. Republicans made it easier to drug test people receiving unemployment compensation. Do you think the unemployed want that? I doubt it. Republicans have passed and the President even signed a law to protect corporate firms from having to disclose labor violations like wage theft before winning government contracts. I have got a feeling the employees were not calling for that. House and Senate Republicans passed laws that allow internet service pro-viders to sell your browser history. I don’t think most folks on the internet today were clamoring for that gem, which I was proud to vote ‘‘no’’ on. Republicans enacted a new law mak-ing it easier to dump coal debris near rivers and streams. Republicans stopped efforts to help governments around the world avoid corruption. H.J. Res. 41 removed the requirement that corporations disclose resource payments to foreign governments, which is a crushing blow to democracy activists working in fragile nations. Mr. Speaker, this particular piece of legislation comes within a certain kind of context—a context where we are not talking about increase in pay, making people safer, making water cleaner, making foreign governments more hon-est. It is quite the opposite. In the 3 months that we have been back in Congress, these laws removing competition, removing disclosure, and removing consumer privacy are all pri-orities of Republicans, who set the agenda. Mr. Speaker, people who might be clued into this broadcast today need to know what the majority has been up to. It has not been up to business. These are all multinational corporate interests that don’t punish people for polluting, allow them to sell your internet browser’s history, allow them to make money off of testing laid-off workers receiving employment com-pensation that is due them, and don’t make corporate interests disclose pay-ments to foreign governments when they drill for oil and minerals. I just want the American people and Members to understand what is going on here, what is the larger context of this piece of legislation that we look at today. When I talk to my constituents, they don’t bring up any of this stuff. Mr. Speaker, they want to know: Where is the jobs bill? When are we going to get back to work? Somebody said we were going to work on real infrastructure, real fair trade. When is that going to happen? Well, the people who are in charge around here, I guess they are going to get around to it at some point. My constituents say: Can’t we raise the minimum wage from something higher than $7.25 an hour, which is the Federal minimum wage? When is that bill coming up? Or, what about recon-structing our roads and our bridges and allowing us to raise a gas tax to invest in our Nation’s infrastructure? They say they want to increase skills. Let’s invest in preschool, Pell grants, and community college. Let’s put the people, not the corporate wish list, first. Today we are asked to vote on a bill that basically makes it easier for pri-vate companies to provide options, like stocks, rather than compensation to their employees. As I have said, fun-damentally, this may not be a bad thing if disclosure is made. This bill makes it not required. This bill makes it easier for firms to offload some of their options to employees without dis-closing financial information to them. While I am glad to see employers re-ward employees with stock and other compensation in addition to salaries, workers should be told the value of the compensation they receive. I don’t think that is asking too much, Mr. Speaker. With this bill, H.R. 1343, it is possible that employees would be promised stock options which could be worth less than promised or even completely worthless. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota. Mr. ELLISON. Employees could de-cide to forego a salary increase and ac-cept lower pay in order to receive more stock options; yet, those stock options could be worth way less than they ex-pected. Why should employees receive less information than any other minority shareholder? If an employee is trusted enough to run day-to-day aspects of the business, they should be trusted enough to re-ceive full disclosure about the stock. Employees should be able to receive in-formation on the financial position of the company so they can make an edu-cated decision. It is not difficult to allow partici-pating employees to sign nondisclosure agreements, and it can’t be because these disclosures are an additional bur-den on the firm. These firms prepare these types of disclosures to receive rule 701 exemption from the SEC in the first place. b1530 So I am also concerned about the mismatch of power between corpora-tions and their employees, and I am very concerned that employees can be susceptible to pressure. Let me do a quick example. George Maddox was one of 21,000 peo-ple who worked for Enron. After work-ing at Enron for 30 years, he had 14,000 shares of company stock valued at $1.3 million. When Enron collapsed, he had literally nothing, Mr. Speaker. All of his retirement was Enron stocks. If you haven’t watched the movie ‘‘Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room’’ recently, I would urge you to watch it again. You could also read Bethany McLean’s book by the same name. One image consistently stuck with me: a staff rally where leaders extolled the virtues of the firm. Just as we heard on the other side of the aisle a moment ago, leaders whipped employ-ees into a frenzy to buy Enron stock, even as leaders knew it was worthless. In fact, corporate leaders had already sold their stock while urging employ-ees to buy. Enron had a strategy of buying companies and then pressuring new employees to buy Enron stock to keep the stock price inflated. Since Enron usually fired 10 percent of the workers every year, workers felt pres-sured to buy stock to show commit-ment to the firm. I can’t just support a bill that gives employees fewer protections than in-vestors. I can’t support a bill that en-courages employees to possibly forgo cash in their paychecks in exchange for some unverified investment option. It is not right. Mr. Speaker, I see you reaching for the gavel. I will include the rest of my comments in the R
ECORD . I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on this particular piece of legisla-tion until it allows for disclosures. Today we consider another bill requested by corporations. But, I got to wonder, of all the things the American public want, why is a revision to the Securities and Exchange Commission rules— Section 701 to be precise—the priority for this week? We’ve been here for three months now. House Republicans set the agenda. They lead this governing body. Why do they keep bringing us bills that cor-porate America wants? In the past few months, Congressional Re-publicans, who decide which bills are priorities have brought forward a hodgepodge of cor-porate requests. Here are some of the bills that are now law. Republicans made it easier to drug test peo-ple receiving unemployment compensation (H.J. Res. 42). Republicans passed—and the President signed—a law to protect corporate firms from having to disclose labor violations—like wage theft—before winning government contracts (H.J. Res. 37). House and Senate Republicans passed laws that allow internet services providers to sell your browser history. Republicans enacted a new law making it easier to dump coal debris near rivers and streams (H.J. Res. 38). Republicans stopped efforts to help govern-ments around the world avoid corruption. H.J. Res. 41 removed the requirement that corporations disclose resource payments to foreign governments.

Which is a crushing blow to democracy ac-tivists working in fragile nations. And, a law preventing State governments from setting up retirement plans for residents who do not have a work-based plan. So, in the three months we’ve been back, these laws—removing competition, disclosure, and consumer privacy—are the priorities of Republicans who set the agenda. These are all asks of corporate America— don’t punish us for polluting streams; let us sell your internet browser history; let us make money drug testing laid off workers receiving unemployment due them, and; don’t make us disclose our payments to foreign governments when we drill for oil or minerals. When I talk to my constituents, they don’t ask for any of these. They say, ‘‘Where’s the jobs bill?’’ My constituents say, can’t we raise the min-imum wage from $7.25 an hour? They say, our roads and bridges need work. Let’s raise the gas tax a skoch and invest in infrastructure? They say, we want to increase our skills; let’s invest in pre-school, Pell grants and com-munity colleges. Let’s put people, not corporate wish lists— first. But, nope, today we are asked to vote on a bill that makes it easier for private companies to provide options—like stocks—rather than compensation to their employees. This bill makes it easier for firms to offload some of their options to their employees with-out disclosing financial information to them. While I’m glad to see companies reward employees with stock and other compensation in addition to salaries, workers should be told the value of the compensation they receive. With this bill—H.R. 1343—it is possible that employees would be promised stock options which could be worth less than promised, or even, completely worthless. So, employees could decide to forego a sal-ary increase—or accept lower pay—in order to receive more stock options, yet, those stock options could be worth way less than ex-pected. Why should employees receive less infor-mation than that of any other minority share-holder? If an employee is trusted enough to run the day-to-day aspects of the business, they should be trusted enough to receive full disclo-sure about the stock. Employees should be able to receive infor-mation on the financial position of the com-pany so they can make an educated decision. It’s not difficult to allow participating employ-ees to sign non-disclosure agreements. And it can’t be because these disclosures are an additional burden on the firm. Because these companies prepared these types of disclosures to receive the Rule 701 exemption from the SEC in the first place. I’m also concerned about the mismatch in power between the corporations and their em-ployees. I am very concerned that employees can be more susceptible to pressure to take options instead of salary increases. For example, we could ask George Maddox. George was one of the 21,000 people who worked at ENRON. After working at ENRON for 30 years, he had 14,000 shares of company stock. It was valued at $1.3 million. Then ENRON collapsed, and he had literally nothing. All his retirement was in ENRON stocks. If you haven’t watched the movie ENRON: The Smartest Guys in the Room recently, I’d urge you to watch it again. You could also read Bethany McLean’s book by the same name. One image has consistently stuck with me. A staff rally where leadership extolled the virtues of the firm. Leaders whipped employees into a frenzy to buy ENRON stock even as the leaders knew it was worthless. In fact, corporate leaders had already sold their stock while urging employees to buy. ENRON had a strategy of buying companies and then pressuring the new employees to buy ENRON stock to keep the stock price in-flated. And since ENRON usually fired 10% of workers every year, workers felt pressured to buy stock to show a commitment to the firm. I just can’t support a bill that gives employ-ees fewer protections than investors. I can’t support a bill that encourages em-ployees to possibly forego cash in their pay-checks in exchange for some unverified in-vestment option. I don’t think the supporters of this bill are doing this for nefarious reasons. I’m sure they find my reference to Enron hy-perbolic. They might also say that it’s irrelevant since Enron was a public company and we are talk-ing about private companies. So, let’s talk about Palantir Technologies. This $20 billion company convinced top-tier engineers to accept below-market salaries by promising them generous stock options. But some employees who accepted this bar-gain, hoping to make money on selling their shares, cannot sell them. The only buyer of their stocks is Palantir Technologies themselves—or a buyer ap-proved by Palantir Technologies. Palantir is not a small firm. Palantir is the third biggest American tech startup, behind only Uber and AIR B-N-B. It was also founded in 2004, which makes Palantir as old as Facebook—which is a long time to wait to cash in your options. Pushing employees to own more of employ-er’s stock exposes workers—like George Mad-dox—to put all their retirement eggs in one basket—what we call ‘‘concentration risk.’’ I ask this Congress to stop doing the bid-ding of corporate America until we address the priorities of American families and workers. We should increase wages and access to affordable housing, provide clean air and clean water, and protect our privacy. We should not make it easier for employers to pressure workers to choose options over salary without adequate disclosures. Vote no on H.R. 1343. Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Mis-souri (Mr. L
UETKEMEYER ), my fellow subcommittee chairman. Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. I also want to thank the dis-tinguished gentleman from Illinois (Mr. H
ULTGREN ) for his work on this legislation and, more broadly, issues surrounding American entrepreneur-ship. He has been a tireless advocate. Mr. Speaker, over the last 2 weeks, the Subcommittee on Financial Insti-tutions and Consumer Credit, which I chair, has held hearings to examine the impact regulations have had on finan-cial institutions, small businesses, and American consumers. What we have seen is that the burdens stemming from Dodd-Frank and associated Obama era policies continue to harm consumers and small businesses. We have what some have referred to as a two-speed economy. Large banks and their large customers are thriving, but the story isn’t as bright for small businesses. That is why H.R. 1343 is so important. Small businesses and startups don’t necessarily have the same opportunities to access the cap-ital markets as their larger competi-tors, but from a regulatory standpoint, the small guys are treated the same as the big guys. Mr. HULTGREN ’s legislation takes an important step in addressing some of the disparities that exist. H.R. 1343 will allow small businesses to attract and retain employees through incentives similar to those that may be offered by large businesses. Unlike the gentleman who just got done speaking, this is not about Enrons. It is about small busi-nesses that we are talking about. It will also ease some of the report-ing burden on small and emerging busi-nesses. The bill does so simply by in-creasing the SEC rule 701 threshold, taking the existing rule and simply ex-panding it, a figure that hasn’t been touched since 1999. It is essential that Washington take steps to level the playing field for small businesses and eliminate this two-speed economy. The bill the House will consider today is another step to-ward job creation and a more reason-able regulatory environment. I again want to thank and commend Mr. H
ULTGREN for his leadership and ask that my colleagues join me in sup-porting H.R. 1343. Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Mary-land (Mr. D
ELANEY ), a member of the Committee on Financial Services, my classmate, and a cosponsor of this leg-islation. Mr. DELANEY. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friend from Michigan for yielding me this time, the vice ranking member of our committee, and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. H
ULTGREN ), my good friend, for cospon-soring this legislation with me. I do rise in support of H.R. 1343, Mr. Speaker, and I think it is a very simple piece of legislation. The chairman of the committee said it was a simple piece of legislation. It is very straight-forward. It simply raises the threshold as to the amount of stock a private corporation can give its employees, from $5 million to $10 million, without triggering additional disclosure. What this bill is not about is rolling back disclosure because, as a practical matter, it simply defines the threshold as to when additional disclosure is re-quired. That threshold was originally

established in 1988 at $5 million. Five million dollars was good in 1988; it is no longer good in 2017. We have simply escalated that amount by inflation, and we have come up with the number $10 million, which is proposed in the legislation. One of the reasons this legislation does not roll back disclosures, which is a myth that I intend to debunk here this afternoon, is because, as a prac-tical matter, what corporations will do is, in fact, not give additional stock to their employees if, in fact, it triggers additional disclosures. That is what ac-tually happens in the private market is this threshold defines the amount of stock that a company will, in fact, give to its employees in any given year; and, if we don’t raise the cap from $5 million to $10 million, we are effec-tively preventing companies from al-lowing their employees to share in stock ownership. Private companies make decisions, Mr. Speaker, to stay private for many reasons: either because they are too small and they don’t want to go public; or they don’t want to, in fact, disclose their confidential information; or they don’t want the costs or burdens of being a public company; or because they don’t want to give up control. Whatever reason they have, it is a very important decision for a private com-pany to stay private and not go public. The current threshold of $5 million ef-fectively forces a company to make the kind of disclosures it would have to make as a public company if it elects to give more than $5 million of stock to its employees. We, as policymakers, should encour-age more employee ownership in the markets because it is good for both the corporations and the employees. It is good for the corporations because it creates a better culture. It allows the management team and the employees of the company to have a more long- term perspective, and it reduces turn-over, which is one of the highest costs that companies have. So it is very good for the companies. But, in fact, Mr. Speaker, it is even better for the employees. The data sug-gest that companies that have high employee ownership are much less likely to lay off their employees during a recession. So it creates, effectively, better retention, which is obviously in the interest of employees. But the other thing it does—and I think this is the most important point—is it encourages kind of an in-clusive capitalism whereby workers ac-tually own more of the U.S. economy. This is something, as Democrats, we should care about, in particular, be-cause we have talked for many years about how the growth in the U.S. econ-omy and the increases in productivity have disproportionately gone to capital and not to workers. We believe there are many reasons this has occurred, but one of the things we should be advocating for, strongly, is increasing workers’ ownership of capital. It will inevitably lead to more savings among workers, and it will start balancing out the distribution of profits in society. One of the ways we do that is to eliminate the barriers for companies to issue stock to their em-ployees, which is effectively what this bill does. So if we care about this concept of inclusive capitalism, if we believe American workers should own a great-er percentage of the economy and, therefore, benefit from the produc-tivity enhancements that are occurring in the economy and the economic growth that is occurring in the econ-omy, we should put policies in place specifically to make it easier for cor-porations to engage in shared employee ownership, which is exactly what this bill does. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from Maryland. Mr. DELANEY. I had firsthand expe-rience with this prior to coming to Congress. I started two businesses as private companies, and they both be-came publicly traded companies. I shared ownership in those companies broadly with my team. It was very good for my business, and it was very good for hundreds of them when those initial public offerings occurred. So I have firsthand experience with this. I do think it is good public policy across the long term, and I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 1343. Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. H
ULTGREN ), the author of this legisla-tion. Mr. HULTGREN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman. I do want to thank my colleagues for being here. I think this is a really im-portant discussion that we are having today. It is such an honor to serve with all of my colleagues. I do think some who have spoken op-posed to this legislation really don’t understand the impact. There is noth-ing in this legislation that takes away any disclosures. Disclosures still re-main. The same disclosures that have been in place for 30 years remain ex-actly there. This does not have any-thing to do with Enron, a publicly traded company. It is completely dif-ferent. This is private sector. This is opening up opportunity. I think, by ar-guing against this, ultimately, it is taking away opportunity from employ-ees to benefit. It is such a privilege to serve with people like the gentleman from Mary-land (Mr. D
ELANEY ), who was part of this, opening up opportunities to hun-dreds of families. Congressman M
AC- A
RTHUR , similarly, opened up opportu-nities that changed lives, as well as Congressman T
ROTT , who is going to be speaking as well. They opened up op-portunities to people who would never have had opportunity to own a com-pany, to own that and to have it com-pletely change their family and their future. I rise to support H.R. 1343, the En-couraging Employee Ownership Act of 2017. My legislation is based on a simple principle: Employees who own a stake in the company they work for every day want to see it do well and will do their best to make sure that that busi-ness succeeds. Their sense of ownership over details, large and small, makes a real difference to the bottom line and, just as importantly, to the quality of life of the employers and employees. When the company succeeds, the em-ployee succeeds. The business, in turn, receives a large boost in productivity, enabling it to expand its reach and in-vest in new technology and equipment. EEOA would make it easier for com-panies in Illinois and nationwide to let hardworking employees own a stake in the business they pour their sweat into every single day. This benefit also helps companies attract top talent, even if the company is just starting out. Warren Ribley of the Illinois Bio-technology Industry Organization, which represents companies that em-ploy thousands of residents in the 14th Congressional District, believes: ‘‘ . . . offering an ownership stake to employ-ees is a critical tool in recruiting top talent to job-generating companies. And there is no doubt that an equity stake encourages employees to drive hard for success of that enterprise.’’ Unfortunately, some companies are shying away from offering employee ownership because of regulations that limit how much ownership they can safely offer. SEC rule 701 mandates var-ious disclosures for certain privately held companies that use more than $5 million worth of securities for em-ployee compensation per year. This threshold was arbitrarily set by the SEC in 1999. For businesses that want to offer more stock to more em-ployees, this rule forces those busi-nesses to make confidential disclosures that could greatly damage future inno-vation if they fell into the wrong hands; this includes business-sensitive information, including the financials and corresponding materials like fu-ture plans and capital expenditures. The SEC’s original rulemaking ac-knowledged these concerns. And these disclosures aren’t just risky, they are costly. As the Chamber of Commerce has explained, the En-couraging Employee Ownership Act would instead ‘‘help give employees of American businesses a greater chance to participate in the success of their company.’’ EEOA builds off the JOBS Act reform to rule 12(g), which increased the num-ber of shareholders of record that a company could have without SEC reg-istration from 500 to 2,000 and exempt-ed employee compensation securities from the registration requirements. This idea championed in the JOBS Act,

that the law should treat employee compensation securities differently than traditional securities, has not been extended to the SEC rule 701. My bill is simple. It is a bipartisan fix. EEOA raises the outdated thresh-old for enhanced disclosure from $5 million to $10 million, keeping pace with inflation every 5 years. We are taking something that is already work-ing and making it available for even more companies and, more impor-tantly, more employees. To be clear, issuers who are exempt from enhanced disclosure would still have to comply with all pertinent anti-fraud civil liability requirements. Fur-thermore, the employees purchasing these securities observe the business they work for every day and have a closer perspective on its operation that is not available to the traditional in-vestor, thus negating the need for addi-tional disclosure. We should applaud the employee ownership from the board room to the shop floor. I thank the bipartisan cosponsors of this EEOA legislation, especially Con-gressman D
ELANEY for his hard work and Congressmen S
TIVERS , S INEMA , H
IGGINS of New York, M ACARTHUR , G
OTTHEIMER , and T ROTT . I thank Speaker R
YAN and Chairman H EN-
SARLING for their support in advancing this critical legislation. Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I appreciate the comments of my col-league and friend. I do, however, dis-agree that the question here derives from a lack of understanding of the legislation. I think it is entirely pos-sible—in fact, I would suggest that it is likely—that members of a body such as this, from 435 distinct districts and dif-ferent experiences, can look at the same information, fully understand it, and come to different conclusions as to what sort of policy ought to be in place, and that is where I have landed on this particular subject. I fully un-derstand. b1545 I also think it is important to note that we can’t on one hand say that this is not about disclosure and on the other hand mention that these disclo-sure requirements could have a nega-tive impact and encourage or discour-age companies from engaging in the practice of awarding employees with stock as a part of their compensation. It is a question of disclosure. This legislation is about the disclosure re-quirements that should be applied in this case. That is really what we have heard from both sides of this argument: where should that disclosure require-ment be, and at what level should it be incurred? What I would say is—and I think this is important to note, speaking for my-self—I know many other members of the Financial Services Committee and Members of this body that may oppose this legislation feel strongly that the direction toward awarding employees with stock ownership is a positive di-rection. It is something that my friend, Mr. DELANEY , has not only advocated for, but has practiced in his own pri-vate sector experience. It is a positive thing for a company and it is a positive thing for the employees. The only point that I continue to drive home and that others have reiter-ated is that it is important that em-ployees understand the nature of the stock that is being awarded to them and that the disclosure requirements make clear employees are aware of the compensation and its true value. That is really the point of my objection. Mr. Speaker, I include in the R
ECORD  a letter I received from Public Citizen, which articulates some of these same arguments. 
PUBLIC CITIZEN, Washington, DC, March 8, 2017. M
EMBER , House Committee on Financial Services, Washington, DC. D
EARREPRESENTATIVE : On behalf of more than 400,000 members and supporters of Pub-lic Citizen, we offer the following comments on bills facing a committee vote March 9, 2017. In securities lawmaking, we believe the committee’s compass should always point to investor protection. Well informed investors who can trust disclosures form the bedrock of capital formation. We are concerned that a few of these measures point in a different direction. HR 910: The ‘‘Fair Access to Investor Re-search Act of 2017’’ directs the SEC to elimi-nate restrictions on research reports that cover Exchange Traded Funds (ETEs). The result of this measure means that firms pro-moting ETFs can simultaneously publish re-ports that appear to be impartial analysis. This may lead investors to take unwarranted comfort in the security. In the last decade, ETFs have grown from about 100 funds with $100 billion in assets to more than 1300 funds with $1.8 trillion in assets,That makes the playing field for mischief immense. Puffery parading as research led to the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s, where ana-lysts disregarded fundamental metrics such as a revenue and income when recom-mending the purchase of new internet-based firms. This measure improves on a previous iteration of the legislation by allowing fun-damental fraud oversight by the SEC. But the bill ignores the basic hazard that a firm’s motivation in funding research may be sales promotion and not bona fide education for its clients. We also note that ETFs represent the securities of active firms. That is, an ETF holds assets such as stocks or bonds. That means this has little to do with capital formation. Now, research reports insulated from government scrutiny may too often serve to promote more turnover and commis-sions, not sound guidance. For these reasons, we oppose this bill and encourage members to vote no. HR 1343: The ‘‘Encouraging Employee Own-ership Act of 2017’’ increases from $5 million to $10 million the amount of securities a firm may sell annually to its employees without providing certain basic financial informa-tion. We believe this is misguided for a num-ber of reasons. First, defenders of this meas-ure reference the potential for leakage of propriety information. There’s little evi-dence of this problem. It’s simply not in the self-interest of an employee-owner to divulge critical information to a rival, especially if it would undermine the value of the stock. Second, employees who are compensated in stock (instead of additional cash) should be entitled to be informed about the financial condition of their company, the same as any other investor. Other company creditors, such as the firm’s bank or major supplier, re-ceive this information, however this measure reduces stock-compensated employees to a class below these other creditors. Young firms may be struggling with cash-flow prob-lems and choose to use stock rather than cash for compensation. But those employees should be informed about such risks. Third, the basic thrust of this measure is to lead employees to hold a greater share of their savings in the firm. An employee invested in his or her own firm may be more productive and lead to greater profits at the firm that the employee then shares; but there is a point beyond which this dynamic dissipates. Any prudent investor should diversify. Over-concentration in one asset, especially where the firm’s prospects are less than stellar, compounds the employee-investor’s risk. We oppose this bill, and encourage members to do the same. HR 1366: The ‘‘U.S. Territories Investor Protection Act’’ extends basic U.S. securities law oversight to investment firms operating in Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories. To date, these firms have escaped oversight, dis-closure and conflict-of-interest requirements that mainland firms face. We support this common sense reform. Sincerely B
ARTLETT NAYLOR , Public Citizen. 
Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the distinguished gentleman from Arkan-sas (Mr. H
ILL). Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Michigan, the distin-guished chairman of the Capital Mar-kets, Securities, and Investments Sub-committee, for yielding the time. Mr. Speaker, what we are here talk-ing about today is opportunity. We are not talking about the money interests. We are not talking about waving the bloody shirt of the Enron debacle. What we are talking about here today, Mr. Speaker, is in the interest of innovators. It is in the interest of tal-ented Millennials who have huge stu-dent loans, who have a great idea to benefit themselves, their community, their economy. We are here to be in the interest of hardworking workers who have no big investment dollars, but have an abundance of sweat equity. We are here in the interest, Mr. Speaker, of building businesses and growing this economy. If we do that, we are growing jobs and opportunity for our citizens. And we are in the interest, Mr. Speak-er, again, not of the money interest, but of efforts all over this country, led by people like J
OHNDELANEY of Mary-land and Stephen Case of Virginia, to build out venture capital and entrepre-neurship in places other than Boston, Massachusetts; Menlo Park; places like Detroit; Flint; Little Rock; St. Louis; and Chicago. That is why we are here today. This bill is a simple, common-sense, small step in that effort. For many years, in my private sector life, I helped young companies form and raise capital for them. In my own business, I extended stock options and

opportunities to buy stock to those very people who did not have the ex-cess cash to invest. Many companies issue stock to compensate their em-ployees, but it is especially important to startup businesses and private busi-nesses. It is especially important to those businesses that are trying to compete with big private enterprises that have a public stock to offer as an incentive. And structuring competitive compensation in private businesses is very challenging. Further, for employees, this stock ownership is a huge source of pride, al-lowing individuals to participate in the growth and prosperity that their hard work and sweat equity have helped build. Through rule 701, the SEC allows pri-vate companies to offer up to $5 million in their own securities without addi-tional regulatory bureaucracy. My friend from Illinois (Mr. H
ULTGREN ) and my friend from Maryland (Mr. D
ELANEY ) have simply made a small change, Mr. Speaker; and that is to raise that commensurate with inflation to $10 million to reflect the world we live in today. This is not rocket science; this is something we need to do for building our economy. As we celebrate the fifth anniversary of the signing of the JOBS Act by President Obama and the successes this legislation has yielded in capital for-mation for small and emerging growth companies, I urge my colleagues to support this effort by my friend from Illinois in this bipartisan, common-sense job-creating proposal. Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gen-tleman from Colorado (Mr. P
OLIS), a member of the Committee on Rules and the Committee on Education and the Workforce. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding the time. Various measurements of the econ-omy have shown economic growth and an increase in the stock market. The frustration that I hear from so many of my constituents is that: With all of this economic growth, why haven’t my prospects improved? Why has there been wage stagnation? Why aren’t my family and I earning any more than I was? It is true, because a lot of the bene-fits of this economic growth have gone to shareholders and consumers rather than workers. We are all consumers, and we have all benefited from that. And do you know what? We are all shareholders through pensions and through retirement accounts, public and private. Many people also put food on their table and pay their rent, wear-ing their hat as an employee or a work-er. One of the things that we can do not just by passing this bill, but by passing a whole host of legal changes both in the tax framework and in the regu-latory framework to make it easier for employees to own companies, is allow employees and workers to share in the value that is being created on the shareholder side of the ledger. Then, and only then, can we have an economy that works for more people rather than just a few. This bill is a small step in that direc-tion. It can reduce the cost and remove a detriment that small to midsize com-panies have from aggressively pursuing employee stock ownership. But it is just a first step. There is a lot of work that we need to do to reorient the economy around a shareholder economy that aligns the incentives of workers with those of shareholders. It is good for sustainable profits, it is good for long-term eco-nomic growth, it is good for stability. It is a better way to make sure that of this vast value that is being created, we all can partake in it on both sides of the ledger, as shareholders and as workers. That is why I rise today in support of the bill, and that is why I call upon my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to see this as but a modest first step to-wards a shareholder economy that works for every worker. Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the balance of time re-maining on each side? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-tleman from Michigan (Mr. HUIZENGA ) has 10 minutes remaining. The gen-tleman from Michigan (Mr. K
ILDEE ) has 10 minutes remaining. Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Geor-gia (Mr. L
OUDERMILK ). Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Michigan for yielding the time. Mr. Speaker, over the last 8 years, our Nation has experienced sluggish economic growth. Americans have suf-fered through stagnant paychecks and a lack of new opportunities. Last year, the economy grew at a meager 1.6 per-cent, which is half of the historic aver-age. However, there has been one job filled that has grown at a faster rate than any other; and that job is those who specialize in regulatory compli-ance. This is a testament to the crush-ing onslaught of new regulations under the previous administration, where compliance with regulation and red tape was emphasized more than grow-ing businesses and creating jobs. We in Congress must do our part to foster economic growth and relieve our job creators of the excessive burden of complying with unnecessary regula-tion. The bill before us today will do exactly that. Currently, businesses that offer more than $5 million in stock to their own employees are required by law to com-ply with costly financial disclosures. This number was set nearly 20 years ago. It is time to update the law and raise this threshold to encourage small-business startups and give them the resources they need to expand and create jobs. The Encouraging Employee Owner-ship Act would raise this threshold to $10 million and give private businesses more flexibility to reward their em-ployees with ownership of a company. This bill passed the Financial Services Committee last month with strong bi-partisan support. This is just one of the many steps that we must take to foster innovation and encourage capital formation, to provide every American with opportu-nities that they deserve. We must build an economy that is open and accessible to every single American, not one that is closed off to those who can’t afford to comply with the high cost of bureau-cratic red tape and endless government paperwork. As a former small-business owner for 20 years, I know the employees benefit tremendously from any opportunity to participate in a company’s success. I support this bill because I know from personal experience this model works and helps startup companies to retain their best employees over the long term. Americans are not satisfied with the stagnant economy that has become the new norm in our Nation. It is unaccept-able for government to stand in the way of prosperity and make it harder for Americans to succeed. Small busi-nesses employ half of U.S. workers, and we must promote, not hinder, small business growth. This bill, Mr. Speaker, empowers Main Street, not Wall Street. I encour-age all of my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I would just point out again that the position many of us are taking does not contradict the principles that are being articulated. In fact, the law does not preclude any company from award-ing stock as compensation at any level. It simply requires that information be provided so that those individuals who are receiving that compensation have the information and have the resources to understand the value of that com-pensation. I just want to reiterate that because it is important that the posi-tion not be mischaracterized as one that wants to dampen the ability of companies to reward their employees with stock or use that as a form of compensation. It is just important that they have transparency in that process so people who are receiving that com-pensation understand its true value. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. T
ROTT ), my fellow Michiganian. Mr. TROTT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1343, the Encouraging Employee Ownership Act. I want to thank my colleagues, Mr. H
ULTGREN and Mr. D ELANEY , for their thoughtful and bipartisan work on this issue. This is a commonsense, simple bill that makes it easier for employees to obtain ownership in the companies

they work for. When I was in the pri-vate sector, I gave dozens of employees an ownership interest. It worked out great for them, it worked out great for the company, and it worked out great for our customers. Ownership interest gave them an upside that could not be realized through a salary. The stock in-stilled loyalty and dedication. More importantly, it created a family at-mosphere. We were all in it together. Our opportunities would rise and fall, depending on our collective success. To have a career where someday, through your hard work, you can end up owning a piece of action is what the American Dream is all about. The out-dated cap is keeping this dream, for no good reason, from many Americans. I suspect that those who oppose the bill, while they may understand the legislation, probably have never worked in the private sector and have no clue how meaningful incentives and opportunities, such as stock ownership, are to individuals. I found it was the best way to motivate and reward em-ployees. In fact, it worked so well, no one ever left the company except to re-tire. My friends from Michigan and Min-nesota oppose the bill because of a lack of transparency. The argument is flawed because it assumes stock owner-ship opportunities comprise all or a significant portion of the individual’s compensation. This is not correct. A stock ownership benefit is typically over and above salary and bonuses. To require the owner of a small busi-ness or a startup to make disclosures will cause many employers not to give employees this opportunity. Implicit in their argument is an assumption, like in so many other areas of life, that in-dividuals cannot be trusted to make decisions on their own, that they need the help of all of the smart politicians and bureaucrats in Washington, D.C., to tell them what to do and what they need to see, and, of course, we cannot trust people to make decisions and dis-cern for themselves whether stock ownership is a fair opportunity. This bill had the support of a bipar-tisan group in our committee. I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 1343. b1600 Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Z
ELDIN ). Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1343, the Encouraging Employee Ownership Act of 2017. This is bipartisan legisla-tion that will remove outdated barriers to capital formation and job creation imposed on the small businesses and startups that are driving America’s in-novation economy. The SEC still hasn’t updated a rule from 17 years ago that imposed an undue burden on entrepreneurs when they want to attract and retain talent through employee compensation plans. Startup ventures, by offering their em-ployees a stake in the company through equity and other forms of de-ferred compensation, can reward hard-working employees by giving them di-rect ownership while their business continues to grow. SEC rules governing these compensa-tion plans haven’t been updated since 1999, and they are imposing burden-some compliance and reporting re-quirements on the very entrepreneurs we should be encouraging to expand and create more good-paying, private sector jobs. We see the effects of this compliance tax placing a drain on our economy because it diverts the re-sources and human capital of entre-preneurs away from expansion and job creation. In my district on Long Island and na-tionwide, entrepreneurs who have the next great invention or idea are strug-gling to gain access to capital. By reg-ulating small startup ventures as if they are large, publicly traded compa-nies, the SEC is imposing an unneces-sary mound of paperwork on startups. A large corporation may have the law-yers and accountants to fill out the mountain of paperwork imposed on them by the SEC, but a small business can’t compete, and that is why they need relief. This Congress we have an oppor-tunity through bipartisan reforms like this legislation to reverse that trou-bling trend by removing the regulatory burdens that harm the economy, con-sumers, and prospects for job growth. In closing, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from the Com-mittee on Financial Services, RANDY  H
ULTGREN , for his leadership on this issue. I urge adoption of this commonsense bipartisan bill. Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the balance of time re-maining on each side? The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. S
HIMKUS ). The gentleman from Michi-gan (Mr. H
UIZENGA ) has 31⁄2minutes re-maining. The gentleman from Michi-gan (Mr. K
ILDEE ) has 9 minutes remain-ing. Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. T
ENNEY ). Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1343, which passed the Committee on Financial Services by a very large bipartisan vote of 48–11. I thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. H
ULTGREN ) and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. D
ELANEY ) for introducing this essential piece of legislation. As the coowner of a small manufac-turing business in New York, this legis-lation would help companies in New York and across our Nation to grow stronger while allowing hardworking employees to have a stake in a busi-ness’ future through ownership. Company leaders across America un-derstand that greater employee invest-ment through ownership will develop a stronger workplace culture and in-crease productivity by giving private companies more flexibility in retaining and rewarding employees, the people we so vitally need to grow our busi-nesses. I want to thank the sponsors of this bill, and I urge my colleagues to sup-port this legislation. Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to close. I have heard a number of my col-leagues point to the red tape and the unnecessary burdens that are placed on a company that wishes to provide stock compensation. Let me be clear about what it is that we would require. This is what is re-quired for a company that exceeds the threshold: That they provide a copy of the compensation plan or a contract, if they disclose that; a copy of a sum-mary plan description, if it is an ERISA retirement plan or, if not, a summary of the plan’s material terms; risk factors associated with the stock; and the company’s most recent finan-cial statements from the last 2 years, which don’t need to be audited. This is important information for anyone receiving stock as compensa-tion in order to understand the value of that stock and not a burdensome re-quirement on a company, particularly a company of the size that would be re-quired under the increased threshold that is being proposed by this law. If there is any aspect of this debate which is common sense, it is common sense that a person receiving com-pensation ought to have information that tells them the value of that com-pensation. Mr. Speaker, I think this is an impor-tant debate and discussion. It is one that this body is well-served by taking on. I do agree, as I said, that this is an important direction for us to take as a nation. And it certainly makes sense that, in order for us to fully all partici-pate in the economy, employee owner-ship is a value. It creates more produc-tive companies, more competitive com-panies. It provides better compensa-tion, and, as has been pointed out, it creates more stable organizations less likely to lay people off, more likely to be sustainable companies. That is all good, and that is important. It comes down to the question of transparency. Employees deserve to know the state of their employer’s fi-nances, if they are to accept stock in lieu of monetary compensation. They deserve no less protection than other investors in the company. We shouldn’t fear that kind of trans-parency. A company that wants its em-ployees to accept stock instead of mon-etary compensation should embrace this sort of compensation. If they want to empower those employees and they want to make them a part of the com-pany, they should provide them with

the information that helps them under-stand the value of that ownership. Transparency is important for indi-viduals to make informed choices, not informed choices coming from a dic-tate from Washington but information that they have the right to have. It empowers them with knowledge that allows them to make choices about the form of compensation that they would accept. That is what this legislation really is about, and that is why I oppose the leg-islation and encourage my colleagues to join me in that. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to close. My colleague on the other side is try-ing to maybe split some hairs. We heard some rhetoric earlier on the floor here which, I think, shows why many on both sides of the aisle scratch their heads in opposition to this bill. We heard about monied interests. We heard about corporate wish lists. We heard about Enron which is, by the way, a publicly traded company which has absolutely nothing to do with this bill. Now, that all might play really well on a leftwing political base, but that is detached from the realities of what our economy is about. As we have talked, 60 percent of all new job creation happens in small busi-nesses. These are not corporations. These are LLCs, limited liability cor-porations. These are subchapter S sole proprietorships. These are small entre-preneurs and innovators. By the way, I looked up the defini-tion of innovator. It is a person who in-troduces new methods, ideas, or prod-ucts. Those are the kind of dynamic elements that we are seeing here. And I think this confusion between corpora-tions and Enron and what we are try-ing to do here is really a disservice to the American people. This is about making sure that we update basically an inflation escalator from 1988. We update a rule that the SEC could have the power to do, which it has not done, that benefits employ-ees and benefits those owner-employ-er’s workers who oftentimes, more often than not, work alongside their employees. So they are the ones who are seeing this on a daily basis. I can just say to you that, as was pointed out by my colleague from across the aisle from Maryland, if we don’t do this, what most of those small businesses are going to do is say: You know what, it is just not worth the ef-fort; I am not going to do it. And we will see that lack of upside going to those employees. As was pointed out by my fellow col-league from Michigan, this is beyond their salary, this is beyond bonuses. This is an additional way to make sure that those relationships get cemented in. So, at a minimum, all you would be doing is voting to confirm the inflation escalator from 1988. It is not a radical change to the law. This is a common-sense, I believe, innovative way of try-ing to make sure that this next genera-tion of workers has the ability to real-ly reap the benefits of success here in the United States. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired. 
AMENDMENT NO . 1 OFFERED BY MR . POLIS  
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 printed in House Report 115–75. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol-lows: 
Page 2, after line 2, insert the following: 
SEC. 3. GAO REPORT ON IMPACT ON EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP. 
Not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Comptroller Gen-eral of the United States shall submit to Congress a report on the impact on employee ownership of the revisions required by sec-tion 2, including the impact on— (1) the number of employees participating in compensatory benefit plans; and (2) diversification of the securities held by employee pension benefit plans subject to title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.). 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-ant to House Resolution 240, the gen-tleman from Colorado (Mr. P
OLIS) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado. Mr. POLIS. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, my amendment would require GAO to do a study on the im-pact of this legislation on employee ownership. When employees are offered the opportunity to have an ownership stake in the place they work, there are benefits for both workers and busi-nesses in our entire economy. Many studies have shown that em-ployee ownership increases produc-tivity, promotes employee retention and stability, and has long-term growth benefits for the business. I be-lieve that the underlying legislation is an important first step to increase em-ployee ownership opportunities, but we should want to make sure that oppor-tunities for participation are widely available to employees at different in-come levels. The amendment also requests the GAO to see the effect of this legislation on the diversification of securities held in ERISA-governed retirement plans. As we all know, diversification in any type of financial portfolio can help weather dramatic fluctuations in the economy and limit financial risk for retirees. By requesting the GAO study, we will be able to understand this legislation’s full impact on employee ownership and make necessary changes and improve-ments in the future. I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. H
ULTGREN ) for the purpose of a colloquy. Mr. HULTGREN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. POLIS) for offering this important amendment to study the impact of this legislation on employee ownership. I believe that employee ownership opportunities should be made widely available to all employees of a com-pany, from the boardroom to the shop floor. As the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. P
OLIS) stated, this legislation is an im-portant step forward to increasing ownership opportunities and gives com-panies more flexibility to make those opportunities available. We should understand how this legis-lation would help increase participa-tion for employees at all key levels. A study will help us understand what we can do in the future to incentivize em-ployee ownership and increase em-ployee ownership participation. If the gentleman would withdraw his amendment, I would like to work with him in requesting GAO to carry out this study. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. H
ULTGREN ), and I take the gentleman at his word. I look forward to working with him on this important issue in co-ordination with GAO. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-sent to withdraw my amendment. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Colorado? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The amendment is withdrawn. Pursuant to the rule, the previous question is ordered on the bill, as amended. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. 
MOTION TO RECOMMIT  
Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill? Mr. SWALWELL of California. I am opposed in its current form. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to recom-mit. The Clerk read as follows: 
Mr. Swalwell of California moves to recom-mit the bill H.R. 1343 to the Committee on Financial Services with instructions to re-port the same back to the House forthwith with the following amendment: Add at the end the following: 
SEC. 3. PROHIBITION. 
Any exemption, safe harbor, or other au-thority provided by this Act or a regulation issued pursuant to this Act shall not apply to an issuer if the issuer or a director, offi-cer, or affiliate of the issuer has withheld in-formation from Congress relevant to its in-vestigation of any collusion between persons associated with the Russian Government and persons associated with the presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump to influence the outcome of the 2016 United States presi-dential election.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-ant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. S
WALWELL ) is recog-nized for 5 minutes in support of his motion. Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill. It will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended. Russia attacked our democracy this past Presidential election. This motion asks Members of this House: Do you want to do something about it? Do you want to do all you can to make sure it doesn’t happen again? b1615 If you do, support this amendment. If you don’t, vote against it, and watch Russia and other adversaries of ours with similar cyber capabilities carry out similar attacks, and the very de-mocracy that we treasure will erode before our eyes. But I believe we are a better body than one that would let an-other country attack us and then di-vide us. What does this motion to recommit do? It requires any company—particu-larly, I am concerned about financial institutions—to cooperate with all in-vestigations into collusion between President Trump, his campaign, his family, his businesses, and anyone on his team and Russia’s interference campaign during the 2016 election. The evidence is overwhelming. In the 2016 election, Russia ran a multifaceted electronic interference campaign against our democracy. They used paid social media trolls. They hacked Democratic emails and disseminated the information in those emails through cutouts like WikiLeaks and Guccifer 2.0. They had a clear pref-erence for Donald Trump as their can-didate. It was ordered by their own President, Vladimir Putin. And most concerning for every per-son in this House—should be—they are sharpening their knives, and they in-tend to do it again. That was the final finding in the intelligence report. They are sharpening their knives and intend to do it again not just to the United States, but to our allies like France and Germany, who are a part of the best check on Russia, the NATO alli-ance. Why are we concerned about finances and companies cooperating with the United States in this investigation? Well, we know from the Kremlin’s playbook that they use financial en-tanglements as a means to recruit indi-viduals or to peddle influence. Why are we concerned about finan-cial ties among Donald Trump and his team? Because unlike any Presidential candidate in the history of our Presi-dential elections, there are an unprece-dented amount of personal, political, and financial ties to a foreign adver-sary. They include, but are not limited to: Paul Manafort, where it is alleged he was paid by pro-Russian Ukraine Gov-ernment individuals and also paid up to $10 million a year by Vladimir Putin’s associates; Former national security adviser Mi-chael Flynn, who should have known better as the former Director of the De-fense Intelligence Agency, should have known about Russia’s playbook and their ability to influence people, but after leaving the DIA, went over to Moscow, sat next to Vladimir Putin, and was paid by Russia’s propaganda tool, Russia Today, also known as RT, who General Flynn would have known is an arm of Russia’s intelligence serv-ices; Donald J. Trump, Jr., who said in 2008, in terms of high-end product in-flux into the United States, Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross section of a lot of our assets. In Dubai, and certainly with our project in SoHo, and anywhere in New York, we see a lot of money pouring in from Russia; President Trump, who has invested in the past in Russia: over half a dozen trademarks granted to him in Russia, a vodka brand he tried to peddle in Rus-sia, a Miss Universe contest that he held in Moscow in 2013, and Russia has invested in our President. There are Russian businessowners who have bought condos in his Trump Tower building. There are loans from banks that have paid fines for laundering money through Russia. There is a home sale in 2008 where the President reaped 129 percent in profit. He bought a home in 2004 in West Palm Beach for $40 million; sold it in 2008, as the real estate market was collapsing, for over $90 million; sold it to a Russian busi-nessman known as the fertilizer king. No one else in that ZIP Code reaped a profit of 129 percent. So why are banks particularly rel-evant for this motion? We know they are used by Russia to move money and extend influence. Their cooperation will be crucial to understanding how Russia finances its interference cam-paign. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this motion to recommit and get to the bottom of exactly what hap-pened with Russia. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the motion. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-tleman from Michigan is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I just want to point out a couple of things. The Senate Banking Committee has moved an identical bill forward, unani-mously, recently. Regarding the subject matter that the gentleman from California was throwing out, this bill is not about anything other than providing hard-working Americans an opportunity to succeed. It is not about relitigating the last election or even about Susan Rice illegally unmasking American citizens. This is about an underlying bill that will help American citizens. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this motion to recommit, and I urge them to vote ‘‘yes’’ on the underlying bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is or-dered on the motion to recommit. There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-ant to clause 9 of rule XX, the Chair will reduce to 5 minutes the minimum time for any electronic vote on the question of passage of the bill. The vote was taken by electronic de-vice, and there were—yeas 185, nays 228, not voting 16, as follows:

REMOVAL OF NAME OF MEMBER AS COSPONSOR OF H.J. RES. 50 Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to have my name removed as a cosponsor of H.J. Res. 50.

EQUAL PAY DAY (Ms. M
CSALLY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her re-marks.) Ms. M
CSALLY. Mr. Speaker, since the passage of the Equal Pay Act in 1963, it has been illegal for an employer to pay a woman less than a man for the same work. But the unfortunate re-ality is that today, over 50 years later, women are still making less than men, and that is unacceptable. Labor Department statistics cite, when comparing median salaries for all annual full-time jobs, women are mak-ing 81 cents on the dollar compared to men. Some of this is from blatant bias and discrimination, which is illegal and unacceptable. But most of the pay gap comes from factors like women going into lower-paying career fields; seeking flexibility since they are still primary caregivers for children and, in-creasingly, parents; or not being able to afford child care. Here in the House, I am working on putting forward ideas and solutions to empower women to close this pay gap. Last year I joined my colleagues to create and lead a Working Group on Women in the 21st century workforce. It is examining the challenges women still face and working to expand equal opportunity and improve outcomes for all women. Mr. Speaker, I have been fighting for women my whole life. I know we still have work to do, and I am committed to making equal opportunity for women a reality. After all, this is America and we pick the best man for the job, even if she is a woman, and that means making sure she is getting paid what she deserves.

b1700 CONGRATULATING TEXAS WES-LEYAN MEN’S BASKETBALL TEAM (Mr. VEASEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my alma mater, Texas Wesleyan University. On March 21, 2017, Texas Wesleyan’s men’s bas-ketball team brought home their sec-ond NAIA title to Fort Worth, Texas. From the start, Texas Wesleyan Rams were up against a tough fight as they faced off with Life University in the championship match. Thanks to the Ram’s MVP, Dion Rog-ers, who scored 28 points in the final match, and with another 21 points scored by Ryan Harris, the Rams were led to victory. But the road to the championship wasn’t easy. The Rams showed true perseverance, heart, and dedication to win 5 games in 6 days against the toughest competition in the Nation. Congratulations to the Rams, the coaching staff, parents, families, and the city of Fort Worth for this hard fought victory. Go Rams. Mr. Speaker, the Rams were not the only team making Fort Worth proud. Just 9 days later, Texas Christian Uni-versity across town also won a cham-pionship, and my colleague, KAY G
RANGER , who represents west Fort Worth, is here to tell that story. 
f 
CONGRATULATING TEXAS CHRIS-TIAN UNIVERSITY’S MEN’S BAS-KETBALL TEAM (Ms. GRANGER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Texas Chris-tian University’s men’s basketball team on their National Invitational Tournament championship. After a 12-win season last year, the Horned Frogs showed the grit and te-nacity my hometown of Fort Worth is known for. They finished the season with 24 wins. With their win over the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets in the title game last week, the Horned Frogs capped off a memorable and historic comeback sea-son. In fact, this 2017 NIT title is Texas Christian University’s first postseason championship in school history. I want to recognize the TCU players and coaches for a job well done. Go Frogs. 
f 
EQUAL PAY DAY (Mr. ESPAILLAT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Equal Pay Day. The year is 2017, and women, especially women of color, still earn significantly less than their male counterparts. Pay inequality disproportionately impacts women of color. For example, White women earn 80 cents to every dollar that her White male counterpart makes, African-American women earn an average of 63 cents per every dollar, and Latina women on average earn 54 cents for every dollar. This may seem like mere pennies on the dollar, but, over a lifetime, this translates to an estimated loss of al-most $700,000 for a high school graduate and $1.2 million for a college graduate. $1.2 million—can you imagine what these earnings mean to working fami-lies of today? That is health insurance, retirement savings, and food on the table. Unequal pay for equal work just doesn’t add up. It is morally and math-ematically wrong. Pay inequality is not only a women’s issue, but a family issue. To my male colleagues, I ask: In 2017, do you not believe in strong women? In 2017, do you not believe in equality? f 
NATIONAL PET ADOPTION DAY (Mr. WILLIAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to talk about H. Res. 133, a bill I introduced with my friend and Texas colleague, Congressman M
ARCVEASEY . This resolution expresses support for the designation of April 11 as National Pet Adoption Day and the month of April as National Pet Adoption Month. Simply, we are aiming to highlight the importance of pet adoption. Mr. Speaker, each year, 2.7 million adoptable dogs and cats are euthanized in the United States. As a rancher and lifelong animal lover, this is heart-breaking. The Humane Society of the United States, ASPCA, Animal Welfare Insti-tute, and local shelters such as PAWS Shelter of Central Texas have endorsed this resolution. Mr. Speaker, we request that the President issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to observe April 11 as National Pet Adop-tion Day and the month of April as Na-tional Pet Adoption Month. More than 60 Members of Congress have signed on to our bipartisan reso-lution, and I encourage others to do so. For those who may be watching this back home, call your Representative in Washington and have them support this bill. In God We Trust. 
f 
EQUAL PAY DAY (Mr. PANETTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Equal Pay Day. This day marks how far into this year that a woman must work to earn what a man earned up to December 31 of last year. In the United States, a woman is paid 20 percent less than her male counter-part. In California, a woman earns 86 percent of what men earn. Pay dispari-ties in California are even more stark for women of color. Latinas make just 56 percent of what a man makes. In order to continue to close the pay gap, Congress must pass the Paycheck

Fairness Act. That law would strength-en the Equal Pay Act by requiring em-ployers to demonstrate that wage dif-ferences are not due to gender, and they would hold employers accountable for discriminatory actions. This bill, which I proudly cospon-sored, is only one step forward. Con-gress must also pass legislation to ad-dress family leave and fight to protect a woman’s right to choose, because, ul-timately, the challenges and burdens women face are shared by all Ameri-cans, and when half of our citizenry is in any way impeded from their full po-tential, all of our country suffers.

MICHIGAN FARMERS AND TRUCKERS AID WILDFIRE VICTIMS (Mr. MITCHELL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the selfless actions of farmers in my district and across Michigan. In early March, wildfires spread through Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, and Colorado, devastating fami-lies and destroying crops and live-stock—farmers’ income for next year. Hearing of the devastation, Michigan farmers and truckers mobilized quickly to bring aid to the farmers in need of immediate assistance. Selfless individ-uals have donated their resources, in-cluding over 250 bales of hay, fencing, cattle feed, financial support, and more. Convoys of volunteers, farmers, and truckers have volunteered their time and their vehicles to drive these resources hundreds of miles to affected areas. Farmers in 68 of 83 Michigan counties have donated supplies or driv-en to deliver aid, and their efforts are expanding. This weekend, 50 students from Sanilac County 4–H are delivering aid to Ashland. These selfless acts are truly inspiring and humbling. I am proud to recognize their efforts and was happy to be able to aid some of these efforts by getting permits issued for their travel. 
f 
EQUAL PAY DAY (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, it is Equal Pay Day, and I am privileged to rise in support of the Paycheck Fair-ness Act today. This legislation would strengthen the Equal Pay Act of 1963 by ensuring that women can hold em-ployers accountable for what they earn and challenge discrimination. Rep-resentative R
OSA DELAURO has intro-duced this bill for two decades, which is two decades too long. Women in Ohio make 75 cents for every dollar a man makes, which is un-acceptable. It is time we close the dec-ades-old loophole that prevents the United States from closing this gender pay gap once and for all. The Paycheck Fairness Act would close loopholes in the Equal Pay Act of 1963, by holding employers accountable for discriminatory practices. The bill would end the practice of pay secrecy, ease workers’ ability to individually or jointly challenge pay discrimination, and strengthen the available remedies for wronged employees. President Trump said on equal pay: ‘‘If they do the same job, they should get the same pay.’’ Boy, do I agree. So let’s make it happen. f 
WAS SURVEILLANCE OF TRUMP ILLEGAL? (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, criminal laws may well have been bro-ken when the Obama administration conducted surveillance of candidate and then-President-elect Trump and those close to him, including his fam-ily members. It is reported that a former national security adviser under President Obama ordered the names of Trump as-sociates to be revealed rather than kept confidential, as would normally be the case with any American citizen. This exposing and disseminating per-sonal information may well have been a criminal act. A serious question is: Who authorized the surveillance in the first place? To direct intelligence or law enforcement agencies to conduct surveillance of political opponents is a violation of the Constitution and a threat to our democracy. But the Obama administration wrongfully asked the IRS to target conservative organizations, so anything is possible. One thing is for sure—the American people need to learn a lot more about what the Obama administration did and who did it. 
f 
NEW YORK IS NUMBER ONE IN CLOSING THE GAP (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York asked and was given permis-sion to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, think all the way back to New Year’s Day—94 days ago— and contemplate for just a moment the fact that if a full-time working woman were to take all of the money she made between way back then and today, and she added that to what she had made working all of last year, well, she just now would have an amount equal to what a typical man made just last year. Well, welcome to Equal Pay Day. The exact size of the gender pay gap can vary. It tends to be smaller when you are younger, worse when you are older, and worse still if you are a woman of color. Even where you choose to live can make a difference. My thanks to the Democratic staff of the Joint Economic Committee, where I sit as the ranking member, for pro-ducing a new report that updates all these numbers, as well as State-by- State numbers on the gender wage gap. I encourage all my colleagues to take a look at this report to see just how your State is doing. The best news I read all day was that New York State is number one. That was good news. f 
RECOGNIZING GREENBERG TRAURIG (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Greenberg Traurig, an iconic law firm located in my congressional district whose growth, over the past 50 years, has been symbolic of the growth of our south Florida community. In 1967, attorneys Larry Hoffman, Mel Greenberg, and Robert Traurig saw an opportunity to capitalize on south Florida’s emergence as a center of global commerce and joined together to found the law firm Greenberg Traurig Hoffman. Over time, these vi-sionaries played an important role in defining the south Florida skyline and its corporate landscape. Now their firm has expanded across Florida, across our country, and even internationally. Fifty years after its founding, Green-berg Traurig today has more than 2,000 attorneys practicing in 38 locations on three continents. With a culture strongly rooted in providing legal ex-cellence for clients and an unparalleled commitment to community service, Greenberg Traurig prospered and grew alongside Miami to the extent that both are now global influencers. I am truly proud to have Greenberg Traurig, founded in my congressional district, as a continued partner in the growth of south Florida, and I wish the firm another 50 years of continued suc-cess.

RECOGNIZING ZACH MAIORANA AND HIS BATTLE WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of my con-stituent, Zach Maiorana, and his ongo-ing battle with cystic fibrosis. At birth, Zach was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis and has been courageously bat-tling this condition for the past 2
1⁄2 years. Cystic fibrosis is a complex, genetic disease that primarily affects the lungs and digestive systems. Those diagnosed with CF require intensive daily treat-ment and regular physician visits to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Despite this diagnosis, Zach and his family have channeled their deter-mination into becoming advocates for those impacted by cystic fibrosis—a true testament to their perseverance and will to live their lives to the fullest extent possible. Now it is up to us. This Congress can be the one to prioritize research and

funding to combat this disease and con-tinue making progress. In 1955, chil-dren born with CF likely would not make it through elementary school. Today, more than half of those living with CF are older than age 18, and many are living into their thirties, for-ties, and beyond. Investment into new therapies for this disease and contin-uous focus on improvement have made promising gains for those suffering with CF. I commend Zach and the entire Maiorana family for their strength, and I hope that my colleagues will stand up to cystic fibrosis and advocate for all those who are affected in this country.

b1715 JOBS AND TRADE The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. G
AETZ ). Under the Speaker’s an-nounced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. K

USH) in the beginning of our Special Order this evening. 
REMEMBERING DR . MARTIN LUTHER KING , JR., 
ON THE ANNIVERSARY OF HIS DEATH  
Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, I commend Representative K
APTUR for her out-standing leadership in this Congress and past Congresses. She has been a beacon of hope for so many of my con-stituents and so many poor and disen-franchised Americans. She never cow-ered in the face of those who restrict the rights of all. Ms. K
APTUR has been my friend and someone whom I have shared so many conversations with about justice and fighting for justice, creating a nation where all people have the opportunity to have freedom, justice, and equality. I want to commend her for being such a stalwart battler for the people of America. Mr. Speaker, today marks the 49th anniversary of one of the darkest days in the history of this Nation: the day that Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., America’s drum major for justice, was assassinated. Dr. King was murdered while stand-ing on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee, on April 4, 1968. He was there to advocate for the rights of Black sanitation workers who were fighting for their dignity: for equal pay, for equal treatment, and for racial justice in the American work-place. In one of the dimmest hours in our history, a voice of reason, a voice of mercy, a voice of compassion, a voice for justice, a voice of the beloved com-munity was silenced. Yet, Mr. Speaker, his work to hold the United States to its constitutional promises that are rooted in the very fabric of our Dec-laration of Independence remains largely incomplete. As you know, Mr. Speaker, America remains a divided nation, even more so now. We are tremendously discon-nected from the ideals set forth by Dr. King’s monumental ‘‘I Have a Dream’’ speech. Today, we still live in two Americas: one white and privileged, an-other filled with people of color, the poor, the disabled, and those lost in the margins, where people of color—Black and Brown—continue to be judged by the color of their skin rather than the content of their character. In the year 2017, Mr. Speaker, we find the names of countless men and women who have lost their lives at the hands of too many law enforcement officials and too many police departments all across this country. Those individuals, Mr. Speaker, are now etched in the so-cial justice history of this Nation be-cause they were first judged by the color of their skin and not by the con-tent of their character. The list is far-reaching, Mr. Speaker. I am speaking of Michael Brown, Tamir Rice, Freddie Gray, Laquan McDonald, Alton Sterling, Philando Castile, Rekia Boyd, Tanisha Anderson, Yvette Smith, Shereese Francis, and, lastly, 4- year-old Aiyana Stanley-Jones and so many, many others. I could go on and on and on, but the names of the men, women, and children victimized by er-rant and wayward police departments all across this Nation would keep us here for days, even months, if we were to recite them all. These stalwart young citizens are joined also by the many martyrs who lost their lives in the struggle for American justice, just like Dr. King: Viola Liuzzo; Emmett Till; Jimmie Lee Jackson; Medgar Evers; Chaney, Good-man, and Schwerner; the four little girls in Birmingham, Alabama; Fred Hampton; and many, many others who gave their lives during the fifties and sixties. In my hometown of Chicago, Mr. Speaker, the killing of Laquan McDon-ald rocked our city and the Nation by pulling the scab off a festering wound of police relations and the Black com-munity. McDonald’s death by 16 shots from a single police weapon fired by a police officer led to multiple investigations of previous police-involved shootings and also sparked the investigation by the United States Department of Justice under then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch and the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois. That investigation concluded that the Chicago Police Department officers en-gage ‘‘in a pattern or practice of using force, including deadly force,’’ that is a unreasonable. This report also found the Chicago Police Department has failed to hold officers accountable when they use force contrary to De-partment policy or otherwise commit misconduct. To put it bluntly, Mr. Speaker, the Department of Justice found and re-ported that the Chicago Police Depart-ment engages in force in violation of the United States Constitution. Mr. Speaker, I am here today because I am just beside myself. I am angry. I am so fed up, Mr. Speaker, because I learned recently that Attorney General Jefferson Sessions has issued a memo-randum ordering officials at the Jus-tice Department to review police re-form consent agreements all across the country, including the agreement that is being negotiated with the City of Chicago. Mr. Speaker, our Nation has fallen so very, very far. Dr. King’s dream has not been realized in this Nation. The day before his assassination—this At-torney General has retreated so very, very far from the high ideals of Amer-ican justice. It is proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that police agencies—not all po-lice officers, not all agencies, not all departments—but there are too many police departments, too many law en-forcement officials, too many police of-ficers who have wantonly killed inno-cent young men of color in this Nation, and it did not just begin in this year. It has been going on for decades. We are now at a point where some depart-ments have been placed under a con-sent decree. The U.S. Attorney is now trying to retreat from that pattern. I am here, Mr. Speaker, to ask—to demand—that Attorney General Ses-sions retreat from his position, that he stop this memorandum from circu-lating in the department, and that he see the light of day that many inno-cent American citizens are being killed because of the wayward actions of those police officers who think that they are above the law. They can’t just continue to kill wantonly and think that they are above the American law and the American Constitution. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, Congress-man R
USHis always calling the Nation to its higher principles. I thank him so very much for sharing our Special Order this evening. Congressman D
AVID CICILLINE of Rhode Island is here on the floor. I also want to thank Congressman J
OHN G
ARAMENDI for sharing his hour with us. The focus tonight really is on jobs and trade, an issue on the mind of mil-lions and millions of Americans. We have been joined by Congressman B
RENDAN BOYLE of Philadelphia, Penn-sylvania, as well. I will place this up for the Nation to see. It is a chart showing just U.S. trade relations with Mexico and Can-ada and what has happened since the deal was negotiated back in the early 1990s. It was also prepared before that, during the 1980s, when the United States actually had some trade sur-pluses on this continent with both Can-ada and Mexico. This shows, in 1994, when NAFTA was actually enacted. You could see the United States begin to kind of fall into deficit. Then we had just a precipitous trade deficit, including the collapse of the peso after the NAFTA trade agree-ment was signed.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2681 April 4, 2017 
This is serious business for our coun-try because this red ink represents lost jobs, lost productive power, and com-munities in disrepair across this coun-try, where production units were just picked up and put either north or south of the border. Tonight, we want to focus on Presi-dent Trump’s Manufacturing Jobs Ini-tiative, which he announced during the campaign and afterwards. Here were his words: 
Everything is going to be based on bring-ing our jobs back, the good jobs, the real jobs. They have to come back. 
Well, after all we have lost, we cer-tainly do need job creation in this country. b1730 We are now into the third month of Mr. Trump’s Presidency and closing in on his first 100 days in office, a period when most Presidents are able to pass something through this Congress that really matters to the American people. I remember when we were able to save Social Security back during the 1980s and when a Congress was elected in re-sponse to Ronald Reagan’s excesses, and it was in the first quarter of the year that that was done. So we are waiting. It is 100 days now, and nothing significant has been done on the jobs and trade front. Candidate Donald Trump’s campaign for President in my region of America was actually founded on the principle of fixing jobs and trade. People lis-tened. But if we look at this first 100 days, we see that he has really taken a back seat to his billionaire donors and their interests and a staff that seems to be more and more peopled with indi-viduals who spent a whole lot of time at Goldman Sachs, which is a company that has been notorious in helping to outsource jobs. Throughout the campaign, Mr. Trump touted his trade policies, assur-ing voters he would renegotiate NAFTA. Well, we have been waiting. During a debate, he said: ‘‘NAFTA is the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere, but certainly ever signed in this country.’’ I would say that that agreement is the foundational agreement, the pre-cepts on which all subsequent trade deals have been negotiated that have placed America in a red ink position: many more imports coming into this country, many more of our jobs being outsourced elsewhere than our exports going out. So I ask: Are the strong planks for a new NAFTA part of what the Trump administration is proposing? Well, no. A leaked draft notice last week revealed a tepid agenda on trade that is little more than a rehash of what the President said in his cam-paign rhetoric. It is not a real plan. The one action item identified in the Trump trade agenda is the announce-ment of a study to find out why the United States is losing in global trade. It actually doesn’t focus completely on NAFTA itself, and we need healing in this hemisphere before we start look-ing around the world. The reality is we know why the def-icit is so bad. Bad trade deals have led to a loss of nearly 4 million American jobs and a deficit just last month of $43.6 billion. President Trump promised a trade deal that would get Americans back to work and reduce our deficit. Instead, our deficit with NAFTA and Mexico and Canada is 31 percent high-er. It got worse than a year ago. So I hope the President understands the real urgency of stopping U.S. job out-sourcing, especially in the manufac-turing sector. He should do more than pay lipservice. He should really take a look at how thin his administration proposals have been on renegotiating this agreement. He should establish real goals and timetables for U.S. trade to drive policy that will fix these job- killing trade agreements and deliver real benefits for the American people. Now, we have Members who have been very active on this trade issue since being sworn in here in Congress. Mr. Speaker, I yield now to Congress-man D
AVID CICILLINE , former mayor of Providence, Rhode Island, and a very strong leader for working men and women across this country. Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I want to begin by thanking her for her ex-traordinary leadership on this issue. From the very day that I arrived in Congress, she has been a passionate, ar-ticulate, effective voice for working men and women and for the impact that bad trade agreements have had on the economy of this country and on her region, but on working families all across America. She has done it con-sistently and relentlessly. It has been a privilege to work with her, but I really do want to acknowledge her extraor-dinary leadership and thank her for convening this Special Order hour to-night. As Ms. K
APTUR mentioned, the con-sequences of bad trade agreements have been felt by many regions throughout the country, but in my home State of Rhode Island, as an ex-ample, we lost more than 41,000 jobs since NAFTA was enacted. These are good wages. These are jobs that pay, on average, above nonmanufacturing jobs—jobs that really help build the economy of our State and of this coun-try. When President Trump was elected, as Ms. K
APTUR mentioned, during the course of his campaign he promised that he would do something different with our trade deals. He promised hard-working Americans that he would de-liver results, but we are now 10 weeks into his Presidency, and we have seen a lot of talk and no action on fair trade. The President promised to label China a currency manipulator on day one. He hasn’t done that. The President promised to use Amer-ican steel for the pipelines. He hasn’t done that. The President promised to make NAFTA work for American workers, but as Congresswoman KAPTUR men-tioned, there is a leaked letter from the White House that shows he is al-ready looking to implement the same failed policies that are good for cor-porate America and bad for American workers. The executive orders that President Trump signed failed to address the real challenges that are facing hard work-ing Rhode Islanders and hardworking Americans. Let’s be very clear, Mr. Speaker, we don’t need another report on trade pol-icy. We need concrete actions that cre-ate good-paying jobs, that honor hard work with good wages and grow our economy. We need to end incentives that encourage corporations to ship jobs overseas and raise the Federal minimum wage. And while we should collect unpaid penalties, that is only going to happen if the President takes real action to clamp down on cheating, end job-killing trade deals, and create new standards that benefit working Americans. It already seems that President Trump’s campaign promises to get tough on trade were all bark and no bite. If President Trump does indeed deliver on his promise to renegotiate NAFTA, any new agreement must in-clude strong labor and environmental standards, strong Buy America provi-sions, prescription drug cost reduc-tions, enforceable currency manipula-tion standards, and other pro-worker, pro-consumer requirements. Mr. Speaker, there is a terrific publi-cation that I know you are aware of en-titled ‘‘The New Rules of the Road: A Progressive Approach to Globalization,’’ prepared by Jared Bernstein, who is a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a former chief economist and economic adviser to Vice President Biden; and Lori Wallach, a lawyer and someone who has been director of Public Citi-zen’s Global Trade Watch since 1995. It really sets forth the kind of prin-ciples that should guide a new trade deal: that we need to ensure that, first of all, the way it is negotiated ensures that it is going to benefit working men and women. We cannot allow corporate elites to dictate how NAFTA is renego-tiated. The agreement could poten-tially become more damaging for work-ing families and for our environment in the countries that we work with. If done wrong, it could increase job offshoring, push down wages, and ex-pand the special power and protections that NAFTA provides to corporate in-terests that are reflected in the origi-nal deal. What we have to ensure is that what President Trump doesn’t do is make a bad trade deal worse and pander to cor-porate and multinational corporations and his sort of crony friends, and the process by which this will be renegoti-ated will help to determine that. The provisions that are in it need to be

guided by what is good for American workers and what is good to help grow American jobs. So not unlike so many other areas, it is disappointing because there has been a lot of good rhetoric about this, but very little action by the administra-tion. I think we are all here tonight to participate in this Special Order led by the gentlewoman from Ohio to let the administration know that we are not going anywhere, that we are going to demand that NAFTA be renegotiated, that it be a trade deal that works for American jobs and American workers, and we are not going to allow the President to simply use rhetoric but actually not do the hard work to strike a better deal for American jobs and American workers. I want to just end where I began, by thanking the gentlewoman for yield-ing. This is an issue of tremendous im-portance to my home State, where manufacturing is so important, the birthplace of the American industrial revolution, and one of the reasons I continue to work hard on the whole Make It In America agenda. We need to start creating conditions for the cre-ation of good manufacturing jobs here in America so we can export American- made goods, not American jobs. I thank again the gentlewoman for yielding. Ms. KAPTUR. I thank Congressman C
ICILLINE . He hit it right on the head. We ought to be exporting goods, not importing this many more than we ex-port, and we ought to be creating jobs right here. I am sure he has seen com-panies from his community, from his State, literally picked up and then magically transported to some other environment, like Mexico, in one of the maquiladoras, and maybe windshield wipers or plastic parts or auto parts that used to be made in the United States then are made down there. I cer-tainly have seen it. Mr. CICILLINE. Absolutely. Ms. KAPTUR. If we look at this chart, just for those who are listening to us this evening, if you go back to the mid-1970s, as Congressman C
ICILLINE pointed out, you will see the United States was pretty buoyant. We were actually exporting more than we were importing. But then when China Most Favored Nation passed in 1979, 1994 NAFTA passed, and all of a sudden what was happening is the reverse flow started. We started importing more than we were exporting, and every time you get a billion dollars of red ink, you lose 5,000 more jobs in this country. Well, my gosh, as NAFTA actually took full bore and then China perma-nent normal trade relations took effect here, CAFTA, which was the Central American Free Trade Agreement, here was the Colombian Free Trade Agree-ment, here was the Korean Free Trade Agreement, every single agreement that happened, we ended up getting more imports into our country than ex-ports out, and promises were not kept. Our focus tonight is mainly on NAFTA, but if we look at Korea, they were supposed to be taking 50,000 cars from us. We were supposed to have more balanced trade. Well, guess what, they didn’t keep up their end of the bargain. Other markets around the world, such as Japan, remain closed to this day to cars from other places in the world. You say: Congresswoman, that can’t be possible. I have seen it with my own eyes. I have visited there many times. When I first began my career, Japan had about—oh, 3 percent of the cars on their streets were from anyplace else in the world. Today maybe it is 4 percent, maybe it is 3.5 percent, but there are all kinds of nontariff barriers where they keep cars out. Yet you look at our country, they have put manufacturing plants here, they send product over here. It simply isn’t a two-way street, and Japan is the second largest market in the world for automobiles. So the trade isn’t fair. The American people know this. They are trying to fix this. It really requires the President’s lead-ership to do it. Congressman CICILLINE talked about steel trade—I just want to put on the Record—with China, and we see what a big player she is in the market and doesn’t play fair. I just want to put some numbers on the Record. China’s expansion of steel since 2000 has grown to over 2,300 million metric tons. That is a big number to imagine. But only 1,500 million metric tons are needed to actually serve the global marketplace. So what you have got is over 800 mil-lion metric tons of steel just floating around the world in warehouses and stored up in provinces in China, and they are dumping the steel. Why does that matter? Because in places like I represent, Lorain, Ohio, U.S. Steel just pink- slipped hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of more workers. Republic Steel, which sits next door to U.S. Steel, has shuttered their plant be-cause of imported steel. The President could do something about that. He could have done some-thing about that the second day he was in office. Nothing has been done. All these workers, some of whom have worked in these plants for 28 years, in modernized plants where hundreds of millions of dollars of investment have been made to upgrade the capacity of these plants, rather than save that ca-pacity for our country for the years ahead and to try to deal with this Chi-nese dumping, they are allowing more workers and more companies to go belly up in this country. It is wrong. It is wrong. This needs to be fixed. This is big time for jobs and economic growth in our country. I want to thank Congressman B
RENDAN F. B OYLE , who understands this problem full well. As a younger Member of Congress and one who really speaks on behalf of working men and women in Pennsylvania and coast to coast, I thank him so much for taking time and joining us tonight. I yield to the gentleman. Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsyl-vania. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentle-woman for yielding. I have to say that the working people of not just Ohio but this country are very lucky to have MARCY KAPTUR fighting for them and for her years of service. There is not a more passionate champion for working Americans in this House than the gen-tlewoman from Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I come here not with a prepared text, but really to speak from my heart. As the son of two hard-working parents who were working in industries that were supported by orga-nized labor, and it depresses me to see the great decline in our workforce today that is in a union. Now, the subject that we are speak-ing about tonight is about the trade deficit, and I just started talking about unions. To some that might seem as if I am off topic, but there is no question the two are absolutely related. b1745 Mr. Speaker, I want to correct a fal-lacy that sometimes is out there about those of us who may be critical about NAFTA and other trade deals. I am not antitrade. I recognize that the United States of America, despite being a large country of over 320 million peo-ple, we are only 5 percent of the world’s population. We must engage in trade with the rest of the world. I also look at those economic statistics that tell us, without question, the most produc-tive workforce in the world today is the American worker. So if the grounds of trade are fair and if the rules of the game are fair, we can compete with anyone. Our workers can compete and outcompete anyone in the world. But, Mr. Speaker, they have not been fighting on a fair playing field. Now, let’s not forget that over the last 20 to 23 years or so since NAFTA was passed, that happens to also coin-cide with this point in American his-tory in which most wages have been stagnant. Indeed, for middle class peo-ple and lower middle class folks, their real wages have declined, not to men-tion the most lower income quintile, which has seen a dramatic drop in real wages. I think that it would be unfair for any of us to say that this is because of NAFTA or that this is because of any specific trade deal. But it is also very fair for us to point out that none of these trade deals did anything to raise the living standards and wages of American workers. Here we are in an environment in Congress in which, re-cently, we were talking about the TPP and moving forward with other trade deals and talking about nothing really to raise wages and living standards for our own workers here at home. Look at the example of NAFTA, something that was promised to raise wage standards in Mexico, that we would benefit from having on our

southern border a country with a rising middle class population. There is no question that would be in the best in-terest of the United States and, obvi-ously, in the best interest of Mexico. However, Mr. Speaker, here we are in the last few years with more jobs going to Mexico, including the closing of the Nabisco plant in my district that I stood on the well of the House floor and protested against. It goes to a nice new facility in Monterrey, Mexico. Is that helping to raise wages in Mexico? Actually, wages are lower today in Mexico than they were 3 years ago. That is an economic fact. Under the letter of the law of NAFTA, that is something that our ad-ministration could take up with our Mexican counterparts, but they don’t. Instead, we see Nabisco. And I am tak-ing one specific example because it af-fected my district. We see them closing a plant that had existed in Philadel-phia since before my parents were born lay off 325 workers, lay off double that in Chicago, and move to Monterrey, Mexico, which they can do in accord-ance with NAFTA. If we are going to move forward with new trade deals, which inevitably at some point in years moving forward we will, I would simply ask—and strongly suggest—that we look out not just for the corporate interest, not just for what is in the best interest of con-sumers, but also what is in the best in-terest of American workers. We should not be surprised that we see this tumult in the United States politically at the same time that we are seeing stagnant wages and stag-nant benefits for decades. Those two are inextricably linked. Mr. Speaker, finally, let me say to all those who are interested in working on this trade issue on both sides of the aisle: You have committed and pas-sionate public servants on this side of the aisle who want to get it right, who want to ensure that we finally have trade deals that put American workers first and foremost. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman B
OYLE . He has raised so many important issues tonight on jobs and trade and how we fix this problem for the people of our country and, frankly, the world. One of the issues is which banks are actually financing this outsourcing. I can tell you, they are not banks in the communities that I represent. They are not big enough to put all that money, to actually take these big companies and move them out of the United States and plunk them down in a Third World environment. It is largely Wall Street banks that do that. So they fly over the heads of people that live in communities across this country. The gentleman talked about Nabisco moving. I had an experience. I went out to Newton, Iowa, a few years ago when Maytag was closing. I felt so bad as an American that a gold star label com-pany that had manufactured reliable, high-quality products in our country was closing. I learned what was hap-pening. What I didn’t realize was that the production that closed in Newton, Iowa, large parts of it were moved south of the border. I was traveling down to Monterrey, Mexico. I was going down there, actu-ally, to find out what had happened to someone who was murdered, who had been a student in our community and was murdered in Monterrey, Mexico. We went by this big complex that said Maytag, Amana, all of these American companies that had been outsourced to Monterrey. I said: Stop the cab. I am taking a picture. This is exactly what I am talking about. I said: Let me ask a question to some of the people that were walking by and living in the area. I said: Can the peo-ple who work in that Maytag plant in Monterrey, can they afford to buy the washers they make? Guess what? No. In fact, where they lived, there was no running water. There was no decent water to drink. I thought: This is what we stand for as a country? What is wrong with this picture? For our country, in districts like mine, the results of all this lop-sided trade are that citizens in north-ern Ohio, on average, are earning $7,000 less than they did when this century began, because of this. The playing field is simply not level. Several years ago, I was visited by a group of United Automobile Workers from Milwaukee, Wisconsin. They told me—and I just love these wonderful, generous human beings. They had all been pink-slipped. They had just lost their jobs. They came to see me to tell me their stories on trade and what it had done to them. They said: Marcy, we are training those who are going to replace us in Mexico. But we went down to Mexico, and we felt so sorry to see where the people lived and the conditions under which they were working that we are collecting medical items, and we are doing humanitarian shipments to that town. I thought: Oh, my goodness, what a generous group of Americans who are facing such horror in their own lives and yet they were doing that for people who live on this continent—and were, by the way, going to be earning, like, one-twentieth of what the workers in Milwaukee earned. So it was all about cheap labor. I really felt bad for the cheapening of the Maytag product. I am probably going to get in trouble for saying that, but it is the truth. I certainly learned a lesson by traveling to Newton, Iowa. Now, another story, this is on plastic seals. I happened to visit a plant in the Tijuana area, and I walked through the plant in Mexico. This company had been moved from Ohio and its equip-ment shipped down to Mexico. I walked through this plant. It was about 100 degrees that particular day. I turned the corner. There were no fans taking out the exhaust. It was bloody hot, and it had to be 110 degrees. These men were working. They had T-shirts on. It was very hot that summer. They were pulling down these large levers because they were melting plastic and rubber. I witnessed this. I thought: Boy, that really looks dan-gerous with that thing that they are pulling down because it was moving like this. I thought: Boy, they have got to really pay attention every time they move that steam press down so they don’t catch their arm in there. I took pictures, and I sent them back to Ohio. I got a letter from one of my constituents. This constituent said: Congresswoman, did you really take a look at the picture you took? I thought: Well, yeah, I was looking at the workers. He said: No. No. Look at the ma-chine, the machine, up in the right- hand corner, the button with the tape over it. I said: Oh, yeah. He said: I used to do that job. Do you know what that button is? I said: No. He said: That is the safety button. In other words, when the equipment was shipped and the machine started, life wasn’t worth as much in Mexico, so these workers were working with much greater risk of injury to themselves be-cause the equipment had been tinkered with in a way that told me a lot about health and safety standards and how they are really not enforced in places like Mexico. I finally want to end with a story that relates to trade. It doesn’t just have to do with goods. It has to do with human beings, with people, and why re-negotiating trade deals is so important for what our Constitution says we stand for: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. This is a country that be-lieves in liberty and justice for all. It has to do with the undocumented workers in our country who are coming from south of our border. We hear all kinds of rhetoric about that, but the truth is that I face the re-ality of what happened in the agricul-tural sector with NAFTA. What hap-pened is we wanted two-way trade with Mexico, but what the trade agreement did is it caused great problems in Mex-ico in that over 2 million small farmers in Mexico were displaced by the NAFTA agreement because our coun-try was 18 times more efficient in corn agriculture than the Mexican people. These workers and owners of these lit-tle ejidos, these little, tiny farms that were subsistence farms, they were just completely obliterated—2 million or more people. Well, guess what? When you lose your livelihood and the trade agree-ment doesn’t provide for readjustment, what do you think desperate people do? They run anywhere to eat, and north of the border looks pretty attractive. As I heard all of these speeches dur-ing the campaign about what we are going to do on trade and how we are going to fix everything, I have never heard any of the major candidates talk

about: How are you going to fix the problem for the people in Mexico who lost their livelihoods, their ability to produce for themselves? The undocumented worker problem has a big, big root in Mexico. It was an uncaring set of governments that nego-tiated these agreements that caused that hemorrhage that creates an end-less flow of people who are desperate, who will do anything to survive. You wouldn’t want this to happen to your family. I am all for yellow corn from the United States. I eat corn. I just served it the other night to our family. But when a trade agreement wipes out the livelihoods of millions of people, it up-sets an entire continent. So now the solution is not to figure out a way to have readjustment in agriculture in Mexico as part of a renegotiated NAFTA agreement; the answer is sup-posed to be a wall. Do you know what? Walls don’t feed people. Proper trade agreements feed people when they are done the right way and you don’t obliterate people’s lives. That is what really matters. When I see what the White House is producing, I haven’t seen anything yet that really gets us to balanced trade accounts in a way that people matter and the communities in which they live matter. And it isn’t always a de-fault to what Wall Street wants and cheap labor and substandard working conditions and substandard living con-ditions. We have to do better than that. We have to aspire to a system where peo-ple are invited into a trade union in which we have rising standards of liv-ing, where we have balanced trade ac-counts again, and where people’s in-comes and living standards rise. If we don’t get there, we are going to have even greater social problems on this continent. Today, I met with El Salvadoran workers, talking about the conditions in that country, what has happened there with the maquiladoras and the situations that people face in their daily lives. This race to the bottom is not working. It is not working in our country. It is not working in the Latin American countries or in Canada. We simply have to aspire to the highest values that founded this country. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-woman from Connecticut (Ms. D
ELAURO ), someone who knows all about those values. Congresswoman R
OSADELAURO is a true leader of our trade efforts to reform this really ter-rible trade regimen that isn’t helping anyone but the wealthiest investors who have invested in the movement of these companies abroad. Connecticut we think of as an east-ern State close to New York, but Con-necticut has been battered in so many corners by trade. Congresswoman R
OSA D
ELAURO is an indefatigable Member of the House. I don’t know how the people of Connecticut found her, but keep sending her here because she really does her job with distinction. I thank her so much for joining us this evening. b1800 Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, what a great compliment from someone who is a tigress when it comes to making sure that the working people in her commu-nity are represented—that their inter-ests, their families, and their economic security are represented—and who fights on a daily basis to make sure that our families have the economic wherewithal with which to succeed. The gentlewoman from Ohio is some-one who really knows that the biggest problem that we face today in this Na-tion is that people are in jobs that just don’t pay them enough; and that they can’t make it, that they are struggling. When you lay on top of that the di-rection that our trade agreements have taken us, it reinforces the fact of their lack of wages and of income inequality. And you can’t have a discussion about income inequality in this Nation today without starting with wages. I am struck by those people who tell us that all of this wage stagnation and income inequality is the fault of globalization and technology. No, that is not the case. You just listen to Nobel Laureate Joseph Stiglitz, who said that this inequality and the depression of wages has come from public policy choices. And we have made the wrong public policy choices, as has been evi-denced by my colleague’s comments. We support a trade policy that puts American workers before corporate in-terests. And although President Trump made trade a central focus of his cam-paign and he promised to fight for working men and women, the broken promises are piling up. I am deeply disturbed—I know my colleague is—that President Trump’s Commerce Secretary, Wilbur Ross, has suggested that the Trans-Pacific Part-nership Agreement is a good place to start for the NAFTA renegotiations. Working men and women deserve a new North American Free Trade Agree-ment, not more of the same corporate- driven trade policies of the failed Trans-Pacific Partnership—an agree-ment, as I said, that, as a candidate, President Trump opposed. He spoke all over the country and told people that it had to go, that he was going to re-negotiate NAFTA. This is not the only about-face that this administration has taken on trade. If you listen to the Economic Policy Institute, China’s past cheating to ma-nipulate the value of their money has left over 5 million Americans without good-paying jobs. Yet, President Trump has failed to deliver on declar-ing China a currency manipulator. He said he was going to do that on day one. And he has yet to act on coun-tering our massive $347 billion trade deficit with China. He missed his promised deadline to start NAFTA renegotiation in his first 100 days. He has already reneged on his Buy American promise that American steel would be required for the Key-stone XL pipeline. They have waived that requirement, and my colleague knows deeply what has happened to steel workers. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I wanted to mention that hundreds and hundreds of steel workers in my district are get-ting laid off right now, as the gentle-woman from Connecticut speaks. We are facing complete closure of two plants. One has already been idled, Republic Steel; and the other, the U.S. Steel plant in Lorain, Ohio, will be by early June. If the President really wanted to do something to make a statement, what he would do is put an embargo on the products that are being dumped by China and Korea on our market that are forcing this to happen at our steel companies. There is a glut in the steel market globally. We have about 800 million metric tons of steel that are out there. What China has been doing is build-ing a steel company in every province to put people to work. Then, what do they do with the steel? They have been storing it because there is so much that the global market can’t absorb 800 million more metric tons. So companies like those I represent get hurt because they are trying to play by the rules; but the rules aren’t being enforced properly, so they end up with the short end of the deal that is absolutely backwards. So what the gentlewoman says about steel is right on. I yield to the gentlewoman from Con-necticut. Ms. D
ELAURO. Mr. Speaker, this has been happening all along in so many sectors. When you talk about the var-ious agreements and NAFTA—and ac-tually with regard to currency—what we fought for in the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement was to do something about currency manipula-tion because everything that may have been negotiated in the NAFTA agree-ment with tariffs and lowering them and all of that, all of that was for naught when Mexico devalued the peso. Once you do that, then your goods are cheaper than our goods and we suffer. It is the same thing that has happened in Korea, and this is what we were looking at in the Trans-Pacific Part-nership Agreement. Despite the Oval Office fanfare last Friday, President Trump’s recent exec-utive orders are, frankly, nothing but window dressing. While initiating a new Federal report—a new Federal re-port, God, there must be unbelievable cavernous institutions and places where we have Federal reports which go nowhere—what they are about is a common way to avoid fixing any prob-lems that we have. The real test is going to be whether or not the Trump administration takes action to create jobs and to reduce the trade deficit. Improving our trade policy requires new rules, not more of the status quo. And it was Mr. Ross who, I believe, said

that: My gosh, you can’t throw out the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement. You have to fiddle around the edges with it. That is where they are going. Again, they are betraying the promises that were made to those workers in your district, those workers in my district, and workers all across the country. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, what the gentlewoman from Connecticut is say-ing is very important because certain States hung in the balance in this past election. Ohio was one of them. Michi-gan, Pennsylvania, obviously Indiana next door was constant. If you look at each one of those States, those were the ones that actually carried for President Trump in the end because of the jobs and trade issue. I yield to the gentlewoman from Con-necticut. Ms. D
ELAURO. Mr. Speaker, that is absolutely right. That was a central part of the election last November. Improving our trade policy requires new rules, as I said, not more status quo. We have to push a trade agenda that will create good-paying jobs and that is going to raise wages here at home. And our coalition is going to continue to hold this administration accountable. What we need to do is to try to reshape the trajectory of modern globalization, one that doesn’t exacer-bate that economic problem that I spoke about people being in jobs that just don’t pay them enough money. The NAFTA agreement put people at such grave risk. I know that the gentlewoman can re-call this as well: we both stood on this House floor all those years ago and we said we were going to lose jobs, that we were going to increase the trade def-icit, and that this was not an agree-ment that would benefit the working men and women of this country. At that time, quite frankly, we were told by the then-Clinton administra-tion that we were thugs, that we did not understand what was happening, that we were protectionist, all kinds of labels against the thinking that we said that this was not going to benefit us. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, does the gentlewoman from Connecticut re-member when Gary Hufbauer said we would have trade surpluses? In other words, this is upside down. It should actually be like this. We would have surpluses then. Well, it is exactly the opposite he testified back then. I will never forget that. The Peterson Institute said we would have jobs, we would have rising in-comes, we would have more benefits for workers. Wrong, wrong, wrong. I yield to the gentlewoman from Con-necticut. Ms. D
ELAURO. Mr. Speaker, we said it then. What we didn’t have at that time was the data, which is now right here on this floor of the House, which is why we were able to defeat the Trans-Pa-cific Partnership Agreement, because they couldn’t fool us again. They could not fool us again. Not us. They couldn’t fool the American people again. We are not going down that road, not with a reheated Trans-Pacific Partner-ship Agreement or a tweaked North American Free Trade Agreement. I said we have to reshape that trajec-tory of modern globalization. It is a trajectory that needs to benefit Amer-ican workers. It has to foster inclusive growth. This is not just about large corpora-tions and special interests that will be the beneficiaries of trade agreements. It is about trade agreements that grow our economy, that grow the economic security of the people of this country. Implementing a new model is not going to be easy. It isn’t going to be easy; we know that. But with so much on the line, we understand that it is our obligation to put the American people first, to set those new rules for a 21st century economy and give it our all. We are going to be absolutely vigi-lant with where the discussions and the negotiations go on a renegotiated NAFTA agreement and future trade agreements that we may embark on. We are not afraid of trade. We just want it to work for the people of this country, and we don’t want to do what has happened to the folks in Mexico and to other countries as well. First and foremost, I will just say that we have to be cognizant of the re-percussions on the standard of living and the quality of life that our people in the United States have. These trade agreements have worked against that, and it is not going to happen again. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Congresswoman DELAURO for her stellar leadership on the trade task force and the work that it has done. The hours and hours of effort on de-feating the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the great assemblage that she gathered and the persistence with which she ap-proached that, seeking to defeat that trade model, which has now been done, and to go back to the drawing board and to fix what is wrong with these, Representative D
ELAURO has been ex-traordinary. I yield to the gentlewoman from Con-necticut. Ms. D
ELAURO. Mr. Speaker, it has been a remarkable coalition, and it is standing strong. It stands strong. I thank the gentlewoman from Ohio for being a central and integral part of this effort. I appreciate that. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Connecticut for coming down this evening. As we complete our work here this evening, I wanted to reissue our invita-tion to Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross to travel to Ohio to come to U.S. Steel in Lorain to really see what is happening there to the workers; and not just Lorain—we are not selfish— but all over this country where steel companies are being harmed because of imports and the fact that China, Korea, and Russia are dumping on the inter-national market. We need to have an embargo. We need to let our industry survive and get over this hump of overcapacity. We are going to need that production in the years ahead, for example, in the natural gas industry for piping and so forth. These are modern plants. Amer-ica should not lose them. We have lost so many steel plants. We can’t afford to lose many more for the sake of the Nation’s defense. I also wanted to invite the President to Ohio. I hope that somebody is listen-ing. He campaigned a great deal in Ohio. I know he likes meeting people, and it certainly would be a good way to see the immediate challenge on the trade front where real lives and liveli-hoods are at stake in this country. b1815 I also just wanted to end by saying this: When you create a system of trade where people are exploited in our country, or in other countries, that really isn’t the best face that America can put forward. And unfortunately, what happens too often in our country now, for example, in trade with Mexico, when you have undocumented workers who come here, many in desperation, many of them are being trafficked across the continent. You say: Oh, Con-gresswoman, what do you mean traf-ficked? I mean, some of them come here because they are desperate, and they end up paying sometimes as much as $8,000 to come here and work at a very low-wage job. They never get out of debt. We have to take that system and move it into the sunlight out of the doldrums, because we can’t treat peo-ple like chattel. There are millions of agricultural workers, for example, who come to this country with no contract. They are completely indentured to whatever coyote brings them across the border. That is not the system I want for this country. That is not fair to those families. It is not fair to their children. It is not fair to the places to which they come in our country. They always feel uncomfortable. What kind of a system, what kind of a trade system would subject them to that? We are a different kind of coun-try. We aspire to higher values. We as-pire to treating people and elevating their worth, not diminishing their worth as human beings. We have a lot to fix in these trade agreements, and I hope that President Trump will join us. I would like to tell him about what coyotes do. I would like to tell him how they behave, how some of them have been involved in murder of individuals from my district who fight for labor rights so that no one is afraid, that people feel that they have a legal system that will defend them. We need to get to that world. Our Constitution intends it for all of the people of our country. We should be-have no differently internationally.

So in closing tonight, I agree with the President. We need good jobs. We need real jobs. They have to come back to this country, and we have to treat people in other countries with worth, with their worth as human beings. We need to get back to trade balances, not trade deficits. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

NO TAX SUBSIDIES FOR STADIUMS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-uary 3, 2017, the gentleman from Okla-homa (Mr. R
USSELL ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the ma-jority leader. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, it is of-ficial: the Oakland Raiders are moving to Las Vegas. Beginning in 2020, they will play in a shiny, new 65,000-seat stadium outfitted with a retractable roof that is expected to cost $1.9 bil-lion. If you are an American taxpayer, you will help pay for it, even if you live no-where near Nevada. About $750 million for the project will be financed through municipal bonds, which are tax ex-empt. The Federal tax break is pro-jected to amount to some $120 million, according to a study by the Brookings Institution. Congress and President Trump should take the Raiders’ bad example as an impetus for reform. As the Presi-dent considers a $1 trillion plan to re-store America’s aging roads, rail, bridges, waterways, and airports, law-makers should ask why so many sta-diums are following the Las Vegas model, fleeing one bad economic State and using your tax dollars to go to an-other. The alternative is what we did in Oklahoma City in 1993. Our residents passed a temporary 1 percent increase in sales tax to fund, without incurring a debt, a building spree called the Met-ropolitan Area Projects, or MAPS. Over 5 years, the plan raised $350 mil-lion for nine projects, including a sta-dium now called the Chesapeake En-ergy Arena, home to NBA basketball’s Oklahoma City Thunder. This pay-as- you-go approach may sound unremarkable, but it is nothing short of exceptional. Most professional sports stadiums these days are financed with municipal bonds, something that they were never intended to be used for. But this kind of debt wasn’t intended for lavish foot-ball stadiums or basketball arenas. Mu-nicipal bonds were supposed to give communities a way to build public projects—hospitals, schools, roads— without having to pay Federal taxes on the debt’s interest. The point was to ease the financial burden on cities and States that invest in expensive but es-sential infrastructure. Over the past 30 years, however, sta-dium financiers have exploited a loop-hole in the Tax Code to qualify profes-sional sports arenas for municipal bonds. Because Federal taxes aren’t in-curred on the interest of this debt, sta-diums essentially receive a multi-million-dollar subsidy from Wash-ington. Last year, a Brookings study exam-ined 45 stadiums built or seriously ren-ovated since 2000; 36 were funded at least in part with municipal bonds, re-sulting in forgone Federal tax revenue of $3.7 billion. That is enough money to employ 88,000 military staff sergeants or give each State a $74 million block grant, or it could help reduce the na-tional debt. To solve this problem, I have intro-duced, along with my Democratic col-league, E
ARL BLUMENAUER from Or-egon, H.R. 811. This bipartisan No Tax Subsidies for Stadiums Act would pro-hibit arena financiers from using mu-nicipal bonds. Instead of building enor-mous, lavish sports facilities on the backs of unsuspecting taxpayers across the Nation, financiers should ask com-munities to buy into their vision. If residents want a stadium to be built, fine. They should be willing to pay for it like we did in Oklahoma City; or sports franchises and leagues always have the option to finance construction like most businesses do, privately. Funding an upgrade to America’s core infrastructure will be a challenge. It shouldn’t require Congress to use budget gimmicks or run up the na-tional debt. Closing loopholes, such as requiring stadium financiers to pay Federal taxes on bond interest that was in-tended to improve our decaying infra-structure, would ensure taxpayers get the best return on their dollars to im-prove public infrastructure that all Americans use. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

DON’T CUT INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS BUDGET The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-uary 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. C
ASTRO ) for 30 minutes. Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I am here this evening joined by col-leagues from the Foreign Affairs Com-mittee to discuss President Trump’s extreme, proposed cuts to the Inter-national Affairs Budget. The President’s budget proposal would reduce funding for the State De-partment and the U.S. Agency for International Development, what we know as USAID, by nearly a third. The proposal would reduce overall funding for the International Affairs Budget by $17.4 billion, or 31 percent. This would be a devastating reduc-tion. U.S. diplomats and development experts work to shape a freer, more se-cure, and more prosperous world while advancing U.S. interests abroad. They build relationships with foreign coun-terparts and resolve disputes to pre-serve peace and reduce the need for military action. They also provide critical services to U.S. citizens living and working over-seas and screen people seeking visas to visit the United States. This work would all be compromised by the ad-ministration’s funding cuts. These cuts could also undercut President Trump’s purported priorities. For example, these reductions could interrupt the Bureau of Counterterror-ism and Countering Violent Extremism and U.S. efforts to disrupt money laun-dering and terror financing. Funding could be slashed for nonproliferation, counternarcotics, and consular af-fairs—efforts specifically focused on protecting Americans from foreign threats. This work overseas is always impor-tant, but it is especially necessary now in this tumultuous time, when the United States faces complex challenges around the world: In Asia, we see increased tensions in the South China Sea and an increas-ingly hostile North Korea. In Africa, there is a devastating fam-ine in East Africa, brutal civil wars, as well as terrorist organizations like Boko Haram and al-Shabaab. The refugee crisis stemming from un-rest in the Middle East continues, and we have just seen reports of more gas attacks on the Syrian people. In South America, the people of Co-lombia have experienced devastating floods that claimed more than 270 lives, a breakdown in the rule of law in the Northern Triangle, and a government in Venezuela that has become an op-pressive dictatorship. Even in Western Europe, we continue to combat terrorist threats from orga-nizations like ISIS, who 2 weeks ago inspired the attack in London. These are challenging times for our world that require a fully funded Inter-national Affairs Budget. But America’s unilateral diplomatic and development work is just one piece of our engage-ment overseas. Following World War II, the United States helped lead the creation of sev-eral multilateral organizations to fos-ter peace and stability in the world like the United Nations, NATO, and the World Bank. With its budget pro-posal and heated rhetoric, the Trump administration is threatening that ar-chitecture of peace and stability. For example, the President rec-ommends cutting funding for multilat-eral development banks by $650 million over 3 years and capping United Na-tions peacekeeping contributions to 25 percent of total funding. These deci-sions will have a significant desta-bilizing impact on the global order. If America retreats from the inter-national stage, other powers, like China, will step in to fill that void and exert their influence. We cannot afford for that to happen. That is why my colleagues and I are here tonight, to speak out against the shortsighted, dangerous budget pro-posal and emphasize the importance of the United States’ diplomatic and de-velopment work.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2687 April 4, 2017 
And with that, I yield to the gen-tleman from New Jersey (Mr. S
IRES). Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, as the rank-ing member of the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee, I am very concerned about these cuts. This undermines our leadership around the world and makes Americans less safe. When you consider that foreign aid is only 1 percent of our entire budget and helps keep Ameri-cans safe, it is an investment in our se-curity. Fully funding our State Department and ensuring our diplomats have the resources they need prevents conflicts, diffuses crises, and works to keep American soldiers out of harm’s way. U.S. foreign aid helps protect some of the world’s poorest people from dis-ease, starvation, and death. President Trump’s own Secretary of Defense, General James Mattis, said: ‘‘If you don’t fund the State Department fully, then I need to buy more ammunition. . . .’’ I signed onto a letter led by Ranking Member E
NGEL , along with my Demo-cratic colleagues on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, urging the Speaker to oppose these draconian cuts. We are already hearing from our al-lies all over the Western Hemisphere how dangerous these cuts could be to the stability of the region. Countries like Colombia fought a 52-year-long war with the FARC guerrillas, and now, when they need us the most to implement the peace deal, the Trump administration has signaled it is ready to abandon one of our strongest part-ners in the world. The President claims to care about protecting our sovereign border, but this budget says otherwise. Both Republican and Democrat ad-ministrations have pushed for a strong security, economic, and trade relation-ship with Mexico. Pushing our neigh-bors away could cost billions of dollars to our U.S. businesses. b1830 Instead of working with our partners in the Western Hemisphere, President Trump is preventing us from maintain-ing a robust relationship with our neighbors to pay for this unrealistic and ineffective wall. In Central America, we risk seeing a repeat of the 2014 crisis when nearly 70,000 children made the dangerous journeys from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador after being threatened with violence, assault, and forced gang recruitment. Our engagement in Cen-tral America is helping to bring calm to the region, and abandoning our friends in their time of need puts America at risk. Retreating from the world will allow other countries like China and Russia to take our place as a global leader. Instead of building a wall, the Presi-dent should continue working with our neighbors to enhance cooperation in-stead of alienating friends who have stood by us for decades. Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I should have mentioned, of course, that Congressman SIRES is the ranking member on the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee on the Foreign Affairs Committee. His experience in that re-gion in particular is vast. I am glad that you mentioned that this is really part of a larger theme and a larger concern, because President Trump, in addition to proposing to cut a lot of funds for diplomacy and devel-opment around the world, has also shown a real hostility towards other nations, including some of our best al-lies and friends around the world, and that is of great concern. For example, this issue with Mexico which you brought up, forcing Mexico to pay for the wall and constructing this wall along the 2,000-mile border that we have between the United States and Mexico and cutting aid if necessary, which he has threatened to do if Mexico won’t pay for it, I have said very clearly that that creates an opportunity for China to step in or the Chinese President Xi Jinping to go into Latin America, go into Mexico and offer to give Mexico whatever Donald Trump takes away. That would strengthen China’s hand in yet another region of the world. Of course, China is a big economic competitor of the United States, and I relate to my Texas folks because Texas does an incredible amount of trade with Mexico, and we have been very fortunate over the years that Mexico buys a lot of our stuff. They buy a lot of our goods. But they don’t have to just buy that stuff from Texas or the United States, generally. They could go buy it from Brazil. They could buy it from China or somewhere else. So thank you for mentioning that. Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I couldn’t agree more. Already we are starting to see the influence of China in most of the countries in South America. You know, I had a conversation with one of the presidents of the colleges in Colombia on one of my trips. He was telling me how the influence of China in Colombia is so strong. He was telling me that the second most studied lan-guage in Colombia today is Mandarin. When you think of that, that is a frightening thought. You talk about the influence in Nica-ragua of the Chinese. They even think of building a canal, which many people think will never happen. But to have China so close to our borders is not good for America. To push away our neighbors is not good for America. We must work with our neighbors. People don’t realize the amount of economic activity between the United States and the rest of Central America and Mex-ico. I read something very funny the other day. Well, it is not funny, but it is really sad. They were discussing this wall that the President proposes. Some people say: Where are we going to put it? In the middle of the river? Or are we going to put it on the American side and give the river to Mexico? Or are we going to go invade Mexico and put the wall on the Mexican side and keep the river to ourselves? So I thought that was telling of the difficulty. Mr. CASTRO of Texas. It has been a very thorny issue, as you can imagine, especially in Texas. Both Republicans and Democrats have expressed deep concern about building a wall and spending $20 billion to $30 billion to do it, and that concern, I think, has reached the U.S. Congress. I think that is part of why you see a reluctance on the part of the Senate, for example, to move forward with this in their appro-priations bill, in their budget. I yield to our ranking member on the Foreign Affairs Committee, the gen-tleman from New York (Mr. E
NGEL ). Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, as the ranking member on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, I join with my col-leagues. I want to thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. C
ASTRO ), who is a val-ued member of our committee, for his leadership on this critical issue, and also the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. S
IRES). I agree with everything that they have said heretofore about these draconian cuts. I am here because I am rising to strongly reject the Trump Administra-tion’s draconian cuts to the Inter-national Affairs Budget. Now 2
1⁄2 months into the Trump Administra-tion, I find myself deeply troubled by the direction American foreign policy is heading on many fronts. I was par-ticularly shocked when the White House released its fiscal year 2018 budg-et calling for a 31 percent cut to Amer-ican diplomacy and development ef-forts. In my view, cutting the International Affairs Budget by even a fraction of that amount would be devastating. We haven’t seen many details, but a cut that drastic would surely mean that too many efforts and initiatives that do so much good would wind up on the chopping block. Here is the bottom line: Slashing di-plomacy and development puts Amer-ican lives at risk. If we no longer have diplomacy and development tools to meet international challenges, what does that leave? It leaves the military. Now, don’t get me wrong. I have al-ways supported a strong national de-fense, and I do support our military, and I do support giving them more money. But I also support using mili-tary force only as a measure of last re-sort. We should not send American servicemembers into harm’s way unless we have exhausted every other option. If we are not investing in diplomacy and development, we aren’t even giving these other options a chance. We rely on diplomacy to resolve con-flicts across negotiating tables at mul-tilateral gatherings and in quiet cor-ners so that we don’t need to resolve them down the line on the battlefield. Our diplomats work to strengthen old alliances and build new bridges of friendship and shared understanding. Just last week, the Foreign Affairs Committee held a hearing on the

Trump Administration’s efforts to decimate our International Affairs Budget. In his testimony at the hear-ing, former Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Nicholas Burns said that morale at the State Depart-ment is ‘‘at its lowest point in my memory.’’ It is deeply disturbing to hear that our diplomats, many of whom serve in dangerous places at high risk to them-selves and their families, are so dis-heartened. Of course it is not just former dip-lomats who reject these cuts. A recent letter signed by more than 120 retired generals and admirals to House and Senate leadership said: ‘‘We urge you to ensure that resources for the Inter-national Affairs Budget keep pace with the growing global threats and oppor-tunities we face. Now is not the time to retreat.’’ Mr. Speaker, I include their letter in the R

ELOSI , MAJORITY LEADER MCCONNELL , AND M
INORITY LEADER SCHUMER : As you and your colleagues address the federal budget for Fis-cal Year 2018. we write as retired three and four star flag and general officers from all branches of the armed services to share our strong conviction that elevating and strengthening diplomacy and development alongside defense are critical to keeping America safe. We know from our service in uniform that many of the crises our nation faces do not have military solutions alone—from con-fronting violent extremist groups like ISIS in the Middle East and North Africa to pre-venting pandemics like Ebola and stabilizing weak and fragile states that can lead to greater instability. There are 65 million dis-placed people today. the most since World War II, with consequences including refugee flows that are threatening America’s stra-tegic allies in Israel, Jordan, Turkey, and Europe. The State Department. USAID, Millen-nium Challenge Corporation, Peace Corps and other development agencies are critical to preventing conflict and reducing the need to put our men and women in uniform in harm’s way. As Secretary James Mattis said while Commander of U.S. Central Command, ‘‘If you don’t fully fund the State Depart-ment, then I need to buy more ammunition.’’ The military will lead the fight against ter-rorism on the battlefield, but it needs strong civilian partners in the battle against the drivers of extremism—lack of opportunity, insecurity, injustice, and hopelessness. We recognize that America’s strategic in-vestments in diplomacy and development— like all of U.S. investments—must be effec-tive and accountable. Significant reforms have been undertaken since 9/11, many of which have been embodied in recent legisla-tion in Congress with strong bipartisan sup-port—on human trafficking, the rights of women and girls. trade and energy in Africa, wildlife trafficking. water. food security. and transparency and accountability. We urge you to ensure that resources for the International Affairs Budget keep pace with the growing global threats and opportu-nities we face. Now is not the time to re-treat. Sincerely, 1.

Zinni, USMC (Ret.), Commander in Chief, U.S. Central Command (’97–’00) Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, in 2013, Secretary of Defense Mattis similarly said: ‘‘If you don’t fund the State De-partment fully, then I need to buy more ammunition ultimately. So I think it’s a cost benefit ratio. The more that we put into the State De-partment’s diplomacy, hopefully the less we have to put into a military budget as we deal with the outcome of an apparent American withdrawal from the international scene.’’ That is from Secretary of Defense Mattis. I couldn’t agree with him more. Now, I believe that development helps to lift countries and communities up today so they can become strong partners on the global stage tomorrow. A lot of us think we have a moral obli-gation to help cure disease, improve access to education, and advance human rights. But even if it were not the right thing to do, it would be the smart thing to do because those efforts lead to greater stability, more respon-sive governments, and stronger rule of law—populations that share our values and priorities. Poverty and lack of op-portunity, on the other hand, provide fertile ground for those who mean us harm. All these efforts, by the way, cost cents on the dollar compared to mili-tary engagement. People think inter-national affairs and foreign aid are a massive chunk of the Federal budget, but the chart right over here next to me shows how it actually stacks up: 1.4 percent. And we make that sliver of the pie even smaller. It will come back on us in spades. 1.4 percent of our Fed-eral budget goes to all these programs. The diseases we don’t combat will reach our shores; the communities on which we turn or backs may be the next generation of people who mean us

harm; and the conflicts we fail to defuse may well grow into the wars we need to fight later at a much higher cost in terms of American blood and treasure. Just imagine having to tell the parents of a young American sol-dier that their son or daughter was killed in battle because we weren’t willing to spend the tiny sums needed to prevent the conflict. Finally, let me say that the Amer-ican people don’t want to see us slash diplomacy and development. In fact, recent data shows that 72 percent of Americans believe the country should play a leading global role. Nearly 6 in 10 believe funding levels at the State Department should stay the same or increase. Fortunately, the Congress is a co-equal branch of government. I want to the remind the executive branch of that. We in Congress decide how much to invest in our international affairs, not the White House. For example, regardless of how this administration is playing footsie with Vladimir Putin, Congress will devote resources to push back against the Kremlin’s efforts to spread disinformation and destabilize our al-lies, just like they did to the United States during last year’s election cam-paign. I am hopeful that, as we move for-ward with next year’s spending bills, we continue to provide our diplomatic and development efforts the support they need and the support they have received under Republican and Demo-cratic Presidents alike. With the President’s proposed cuts, I fear what message we are sending to the world. The United States is the global standard bearer for freedom, jus-tice, and democracy. If we cede our role as a global leader, make no mistake, someone will step into the void. It could very well be another power that doesn’t share our values or our inter-ests. Think Russia or some country like that. We cannot allow that to happen. I am committed to ensuring it doesn’t, and I look forward to working with my col-leagues on both sides of the aisle to firmly reject President Trump’s cuts. Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman E
NGEL for all of his years of work on behalf of the Nation on the Foreign Affairs Committee. I know you may have a busy schedule this evening. We have got about 12 minutes left, so I thought we would just have a discussion on some of these issues. Stick with us if you can. Mr. ENGEL. You are doing a fine job. Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Congressman E
NGEL mentioned main-taining the United States’ position as a leader in the world and not ceding that to another country, whether it is China or Russia, who has been very aggres-sive, and it is not just maintaining a strong defense. I represent what is known as Mili-tary City, USA: San Antonio, Texas. Once upon a time we had five military bases in San Antonio. We still have Joint Base San Antonio, which is a large operation. So it is not just about a strong defense, which we all support, but also about the hard work of diplo-macy and development. The United States, who has been a leader for so long, if we back away from our commitments, then we not only cede it to somebody else, but there is a good chance that a lot of that work is not going to get done, that the peoples in many nations around the world are going to become poorer, more desperate; and from that, only bad things can happen both for those peoples, but also for the neigh-boring countries, for the United States, and for the world. Thank you for lending your strong voice to support for the diplomatic budget. I yield to the gentleman from New York. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I couldn’t agree with him more. And, you know, it is especially interesting since, dur-ing the campaign, President Trump at-tacked the previous administration for not being strong enough, for not show-ing American presence. And now with this cut, with this proposed 31 percent cut, I couldn’t think of anything that would make us weaker or make us un-able to do what we need to do. b1845 So I hope the President remembers what he said during the campaign and acts accordingly so that these massive cuts can be taken away. Mr. CASTRO of Texas. No, abso-lutely. And Congressman SIRES, you re-call that during those months, then- Candidate Trump talked about backing away from NATO; about allowing Ger-many, for example, to handle the issues between Russia and the Baltic States; about allowing or really forcing Japan and South Korea to go it alone or to develop even their own nuclear weap-ons to combat the threat of North Korea, to deal with China’s aggressive-ness in the South China Sea. So the more we go down that road, not only do we abandon those nations who have been friends for so long and allies and supporters for so long in keeping the peace, but we also, in the long run, threaten our own security. I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey. Mr. SIRES. If I might, I couldn’t agree with the gentleman more. Just to bring it even closer to home, we re-cently met with the attorneys general from the Northern Triangle. These at-torneys general have been fighting cor-ruption, have been fighting the cartel. We have assisted them with a small amount of money. These people put their lives every day in peril fighting the cartel, fighting this corruption. In our conversation, they said to me: We need America’s support to continue our work. If we stop now, all that we have accomplished until now is going to go for naught. When you are talking about a small amount of money, the strong impact that it has on countries that, for dec-ades, have experienced a great deal of corruption, and we finally have people that have stepped forward and want to fight this corruption and put their lives in peril every single day, I think we should support those people. Cut-ting and running away from these peo-ple can only hurt us. This is just one small example of the impact that this 30 percent cut would have on this region. Mr. CASTRO of Texas. The gen-tleman mentioned the Northern Tri-angle countries of Central America. Es-pecially over the last few years, thou-sands of women and children who are fleeing very desperate situations there, not only extreme poverty, but the threats of violence by drug gangs, for example, have come to the Texas-Mex-ico border seeking asylum. Congress did, over the last few years, essentially, pass assistance for these nations. And we understood that, look, if you allocate $600 million to three countries, that is not going to solve all of their problems. Nobody is under that illusion. But it can go a long way in being the seed funds to start to turn these things around and these nations around. Mr. ENGEL. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. CASTRO of Texas. I yield to the gentleman from New York. Mr. ENGEL. I would add that we give foreign aid, and it is good for those countries, but it is also good for us. It also helps us. If there is a drug problem in Central America, it inevitably comes up to our border. If there is some problem with some developing country, say, we have a dis-ease that could—Ebola or something like that, and we give money to help eradicate it, well, that will prevent Ebola from coming into the United States. So it is really a win-win situa-tion. Again, if we are going to be the lead-ers of the world, certainly of the free world, and we want other countries to follow our lead, well, if you are a lead-er, you have to lead. What we are doing is in our own best interests, not only just in the other countries’ best inter-ests. I think it is important to say that. And it is important to, again, say, 1 percent—1.4 percent of our total budget is all the foreign aid and all the money that we give in terms of eradicating diseases, in terms of crime, in terms of everything that is actually very impor-tant to us as well. The American peo-ple think it is much higher, but it is not. So if you take the President’s slash-ing of it, it would virtually make all of this impossible to do. So it is a pro-gram that is a win-win situation. Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Congressman E
NGEL , you mentioned Ebola, for exam-ple. Dallas, Texas, was the first Amer-ican city to confront the challenge and

the problem of Ebola. So I couldn’t agree with you more. It should also be said that if you take away this aid and you have people be-coming more desperate in nations around the world, they do become more susceptible to being employed by, for example, drug cartels, or being lured by terrorist organizations because these folks are desperate and need to survive. So these rogue alternatives be-come more attractive to them. So it is important to point out that a lot of this development and a lot of this aid also prevents some of these things from happening. I yield to the gentleman from New York. Mr. ENGEL. Absolutely. Again, I want to reiterate that we are not the leaders of the world because we anoint-ed ourselves. We are the leaders of the world because we provided leadership for all of these years, particularly after World War II, and it is important to en-gage with the world. One of the gentlemen mentioned some of the things that the President said. You know, one of the things he did was he called NATO obsolete. That kind of talk worries me because it is our alliances that are the pillar of our foreign policy and the strength of the United States and our alliances which have worked so well since World War II. So if we denigrate our alliances, and then we cut funding for all these pro-grams that help various countries so we can be a leader by about a third, that doesn’t say much for a robust for-eign policy. You get to be a leader by acting like a leader, not by pulling away from the world. Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Absolutely. I will give Mr. S
IRES the last word. I yield to the gentleman from New Jer-sey. Mr. SIRES. Well, before we finish, I just want to compliment Chairman R
OYCE and Ranking Member E NGEL on the recent resolution that we worked on together in encouraging Argentina to continue on the path under new President Macri. Former President de Kirchner decided that she was going to be an isolationist. Argentina is too big. It is a country that could be a player in assisting us in any crisis that we have in South Amer-ica. So this resolution did not cost any money, but it shows our friendship, it shows our support, and it shows that they are moving in the right direction. So my compliments to the gen-tleman, my compliments to the people that signed this resolution. Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE UNITED STATES The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. T
AYLOR ). Under the Speaker’s an-nounced policy of January 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. L
AMALFA ) for 30 min-utes. Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to talk about several things to do with infrastructure in the United States and in California. I am a happy new member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee here in the U.S. House, and I am very interested and dedicated to things we can do to improve all of our types of infrastruc-ture that are so important for the economy, for the people, for movement of goods, and for the people’s own con-venience in doing what they need to do in their personal lives, their business lives, et cetera. So this is, indeed, a committee and issues that will affect all of our States and have a positive effect if we put good policy in place for all of our peo-ple. We have jurisdiction over quite a few areas. One of the important things we will be working on in the short term have to do with airports as well as reauthorization of the FAA, Federal Aviation Administration. Airports, obviously, are coming more and more into play with the amount of passenger traffic that we are seeing. The FAA projects that by the year 2029 we could see 1 billion passengers using our airports per year, and that is just not that many years away. So airports will need to continue to have more up-grading, runway extensions, maybe ad-ditional runways, the infrastructure in them, the process for getting people through TSA. These are all things that we will be looking at within our com-mittee as well as some of our other committees we partner with here in the House, because passengers are using more and more air service, whether it is urban or the rural air-ports that are very important to areas like my district, the First District of Northern California. They have equal weight to those that are using them in where they live and where they need to get to. Obviously, a lot of discussion about infrastructure led by our President, Donald Trump, on highways being a key component of movement of goods and people and everything we need for our economy to be strong and the con-venience for our people. Highways are breaking down. Bridges are breaking down. We just saw the other day, in Georgia here, a fire caused by storage of things underneath that bridge. They are on the fast track trying to get that redone on I–85. Now, was it a bridge that needed to be maintained? Not sure. But certainly that is a situ-ation that shows how acute the prob-lem is when you lose one structure like that, what it can do to traffic, an in-convenience for people and commerce in an area like that. So we have these problems all across the country with our bridges that are in dire need of repair. We need not have more accidents or more things that would endanger the public when they are not properly maintained or up-graded. Just try driving in the right lane of a lot of our freeways here and with the truck traffic on them who pay weight fees and many other excise taxes, other forms of fees and taxes to be part of the solution. We see much damage to them because of the backlog of work that needs to be done on highways, on free-ways, that have this traffic, that have this high flow that is really part of what we would expect for our highways and these systems. But when we are not doing the work to maintain, when we are not putting the investment in there, when people pay their gas tax, when they pay the tax on diesel, when they pay their weight fees, when all those forms of compensation that are in place to help keep our highways and roads and bridges and all of our transportation structures up, when the money isn’t getting there, then we have a real prob-lem. Again, being from California, we see that some of our highways and road systems are in some of the worst shape in the whole country. Right now, as they contemplate raising taxes on peo-ple at the State level, a gas tax in-crease, a per-car tax increase to get your license plate sticker, people are going to be wondering where are we going to make ends meet on that, be-cause probably at least the average cost to a family would be somewhere around $500 in new gas and new fees to register a vehicle and get their kids to school and go to work and things that they need to do. We need to be part of the solution on that. I don’t think more taxes, more fees upon working people who are try-ing to make ends meet—you know, $500 out of a family’s income is a pretty tough deal when we see that the jobs are not coming back as rapidly, espe-cially in the State of California, that they need to for average working fami-lies, especially inland, that aren’t part of the coast where most of the wealth seems to be centered in California. We see that the drive in California is still pushing forward on the high-speed rail project, one that was passed all the way back in 2008 just under a $10 bil-lion bond by the voters of California, and supplemented a few years later by ARA funding, stimulus funding from the Federal Government, about $3.5 bil-lion. Well, at this point, here in 2017, they have hardly even done anything on the construction of the high-speed rail, which is probably a blessing, because this a boondoggle of epic proportions. The original cost, as sold to the voters of the State of California, would be $33 billion to put a high-speed rail system from San Francisco to Los Angeles going through the Central Valley. Just a couple of years later, the true numbers started coming in on that, and they finally admitted that it was going to cost $98.5 billion was the esti-mate, this in the fall of 2011. So they scurried back, went to the drawing board once again and found a

way to downsize the cost by using local transit, local projects in northern Cali-fornia and the San Francisco Bay Area and in southern California, trying to bring the cost down to then an esti-mated $68 billion, which is still double of the original budget—the original cost that was sold to the voters in proposition 1A in 2008. Much of the funding was supposed to come from private concerns, private in-vestors, because when you add it up, $10 billion from the State bond, $3 bil-lion-plus of Federal money, you are only a little over $13 billion. And if they are projecting it is a $68 billion cost, where is the other $55 bil-lion going to come from? Where are the private investors that have had nearly 9 years now to line up to be part of this profitable enterprise? They are staying away in droves. b1900 There are no guarantees of income which the State cannot do under propo-sition 1A which is illegal. There is no subsidizing of the high-speed rail al-lowed under the proposition 1A bond. Yet it keeps going on and on. We have these infrastructure needs we have all over the country. I don’t see any more money coming from Congress, not com-ing from the Federal level, to help boost this boondoggle in California. We will work hard to make sure that doesn’t happen. Unfortunately, when they seek new funds for other things such as elec-trification of the rail in the bay area, they were seeking $647 million of brand new money from a different pot feder-ally to electrify the existing train route they have in the bay area that is run by diesel trains presently. So it is not like they don’t have train service for commuting in the bay area, indeed, one of the richest areas of the country. They come to Congress here and ask for $647 million of new money maybe to electrify but mostly to help facilitate the high-speed rail boondoggle as part of that. We need not be part of that. They can go to the funding they have already set aside within the bond or the $3.5 mil-lion that we don’t seem to be able to capture back from the stimulus pack-age. Go to those sources of money if you want to electrify the rail. That said, part of the problem with building the high-speed rail is people don’t really want to cooperate. When the first segment was being con-templated, it was going to go from San Francisco halfway down into the valley or L.A. halfway up to the valley. One of the reasons they chose to start build-ing in the valley was that was the cheapest area to build one, the most wide open. One of the quotes at the time from one of the spokesmen for the authority was they would find the least amount of resistance to build the rail in the valley because there are not that many people there compared to the cit-ies. Well, there is plenty of resistance there, too, because, at this point, I don’t know exact statistics, but they have less than half of the parcels even in their control that they would need to lay the route out through the valley because people are resisting. They don’t want this thing coming through their neighborhoods, knocking out their farms, and cutting up their prop-erty in sections into little triangles and little bits that they can no longer farm or even transport their livestock or equipment to because it is going to be cut off by this rail that will be fenced on both sides because you have got a 220-mile-per-hour train sup-posedly running through it. So there will be a lot of damage to the economy and the fabric of the Central Valley. The people in the urban areas aren’t that excited about it either. In the high-value properties in the south bay area, they are not really excited about having this causeway 20 feet above their neighborhoods there. So they are talking, put this thing underground. So they are doing that part last. In the meantime, they are going to try and electrify the commuter train they have, which is a low-speed rail and doesn’t fulfill the goals of a high-speed rail which is just required from San Francisco to Los Angeles. As well in southern California, they want to take over part of the system there to use that commuter rail as fulfilling part of the obligation to have a high-speed rail system that is electrified from one end to the other. Now, they haven’t even really con-templated what it is going to cost as they talk about drilling a hole, drilling a bore, through the Tehachapis down there in southern California, to the tunes of billions and billions of dollars that isn’t really comprehended in the cost of doing the system. So this is an issue, this is a dream, and this is a project that really needs to be scrapped. Where is the money going to come from? It is not coming from the Federal Government, and it is not coming from investors. The cap- and-trade dollars that they were count-ing on in the State of California from auctioning off CO
2allotments to large businesses, that has withered as well. They are not getting the billions they were hoping to get from auctioning off this new commodity created by govern-ment in California of CO
2allotments to large businesses that produce CO
2. So the funding isn’t available any-where. Still they hold on to this dream of building this high-speed rail project that is at least $55 billion, probably a lot more than $55 billion short of being completed. Do you know what? This isn’t even a priority for most people. Are they going to be able to afford to ride that rail? Are they going to be able to afford to ride that train and afford the ticket? Because if it is not going to be a sub-sidized ticket, it is probably going to be close to $200 or $300, not the $80 that they projected 9 years ago. Then should that really be the pri-ority? Now, California, until this year, we were blessed with so much rain and snow pack—there is an incredible amount of snow pack up on the moun-tains that I just flew over yesterday in my commute to Washington. We had suffered about 5 years of drought pre-viously to that. We didn’t have the in-frastructure in place to store water that we should have with a State of 40 million people that, in the good old days, we used to plan for with the Cen-tral Valley Project built in the thirties and forties, the State water project built in the fifties and sixties. Why have we been sitting all these decades since not really doing the things to stay forward and stay ahead of the curve on a population, on the needs of an economy of agriculture and municipalities of people? Instead, we are chasing these utter boondoggles like high-speed rail. Our water infrastructure still has a lot of needs. Our rivers, when we have the high flows, many of our levees are in danger of not holding up in really high flows. We see that issue on the Feather River on the south end of my district and the adjacent district to the south of there with the levee systems in Yuba County and Sutter County, which a lot of folks have worked really hard in recent years on, and they are trying to locally upgrade these levees and keep it going. This year, they had to spend a lot of dollars on upgrading the levees just to get through the season by laying grav-el and mat down so that the boils that would be potentially coming through the levees wouldn’t give out and have a blowout in those areas. What is going on with that? The money has been put aside, and the work is ready to go, but delays have cost the ability to get more miles of those levees done during the good weather last year so that we would ensure the safety of these areas, whether it is south Butte County, Yuba and Sutter Counties, and many other areas in the north State leading all the way down to Sacramento and the delta. We need to be getting that work done immediately. Why should we endanger our communities by not getting the work we know we need to get done, the funding has been more or less put aside for, yet needless delay and bureau-cratic red tape have caused delays in endangered places like that? Or like Hamilton City up in my area that I share in western Butte County and Glenn County. This is the type of infrastructure that produces jobs—but even more im-portantly, after the jobs are done, the safety to a community, the ability to invest there, to build homes there, and to have that 200-year flood protection on the levees that is necessary to be in-surable and, again, ensure the public safety. So this is part of the water in-frastructure we desperately need in California and many of our other States, too, as well. So serving on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, we could ad-vance these. We can have this debate.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2693 April 4, 2017 
We can have this discussion and hold accountable the agencies that are sup-posed to be getting it done and not looking for more ways to delay it with paperwork sitting on the desk for projects that could be going out this year that might be delayed yet another year. Coming back to dams, that is one of our most important components in flood control because we can control the water as it comes down from the higher elevations and have that ability to store water at the level we decide to let it out of the dam instead of what-ever might be coming in uncontrolled with the high flows you can sometimes get from a massive amount of rain like we saw in the Sierras this year and the snow pack that is still sitting up there. Lake Oroville, which many people have heard about across the country in recent weeks, is right in my district, right in my backyard. It has been a great project. It is a jewel of the State water project in California, built pri-marily in the sixties. Well, there was a big problem with the spillway. It gave way in early February, and so they had to assess what was going on with that and temporarily shut it down, in case of so much—an amazing amount of rain coming in during some of those same days actually caused the lake to top out and some of the water to start coming over the emergency spillway, which became another issue requiring an evacuation because erosion hap-pening underneath that emergency spillway structure was unpredictable. Nobody knew what would happen as the dirt field below that eroded. Why is it still a dirt field? That will be an interesting thing for us to hear about in hearings that are going to be going on at the State level as well as at the Federal level here. Why was it al-lowed to stay that way? A dirt field. The erosion nearly came up. Who knows what the effect might have been on that emergency spillway structure. Thankfully nothing happened. The dam structure is sound, the emergency spillway structure is sound. The main spillway needs much work, and a Her-culean effort since then has cleared the river channel so the river can properly flow from the power plant, which is an important regulator of State level, the water that can run through that power plant. So a really good effort was done to do that after this emergency has oc-curred. The evacuation really worried deeply many people in the north State. 180,000 people were evacuated. It was the right call by our Butte County sheriff to do so because of the unpredictability of that situation. So Sheriff Honea de-serves much kudos for making the cor-rect call on that and making people safe, keeping people safe. But, nonetheless, we have this infra-structure issue we need to come back to and is being contemplated right now with a plan to replace the spillway. Can it be done in 1 year? It doesn’t look like it. But measures will be taken to upgrade that and make it work. It can be a long-term structure that will be durable for many decades. That is what we need. We need that predictability so the lake can be regu-lated and water stored properly in a fashion that provides for flood control during the high rain season and high snow pack season, as well as storing water for those drought years that we hopefully didn’t let too much water get away from. We still have an obligation to meet water contracts and grow agri-cultural products and meet the needs for municipalities as well as all the en-vironmental needs that are being de-manded these days as well. So we need to rebuild our spillway at Lake Oroville soon. That project will soon be underway. In the meantime, we still have a massive snow pack up there that has to be modeled and watched and carefully contemplated as to what the releases from the lake will be in the interim until the point where they can know what the predictability is of the amount of snow, the amount of rain, and the amount of water that can come down from the Sierras and affect the river system all the way down basi-cally to where it meets up near Sac-ramento. We need to have that predictability for people to be secure in their homes, at the same time finding that balance of storing the water that is needed to make a State run because we never know what the next drought year will be. Will it be next year? Or will we get a massive amount of rain this coming year? So we need to find that balance to make sure that we are keeping those communities safe, modeling very care-fully what is up on the slopes still in snow pack and storing water for Cali-fornia’s long-term needs this coming year and following years. So with the repairs to Oroville that will soon be underway, I think people can be confident that that system will be sound. The dam is sound, the emer-gency spillway is sound, and the re-pairs that will be going underneath the base of that should make—if it is ever needed—which the goal is to never use the emergency spillway, but, should it be needed, it would be a sound piece of that infrastructure. And with a new spillway that will be built at Oroville within 1 to 2 years, that will be sound as well. People need to have that con-fidence. I was speaking with people around the Oroville area, several of the busi-nesses there that are concerned that having to move in an evacuation obvi-ously is a horrendous expense, but also it is a concern for those others that they do business with, maybe outside of the area, that they can continue to supply the things that they produce for the contracts they would have. Indeed, that was expressed to me at a meeting a few weeks ago that maybe they are vendors for others in other parts of the State or the country that if they have the perception they can’t rely upon them to keep producing those compo-nents that go into other assemblies, then they may not do business with them anymore. We need to ensure those folks that Oroville is going to stay, is in business to stay, and that those manufacturers can count on those components to be produced and made available to them because we will keep working to make sure that that infrastructure is sound with the water storage and the levee flood control system that we have. In just a few short weeks, we will see that, with the snow pack properly ac-counted for and that flood season past us, in the rebuilding of that infrastruc-ture, then we can assure everyone that Oroville is strongly here to stay and here for business. b1915 We have the operations of the lake. Indeed, there are a lot of things to bal-ance with this infrastructure: recre-ation, electricity generation, agricul-tural and municipal as well as environ-mental waters. These are all things that have to be balanced. But, indeed, balance needs to be brought to it so that no one side is pushing too far the other so that we don’t meet all these goals that are needed. Energy is an important component of that as well. Generating that with hy-droelectric power helps meet a reliable baseline load for electricity generated in California. It is much more reliable than solar or wind power. Why hydro-power isn’t seen as an even more im-portant component of the renewal en-ergy portfolio is kind of silly and arbi-trary to me, but it is, indeed, very, very valuable. As we wind through all the different needs we have for infrastructure in this country—some of these examples in my own backyard—they are also needed elsewhere. Folks in all parts of the country have needs for a strong infra-structure, whether you are riding the train from New York to Washington, D.C., which I have a couple of times— that is a very important part of that infrastructure for those folks. We need to support them as well and make sure it is as modern and as safe as it can be. It affects everybody, the highway sys-tem that goes from the East Coast to the West Coast or North to South. It is a positive for all of us. We need to stay ahead of the curve. President Trump has a very ambitious plan for rebuilding and adding to our infrastructure. It isn’t all just about ribbon cuttings on new infrastructure. It is, indeed, the less glamorous that is a very important part of rebuilding what we have: upgrading our bridges, repaving those lanes, adding additional lanes to our freeways. That helps make it more convenient for all of us, better for commerce, better for safety. With so much consternation in Wash-ington, D.C., about what we are doing, these are some of the positives that we can point to in moving forward on in-frastructure that everybody can use. It will be positive for the jobs in con-struction while it is being built and,

longer term, for the type of commerce that will make the United States a place to locate factories once again and have that manufacturing and that pre-dictability of energy sources, water sources, safety of the infrastructure, and the ability to move these goods down our freeways to our ports, wher-ever they need to go. With that, I will be looking forward to what we can do in California to have better infrastructure that is something people can actually use, actually ac-cess, and certainly afford without being hit with more taxes, more gas tax, more vehicle fees, and more ideas for taxes that may come from the Fed-eral Government. I don’t see that happening here, but the people pay enough. As it is, it is al-ready difficult enough for middle-in-come families to make ends meet if they have dreams of buying a home, paying off college debt, or sending their own kids to college a little later and maybe even, once in a while, going on a vacation that they would like to save up for. People need to have these choices. We are here at the Federal level to help be part of facilitating their ability to have those choices. Mr. Speaker, I encourage all the folks in northern California to hang in there. We are going to get through this season here. To the people of Oroville, we will make sure our systems are very sound. I think already, with steps that are taken, we will weather this dif-ficult winter with a sound dam and in-frastructure that will be able to have predictability and the assurance that, when you go to sleep at night, these systems are going to be serving us well and providing for our safety. I think we are well onto that track already. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

PRAYER The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-fered the following prayer: Let us pray. Eternal Lord God, we rejoice because of Your power. We are dependent upon You to rescue us from ourselves and from the unseen consequences of the challenges we face. Guide and sustain our Senators, ena-bling them to know the joy of having You as their sure defense. May Your unfailing love, O God, which is as vast as the Heavens, motivate our law-makers to make faithfulness their top priority. Use them to give justice a chance to thrive in a threatening world. Lord, infuse them with the spir-it of humility that seeks first to under-stand rather than to be understood. May they find their strength and con-fidence in You alone. We pray in Your great Name. Amen.

NOMINATION OF NEIL GORSUCH Mr. M
CCONNELL. Madam President, later today, due to the threat of an un-precedented partisan filibuster, I will file cloture on the nomination of Judge Gorsuch to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. It should be unset-tling to everyone that our colleagues across the aisle have brought the Sen-ate to this new low, and on such an im-pressive nominee with such broad bi-partisan support. Judge Gorsuch is independent, he is fair, he has one of the most impressive resumes we will ever see, and he has earned the highest possible rating from the group the Democratic leader called the ‘‘gold standard’’ for evaluating ju-dicial nominations. No one seriously disputes his sterling credentials to serve on the Court. Yet, in the Judici-ary Committee, Democrats withheld support from him. On the floor, Demo-crats said they will launch a partisan filibuster against him—something Re-publicans have never done. No one in the Senate Republican conference has ever voted to filibuster a Supreme Court nominee. Not one Republican has ever done that. Later today, colleagues will continue to debate the nomination of Judge Gorsuch. They will discuss how com-pletely unprecedented it would be for Democrats to actually follow through on this filibuster threat to actually block an up-or-down vote for this nominee even though a bipartisan ma-jority of the Senate supports his nomi-nation and what the negative con-sequences would be for the Senate if they succeed. I will be listening with interest. I hope Senators in both par-ties will listen as well. ‘‘There has never been,’’ as the New York Times and others reported last week, ‘‘a successful partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee.’’ Never in the history of our country. Not once in the nearly 230-year history of the Sen-ate. The last time a Republican President nominated someone to the Supreme Court, Democrats tried to filibuster him too. That was Samuel Alito in 2006. Fortunately, cooler heads pre-vailed. Even former President Obama, who as a Senator participated in that effort, now admits that he regrets join-ing that filibuster effort. Democrats are now being pushed by far-left interest groups into doing something truly detrimental to this body and to our country. They seem to be hurtling toward the abyss this time and trying to take the Senate with them. They need to reconsider. Perhaps they will recall their own words from the last time they flirted with a partisan Supreme Court fili-buster. Back then, the current top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee said she opposed attempts to filibuster Supreme Court nominees. ‘‘[Just be-cause the nominee] is a man I might disagree with,’’ she said, ‘‘that doesn’t mean he shouldn’t be on the court.’’ She said the filibuster should be re-served for something truly outrageous. Yesterday, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee announced her intention to filibuster the Supreme Court nominee before us because she disagreed with him. It is totally the op-posite of what she said before. It is just the kind of thing she said the filibuster should not be used for. This is emblematic of what we are seeing in Democrats’ strained rationale for their unprecedented filibuster threat. It seems they are opposed to Judge Gorsuch’s nomination because far-left interest groups are upset about other things—the way the election turned out, mostly—and threatening the careers of any Democrat who op-poses blind resistance to everything this President does. Democrats have come up with all manner of excuses to justify opposing this outstanding nominee. They asked for his personal opinions on issues that could come before him and posed hypotheticals that they know he is ethically precluded from answering. They cherry-picked a few cases out of thousands in which he has partici-pated. They invent fake 60-vote stand-ards that fact checkers call bogus. They are, to paraphrase the Judiciary

chairman, a ‘‘no’’ vote in search of a reason to vote that way. What they can’t lay a glove on is the nominee’s record and independence—the kinds of things that should actually be swaying our vote—and that is really quite tell-ing. If Democrats follow through on their threat to subject this widely respected judge to the first partisan filibuster in the history of the Senate, then I doubt there is a single nominee from this President they could ever support— ever. After all, the Democratic leader basically said as much before the nomi-nation was even made. But it is not too late for our friends to do the right thing. You know, we on this side of the aisle are no strangers to political pressure. We can emphathize with what our Democratic colleagues might be going through right now. But part of the job you sign up for here is to do what you know is right in the end. When President Clinton nominated Stephen Breyer, I voted to confirm him. When President Clinton nomi-nated Ruth Bader Ginsburg, I voted to confirm her. I thought it was the right thing to do. After all, he won the elec-tion. He was the President. The Presi-dent gets to appoint Supreme Court Justices. When President Obama nomi-nated Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, I led my party in working to ensure they received an up-or-down vote, not a filibuster. We were in exactly the same position in which our Democratic friends are today. No filibuster. No filibuster. We thought it was the right thing to do. It is not because we harbored illusions that we would usually agree with these nominees of Democratic Presidents— certainly not. We even protested when then-Majority Leader Reid tried to file cloture on the Kagan nomination. We talked him out of it and said it wasn’t necessary. Jeff Sessions, the current Attorney General, was the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee at the time. Jeff Sessions talked Harry Reid out of filing cloture because it wasn’t necessary. We didn’t even want the pretext of the possibility of a fili-buster on the table. Well, that is quite a different story from what we are seeing today, but this is where our Democratic col-leagues have taken us. Will a partisan minority of the Senate really prevent the Senate’s pro-Gorsuch bipartisan majority from confirming him? Will they really subject this eminently qualified nominee to the first success-ful partisan filibuster in American his-tory? Americans will be watching, his-tory will be watching, and the future of the Senate will hang on their choice.

NOMINATION OF NEIL GORSUCH  
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, there is a poem that I recall, and it goes like this: 
When I was going up the stair, I met a man who wasn’t there. He wasn’t there again today. I wish that man would go away. 
I thought about that poem when I lis-tened to the majority leader’s speech about how cooperative he has been when it comes to Supreme Court nomi-nations. The name he forgot to men-tion was Merrick Garland—Merrick Garland, who was nominated by Presi-dent Obama to fill the vacancy of Jus-tice Antonin Scalia; Merrick Garland, the only Presidential nominee to the Supreme Court in the history of the U.S. Senate to be denied a hearing and a vote; Merrick Garland, about whom Senator M
CCONNELL said: I will not only refuse to give him a hearing and a vote, I refuse to even see him; Merrick Garland, who was found unanimously ‘‘well qualified’’ by the American Bar Association; Merrick Garland, the per-son who received bipartisan support for appointment to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, the second highest court in the land. So when the majority leader comes to the floor to talk about how coopera-tive he has been with previous Presi-dents when it comes to Supreme Court nominees, he conveniently omits the most obvious reason for our problems this week: the unilateral decision by the majority leader to preclude any vote on Merrick Garland to fill the va-cancy of Justice Scalia. I know Judge Garland. I have met with him several times. He is a bal-anced, moderate, experienced jurist who should be on the U.S. Supreme Court. We should not be entertaining Neil Gorsuch this week; we ought to be celebrating the first anniversary of Merrick Garland’s service on the U.S. Supreme Court. The reason we are not is that Senator MCCONNELL and the Senate Republicans refused us that op-portunity. They said: No, you cannot vote on that. Remember their logic? The logic was: Wait a minute. This is the last year of President Obama’s Presidency. Why should he be able to fill a vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court when we have an election coming soon? That is an interesting argument. There are two things I am troubled with. I do believe President Obama was elected for 4 years in his second term, not for 3, which meant he had author-ity in the fourth year, as he did in the third year. Secondly, the Republican argument ignores history. It ignores the obvious history when we had a situation with President Ronald Reagan, in his last year in office, with regard to a vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court. There were Democrats in charge of the Senate and Democrats in charge of the Senate Ju-diciary Committee, and President Ron-ald Reagan, a lameduck President in his last year, nominated Anthony Ken-nedy to serve on the Court. He sent the name to the Democratic Senate, and there was a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee and a vote that sent him to the Court. You never hear that story from Sen-ator M
CCONNELL . It is because it does not fit into his playbook as to why he would wait for a year and refuse to give Merrick Garland a hearing and a vote. The reasoning is obvious: Clearly he was banking on the possibility that the electorate would choose a Republican President—and that is what hap-pened—so that a Republican Presi-dent—in this case, Donald Trump— could fill the vacancy, not Barack Obama. So when I hear the speeches on the floor by Senator M
CCONNELL about his bipartisan cooperation, he leaves out an important chapter—the last chap-ter, the one that brought us to this mo-ment in the Senate. I look at the situation before us today, and it is a sad situation for the Senate—sad in that we have reached the point in which a Supreme Court nomination has become so political, more so than at any time in history. Where did the name ‘‘Neil Gorsuch’’ come from for the Supreme Court? It came from a list that was prepared by two organizations: the Federalist Soci-ety and the Heritage Foundation. These are both Republican advocacy groups who represent special interests and are funded by special interests. They came up with the names and gave them to Presidential candidate Donald Trump. It was a list of 21 names. He issued them twice—in March and in September of the last campaign year— and Neil Gorsuch’s name was on the list. The Federalist Society was created in 1982. Nominally, it is an organiza-tion that is committed to originalism.

In other words, it looks to the clear meaning of the Constitution, what the Founding Fathers meant. They say that over and over again: Just look to the Constitution and read it, and then we will know what we should do. That was in a speech that was given by Edwin Meese, the then-Attorney Gen-eral in 1985, who explained the Fed-eralist Society’s credo. On its face, it sounds at least argu-ably defensible that there would be an organization that is so committed to the Constitution that it wants Su-preme Court nominees who will follow it as literally as possible. Yet, as Jus-tice William Brennan on the Supreme Court said, if they think they can find in those musty volumes from back in the 18th century all of the answers to all of the questions on the issues we face today—here is what he called it— that is arrogance posing as humility. Yet that is what they said the Fed-eralist Society was all about. If that were all the Federalist Society were about, then I guess one could argue that they ought to have their day in court, their day in choosing someone for the Supreme Court, but it is more than that. When you look at those who finance the Federalist Society—and it is a short list because they refuse to disclose all their donors—you see the classic names of Republican support: the Koch brothers, the Mercer family, the Richard Mellon Scaife family foun-dation, the ones who pop up over and over again. Why would these organiza-tions be so determined to pick the next nominee to fill the vacancy on the Su-preme Court? It is because there is so much at stake. In a Judiciary Committee hearing, my colleague S
HELDON WHITEHOUSE  went through the box score when it came to the Supreme Court and how they ruled when given a choice between special interests and corporate elites versus average workers and consumers and families. As Senator W
HITEHOUSE  pointed out graphically, in detail, over-whelmingly, this Court has ruled for the special interests. Sixty-nine per-cent of the Roberts’ Court’s rulings are in favor of the U.S. Chamber of Com-merce’s position on issues, according to one study. Why would a special interest organi-zation like the Federalist Society care? It wants to keep a good thing going, from its point of view. That is why this is a different Supreme Court nominee. I yield the floor. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER  
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. K EN-
NEDY ). The Democratic leader is recog-nized. 
CONGRATULATING THE SENIOR SENATOR FROM  
ILLINOIS  
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, I sat at the back of the room to listen to my colleague from Illinois. I know he got up because he wanted very much to respond to the majority leader, and I thought he did a great job. It was a pleasure to listen, as always, to one of the most articulate Members with whom I have ever served in any legisla-tive body, as well as his having many other good traits. EQUAL PAY DAY  
Mr. President, today is Equal Pay Day. Unlike many holidays on our cal-endar, Equal Pay Day is not actually a commemoration of some achievement. Equal pay for women is still not close to a reality. Women still make 79 cents for every dollar a man makes in the same position. African-American women are making 64 cents on the dol-lar. Latina women are making 54 cents on the dollar. That is not right. It is holding the American dream out of reach for too many women in this country. So Equal Pay Day is not a commemoration; it is a reminder that glass ceilings are everywhere and that there are hugely consequential and tangible barriers that women face every single day that men do not. In 2007, the Supreme Court, in a 5-to- 4 decision by the conservative majority in Ledbetter v. Goodyear, ruled that Lilly Ledbetter could not pursue her claim that she was entitled to equal pay. The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which reversed this unfair Supreme Court decision, was the first bill Presi-dent Obama signed into law in 2009. 
NOMINATION OF NEIL GORSUCH  
Mr. President, this leads me to the Supreme Court. It is just one of so many examples of what is at stake in the nomination of Judge Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, which we now de-bate here on the floor of the Senate. I was listening to the majority leader earlier this morning, and I cannot be-lieve he can stand here on the floor of the U.S. Senate and with a straight face say that Democrats are launching the first partisan filibuster of a Su-preme Court nominee. What the major-ity leader did to Merrick Garland by denying him even a hearing and a vote is even worse than a filibuster. For him to accuse Democrats of the first par-tisan filibuster on the Supreme Court belies the facts, belies the history, be-lies the basic truth. My friend Representative A
DAM S
CHIFF said: ‘‘When McConnell de-prived President Obama of a vote on Garland, it was a nuclear option. The rest is fallout.’’ Let me repeat that. A
DAM SCHIFF put it better than I ever could. ‘‘When McConnell deprived President Obama of a vote on Garland, it was a nuclear option. The rest is fall-out.’’ Even though my friend the majority leader keeps insisting that there is no principled reason to vote against Judge Gorsuch, we Democrats disagree. First, he has instinctively favored corporate interests over average Americans. Sec-ond, he has not shown a scintilla of independence from President Trump. Third, as my colleague from Illinois elaborated, he was handpicked by hard- right special interest groups, not be-cause he called balls and strikes. They would not put all of that effort and money into a caller of balls and strikes. These are ideologues who want to move America far to the right. He was picked by hard-right special inter-est groups because his views are out-side the mainstream. According to analyses of his record on the Tenth Circuit, which were con-ducted by the New York Times and the Washington Post, by experts on the Court, Judge Gorsuch would be one of the most conservative voices ever on the Supreme Court should he achieve that. The Washington Post: Gorsuch’s actual voting behavior suggests he is to the right of both Alito and Thomas and by a substantial margin. That would make him the most conservative Justice on the Court in recent memory. 
That is why the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society put Judge Gorsuch on their list for President Trump. As Emily Bazelon of the New York Times put it in a brilliant article that I would urge all of my colleagues to read: 
The reality is that Judge Gorsuch em-braces a judicial philosophy that would do nothing less than undermine the structure of modern government—including the rules that keep our water clean, regulate the fi-nancial markets and protect workers and consumers. 
I ask unanimous consent to have that article printed in the R
ECORD . There being no objection, the mate-rial was ordered to be printed in the R
ECORD , as follows: 
[From the New York Times, Apr. 1, 2017] T
HEGOVERNMENT GORSUCH WANTS TOUNDO (By Emily Bazelon and Eric Posner) At recent Senate hearings to fill the Su-preme Court’s open seat, Judge Neil Gorsuch came across as a thoroughly bland and non-threatening nominee. The idea was to give as little ammunition as possible to opponents when his nomination comes up this week for a vote, one that Senate Democrats may try to upend with a filibuster. But the reality is that Judge Gorsuch em-braces a judicial philosophy that would do nothing less than undermine the structure of modern government—including the rules that keep our water clean, regulate the fi-nancial markets and protect workers and consumers. In strongly opposing the admin-istrative state, Judge Gorsuch is in the com-pany of incendiary figures like the White House adviser Steve Bannon, who has called for its ‘‘deconstruction.’’ The Republican- dominated House, too, has passed a bill de-signed to severely curtail the power of fed-eral agencies. Businesses have always complained that government regulations increase their costs, and no doubt some regulations are ill-con-ceived. But a small group of conservative in-tellectuals have gone much further to argue that the rules that safeguard our welfare and the orderly functioning of the market have been fashioned in a way that’s not constitu-tionally legitimate. This once-fringe cause of the right asserts, as Judge Gorsuch put it in a speech last year, that the administrative state ‘‘poses a grave threat to our values of personal liberty.’’ The 80 years of law that are at stake began with the New Deal. President Franklin D. Roosevelt believed that the Great Depression was caused in part by ruinous competition among companies. In 1933, Congress passed the National Industrial Recovery Act, which

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES2182 April 4, 2017 
allowed the president to approve ‘‘fair com-petition’’ standards for different trades and industries. The next year, Roosevelt ap-proved a code for the poultry industry, which, among other things, set a minimum wage and maximum hours for workers, and hygiene requirements for slaughterhouses. Such basic workplace protections and con-straints on the free market are now taken for granted. But in 1935, after a New York City slaugh-terhouse operator was convicted of violating the poultry code, the Supreme Court called into question the whole approach of the New Deal, by holding that the N.I.R.A. was an ‘‘unconstitutional delegation by Congress of a legislative power.’’ Only Congress can cre-ate rules like the poultry code, the justices said. Because Congress did not define ‘‘fair competition,’’ leaving the rule-making to the president, the N.I.R.A. violated the Con-stitution’s separation of powers. The court’s ruling in Schechter Poultry Corp. v. the United States, along with an-other case decided the same year, are the only instances in which the Supreme Court has ever struck down a federal statute based on this rationale, known as the ‘‘nondelega-tion doctrine.’’ Schechter Poultry’s stand against executive-branch rule-making proved to be a legal dead end, and for good reason. As the court has recognized over and over, before and since 1935, Congress is a cumbersome body that moves slowly in the best of times, while the economy is an in-credibly dynamic system. For the sake of business as well as labor, the updating of regulations can’t wait for Congress to give highly specific and detailed directions. The New Deal filled the gap by giving pol-icy-making authority to agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, which protects investors, and the National Labor Relations Board, which oversees col-lective bargaining between unions and em-ployers. Later came other agencies, includ-ing the Environmental Protection Agency, the Occupational Safety and Health Admin-istration (which regulates workplace safety) and the Department of Homeland Security. Still other agencies regulate the broadcast spectrum, keep the national parks open, help farmers and assist Americans who are over-seas. Administrative agencies coordinated the response to Sept. 11, kept the Ebola out-break in check and were instrumental to ending the last financial crisis. They regu-late the safety of food, drugs, airplanes and nuclear power plants. The administrative state isn’t optional in our complex society. It’s indispensable. But if the regulatory power of this arm of government is necessary, it also poses a risk that federal agencies, with their large bu-reaucracies and potential ties to lobbyists, could abuse their power. Congress sought to address that concern in 1946, by passing the Administrative Procedure Act, which en-sured a role for the judiciary in overseeing rule-making by agencies. The system worked well enough for dec-ades, but questions arose when Ronald Reagan came to power promising to deregu-late. His E.P.A. sought to weaken a rule, issue by the Carter administration, which called for regulating ‘‘stationary sources’’ of air pollution—a broad wording that is open to interpretation. When President Reagan’s E.P.A. narrowed the definition of what counted as a ‘‘stationary source’’ to allow plants to emit more pollutants, an environ-mental group challenged the agency. The Su-preme Court held in 1984 in Chevron v. Nat-ural Resources Defense Council that the E.P.A. (and any agency) could determine the meaning of ambiguous term in the law. The rule came to be known as Chevron deference: When Congress uses ambiguous language in a statute, courts must defer to an agency’s reasonable interpretation of what the words mean. Chevron was not viewed as a left-leaning decision. The Supreme Court decided in favor of the Reagan administration, after all, voting 6 to 0 (three justices did not take part), and spanning the ideological spectrum. After the conservative icon Justice Antonin Scalia reached the Supreme Court, he de-clared himself a Chevron fan. ‘‘In the long run Chevron will endure,’’ Justice Scalia wrote in a 1989 article, ‘‘because it more ac-curately reflects the reality of government, and thus more adequately serves its needs.’’ That was then. But the Reagan administra-tion’s effort to cut back on regulation ran out of steam. It turned out that the public often likes regulation—because it keeps the air and water clean, the workplace safe and the financial system in working order. De-regulation of the financial system led to the savings-and-loans crisis of the 1980s and the financial crisis a decade ago, costing tax-payers billions. Businesses, however, have continued to complain that the federal government regu-lates too much. In the past 20 years, conserv-ative legal scholars have bolstered the red- tape critique with a constitutional one. They argued that only Congress—not agencies— can create rules. This is Schechter Poultry all over again. And Judge Gorsuch has forcefully joined in. Last year, in a concurring opinion in an immigration case called Gutierrez-Brizuela v. Lynch, he attacked Chevron deference, writing that the rule ‘‘certainly seems to have added prodigious new powers to an al-ready titanic administrative state.’’ Re-markably, Judge Gorsuch argued that Chev-ron—one of the most frequently cited cases in the legal canon—is illegitimate in part be-cause it is out of step with (you guessed it) Schechter Poultry. Never mind that the Su-preme Court hasn’t since relied on its 1935 attempt to scuttle the New Deal. Nonethe-less, Judge Gorsuch wrote that in light of Schechter Poultry, ‘‘you might ask how is it that Chevron—a rule that invests agencies with pretty unfettered power to regulate a lot more than chicken—can evade the chop-ping block.’’ At his confirmation hearings, Judge Gorsuch hinted that he might vote to over-turn Chevron without saying so directly, noting that the administrative state existed long before Chevron was decided in 1984. The implication is that little would change if courts stopped deferring to the E.P.A.’s or the Department of Labor’s reading of a stat-ute. Judges would interpret the law. Who could object to that? But here’s the thing: Judge Gorsuch is skeptical that Congress can use broadly written laws to delegate authority to agen-cies in the first place. That can mean only that at least portions of such statutes—the source of so many regulations that safeguard Americans’ welfare—must be sent back to Congress, to redo or not. On the current Supreme Court, only Jus-tice Clarence Thomas seeks to strip power from the administrative state by undercut-ting Chevron and even reviving the obsolete and discredited nondelegation doctrine, as he explains in opinions approvingly cited by Judge Gorsuch. But President Trump may well appoint additional justices, and the other conservatives on the court have ex-pressed some uneasiness with Chevron, though as yet they are not on board for over-turning it. What would happen if agencies could not make rules for the financial indus-try and for consumer, environmental and workplace protection? Decades of experience in the United States and around the world teach that the administrative state is a nec-essary part of the modern market economy. With Judge Gorsuch on the Supreme Court, we will be one step closer to testing that premise. 
Mr. SCHUMER. There are clearly principled reasons to oppose Judge Gorsuch, and enough of us Democrats have reasons to prevent his nomination from moving forward on Thursday’s cloture vote. The question is no longer whether Judge Gorsuch will get enough votes on the cloture motion; now the ques-tion is, Will the majority leader and our friends on the other side break the rules of the Senate to approve Judge Gorsuch on a majority vote? That question should be the focus of the de-bate here on the floor, and it should weigh heavily on the conscience of every Senator. Ultimately, my Republican friends face a simple choice: They can fun-damentally alter the rules and tradi-tions of this great body or they can sit down with us Democrats and the Presi-dent to come up with a mainstream nominee who can earn bipartisan sup-port and pass the Senate. No one is making our Republican col-leagues change the rules. No one is forcing Senator M
CCONNELL to change the rules. He is doing it of his own voli-tion, just as he prevented Merrick Gar-land from getting a vote of his own vo-lition. Senator M
CCONNELL and my Re-publican colleagues are completely free actors in making a choice—a very bad one, in our opinion. I know my friends on the other side of the aisle are uncomfortable with this choice, so they are scrambling for arguments to justify breaking the rules. Let me go through a few of these justifications and explain why each does not hold up. First, many of my Republican col-leagues will argue that they can break the rules because ‘‘Democrats started it in 2013’’ when we lowered the bar for lower court nominees and Cabinet ap-pointments. Let’s talk about that. The reason Majority Leader Reid changed the rules was that Republicans had ramped up the use of the filibuster—the very filibuster they now decry—to historic proportions. They filibustered 79 nomi-nees in the first 5 years of Obama’s Presidency. Let’s put that into per-spective. Prior to President Obama, there were 68 filibusters on nomina-tions under all of the other Presidents combined, from George Washington to George Bush. We had 79. Our colleagues and Leader M
CCONNELL , the filibuster is wrong? There were 79—more than all of the other Presidents put together. The shoe was on a different foot. They deliberately kept open three seats on the second most important court in the land—the DC Court of Ap-peals—because it had such influence over decisions made by the govern-ment. This is the court, other than the U.S. Supreme Court, that the Fed-eralist Society and the Heritage Foun-dation hate the most. The deal that a

number of Senators made in 2005 al-lowed several of the most conservative judges to be confirmed to that court— very conservative people. It left a bad taste in my mouth, and I am sure in my colleagues’ and in many others. But then, when President Obama came in, they insisted on not filling any additional seats on the court— which, of course, would have been Democratic seats—and eventually held open 3 of the 11 seats on that court. They said they would not allow those seats to be filled by President Obama— an eerie precedent, which the majority leader repeated with Merrick Garland. He didn’t want the DC Circuit to have Obama-appointed, Democratic-ap-pointed nominees; he didn’t want that on the Supreme Court, so he blocked Merrick Garland. He didn’t want it on the DC Circuit, so they wouldn’t let any of President Obama’s nominees come to the floor. Merrick Garland’s nomination was not the first time the majority leader held open a judicial seat because it wasn’t the President of his party, and that was not during an election year. At the time, I spoke with my good friend from Tennessee, Senator A
LEX-
ANDER . I asked him to go to Senator M
CCONNELL and tell him that the pres-sure on our side to change these rules— after all of these unprecedented num-bers of filibusters—was going to be large. I said to Senator A
LEXANDER : Let’s try to avoid it. But Senator M
CCONNELL and Republicans refused all of our overtures to break the dead-lock they imposed. To be clear, Democrats changed the rules after 1,776 days of obstruction on President Obama’s nominees. My Re-publican friends are contemplating changing the rules after barely more than 70 days of President Trump’s ad-ministration. We moved to change the rules after 79 cloture motions had to be filed. They are talking about changing the rules after 1 nominee fails to meet the 60-vote threshold. So, yes, Democrats changed the rules in 2013, but only to surmount an un-precedented slowdown that was crip-pling the Federal judiciary, and we left the 60-vote threshold intact for the Su-preme Court deliberately. We could have changed it. We had free will then, just as Senator M
CCONNELL has it now. But we left the 60-vote threshold intact for the Supreme Court because we knew and know—just as our Repub-lican friends know—that the highest Court in the land is different. Unlike with lower courts, Justices on the Supreme Court don’t simply apply precedents of a higher court; they set the precedents. They have the ultimate authority under our constitutional government to interpret the law. Jus-tices on the Supreme Court should be mainstream enough to garner substan-tial bipartisan support; hence, why we didn’t change the rules; hence, why we believe in the 60-vote threshold; and hence, why 55 or 60 percent of all Amer-icans agree with the 60-vote threshold, according to the most recent polls. To me, and I think to most of my friends on the Republican side, that is not a good enough reason to escalate the ar-gument and break the rules for the Su-preme Court. Second, as I have mentioned, I have heard my Republican friends complain that Democrats are conducting the first partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee in history, so that is the reason they can justify breaking the rules because Democrats are the ones taking it to a new level. Again, I have just two words for my Republican friends: Merrick Garland. The Repub-lican majority conducted the first par-tisan filibuster of a Supreme Court pick when their members refused to have hearings for Merrick Garland. In fact, what the Republicans did was worse than a filibuster. The fact is, the Republicans blocked Merrick Garland using the most unprecedented of ma-neuvers. Now we are likely to block Judge Gorsuch because we are insisting on a bar of 60 votes. We think a 60-vote bar is far more in keeping with tradition than what the Republicans did to Merrick Garland. We don’t think the two are equivalent. Nonetheless, in the history of the Scalia vacancy, both sides have lost. We didn’t get Merrick Garland; they are not getting 60 votes on Judge Gorsuch. So we are back to square one right now, and the Republicans have total freedom of choice in this situation. Finally, Republicans have started to argue that because Democrats will not confirm Judge Gorsuch, we will not confirm anyone nominated by Presi-dent Trump, so they have to break the rules right now. That is an easy one. I am the Democratic leader. I can tell you myself that there are mainstream Republican nominees who could earn adequate Democratic support. And just look at recent history. Jus-tices Roberts and Alito, two conserv-ative judges who many of us on the Democratic side probably don’t agree with, both earned over 60 votes. They got Democratic votes. While there was a cloture vote on Justice Alito, he was able to earn enough bipartisan support that cloture was invoked with over 70 votes. He got only 58 when we voted for him, but the key vote was the cloture vote. Let’s have the President consult Members of both parties—he didn’t with Gorsuch—and try to come up with a consensus nominee who could meet a 60-vote threshold. That is what Presi-dent Clinton did with my friend, the Senator from Utah, in selecting Jus-tices Ginsberg and Breyer. It is what President Obama did with Merrick Gar-land. Of course, we realize a nominee se-lected this way would not agree with many of our views. That is true. But President Trump was elected Presi-dent, and he is entitled by the Con-stitution to nominate. But Judge Gorsuch is so far out of the main-stream that the Washington Post said his voting record would place him to the right of Justice Thomas. He was se-lected by the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society without an iota of input from the Senate. There is a better way to do this. I know it sometimes may seem like a foreign concept in our hyperpolarized politics these days, but there is always the option of actually consulting Democrats on a nominee and dis-cussing a way forward that both par-ties can live with. We are willing to meet anywhere, anytime. So my friends on the other side can dredge up these old wounds and shop-worn talking points if they choose. If Republicans want to conduct a par-tisan, ‘‘they started it’’ exercise, I am sure we could trace this all the way back to the Hamilton-Burr duel. But at the end of the day, they have to con-front a simple choice: Are they willing to break the rules of the Senate or can they work with us on a way forward? I, for one, hope we can find a way to com-promise. Judge Gorsuch was not a com-promise. He was solely chosen without any consultation. So it is not that there is a Merrick equivalency. My friend the majority leader said: ‘‘I think we can stipulate that in the Senate it takes 60 votes on controver-sial matters.’’ If anything is a con-troversial, important matter, it is a se-lection for the Supreme Court, and Senator MCCONNELL has repeatedly stood for the rightness of 60 votes on important and controversial issues. If Senator M
CCONNELL wants to change his view on the 60 votes all of a sudden and Republicans decide to go along with him, it will not be because Democrats started it, because that is not true. It will not be because Demo-crats will not confirm any President Trump-nominated Justice, because that is not true. It will be because they choose to do so, and they will have to bear the unfortunate consequences. Mr. President, I yield the floor. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I sug-gest the absence of a quorum.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES2184 April 4, 2017 
I have visited with retired miners from all across West Virginia to dis-cuss this situation. During the Feb-ruary congressional recess, I visited the Cabin Creek Health Center in West Virginia. The Cabin Creek Health Cen-ter serves hundreds of coal miners and their families. They provide pulmonary rehabilitation services for miners suf-fering from black lung. They also pro-vide primary care services for miners and other members of their commu-nity. During my visit, I met with sev-eral retired miners who would lose their health insurance coverage if Con-gress fails to act. These individuals are suffering from serious medical condi-tions and were unsure how they would afford their healthcare if they were to lose their current coverage. Just 2 weeks ago, I met with about a dozen retired miners from West Vir-ginia who came to Washington to sup-port the Miners Protection Act and to stand up for their hard-earned retire-ment benefits. Other groups of West Virginia miners have come to Wash-ington over the past few months. All have carried one message to Congress: Keep the promise of our lifetime health benefits. On March 1, thousands of min-ers received notice that their health in-surance would be terminated in 60 days. Most of these same people re-ceived that very same message just last October. As I listen to their sto-ries, it is hard to imagine the worry these notices cause for miners and their families. In December 2016, Congress included language in the continuing appropria-tions legislation that preserved health coverage for these retired miners for just 4 months. While that provision kept mining families from losing their health coverage—which is good—at the end of last year, a permanent solution is critically needed. The 4-month provision from the De-cember CR expires at the end of this month. It is vital—vital—that Congress take action within the next few weeks to provide healthcare and peace of mind for these miners in West Virginia and across coal country. Our retired miners deserve their promised healthcare coverage and should not have to receive another cancellation notice or another Band-Aid solution. We have a bipartisan vehicle for ac-tion. I have worked closely with Sen-ator J
OE MANCHIN , Senator R OB P
ORTMAN , and others to introduce and promote the bipartisan Miners Protec-tion Act, which would preserve healthcare and pension benefits for our miners. Our bill passed the Senate Fi-nance Committee last year by a bipar-tisan vote of 18 to 8. I also would like to thank the majority leader, Senator M
ITCH MCCONNELL , because he has in-troduced legislation that would provide a permanent healthcare solution for our miners. With all of us pulling together and with us working together, I am con-fident the Senate will act before the end of this month to continue these critical healthcare benefits for our miners. I ask my colleagues for their support in addressing this important issue for our working families. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Texas. NOMINATION OF NEIL GORSUCH  
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, yester-day the Senate Judiciary Committee voted out the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to fill the vacancy on the Su-preme Court left by the death of Jus-tice Scalia. During the meeting, as the Presiding Officer knows, our Demo-cratic colleagues trotted out the same old tired arguments we have heard time and again about Judge Gorsuch. In the end, though, none of those ar-guments hold water, and of course many of them aren’t even about him. Instead, these arguments reveal how our colleagues across the aisle are grasping for reasons to justify an un-precedented partisan filibuster of a Su-preme Court Justice. Some object to the nomination of Judge Gorsuch because they claim he refuses to answer specific questions. But I ask: How would any of us feel if the judge before whom we might later appear had previously, in order to get a confirmation of his nomination, made certain promises of how he would judge that case when presented at a future date? We would all feel more than a lit-tle bit betrayed and even cheated if the judge had prejudged our case before he even heard it. The judge is simply en-gaging in a common practice for Su-preme Court nominees. They steer clear of any questions that may per-tain to cases they may have to rule on later. It is a matter, as the Presiding Officer knows, of judicial ethics, and we wouldn’t have it any other way. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg set this precedent early on. During her con-firmation hearing in 1993, she said she didn’t want to give any hints or pre-views about how she might vote on an issue before her. So she politely and re-spectfully declined. Others followed her example, and Judge Gorsuch is, of course, doing precisely the same. By any fair review, Judge Gorsuch has a history of 10 years as a judge sit-ting on the Tenth Circuit Court of Ap-peals out of Denver, CO. He has a his-tory of interpreting the law fairly, bas-ing his judgments on the law and the facts, without regard to politics and without respect to persons. That brings me to this argument that somehow he is against the little guy. Clearly, a review of the records dem-onstrates that this is not so. But, again, how are judges supposed to per-form? Are they supposed to see the liti-gants—the parties to a lawsuit—in their court and say: Well, you have a big guy and you have a little guy, and I am always going to vote or render a judgment for the little guy without re-gard to the law or the facts? I realize that sometimes our col-leagues can weave a story that seems somewhat sympathetic when it comes to the fact that not everybody is guar-anteed a win in court. As a matter of fact, when there are two parties to a lawsuit, one of those parties is likely to be disappointed in the outcome. But that is what judges are there for. That is what they are supposed to do. They are supposed to render judgments, without regard to personal preferences or politics or without regard to their sympathies, let’s say, for one of the parties to the lawsuit. Judge Gorsuch even said this during his hearing: No one will capture me. No one will capture me—meaning that no special interest group or faction would derail him from following the law, wherever it may lead. That is why Judge Gorsuch is universally respected. That is why he was confirmed by voice vote 10 years ago to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. No one objected to Judge Gorsuch’s confirmation to a life-time appointment on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. Again, as the Presiding Officer knows, the Supreme Court of the United States only hears about 80 cases, give or take, a year. Most of the hard work gets done in our judicial sys-tem at the district court level and at the circuit court level, and almost all of the cases end in circuit courts, like the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, on which Judge Gorsuch serves. That is not to say that the Supreme Court is not important—it is—in resolving con-flicts between the circuits or ruling on important questions of law to guide all of the judiciary and to settle these issues for our country, at least for a time, and maybe even permanently when it comes to constitutional inter-pretation. Judge Gorsuch enjoys broad support from across the political spectrum, es-pecially from his colleagues and mem-bers of the bar. For 13 years, I served on the State ju-diciary in Texas, with 6 years as a trial judge and 7 years as a member of the Texas Supreme Court. When I heard that Judge Gorsuch had participated in 2,700 cases on a three-judge panel and 97 percent of them were unanimous, that told me something special about this judge. It takes hard work to build consensus on a multijudge panel, whether it is three judges or nine judges, like the Supreme Court. I think what we are going to see out of this judge is not somebody who is going to decide cases in a knee-jerk fashion but somebody who is going to work really hard to try to build consensus on the Supreme Court of the United States. That is really important to the Su-preme Court’s respect as an institution of our government. What causes dis-respect for our judiciary is when judges act like politicians, when they make pledges of how they will decide cases ahead of time or they campaign, in es-sence, for votes based on ideological positions. Judge Gorsuch is the opposite of that, and that is the kind of judge America needs right now in the Su-preme Court. That is why later on this

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2185 April 4, 2017 
week, on Friday, Judge Gorsuch will be confirmed. In spite of all the evidence in support of the nominee’s intellect and quali-fications, without regard to the bipar-tisan chorus urging his confirmation, the Democratic leader has decided to do everything he can to prevent us from even having an up-or-down vote on his nomination. Unfortunately, he will be making history in urging his Democratic colleagues to engage in a partisan filibuster against a Supreme Court justice. In our Nation’s long, rich history, there has never been a successful partisan filibuster of a Su-preme Court nominee. Now, some peo-ple want to talk about Abe Fortas back in 1968, which was totally different. But there has never been a successful partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court justice until, apparently, this week on Thursday—not one of them. Not one of my Republican colleagues mounted a filibuster when President Obama nominated Justice Sotomayor or Justice Kagan. Both received an up- or-down vote. That is because that has been the customary way this Chamber has treated Supreme Court nominees in the past. Only four times in our Na-tion’s history has a cloture motion ac-tually even been filed. But cloture was always achieved because, on a bipar-tisan basis, enough votes were cast to allow the debate to end and then to allow an up-or-down vote on the nomi-nee. To show how new this weaponization of the filibuster has become, back when Clarence Thomas was confirmed to the Supreme Court of the United States, he got 52 votes—52 votes—and was con-firmed and now serves on the Supreme Court. Back when he was confirmed, no one even dreamed of its use. It was theoretically possible, but no one dreamed of the idea that someone would raise the threshold for confirma-tion from a 51-majority vote to 60. Our colleagues have made it quite clear that they don’t want to support any nominee from this President. So it is not even just about Judge Gorsuch. It is about any nominee this President might propose to the Supreme Court. And I think what it boils down to is this: Our Democratic colleagues haven’t gotten over the fact that they lost the election. I think it really isn’t much more complicated than that. They adamantly resisted participating in the legislative process. They dug their feet on every Cabinet nomination and now on the Supreme Court nomi-nation. All they know is to obstruct because they haven’t gotten over the fact that Hillary Clinton isn’t Presi-dent of the United States. They keep bringing up Merrick Gar-land’s name. Judge Garland is a fine man, a good judge who serves on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, but you would have to go back to 1888 to find a time when someone was nominated in a Presidential election year with divided government and where that person was confirmed. What we decided to do upon the death of Justice Scalia is to say that the Supreme Court is so important that we are going to have a referendum on who gets to nominate the next Jus-tice on the Supreme Court. Our Demo-cratic friends thought for sure it would be Hillary Clinton. When it turned out to be Donald Trump, well, all bets were off, and they were in full opposition mode. But we would have respected the right of a President Hillary Clinton to fill that nomination because that is what we said was at stake in the elec-tion. I think it had a big impact on whom got elected on November 8 as President of the United States and who would fill that vacant seat and any fu-ture vacant seats on the Supreme Court. So here is the problem. If Judge Gorsuch is an unacceptable nominee, can you imagine any nominee by this President being acceptable to our Democratic colleagues? I can’t, be-cause Judge Gorsuch is about as good as you get when it comes to a nominee. He is exactly the type of person we should hope to see nominated to the Supreme Court. So it is time for our Democratic col-leagues to accept reality and not to live in some sort of fantasy land and not to try to punish good people like Judge Gorsuch, who has done an out-standing job, because they are dis-appointed in the outcome of the elec-tion. So here is the bottom line. Our Democratic friends will determine how we get to an up-or-down vote on Judge Gorsuch. If they are genuinely con-cerned about the institution of the Senate, they will provide eight votes to get cloture to close off debate, they will decline to filibuster the judge, and they will allow an up-and-down vote on this imminently qualified nominee. I am holding out hope that more thoughtful and independent Democrats will think better of the Democratic leader’s strategy. Several already have, and I commend them for it. I hope more will come around to that idea, but as I and others have said before, re-gardless of whether they do, Judge Gorsuch will be confirmed. But it is up to the Democrats to determine just how we get that done. I see a friend from Vermont here. I won’t take much longer. I want to take about 3 or 4 minutes, maybe 5 minutes, to debunk some of the myths about how we got here. I have in front of me an article writ-ten by Neil Lewis dated May 1, 2001. The title of this New York Times story is ‘‘Washington Talk; Democrats Readying for Judicial Fight.’’ It is dated May 1, 2001. That was, of course, in the early days of the George W. Bush administration. What it says is that 42 of the Senate’s 50 Democrats attended a private retreat in Farmington, PA, where the principal topic was forging a unified party strategy to combat the White House on judicial nominees. Mr. Lewis goes on to quote one of the people there who said: ‘‘They said it was important for the Senate to change the ground rules’’ by which ju-dicial nominees were confirmed. And they did as a result of that meeting, which was led by Laurence Tribe of Harvard Law School, Cass Sunstein of the University of Chicago, and Marcia Greenberger, codirector of the National Women’s Law Center. Senator S
CHU-
MER, the present Democratic leader, and others, cooked up a new procedural hurdle for President George W. Bush’s judicial nominees, and we remember what happened after that. It became al-most routine for our Democratic col-leagues to filibuster President Bush’s nominees. Ultimately, there came a meeting of a group called the Gang of 14, where there was a deal worked out that some of President Bush’s judicial nominees were confirmed and others were re-turned and not confirmed. There was a decision made at that time by the Gang of 14, a bipartisan group, that there would be no filibuster of judicial nominees, absent exceptional cir-cumstances. That was the language that they used—‘‘absent exceptional circumstances’’—that let us get by that obstacle and those filibusters for a time. The next major development oc-curred in 2013, when President Obama really wanted to see on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals—the primary circuit court that reviewed administrative de-cisions—more of his Democratic nomi-nees on that court. So in a new and un-precedented fashion, Senator Harry Reid changed the cloture rules once again—so-called the Reid Rule. For what purpose? It was a naked power grab. It was to pack the DC Circuit Court of Appeals—one of the least busy circuit courts in the country—in order to have judges confirmed by 51 Demo-cratic votes that would rubberstamp President Obama’s administrative ac-tions during his administration. And sadly, it worked. They did just that. So in a way, we are coming full cir-cle, back to what the tradition in the Senate was before the year 2000, before Democrats went to this retreat led by liberal legal activists who cooked up this idea that you could filibuster judges, and they tried to impose a re-quirement of 60 votes for confirmation when, in fact, the Constitution con-templates a majority vote, or 51 votes for confirmation. Some have said this represents the end of comity in the Senate. I don’t be-lieve that. Some have said this threat-ens the end of the legislative filibuster or cloture requirement. I don’t believe that either. There is a big difference between a nominee by a President that is an up-or-down vote—confirm or don’t confirm. There is a big difference between that and legislation, which by definition is a consensus-building proc-ess by offering an amendment, by offer-ing other suggestions to build that con-sensus and get it passed. You can’t amend a nominee. All you can do is vote up or down. So I don’t

believe restoring the status quo ante— going back before 2000 and restoring the 200-year-plus tradition of the Sen-ate where you don’t filibuster judges— I don’t see that as a bad thing. I don’t see it as the end of the legislative fili-buster. It is completely apples and or-anges. It is true that 51 Senators will be able to close off debate and confirm Judge Gorsuch, and we will see that happen later this week. It also means that the next Democratic President can nominate a Supreme Court nomi-nee, and that person will be confirmed by 51 votes. Again, this has been the 200-plus-year tradition of the Senate. I don’t see that as the end of the Senate. I don’t see this as somehow damaging our country—the restoration of the status quo before 2000, when our Demo-cratic colleagues decided to weaponize the filibuster and use it to block judges based on this trumped-up idea that 60 votes would be required rather than 51. I look forward to confirming Judge Gorsuch later this week. He is a fine man and a very good judge. He has ex-actly the sort of record we would want to serve on the Court. No, he is not a liberal activist. Clearly, Hillary Clin-ton, if she had been elected, would have nominated somebody different. That is one reason why we choose whom we choose for our President, because of the kinds of nominations they will make, and I must say President Trump has chosen well in Neil Gorsuch. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. F
LAKE ). The Senator from Vermont. Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court of the United States. After meet-ing with Judge Gorsuch and having a long and pleasant conversation, after hearing his testimony before the Judi-ciary Committee, and after carefully reviewing his record, I have concluded that I cannot support a man with his views for a lifetime seat on the Su-preme Court. The Supreme Court is the most im-portant judicial body in this country. The decisions that it reaches, even on a 5-to-4 vote, have a profound impact on all Americans, on our environment, and on our way of life. As we decide this week as to how we are going to cast our votes regarding Judge Gorsuch, it is important to understand how that vote for Judge Gorsuch—for or against him—will impact the lives of the people of our country. Let me give you just a few examples as to what is at stake. Seven years ago, in a 5-to-4 decision, the Supreme Court ruled in a case called Citizens United, and in that case, by a 5-to-4 decision, the Court said that billionaires and corporations could spend as much money as they wanted on the political process. This decision, as all Americans know, opened the floodgates of cor-porate money, of money from the bil-lionaire class, such that the wealthiest people in our country today can now elect candidates who represent their interests and not the interests of ordi-nary Americans. That decision, Citizens United, is un-dermining American democracy, and in my view, it is moving us toward an oli-garchic form of society in which a handful of the wealthiest people in this country—the Koch brothers and oth-ers—now have the power not only to control our economy but our political life as well. In my view, Citizens United must be overturned, and we must move back to a nation where our political system is based on one person, one vote, not on the ability of billion-aires to buy elections. Based on my conversation with Judge Gorsuch and a review of his record, do I believe that he will vote to overturn Citizens United? Absolutely not. Further, I suspect that he will vote to undermine our democracy even further by supporting the elimination of all restrictions on campaign finance, something which the Republican lead-ership in this body wants. What the Republican leadership is striving toward is eliminating all cam-paign finance restrictions, such that billionaires can say to somebody: I am going to give you $500 million to run for the U.S. Senate from California, and you work for me—no independent expenditures. I will select your cam-paign manager, your speech writer, your media adviser, your pollster. You are my employee. That is what the Republican leader-ship here wants. They want to under-mine all campaign finance laws, and I believe that Judge Gorsuch will move this country in that way, a more and more undemocratic way. Further, when we talk about the po-litical process, it is important to point out that in 2013, again by a 5-to-4 vote, the Supreme Court gutted the 1965 his-toric Voting Rights Act, a law which was passed to combat racial discrimi-nation in voting in a number of States. What the Court said, finally, is that in the United States, you have the right to vote no matter what the color of your skin is, a historic step forward in making this country the kind of coun-try that it must become. Well, as a result of that 5-to-4 Su-preme Court decision in 2013 gutting the Voting Rights Act, literally days after, we had Republican Governors and Republican legislatures all over this country, under the guise of fight-ing voter fraud, passing laws—every-body knows this—intentionally de-signed to make it harder for people of color, for poor people, for young people, for older people to vote in elections. In America in the year 2017, it is not too much to ask that all of our people who are eligible to vote be able to vote without harassment, without road-blocks, without barriers being placed in front of them. I know it is a radical idea, but it is called democracy. It is called democ-racy. It says that if you are eligible to vote, we want you to vote. We want you to participate. It says that in America, where we have one of the low-est voter turnout rates of any major country on Earth, we want more people to be participating in the political process, not fewer people. There is nothing I have seen in Judge Gorsuch’s record or in his recent statements to suggest to me that he is prepared to overturn this disastrous decision on the Voting Rights Act. In 1973, we all know, the Supreme Court decided Rowe v. Wade and de-clared that women have a constitu-tional right to control their own bod-ies. That decision has been subse-quently affirmed by multiple cases as recently as last June. In his confirmation hearings, Judge Gorsuch refused to state if he believed Roe v. Wade was good law and should be upheld. Based on his statements and general philosophy, I believe there is a strong likelihood that Judge Gorsuch would vote to overturn Roe v. Wade and deny the women of this country the constitutional right to control their own bodies. This would be an out-rage. I do not want to be a party to al-lowing that to happen. In addition, under Chief Justice John Roberts, the Supreme Court has time and again voted in support of corporate interests and against the needs of the working people of our country. After reviewing Judge Gorsuch’s record, I be-lieve he will continue that trend. In a case called TransAm Trucking, Judge Gorsuch argued that a trucker was properly fired by his employer for abandoning his cargo at the side of the road after his truck broke down and he nearly froze to death waiting for help. Judge Gorsuch literally believed that this man should have had to choose be-tween his life and his job, and by choosing his life—not freezing to death—he deserved to lose his job. In another case, Judge Gorsuch ruled that a university was correct to fire a professor battling cancer rather than grant her request to extend her sick leave. I find these decisions troubling. At a time of massive income and wealth inequality, when so many work-ing people throughout this country feel powerless at the hands of the wealthy and the powerful and their employers, we need a Supreme Court Justice who will protect workers’ rights and not just worry about corporate profits. I fear very much that Judge Gorsuch is not that person. I listened carefully to what my friend, Senator C
ORNYN of Texas, had to say about this entire process. I have to say that in his remarks there was a whole lot of obfuscation because there is a simple reality that we are going to have to deal with in the Senate this week. Everybody knows, and Senator C
ORNYN made the point, that under Harry Reid, the former Democratic leader, the rules, in fact, were changed. They were changed because of an un-precedented level of Republican ob-structionism, making it impossible for President Obama to get almost any of his nominees appointed.

Let’s not forget that in the midst of that controversial decision—and it was a controversial decision—the Demo-cratic leader had the power also to say that we will waive the 60-vote rule re-garding Supreme Court nominees. Democrats had the power, and they chose not to exercise that power in ending that rule—although, of course, they could have done that. I think the reason was that the Democratic leader-ship appropriately and correctly be-lieved that on an issue of such mag-nitude, the appointment of a Supreme Court Justice, it is important that there be bipartisan support. But right now, it appears that the Republican leadership is going to do what the Democratic leadership did not do; that is, waive that rule and get their judge appointed with 51 votes. So I would suggest to the Republican leader that instead of trying to push this nominee through with 50-some-odd votes, it might make more sense that, rather than changing the rule, change the nominee, and bring forth someone who, in fact, can get 60 votes. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. 
FOREIGN AGENTS REGISTRATION  
MODERNIZATION AND ENFORCEMENT ACT  
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, last month I introduced bipartisan legisla-tion with Senator T
ODDYOUNG of Indi-ana to create greater transparency about foreign individuals and organiza-tions that are operating in the United States to advance the interests of for-eign governments, including govern-ments that are hostile to the United States. In particular, our bill will give the Department of Justice new and nec-essary authority to investigate poten-tial violations of the Foreign Agents Registration Act by RT America, the U.S. branch of RT News or Russia Today News. The Foreign Agents Registration Act was passed back in the late 1930s in re-sponse to concerns about Nazi propa-ganda being disseminated in the United States without people knowing what it was. It is absolutely appropriate today for us to take a look at what Russia and other countries may be doing to our news. RT America, which broadcasts from studios here in Washington and is available on cable TV across the United States and across the world, for that matter, is one of the most high- profile assets in Vladimir Putin’s vast $1.4 billion propaganda machine. Ac-cording to the U.S. intelligence com-munity, the Kremlin selects the staff for RT and closely supervises RT’s cov-erage, including disinformation and false news stories designed to under-mine our democracy. Here we have a photo that shows ex-actly what I believe seems to be hap-pening with RT. This photo was taken from a declassified U.S. intelligence re-port, and it shows RT’s editor-in- chief—and former Putin campaign staffer, by the way—Margarita Simonyan briefing Putin on RT’s fa-cilities. So clearly he is interested. Well, I believe the American people have a right to know if a Russian Gov-ernment entity is exploiting our first amendment freedoms to harm our country. It is galling that RT news has publicly—publicly—boasted that it can dodge our laws by claiming to be fi-nanced by a nonprofit organization and not the Russian Government. Well, what my bill—our bill—would do is strengthen the Foreign Agents Registration Act by giving the Depart-ment of Justice authority to compel foreign organizations to produce docu-mentation to confirm funding sources and foreign connections. This is inves-tigative authority that has been rec-ommended by the Department of Jus-tice inspector general, the Government Accountability Office, and the Project on Government Oversight. Our bill would create transparency by giving Justice the authority it needs to inves-tigate RT America and publicly expose its ties to the Kremlin. The audacity of Russia’s interference in Western democracies, including ex-tensive meddling in our 2016 Presi-dential election, is deeply alarming, and we have learned that Russia’s in-fluence campaign reaches tens of mil-lions of unsuspecting Americans. False news stories can end up on our Facebook timelines and our Twitter feeds. They shape the political con-versations that we have with our friends at the supermarket and our col-leagues at work. These are just a few of the headlines from RT. This one is actually from Sputnik, which is another Russian news outlet. They show the extent to which these false news stories are being spread around. This one talks about how ‘‘1,000s Turkish forces sur-round NATO’s Incirlik air base for ‘in-spection’ amid rumors of coup at-tempt,’’ which suggests that we were involved in that coup attempt. ‘‘FBI wiretapped Trump Tower in search of ‘Russian mobster.’’’ ‘‘Spying on Trump: CIA Whistle-blower Points Finger at Clapper, Bren-nan, Comey.’’ ‘‘Ukrainian Su-25 fighter detected in close approach to MH17 before crash.’’ You will remember that this was the plane crash over Ukraine—that the Russians shot down. During our Presidential campaign in 2016, dozens of narratives and false news stories originated in Russia—for instance, this one, the baseless story that the Obama administration launched a coup against the Turkish Government from the U.S. airbase in that country. Earlier, RT News ran numerous re-ports on supposed U.S. election fraud and voting machine vulnerabilities, claiming that the results of the U.S. elections could not be trusted and did not reflect the people’s will. Well, researchers have traced these and other stories to a common source: the Kremlin’s sophisticated, multi-faceted propaganda empire, which reaches some 600 million people across 130 countries and in 30 languages. If you watch RT News, you will agree that it is not clear whether you are watching a U.S. news station or a Rus-sian station because it has slick pro-duction values. It is arguably the jewel in the crown of this propaganda em-pire. According to the U.S. intelligence community report declassified in Janu-ary: The Kremlin has committed significant re-sources to expanding the [RT News’] reach, particularly its social media footprint. . . . RT America has positioned itself as a domes-tic US channel and has deliberately sought to obscure any legal ties to the Russian gov-ernment. 
A prime objective of this propaganda barrage is to influence U.S. and Euro-pean public opinion, create confusion, and shape election outcomes. The Associated Press has identified a building in Moscow where an estimated 400 internet trolls—fluent in English and well-versed in American politics— work 12-hour shifts, creating false nar-ratives and fake news stories. These stories are then seeded on the internet, they get validated, and they get passed on by popular websites and eventually end up on our radios, TVs, and smartphone screens. In an incident earlier this month, a discredited former CIA employee went on RT News to charge that President Obama had asked British intelligence to spy on Donald Trump. Well, this false news story was then spread by legal commentator Anthony Napoli-tano on the FOX News show ‘‘Fox and Friends,’’ which is regularly watched by the President. The claims were then cited by President Trump and White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer to defend the President’s claims that his predecessor had wiretapped Trump Tower. Well, we know that during testimony before Congress 2 weeks ago, the NSA Director, ADM Michael Rogers, agreed with our British allies that the original RT News story was utterly ridiculous. At an Armed Services Committee hearing last month, Gen. Philip Breedlove, Retired, the former Su-preme Allied Commander in Europe, told us that when Russian-backed forces shot down Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 over Ukraine in 2014, the Rus-sians put out four stories within two news cycles placing the blame on the Ukrainian Government and others. This is the headline that we see from RT. The general said it took 2 years for

the West to finally debunk these false news stories. We know that Russia interfered in our 2016 Presidential election. We know that a Russian influence campaign was one aspect of that interference. Our in-telligence community has concluded that RT America is an arm of the Rus-sian propaganda juggernaut, operating openly in our country and taking full advantage of our First Amendment freedoms. I am sure we would all agree that ev-eryone in the United States, in every organization, has a right to speak, write, and broadcast freely. That is what our First Amendment says. We are a resilient democracy. We are con-fident that our values and institutions will prevail in the free marketplace of ideas. Our Constitution protects the right of individuals and organizations to spread those Russian viewpoints, disinformation, and even outright lies, but the American people have a right to know if RT America is a Russian propaganda organ that takes its direc-tion from the Kremlin. They have a right to know who is funding their op-erations. RT has publicly boasted that it uses a shell nonprofit corporation to dodge U.S. laws. This legislation, the Foreign Agents Registration Modernization and Enforcement Act, would put an end to that charade. The legislation Senator Y
OUNG and I recently introduced would give the Department of Justice the au-thority it needs to request documenta-tion from RT News on funding sources and foreign connections. As we see here, clearly the legisla-tion has hit a nerve because Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov defended RT News, and Russia’s State Duma is considering measures to retaliate. What RT says about our legislation is that ‘‘US senator wants to probe RT as a ‘foreign agent’ . . . What’s next, public executions’’? Well, that is ridic-ulous. The editor-in-chief at RT News has said that my legislation is a ‘‘per-secution of dissenting voices.’’ As I said, that is just nonsense. I welcome dissenting voices. That is what our First Amendment and the United States are all about. But it is not rea-sonable or acceptable for an individual or organization working in the United States on behalf of a hostile foreign government to conceal funding and di-rection that it receives from that gov-ernment. Vladimir Putin is not going to stop us from enforcing our laws and pro-tecting our country. We have a respon-sibility to expose RT News, RT Amer-ica, and the entire panoply of tactics that Russia has used to interfere in our 2016 election and that they continue to currently use to sow confusion and dis-trust and spread around stories which pretend to be news but which are not accurate. Make no mistake, the Kremlin’s in-fluence campaign is an ongoing enter-prise, and to the extent that it is suc-cessful, that it can operate under the radar screen, it will become even more brazen and more aggressive in the fu-ture. In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee last De-cember, Dr. Robert Kagan of the Brookings Institution said that Rus-sia’s broader objective is to subvert Western democracies, and we see that going on now in Europe. He said: ‘‘For the United States to ignore this Rus-sian tactic, and particularly now that it has been deployed against the United States, is to cede to Moscow a powerful tool of modern geopolitical warfare.’’ That was a direct quote. This is a profound test for our coun-try. Our democracy has been attacked and continues to be under attack from this kind of news that is being put out by a Kremlin-funded organization which is a hostile foreign power. We need to understand the Kremlin’s tac-tics, and we need to expose this propa-ganda here in the United States, in-cluding RT America. To that end, I urge my colleagues to support the For-eign Agents Registration Moderniza-tion and Enforcement Act. Let’s give the Department of Justice the tools it needs to investigate and expose RT America. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Montana. NOMINATION OF NEIL GORSUCH  
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, today I am joining my colleagues on the floor with a bit of confusion, a bit of dis-appointment, and, frankly, a lot of questions. I am referring to the con-firmation of Neil Gorsuch as the next Supreme Court Justice. As a Senator, one of the most con-sequential votes I will cast is a vote to confirm a U.S. Supreme Court nomi-nee. It is a lifetime appointment to our Nation’s highest Court. I recently spoke with some students back in Montana, some FFA students. The average age 17, 18 years old. God willing, Neil Gorsuch may serve on the Court for 30 or more years. These FFA students’ children and perhaps even grandchildren will be part of Neil Gorsuch’s time on the Court, given that he likely will serve for three dec-ades or more. As it stands today, the Senate is on the precipice of confirming Neil Gorsuch to be our next U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice. However, as the news has been reporting, as our Twitter feeds are overflowing with in-formation, it looks as though my col-leagues on the other side of the aisle are caving to the pressures of the far left, and they are set to unleash an un-precedented filibuster. I have met with Judge Gorsuch. I watched his confirmation hearings. What I have seen and what most Amer-icans agree—Judge Neil Gorsuch has been incredibly transparent, he has been accessible, and he is the right man for the position. He is main-stream. He is a westerner. He is com-mitted to judicial independence. He has a brilliant legal mind—that is without dispute. He is exceptionally qualified. In fact, the American Bar Association unanimously rated Judge Gorsuch as ‘‘well qualified.’’ That is its highest rating. He has met with nearly 80 Senators. Prior to his hearing, he provided the Judiciary Committee over 70 pages of written answers about his personal record. He provided 75,000-plus pages of documents, including speeches, case briefs, opinions, and written works going as far back as his college days. The White House archives produced over 180,000 pages of email and paper records related to Judge Gorsuch’s time at the Department of Justice. Judge Gorsuch sat for three rounds of questioning, totaling nearly 20 hours, in committee. As the American people watched Judge Gorsuch before that committee, they saw an exceptionally qualified nominee for the highest Court in the land, someone who was bright, who was kind. I would argue that Judge Gorsuch’s mind, his intellectual capacity, is only exceeded by his heart. This is a kind and independent jurist. When he came before the Judiciary Committee, this was the longest hear-ing of any 21st-century nominee. He answered nearly 1,200 questions during his hearing, which is nearly twice as many questions posed to Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, or Ginsburg. He was given 299 questions for the record by Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee—the most in recent history of any Supreme Court nominee. Judge Gorsuch did all of this with the utmost integrity and with transparency and humility. Yet here we are, with Demo-crats engaged in unprecedented ob-struction, refusing to give Neil Gorsuch an up-or-down vote. The Senate has only ever employed a cloture motion for a Supreme Court nominee four times in modern history. We voted on cloture when Justice Alito was nominated in 2006. We did the same in 1968, 1971, and 1986. In 1991, Clarence Thomas was confirmed on a 52-to-48 vote, and in 2006, Samuel Alito was confirmed on a 58-to-42 vote. In fact, when President Obama was in the White House, Republicans did not fili-buster a nominee. This body confirmed Sonya Sotomayor in 2009 by a vote of 68-to-31 and confirmed Justice Kagan by a rollcall vote of 63-to-37 in 2010. We did not filibuster. Let me remind folks that cloture is in place to stop debate, not to stop a vote. Cloture was put in place to speed the Senate up, end debate, and move to a vote, not to stop a vote. It was never intended to be a stall tactic or some-thing to obstruct this body. This bears repeating. Cloture was put in place to speed up the process, to pre-vent obstruction. This Chamber has never had a par-tisan filibuster to a Supreme Court nominee. Let me say that again. This Chamber has never had a partisan fili-buster to a Supreme Court nominee.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2189 April 4, 2017 
So here we are today, with no other option but to invoke this so-called nu-clear option to put an eminently quali-fied individual on the U.S. Supreme Court. Judge Gorsuch is the definition of a mainstream judge. In more than 2,700 cases in which he has participated in the Tenth Circuit, 97 percent of them have been decided unanimously; in fact, he was in the majority 99 per-cent of the time. Yet Senate Demo-crats would rather play politics and place the demands of extreme liberal interests over ensuring regular order. Let’s talk about what we are and what we are not doing. We are in the Senate, a Chamber I am honored to serve in, representing more than 1 mil-lion Montanans. We operate on a set of Parliamentary criteria based on things that have happened before. Therefore, we are going to establish a new prece-dent; we aren’t changing the rules. This isn’t happening for the first time. Let us remember that in November of 2013, Senate majority leader Harry Reid established a new precedent of how many votes are necessary on exec-utive branch nominees, with the exclu-sion of Supreme Court picks. What is even more shocking to me is that over the past few weeks, through the hearing process, through the de-bate and discussions about Judge Gorsuch on the floor, and with support from across my State of Montana—let me just name some of those organiza-tions and people in support of Judge Gorsuch: the Montana Chamber of Commerce; four of Montana’s Tribes— the CSKT, the Crow Tribe, Fort Belknap and Fort Peck; the Montana Farm Bureau, Judge Russell Fagg of the 13th judicial district, Judge Jeffrey Langton of the 21st judicial district, Judge John Larson of the 4th judicial district, State senator Nels Swandal, retired judge of the 6th Judicial Dis-trict; the Montana NRA members; the Montana Grain Growers Association and the Montana Wool Growers Asso-ciation; the Montana Stockgrowers As-sociation; our attorney general in Mon-tana, our auditor in Montana, our speaker of the Montana House. This is a very mainstream group of Mon-tanans, leaders back home who are in support of Judge Gorsuch. Yet my col-leagues are rejecting the will of the American people, rejecting the will of Montanans, filibustering this nomina-tion, and not even allowing for an up- or-down vote. The American people deserve a Su-preme Court Justice who upholds the rule of law and will follow the Con-stitution. The American people deserve a Supreme Court Justice who doesn’t legislate from the bench. The Amer-ican people deserve Judge Neil Gorsuch to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court. Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be allowed to speak for up to 3 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. 
INTERNET PRIVACY RIGHTS  
Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise today with a warning about S.J. Res. 34. This measure undermines the pri-vacy of all Montanans and all Ameri-cans. It is a measure I strongly oppose because it takes the refs off the field, leaving consumers at the whim of internet service providers. It allows these companies to sell our data—to sell my data—and to snoop through your search history and to track the sites we visit. In other words, it allows internet companies to make a profit by invading your privacy. It gives them the ability to collect and sell your physical location, information about your children, your health, finances, Social Security number, and web browsing history. In fact, this legisla-tion even extends to apps and your so-cial media accounts. Following the vote that we had here on this floor, a Republican State sen-ator from Buffalo, MT, proposed an amendment to our State budget to push back against this irresponsible resolution. In my home State of Mon-tana, folks on both sides of the aisle are deeply concerned about their right to privacy. Now folks you don’t even know can have access to the websites you visit, and they can have this access without your consent. This is another troubling step that folks in Congress have taken this year to violate the rights of privacy of law- abiding citizens. We already have a CIA Director who has advocated for the most intrusive acts of the PATRIOT Act. We have a Supreme Court nominee before us who supports the govern-ment’s ability to reach into the private lives of law-abiding Americans. Now Congress is rolling out the red carpet for major corporations to collect and sell our personal online information. Enough is enough. I am here today to provide a voice for all Montanans and all Americans who value their right to privacy, who expect their elected offi-cials to defend civil liberties, to stand up for constitutional rights, and who do not want private information col-lected and shopped around like a used book on Amazon. When the President decided to sign this resolution last night, he ushered in the latest significant threat to our right to privacy. Now it is the responsi-bility of service providers to protect our personal information online. I think folks in Montana and across this country have the right to question the priorities of those who supported this resolution. Everyone has a funda-mental right to privacy, and the gov-ernment shouldn’t be in the business of violating those individual rights, espe-cially when doing the bidding of big companies looking to make more prof-its at the expense of people’s privacy. I want it to be known in this body that Montanans don’t want anyone snooping around in their private lives, neither the government nor corpora-tions. It is fundamental to our Mon-tana values. Protecting online privacy is critical to the integrity of basic, fun-damental freedom, of fundamental civil liberty. I urge all my colleagues to make their voices heard on this critical issue. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Wyoming. (The remarks of Mr. B

Gorsuch, of Colorado, to be an Asso-ciate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Iowa. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, be-fore I start, I ask unanimous consent that the debate time on the nomina-tion of Judge Gorsuch during Tues-day’s session of the Senate be divided as follows: the time until 3:30 p.m. be under the control of the chairman of the Judiciary Committee; the time from 3:30 p.m. until 4:30 p.m. be under the control of the minority; the time from 4:30 p.m. until 5:30 p.m. be under the control of the majority; the time from 5:30 p.m. until 6:30 p.m. be under the control of the minority; and fi-nally, that the time from 6:30 p.m. until 6:45 p.m. be under the control of the majority. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today we will continue to debate the nomination of Judge Neil M. Gorsuch to serve as Associate Justice of the Su-preme Court of the United States. The Judiciary Committee held four full days of hearings last month. The judge testified for more than 20 hours. He answered more than 1,000 questions during his testimony and hundreds more questions for the record. We have had the opportunity to review the 2,700 cases he has heard, and we have had the opportunity to review the more than 180,000 pages of documents pro-duced by the Bush Library and the De-partment of Justice. Now, after all of this, my Democratic colleagues unfor-tunately appear to remain committed to what they have been talking about for a long period of time: filibustering the nomination of this very well quali-fied jurist. Even after all of this process, there is no attack against the judge that sticks. In fact, it has been clear since before the judge was nominated that some Members in the Democratic lead-ership would search desperately for a reason to oppose him. As the minority leader said before the nomination: ‘‘It’s hard for me to imagine a nominee that Donald Trump would choose that would get Repub-lican support that we could support.’’ That is the end of the quote from the minority leader. He said later, and I will continue to quote him: ‘‘If the nominee is out of the mainstream, we’ll do our best to hold the seat open.’’ Then the President nominated Judge Gorsuch. This judge is eminently quali-fied to fill Justice Scalia’s seat on the Supreme Court, and there is no deny-ing that whatsoever. Let me tell you some things about him. He is a graduate of Columbia Uni-versity and Harvard Law School. He earned a doctorate in philosophy from Oxford University and served as a law clerk for two Supreme Court Justices. During a decade in private practice, he earned a reputation as a distin-guished trial and appellate lawyer. He served with distinction in the Depart-ment of Justice. He was confirmed to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals by a unanimous voice vote in this body. The record he has built during his decade on the bench has earned him the universal respect of his colleagues both on the bench and the bar. This judge is eminently qualified to do what the President appointed him to do. Faced with an unquestionably quali-fied nominee, my friends on the other side of the aisle, my Democratic col-leagues, have continually moved the goalpost, setting test after test for this judge to meet. But do you know what? This judge has passed all of those tests, all with flying colors, so the people on the other side of the aisle—the Demo-crats in the minority—are left with a ‘‘no’’ vote in search of a reason. Let’s go through some of their argu-ments. First, the minority leader an-nounced that the nominee must prove himself to be a mainstream judge. Is he a mainstream judge or not? Well, con-sider his record: Judge Gorsuch has heard 2,700 cases and written 240 pub-lished opinions. He has voted with the majority in 99 percent of the cases, and 97 percent of the cases he has heard have been decided unanimously. Only one of those 2,700 cases was ever re-versed by the Supreme Court, and it happens that Judge Gorsuch did not write the opinion. Then consider what others say about him. He has been endorsed by promi-nent Democratic members of the Su-preme Court bar, including Neal Katyal, President Obama’s Acting So-licitor General. This Acting Solicitor General wrote a New York Times op-ed entitled ‘‘Why Liberals Should Back Neil Gorsuch.’’ Mr. Katyal wrote: ‘‘I have no doubt that if confirmed, Judge Gorsuch would help to restore con-fidence in the rule of law.’’ He went on to write that the judge’s record ‘‘should give the American peo-ple confidence that he will not com-promise principle to favor the Presi-dent who appointed him.’’ Likewise, another well-known per-son, David Frederick, a board member

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2191 April 4, 2017 
of the liberal American Constitution Society, says we should ‘‘applaud such independence of mind and spirit in Su-preme Court nominees.’’ So after hearing what people on both the right and the left have said about the judge, it is clear that he is ‘‘main-stream,’’ but the goalpost seems to move. Next we hear that the judge doesn’t care about the ‘‘little guy’’ and, instead, rules for the ‘‘big guy.’’ First of all, that is a goofy argument. Just ask liberal law professor Noah Feldman. If you ask Professor Feld-man, he says this criticism is a ‘‘truly terrible idea’’ because ‘‘the rule of law isn’t liberal or conservative—and it shouldn’t be.’’ The strategy on this point became clear during our hearing: Pore through 2,700 cases, cherry-pick a couple where sympathetic plaintiffs were on the los-ing end of the legal argument, then find a reason to attack the judge for that result, and then, because of that case or two, label him ‘‘against’’ the little guy. As silly as that argument is, the judge himself laid waste to that ar-gument during the hearing when he rattled off a number of cases where the so-called little guy came out on the winning end of the legal argument of a case. At any rate, as we discussed at length during his hearings, the judge applies the law neutrally to every party before him, and that is what you expect of judges. I disagree with some of my col-leagues who have argued that judging is not just a matter of applying neutral principles. I think that view is incon-sistent with the role our judges play in our system and, more importantly, with regard to the oath they take. That oath requires them to do ‘‘equal right to the poor and the rich’’ and to apply the law ‘‘without respect to per-sons.’’ Naturally, this is what it means to live under the rule of law, and this is what our nominee has done during his decade on the bench of the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. So the judge applies the law ‘‘without respect to persons,’’ as he promised in his first oath he would, and he will repeat the oath when he goes on the Supreme Court. Then, of course, as they move these goalposts, the judge has been criticized for the work he did on behalf of his former client, the U.S. Government, when he was at the Justice Depart-ment. Of course, we have had a lot of nomi-nees over many years who have worked as lawyers in the government. Most re-cently, Justice Kagan worked as Solic-itor General. As we all know, she ar-gued before the Supreme Court that the government could constitutionally ban pamphlet material. That is a fairly radical position for the U.S. Govern-ment to take. When asked about that argument during her hearing, she said that she was a government lawyer making an argument on behalf of her client, the U.S. Government, and it had nothing to do with her personal views on the subject. Now, there is a whole different standard for some people of this body. That answer is apparently no longer good enough. To hear the other side tell it, government lawyers are responsible for the positions their client, the U.S. Government, takes and the positions they have to argue. I re-spect my colleagues who are making this argument, but this argument does not hold water. What, then, are my colleagues on the other side left with after moving these goalposts many times, after making all of these arguments that don’t stick? What are they left with? Because they can’t get any of their attacks on the judge to stick, all they are left with are complaints about the so-called dark money being spent by advocacy groups. Yes, that is where the goalpost took them—to dark money. As I said yesterday, that speaks vol-umes about the nominee, that after re-viewing 2,700 cases, roughly 180,000 pages of documents from the Depart-ment of Justice and the George W. Bush Library, thousands of pages of briefs, and over 20 hours of testimony before our committee and hundreds of questions both during and after the hearing, all his detractors are left with is an attack on the nominee’s sup-porters—people out there whom the nominee probably doesn’t even know. They raise money to tell people about him, which they have a constitutional right to do under the First Amendment freedom of speech. The bottom line is that they don’t have any substantive attacks on this nominee that will stick, so they shifted tactics, yet again moving the goalpost, and are now trying to intimidate and silence those who are speaking out and making their voices heard in regard to this nominee. Here is the most interesting thing about this latest development: There are advocacy groups on every side of this nomination. There are people out there for him, raising money and spending the money for him, and there are people out there against him who are raising and spending money so peo-ple know why they disagree with this nominee. Of course, that is nothing new. That has been true of past nomi-nations, and there is nothing wrong with citizens engaging in the First Amendment freedom of speech and in the process of being for or against and encouraging public debate on whether a person ought to be on the Supreme Court. It was certainly true when lib-eral groups favoring the Garland nomi-nation poured money into Iowa to at-tack me last year for not holding a hearing. For that reason, I didn’t hear a lot of my Democratic colleagues complain about that money that could well be called dark money as well. There are groups on the left who are running ads in opposition to this nomi-nee and threatening primaries. They are actually threatening primaries against Democrats who might not tow the line and might not help filibuster this nomination. For some reason, I am not hearing a lot of complaints about the money that is being raised to make some Democrats who might support this nominee look bad. As I have said, there is nothing wrong with citizens engaging in the process and making their voices heard. This is one of the ways we are free to speak our minds in a democracy. It has been true for a long, long time. As I said yesterday in the committee meeting, if you don’t like outside groups getting involved, the remedy is not to intimidate and try to silence that message; the remedy you ought to follow is to support nominees who apply the law as it is written and then, in turn, leave the legislating to a body elected to make laws under our Con-stitution—the Senate and the House of Representatives. Regardless of what you may think about advocacy groups, about their getting involved, there is certainly no reason that they should go to great lengths to talk about this in our com-mittee or talk about it to the nominee because he can’t control any of that. The truth is, the Democrats have no principled reason to oppose this nomi-nation, and those are words from David Frederick that I have quoted before. It is clear instead that much of the oppo-sition to the nominee is pretextual. The merits and qualifications of the nominee apparently no longer matter. The only conclusion we are left to draw is that the Democrats will refuse to confirm any nominee this Repub-lican President may put forth. There is no reason to think the Democrats would confirm any other judge the President identified as a potential nominee or any judge he would nomi-nate. In fact, we don’t even need to speculate on that point because the mi-nority leader has spoken that point and made his point very clear. Before the President made this nomination, he said: ‘‘I can’t imagine us supporting anyone from his list.’’ So it was very clear from the very beginning that the minority leader was going to lead this unprecedented filibuster. The only question was what excuse he would manufacture to justify it. The nominee enjoys broad bipartisan support from those who know him, and he enjoys bi-partisan support in the Senate. I recognize that the minority leader is under very enormous pressure from special interest groups to take this ab-normal step of filibustering a judge, be-cause filibustering the Senate is not unusual but filibustering a Supreme Court Justice is very unusual. I know other Members of his caucus are oper-ating under those very same pressures as well. In fact, yesterday, while the committee was debating the nomina-tion, a whole host of liberal and pro-gressive groups held a press conference outside of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, demanding that the campaign arm cut off campaign funds for any incumbent Democrat who

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES2192 April 4, 2017 
doesn’t filibuster this nominee. Those groups argue that because the Demo-cratic Senatorial Campaign Committee had already raised a lot of money off the minority leader’s announcement that he was going to lead a filibuster, the committee shouldn’t provide that money to any Member who refused to join this misguided effort. Well, all I can say is that it would be truly unfortunate for Democrats to buckle to that pressure and engage in the first partisan filibuster of a Su-preme Court Justice nominee in U.S. history—another way to say that is, the first partisan filibuster in the 228- year history of our country since 1789. If they regard this nominee as the first in our history worthy of a partisan fili-buster, it is clear they would filibuster anyone. I have stated since long before the election that the new President would nominate the next Justice and the Ju-diciary Committee would process that nomination. That is just what we have done through the committee, and now we are doing it on the floor. So I urge my colleagues not to engage in this un-precedented partisan demonstration. Everyone knows the nominee is a qualified, mainstream, independent judge of the very highest caliber. Re-publicans know it, Democrats know it, and the left-leaning editorial boards across the country prove that even the press knows it. I urge my colleagues on the other side to come to their senses and not engage in the first partisan fil-ibuster in U.S. history and instead join me and vote in favor of Judge Gorsuch’s confirmation. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Colorado. Mr. GARDNER. Thank you, Mr. President, for the opportunity to come to the floor today in support of Judge Neil Gorsuch’s confirmation to the Su-preme Court. As a Coloradan, it gives me great honor to be here to talk about his nomination, the exceptional qualities of Judge Gorsuch, and how he will make us proud from the bench of the U.S. Supreme Court. I also commend my colleague, Chair-man C
HUCK GRASSLEY , for his work on the Judiciary Committee presiding over a very fair series of hearings, giv-ing members on both sides of the aisle time to learn about Judge Gorsuch, to question Judge Gorsuch, and the time to present their side of the argument depending on whatever side that was going to be. Because of the fairness of the hearings, because of the fairness with which Chairman G
RASSLEY exe-cuted the hearings, it is quite obvious that this Chamber is faced with a very exceptional judge, a very exceptional nominee, and a nominee there is really no excuse to vote against. Neil Gorsuch really is about the story of the West. He is a fourth-gen-eration Coloradan. It is nice to stand here and talk about somebody who shares so much of our western experi-ence and western heritage and some-body who serves on the Tenth Circuit Court in Denver—a circuit court that represents 20 percent of the land mass of the United States. Neil Gorsuch’s background and up-bringing in Colorado represent the hard work of westerners. His maternal grandfather, Dr. Joseph McGill, began his adult life by working in Union Sta-tion, the main railway terminal in downtown Denver. Dr. McGill put him-self through medical school and went on to become a prominent surgeon. His grandmother, Dorothy Jean, raised seven children, all of whom he gave a better life and put through college be-cause of his work in Colorado. Neil’s paternal grandfather, John Gorsuch, was his legal inspiration. After serving in World War I, John Gorsuch put himself through undergrad and law school at the University of Denver by driving a trolley car back in the trolley car days of Denver. John, his grandfather, helped to build a pri-vate law practice that focused on real estate law. He made time to help Den-ver’s welfare department and partici-pated in Kiwanis and numerous other civic organizations, building a leg-endary law firm in Denver known as Gorsuch Kirgis. This is the kind of upbringing that made Neil Gorsuch who he is. In his younger days, Neil moved furniture, shoveled snow, like so many of us in Colorado, mowed lawns. It was the kind of upbringing that brings grit and determination to any person who knows hard work. It is that work ethic, combined with his family’s apprecia-tion of higher education, that helped Neil consistently realize academic ex-cellence. It has been debated on this floor numerous times, his academic credentials that he would bring to the Supreme Court—his background and education at Columbia, law school at Harvard, his Ph.D. at Oxford, and of course, most importantly, the summer he spent at the University of Colorado and the teaching he carries out at the University of Colorado School of Law. This week, we are going to see a lot of finger-pointing and hear a lot of ac-cusations. We are going to hear a lot of blame. The one thing we may not hear too much about is the person we are debating—Neil Gorsuch. That is be-cause when it comes to Judge Gorsuch, people understand the highly qualified judge that he is. People understand the incredible legal mind he would bring to the Supreme Court. Instead of debating the merits of the nominee, they are going to debate how we got to the place we are today, and by the end of this week, architects of obstruction may force this Chamber to vote along par-tisan lines on something that should be a bipartisan effort. In Colorado, if you go to downtown Denver, you will see an area known as Confluence Park. Confluence Park is a great place in Colorado where people go to spend an afternoon and perhaps a weekend on a hot summer’s day. It is where two rivers join together. There at Confluence Park, Colorado’s poet laureate, Thomas Hornsby Ferril, has a poem inscribed on a plaque, which reads: I wasn’t here. Yet I remember them, the first night long ago, those wagon people who pushed aside enough of the cottonwoods to build our city where the blueness rested. 
It is a poem that reminds us in Colo-rado that we are always looking up, that we are always looking toward the mountains and to that great blue sky. That is what Neil Gorsuch has done his entire life. He is somebody who is for-ward-thinking, somebody who under-stands the optimistic sense of Colo-rado, who understands the majesty of our West, and who understands the majesty of our form of government—a system that has three separate but equal branches of power. He has led a life that is dedicated to the majesty of our Constitution. He is somebody who understands the pillars of our govern-ment in that no one branch of govern-ment should gain an unfair advantage over the other. That is what we ought to be debating this week. Instead, we are going to live the consequences of decisions that were made over a decade ago. It is interesting that Judge Gorsuch serves on the Tenth Circuit Court be-cause one of his fellow judges on the Tenth Circuit Court was nominated by President George Bush in the early part of 2001, 2002, 2003. It was Tim Tymkovich who was nominated by President Bush and who was caught up in the very first round of filibusters that changed the way this Chamber worked on nominations. It was a calculated determination by some in this Chamber to use a tool that had never been used before in such a lethal, partisan fashion that it would bring down judges and ultimately lead to a corrosion of Senate custom—a cor-rosion of over 200 years of Senate prac-tice—when it comes to judges’ con-firmations. Ultimately, this week, we will see whether it leads to the disrup-tion of how we confirm Supreme Court Justices. Make no mistake about it, over the past 200 years, we have not seen this moment before—a successful partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court Justice. People are going to talk about this around the country as they read the news, as they listen to the radio, as they watch on TV what is happening in the Senate. Most will just wonder, is the nominee qualified? If the nominee is qualified, then why are we trying to have an argument about ‘‘he said, she said’’ 15 years ago, 16 years ago? Be-cause the nominee is well qualified, he should be confirmed. Why are we going to change 200 years of Senate practice and custom if the nominee is highly qualified, has what it takes to serve on the Supreme Court? That is the choice Members of this Chamber will have to make over the next several days as we work to confirm Judge Gorsuch. In 2006 when Judge Gorsuch was con-firmed to serve on the Tenth Circuit

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2193 April 4, 2017 
Court in Denver, this Chamber did so unanimously by voice vote. There are a dozen Members in this Chamber who served then and did not oppose his nomination, many of whom seem will-ing today to block his nomination to the Supreme Court. One thing has changed in the inter-vening years; that is, who serves in the Presidency, who serves in the White House, who serves as President, and whether that nomination came from a Republican or a Democrat. The nomi-nation, of course, in 2006 came from a Republican. Still, he was confirmed unanimously. Judge Gorsuch, now nominated to serve on the Supreme Court, was appointed by a Republican. Yet those very same people who sup-ported him 11 years ago are now object-ing to his service on the High Court after his exemplary decade of service on the Tenth Circuit Court. It was service that showed Judge Gorsuch’s joining in over 2,700 opin-ions, and with the majority the vast number of times. It was service in which he got to know the Colorado legal community. As we have discussed over the past several days and several weeks and the past month, the people who know Judge Gorsuch the best are the people who served with him and who worked with him at the Depart-ment of Justice, who practiced law with him, and who serve in the Colo-rado legal community. I thought it was important that we spend some time in talking about the people who know Judge Gorsuch the best because I think their opinions matter in this—those of the people of Colorado who want Judge Gorsuch confirmed. Let me start with a series of quotes from Judge Gorsuch’s supporters back home in Colorado—again, those people who know him the best. This particular quote comes not from a Republican, not from a conservative; this quote comes from Steve Farber, who served in 2008 as the Democratic National Convention cochair. Again, he is not a conservative and he is not a Republican; he was the cochair of the 2008 Democratic National Convention. 
We know Judge Gorsuch to be a person of utmost character. He is fair, decent, and honest, both as a judge and a person. 
Steve Farber continues: 
We all agree that Judge Gorsuch is excep-tionally well qualified to join the Supreme Court. He deserves an up-or-down vote. 
This is not M ITCH MCCONNELL who is saying this. It is not C
ORY GARDNER , Republican Senator from Colorado, who is saying this. This is a very prominent figure in Colorado’s legal community and somebody who served in the 2008 Democratic National Con-vention. One of those 12 people who supported Judge Gorsuch in 2006 was then-Sen-ator Barack Obama, who was seeking the nomination at Mile High Stadium, at this very convention of which Steve Farber was cochair. Steve Farber says we should confirm Judge Gorsuch with an up-or-down vote. Norm Brownstein said that Judge Gorsuch deserves a fair shake in the confirmation process. He is another very prominent Democratic lawyer in Denver. We have heard a lot of people talk about the cases—those 2,700 opinions— that he was a part of. We have heard Senator GRASSLEY talk about argu-ments against Judge Gorsuch, people who have said that Judge Gorsuch was always against the little guy and that he was siding with corporations. Here is a quote from a Denver lawyer and Democrat on representing under-dogs before Judge Gorsuch: 
[Judge Gorsuch] issued a decision that, most certainly, focused on the little guy. 
Why did Marcy Glenn say this? Marcy Glenn said this because she knows that Judge Gorsuch voted with the majority of the court in 99 percent of the cases. In those 2,700 opinions, 99 percent of the time, Judge Gorsuch ruled with the majority. That is not trying to look out for the big guy or the little guy. That is about following the law. That is about a court that rec-ognizes it is not in the business of focus groups or policy preferences, pop-ularity contests or poll testing. It is about a judge who recognizes that the rule of law matters and that you take an opinion where the law leads you and takes you, not where your personal opinion takes you. It was 99 percent of the time that Judge Gorsuch voted to side with the majority on the court, and 97 percent of the time, those rul-ings were unanimous. Those decisions were unanimous. Of those 99 percent in which he sided with the majority, 97 percent of them were unanimously de-cided. This is a judge who is as mainstream as we have seen. He is somebody who understands the obligation and the duty he has to the law. He is somebody who understands what it means to be a good judge. I want to read a letter Senator B
EN-
NETand I received from the Colorado legal community: 
As members of the Colorado legal commu-nity, we are proud to support the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to be our next Su-preme Court Justice. We hold a diverse set of political views as Republicans, Democrats, and Independents. 
That is bipartisan support back home from those people who know the judge the best. What does Neil Gorsuch think it takes to be a good and faithful judge? I will just read from Judge Gorsuch: 
It seems to me that the separation of legis-lative and judicial powers isn’t just a for-mality dictated by the Constitution. Neither is it just about ensuring that two institu-tions, with basically identical functions, are balanced one against the other. To the Founders, the legislative and judicial powers were distinct by nature, and their separation was among the most important liberty-pro-tecting devices of the constitutional design— an independent right of people essential to the preservation of all of the rights later enumerated in the Constitution and its amendments. Now, consider, if we allow the judge to act like a legislator, unconstrained by the bi-cameralism and presentment hurdles of Arti-cle I, the judge would need only his own voice or those of just a few colleagues to re-vise the law, willy-nilly, in accordance with his preferences, and the task of legislating would become a relatively simple thing. Notice too how hard it would be to revise this so easily made judicial legislation to ac-count for changes in the world or to fix mis-takes. Being unable to throw judges out of office in regular elections, you would have to wait for them to die before you would have any chance of change. Even then, you would find the change difficult, for courts cannot so easily undo the errors given the weight that they afford to precedent. Notice, finally, how little voice the people would be left in a government in which life- appointed judges are free to legislate along-side elected representatives. The very idea of self-government would seem to wither to the point of pointlessness. Indeed, it seems that, for reasons just like these, Hamilton ex-plained, that liberty can have nothing to fear from the judiciary alone but that it has everything to fear from the union of the ju-dicial and legislative powers. That is what Judge Gorsuch said makes a good and faithful judge. Over the course of the next week or over the course of the next several days, we are going to flesh out in detail some of the decisions people may find they disagree with. We will flesh out in detail Judge Gorsuch’s temperament and his performance at the committee hearings. Yet there is no doubt that Judge Gorsuch has the support of the American people, who believe he should be confirmed. There is no doubt that Judge Gorsuch has the support of people who cochaired the Democratic National Convention and of prominent attorneys who know him best from Col-orado. There is no doubt that his is an upbringing from the West. It is the story of how we built the West. I hope that over the course of the next few days, Republicans and Demo-crats alike will come to the conclusion that we will do this country a service. Instead of having partisan fights, we will have the bipartisanship support for a judge who will truly make this coun-try proud, a judge who will truly rep-resent the law, not personal opinion. I thank the Presiding Officer for this opportunity today. I look forward to being here for the rest of the week as we talk about Judge Gorsuch’s quali-fications and as we talk about the nomination. More than anything, let’s make it clear that for 200-plus years, we have allowed judges to come to this floor for the Supreme Court and to be confirmed by a simple majority—no threshold, no 60-vote requirement. We have done so without partisan filibusters. I think that if we can maintain that custom, that practice, this country will be bet-ter served. There is no reason to change two centuries of practice in this body simply because they have decided they do not like the person who made the nomination. I yield the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES2194 April 4, 2017 
time until 4:30 p.m. will be controlled by the Democrats. The Senator from Hawaii. Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, over the next hour, a number of my colleagues and I will join together to speak in op-position to the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to be an Associate Jus-tice of the U.S. Supreme Court. We are joining together today because this nomination is not just about the future of the Supreme Court. It is about the future of our country. There is no question about Judge Gorsuch’s credentials or about his in-tellect. He is a graduate of Columbia and Harvard and has been a judge on the Tenth Circuit Court for more than a decade. In fact, his credentials are in stark contrast to so many of the dan-gerously unqualified individuals Presi-dent Trump appointed to his Cabinet. Judge Gorsuch should not get a pass simply because we are relieved that President Trump didn’t nominate a member of his family or a reality tele-vision personality for this job. Creden-tials cannot and should not be the only points we consider when evaluating a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court. In fact, we should expect that anyone nominated to the Supreme Court will at least have impressive cre-dentials. By many accounts, Judge Gorsuch would be the most conservative Justice on the Court—even more conservative than Justice Thomas or Justice Scalia. Rightwing advocacy groups cheered his nomination and have spent over $10 million to support his nomination. They spent this money because they have high confidence that he will rule in their favor on so many of the tough cases that will come before the Su-preme Court. These groups, including the Heritage Foundation and the Fed-eralist Society, selected Judge Gorsuch because he meets their litmus test for how they think a Justice should rule. They selected him because they under-stood Judge Gorsuch clearly met the litmus test the President outlined dur-ing his campaign. To paraphrase, Donald Trump wanted a judge who would prioritize the reli-gious freedom of a corporation over the rights of its employees, uphold an ex-pansive view of the Second Amend-ment, making it much tougher to enact sensible gun legislation to pro-tect our communities, and who would overturn Roe v. Wade—as Donald Trump put it—automatically. Judge Gorsuch’s credentials are just a starting point. For the people who need justice most urgently, Judge Gorsuch’s view of the law and his judi-cial philosophy will make a world of difference. The working families, women, differently abled, people of color, the LGBTQ community, immi-grants, students, seniors, and our Na-tive peoples are the people who will be impacted by the decisions a Justice Gorsuch would make. Today, April 4, is Equal Pay Day, which means that it took women until today to make the same amount that men made in 2016. Women have had to work more than 3 months longer to catch up, on average, to men. This significant pay disparity has ex-isted for centuries, but it has been ille-gal in the United States since the pas-sage of the Equal Pay Act in 1963. Prov-ing illegal pay disparity under this law has been challenging, as we all know. Nationally, women are paid only 79 cents for every dollar a man is paid. In Hawaii, women are paid only 82 cents for every dollar a man makes. That is a little better than the rest of the country, but it is in no way good enough. At the median salary, that 82 cents translates into about $8,000 less per year in wages for a woman in Hawaii. That is a lot of money in my State, where the high cost of living makes it even more difficult for working fami-lies to get ahead—not to mention that many working families in Hawaii, as well as in other States, are headed by women. My immigrant family was headed by my mother. As we mark Equal Pay Day, I am well aware of the tremendous impact a single Justice can have on the lives and rights of millions of Americans. Under Chief Justice John Roberts, the Supreme Court has issued numer-ous 5-to-4 decisions that have favored corporate interests over the rights of individuals—cases like Shelby County, Citizens United, and Hobby Lobby. One of the most deeply flawed of these 5-to-4 decisions was in a 2007 case called Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. That decision had the effect of denying justice to a woman who had suffered pay discrimination for more than a decade. The Court said, in ef-fect, that because Lilly Ledbetter didn’t learn of the pay discrimination until it was too late, our justice sys-tem could not help her. Put another way, under the ruling, employers could discriminate against women so long as the employers made sure the women didn’t find out about it. This will not be hard to do, as em-ployers are not likely to announce that they are providing discriminatory pay to their female employees. This is what happened to Lilly Ledbetter. She didn’t know. This decision was deeply wrong and surprised many Court watchers. It undid years of judicial precedent. I remember learning of this decision in Hawaii. I was serving on the House Education and Labor Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives at that time. The Supreme Court decision inter-preted a Federal law that fell within the jurisdiction of the committee on which I sat. George Miller, then chair of the committee, immediately an-nounced that we would change the law to be interpreted the way it had been before the Court applied their own nar-row and wrong interpretation. We passed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act with a Democratic Congress in 2009. Frankly, I doubt a Republican- controlled House and Senate would have done the same. It was the first bill President Obama signed into law. I was there for that bill signing. Though we could not retroactively help Mrs. Ledbetter, this law reversed the Supreme Court’s decision and as-sured that the injustice she endured did not happen to other women or to anyone else. Clearly, the composition of the Court and the identity of the fifth Justice matters a great deal in the real world—the real world of 5-to-4 decisions. Yet, during this hearing, Judge Gorsuch refused to even acknowledge the role that judicial philosophy plays in the role of a Justice, and he downplayed the impact the law could have on people’s lives, repeatedly say-ing he merely applied the law. If Justices merely applied the law and the law was so clear, we wouldn’t have so many 5-to-4 decisions in the most critical cases. Judge Gorsuch told me during our meeting in February that the purpose of title III courts—these are the Fed-eral courts—is to protect minority rights. But I found through examining his writings and decisions that Judge Gorsuch’s view of the law lacks an un-derstanding of people, their lives, and how the courts’ decisions would impact them. This was particularly true in exam-ining his ruling in the Hobby Lobby de-cision, where Judge Gorsuch dem-onstrated a cavalier attitude about how his decision would impact the thousands of women working at the Hobby Lobby company. In that case, Judge Gorsuch decided that a corporation with tens of thou-sands of employees—many of them women—has rights to the exercise of religion protected by the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, and that it could use those rights to deny to the thousands of women in its employ ac-cess to contraceptive coverage. During the hearing, I pressed Judge Gorsuch on whether he considered what would happen to the thousands of women who worked at Hobby Lobby, many of them working paycheck to paycheck who would now be denied ac-cess to contraceptive coverage. He re-sponded by saying: ‘‘I gave every as-pect of that case very close consider-ation.’’ I fail to see what consideration Judge Gorsuch gave to those female employ-ees. It is certainly not evident in the record. Justice Ginsburg’s dissent, when this case reached the Supreme Court in Hobby Lobby, which Justices Kagan, Sotomayor, and Breyer joined, did as-sess the real world impact this decision would have on women. Justice Gins-burg wrote: ‘‘The exemption sought by Hobby Lobby and Conestoga would . . . deny legions of women who do not hold their employers’ beliefs access to con-traceptive coverage.’’ In the Tenth Circuit’s opinion, which Judge Gorsuch joined, and in his own

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2195 April 4, 2017 
concurrence, Judge Gorsuch showed grave concern with the potential ‘‘com-plicity’’ of the Hobby Lobby’s owners— these are the corporate owners—in vio-lating their beliefs, but he gave little or no consideration to the compelling interest of these women and the thou-sands of female employees in having access to contraceptive care. Judge Gorsuch failed to address our concerns during this hearing. Rather than recognizing the impact of his de-cision on thousands of women who work at Hobby Lobby and millions more who work at companies all across the country, Judge Gorsuch repeatedly said that if we didn’t like what the Court was doing, or what he was doing, then Congress could change the law—as though that is such a simple thing. This is not an academic exercise. This is about the real world impact, not just of the Hobby Lobby decision but of decisions a Justice Gorsuch would make for the next 25 years, from which there is no appeal. Judge Gorsuch’s nomination raises so many serious concerns for women across the country that I look forward to addressing over the next hour. During his hearing, Judge Gorsuch told us time and again to focus on his whole record as a judge and not on cer-tain cases or things he wrote in books, articles, or emails. In fact, my Republican colleagues have suggested that we are being un-fair when we try to look at the things he has said and written in order to dis-cern how Judge Gorsuch would ap-proach cases if confirmed. We wanted to get at his heart. We wanted to get at his judicial philosophy. Some of my colleagues have even gone so far as to suggest that by rais-ing legitimate questions about Judge Gorsuch’s record as part of our advice and consent responsibility, we are at-tacking judges in the same way Presi-dent Trump has done during his 2
1⁄2 months in office. This is fundamentally wrong and deeply misleading. It is like comparing apples and oranges. That comparison doesn’t begin to describe the difference. Two weeks ago, in the middle of Judge Gorsuch’s confirmation hearing, President Trump renewed his vicious and unwarranted attack on Judge Wat-son of Hawaii for blocking the Presi-dent’s unconstitutional Muslim ban. Although I wasn’t then in the Senate, I recall that during Justice Sotomayor’s confirmation hearing, Re-publican after Republican ignored al-most the entirety of her 25 years on the Federal bench. Instead, they focused, in question after question at her con-firmation hearing, on a gross misreading of one speech—one speech— she gave to a group of young women about the value of diversity on the bench. Republicans on the Judiciary Com-mittee and in the Senate twisted her phrase ‘‘wise Latina.’’ That is a term she used in her speech. They twisted her use of the phrase ‘‘wise Latina’’ well beyond meaning. Looking at that speech, it is clear she meant to instill confidence in young women and a sense that they, too, needed to participate in a life of the law; that the law was not—is not— a place that excludes them. Senate Re-publicans turned these words into a baseless attack to undermine Justice Sotomayor’s well-earned reputation of fairly applying the law in thousands of cases that had appeared before her. She had been on the bench for 25 years, but they focused on two words in one speech she gave during that time. Many Republicans then cited that speech to justify their opposition to her nomination. So when I hear my Republican col-leagues touting their fairness toward President Obama’s Supreme Court nominee, I recall not just their omit-ting any mention of Justice Merrick Garland—the well-credentialed, well- respected moderate whom they blocked from even having a hearing—I also re-member Justice Sotomayor. I remem-ber my Republican colleagues ignored her unanimously ‘‘well qualified’’ rat-ing from the American Bar Associa-tion, her long record, and the tremen-dous chorus from the right and the left supporting her historic nomination. If confirmed, Judge Gorsuch’s deci-sions will have a profound impact on the country, not just during his time on the Court but for generations to come. This is particularly true for women whose constitutional right to an abortion will be threatened by a Justice Gorsuch. During the Presi-dential campaign, Donald Trump laid out his litmus test for nominating a Justice. He said, for example, that overturning Roe v. Wade ‘‘will happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court.’’ That was Candidate Trump’s well-articulated litmus test, which he followed through on in his nomination of Judge Gorsuch. During his hearing, my colleagues and I tried to get a better sense of how and whether Judge Gorsuch would fol-low the President and uphold this con-stitutionally protected right. Based on his lack of response, I am skeptical that a Justice Gorsuch would uphold this critical right that generations of women fought to preserve. In 1992, in Casey, the Supreme Court reaffirmed the core holding of Roe that the right to an abortion is constitu-tionally protected. The Court held that these decisions are protected because they are among ‘‘the most intimate and personal choices a person makes in a lifetime.’’ In his 2006 book on the future of as-sisted suicide, Judge Gorsuch argued that Casey should be read more as a de-cision based merely on respect for precedent rather than based on the rec-ognition of constitutional protections for ‘‘personal autonomy’’ or for ‘‘inti-mate or personal’’ decisions. When I asked Judge Gorsuch about this, al-though he recognized that Roe and Casey are precedents of the Supreme Court, he did not go further and ac-knowledge that the Constitution itself protects the right to make intimate and personal decisions. In the time since Casey, the Court has relied on the protection for inti-mate and personal choices to decide many nonabortion cases, such as the Obergefell case, which recognized the right to marriage equality. We need a Justice who understands and respects the importance of this right—that it is the Constitution that provides protec-tions for intimate and personal deci-sions. Otherwise, I am concerned he will join the Court and chip away at those protections. Judge Gorsuch said that the judicial robe changes a person. This was an-other way of telling us to ignore his own strongly held and frequently ex-pressed personal views and, indeed, his judicial philosophy, which he contin-ued to not discuss. Of course, if judicial philosophy didn’t matter, Senate Re-publicans would not have engaged in the unprecedented act of blocking President Obama’s nominee Merrick Garland, a well-credentialed, well-re-spected, moderate nominee, from even having a hearing. They held the seat open to be filled by the next President, preferably, a Republican one. In Neil Gorsuch, the Republicans got a nominee selected by rightwing orga-nizations that are counting on Judge Gorsuch to rule in accordance with their very conservative views, which put corporate interests over individual rights. That is why, to put it simply, who wears the judicial robe matters. Just as the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation want Judge Gorsuch to wear the robe, the people who come before the bench—the mil-lions of hard-working Americans whose lives will be affected by the Court’s de-cisions—want a Justice who will pro-tect their rights. They want a Justice who will wear the robe that protects their rights. I note that I am joined by Senator D
UCKWORTH of Illinois, and I yield time to her. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Illinois. Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. President, today on Equal Pay Day, we are re-minded of the fact that women across the country still make less money for the exact same work as their male counterparts, which is especially prob-lematic for women of color, for whom the gap is even wider. We are also re-minded of how vital our court system is to the future of equal opportunity for women in America and to the fu-ture of our working families. The next Supreme Court Justice will enter the Court at a critical moment for women’s rights—a moment which could change the course of reproduc-tive rights, voting rights, disability rights, and civil liberties in our Nation for generations to come.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES2196 April 4, 2017 
Gorsuch’s judicial philosophy. I have serious concerns with his record of fail-ing to protect women’s health—grant-ing corporations and healthcare pro-viders leeway to undermine women’s access to care. I am also troubled by his rulings on disability rights that would jeopardize access to public edu-cation for students with disabilities, which is particularly alarming for the 27 million women in America who live with a disability. It is personal for me. As an American living with disabilities, my life isn’t like those of many of my colleagues in Congress. Getting around can be dif-ficult. I can’t always get into res-taurants or other public spaces, even here in the Capitol. I have to spend a lot of time planning how to get from one place to another. I understand that not everyone thinks about these things, and for most of my adult life, I didn’t either. But after I became injured in combat in Iraq, I learned how important the pro-tections of laws like the Americans with Disabilities Act and Individuals with Disabilities Education Act are to ensuring that millions of Americans with disabilities can live and thrive with dignity. Without them, Americans like me wouldn’t be able to get to work, go to school, hold a job, pay taxes, go shopping, or do any of the things most of us take for granted. That is why I am speaking out today, because it matters deeply to me that our next Supreme Court Justice under-stand just how vital these protections are for Americans living with a dis-ability. It is not just a disabilities rights issue; it is a civil rights issue. Similarly, a woman’s access to healthcare is also a civil rights issue, and it is an issue that affects every sin-gle American. When a woman can’t get the care she needs, her family suffers, and when her family suffers, her com-munity suffers and our Nation suffers. That is why I find it so deeply trou-bling that Judge Gorsuch has time and again actively worked against repro-ductive justice. In a dissenting opinion, he argued in favor of defunding Planned Parenthood in Utah based on evidence that other judges deemed as false. In the Hobby Lobby case, he made it clear that he favors the reli-gious beliefs of corporations over the rights of women to make their own choices about their bodies. What is worse, that isn’t the only time Judge Gorsuch ruled to put cor-porate rights over human rights. You may have heard about a case in my home State of Illinois in which Judge Gorsuch ruled in favor of the rights of a trucking company over the rights of an employee in grave danger through no fault of his own. That is deeply troubling to me. He also dissented from a ruling giving a female UPS driver just the opportunity—the oppor-tunity—to prove sex discrimination, and then again on a decision to fine a company that failed to properly train a worker, resulting in that worker’s death. Judge Gorsuch’s record makes it very clear that he is willing to elevate large corporations at the expense of every-day Americans, jeopardizing our civil rights. That is why it is so important to me that he explain his judicial phi-losophy, that he explain to me his view on so many of these critical issues. But then, during 4 days of hearings before the Judiciary Committee, Judge Gorsuch had the chance to clarify the philosophy behind his past rulings—to explain how his rulings may reveal his judicial philosophy as a Supreme Court Justice. However, instead of addressing these concerns, he dodged these ques-tions—questions on some of the most important issues of our time. He wouldn’t even express clearly his views on Roe v. Wade. The American people simply deserve better than that. Earning a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court requires much more than a genial demeanor and an ability to artfully dodge questions. It requires honesty in answering even the tough-est questions. That is why I cannot vote to confirm Judge Gorsuch. I take seriously my constitutional responsibility as a U.S. Senator to offer the President my informed con-sent, and it is clear that Judge Gorsuch has not provided some of the most es-sential information needed to grant him a lifetime appointment to our Na-tion’s highest Court. Therefore, I am voting no on his nomination and sup-porting continued debate on the sub-ject because I can’t vote for a nominee when so many questions are left unan-swered. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Hawaii. Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I am joined by my colleague from Cali-fornia, Senator H
ARRIS . The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from California. Ms. HARRIS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Illinois for her im-portant remarks just now and for her leadership and her friendship to so many of us. She has been an extraor-dinary hero of mine, personally, and so many of us look to her leadership. So I thank her—and for her speaking on the nomination of Judge Gorsuch. Across the street from this Chamber stands the U.S. Supreme Court. Above its doors are the words ‘‘Equal Justice Under Law.’’ As Senators, we have a solemn responsibility to ensure that every man and woman who sits on that Court upholds that ideal. As a U.S. Senator, I take that responsibility ex-tremely seriously. Almost two decades after the Su-preme Court’s landmark ruling in Brown v. Board of Education, I was part of only the second class to inte-grate the Berkeley, CA, public schools. If the Court had ruled differently, I likely would not have become a lawyer or a prosecutor or a district attorney or the Attorney General of California, and I certainly would not be standing here today as a U.S. Senator. I know from personal experience just how profoundly the Court’s decisions touch every aspect of Americans’ lives, and for that reason, I rise to join my colleagues in strong opposition to the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court. As we know, Judge Gorsuch went through 4 days of hearings in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and here is what we learned: We learned that Judge Gorsuch refused to answer the most basic of questions. He ini-tially even refused to share his views on Brown v. Board of Education. We learned that Judge Gorsuch has a deep-ly conservative worldview. And we learned that Judge Gorsuch interprets the law in a theoretical bubble, com-pletely detached from the real world— as he puts it, ‘‘focusing backward, not forward.’’ If Judge Gorsuch joins the U.S. Supreme Court, his narrow ap-proach would do real harm to real peo-ple, especially the women of America. America deserves a Supreme Court Justice who will protect a woman’s right to make her own decisions about her own health. Judge Gorsuch will not. Judge Gorsuch carefully avoided speaking about abortion, but he has clearly demonstrated a hostility to women’s access to healthcare. Last year, when the court he sits on sided with Planned Parenthood, Judge Gorsuch took the highly unusual step of asking the court to hear the case again. Judge Gorsuch determined that a 13,000-person, for-profit corporation was entitled to exercise the same reli-gious beliefs as a person. That meant the company did not have to provide employees birth control coverage and could impose the company’s religious beliefs on all of its female employees. I ask my colleagues, why does Judge Gorsuch seem to believe that corpora-tions deserve full rights and protec-tions but women don’t? As we mark Equal Pay Day today, Americans deserve a Supreme Court Justice who will protect the rights of women in the workplace. Judge Gorsuch won’t. In employment dis-crimination cases, Judge Gorsuch has consistently sided with companies against their employees. These em-ployees include women like Betty Pin-kerton. The facts of the case were un-disputed. Her boss repeatedly asked her about her sexual habits and breast size and invited her to his home—then fired her when she reported his sexual har-assment. Judge Gorsuch ruled against Betty. Why? Well, part of his justifica-tion that he offered was that she wait-ed 2 months before reporting the har-assment. Americans deserve a Supreme Court Justice who upholds the rights of all women, including transgender women. Judge Gorsuch won’t. When a transgender inmate claimed that the prison’s practice of starting and stop-ping her hormone treatment was a vio-lation of her rights, Judge Gorsuch dis-agreed.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2197 April 4, 2017 
As the National Women’s Law Center observed, his ‘‘record reveals a trou-bling pattern of narrowly approaching the legal principles upon which every-day women across the Nation rely.’’ They write that his appointment ‘‘would mean a serious setback for women in this country and for genera-tions to come.’’ But judging by his record, if Judge Gorsuch becomes Justice Gorsuch, women won’t be the only ones facing setbacks. Take Luke, a young boy with autism whose parents sought financial assistance after switching him from public school to a school specializing in autism education. Judge Gorsuch ruled that the minimal support Luke re-ceived in public school was good enough. People in the autism commu-nity were up in arms. And in the mid-dle of a Senate hearing 2 weeks ago, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that Judge Gorsuch was wrong on the law. Consider Alphonse Maddin. Maddin was a trucker who got stuck on the road in subzero temperatures—minus 27 degrees, as he recalls—and aban-doned his trailer to seek help and save his life. For leaving the trailer, he was fired. Judge Gorsuch wrote that the company was entitled to fire Maddin for not enduring the cold and for not staying in his freezing truck. Then there is Grace Hwang, a pro-fessor diagnosed with cancer. She sued when her university refused to provide the medical leave her doctor rec-ommended. Judge Gorsuch called the university’s decision ‘‘reasonable’’ and rejected her lawsuit. Sadly, Grace died last summer. Judge Gorsuch has Ivy League cre-dentials, but his record shows he lacks sound judgment to uphold justice. He ignores the complexities of human beings—the humiliating sting of har-assment, the fear of a cancer patient or a worker who feels his life is in danger. In short, his rulings lack a basic sense of empathy. Judge Gorsuch under-stands the text of the law, to be sure, but he has repeatedly failed to show that he fully understands those impor-tant words: ‘‘equal justice under law.’’ For the highest Court in the land, I say, let’s find someone who does. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. S
TRANGE ). The Senator from Hawaii. Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from California, Senator H
ARRIS , for her eloquent and persua-sive remarks. I am now joined by my colleague, the Senator from Massachusetts. I yield to her. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Massachusetts. Ms. WARREN. Thank you to the Sen-ator from Hawaii for calling us here to-gether today. Mr. President, it is clear that Presi-dent Trump’s nominee to the Supreme Court, Neil Gorsuch, does not have enough support in the Senate to be confirmed under our rules. When a Su-preme Court nominee does not have enough support to be confirmed, the so-lution is to pick a new nominee, but Republicans in the Senate are threat-ening to pursue a different path. They are considering breaking the Senate rules to force the nominee onto the Su-preme Court anyway. I will be honest. I think it is crazy that we are considering confirming a lifetime Trump nominee to the Su-preme Court at a moment when the President’s campaign is under the cloud of an active, ongoing FBI coun-terintelligence investigation that could result in indictments and ap-peals, that will go all the way to the Supreme Court, so that Trump’s nomi-nee could be the deciding vote on whether Trump or his supporters broke the law and will be held accountable. That is nuts. I believe we should tap the brakes on any nominee until this investigation is concluded. But even if none of that were hap-pening, I would still oppose the con-firmation of Neil Gorsuch. My objec-tion is based on Judge Gorsuch’s record, which I have reviewed in detail. Judge Gorsuch’s nomination is the lat-est step in a long political campaign by rightwing groups and their billionaire backers to capture our courts. Over the last 30 years, as the rich have gotten richer and working fami-lies have struggled to make ends meet, the scales of justice have been weight-ed further and further in favor of the wealthy and the powerful. Those pow-erful interests have invested vast sums of money into reshaping the judiciary, and their investment has paid off in spades. Recent Supreme Court deci-sions have made it easier for corporate giants that cheat their customers to avoid responsibility. Recent Supreme Court decisions have let those same corporations and their billionaire in-vestors spend unlimited amounts of money to influence elections and ma-nipulate the political process. Recent Supreme Court decisions have made it easier for businesses to abuse and dis-criminate against their workers. Giant corporations and rightwing groups have notched a lot of big wins in the Supreme Court lately, but they know their luck depends on two things—first, stacking the courts with their allies, and second, stopping the confirmation of judges who don’t suffi-ciently cater to their interests. That is part of the reason they launched an all- out attack on fair-minded mainstream judges—judges like Merrick Garland, a thoughtful, intelligent, fair judge to fill the open vacancy on the Supreme Court. These very same corporate and right-wing groups handed Donald Trump a list of acceptable people to fill the Su-preme Court vacancy, and as a Presi-dential candidate, he promised to pick a Justice from their list. Who made it onto that rightwing list? People who, unlike Judge Garland, displayed a suf-ficient allegiance to their corporate and rightwing interests. Judge Gorsuch was on that list, and his nomination is their reward. Even before he became a Federal judge, Judge Gorsuch fully embraced rightwing, pro-corporate views. He ar-gued that it should be harder, not easi-er, for shareholders who got cheated to bring fraud cases to court. On the bench, Judge Gorsuch’s ex-treme views meant giant corporations could run over their workers. In Hobby Lobby, when he had to choose between the rights of corporations and the rights of women, Judge Gorsuch chose corporations. In consumer protection cases, when he had to choose between the rights of corporations and the rights of the consumers they cheated, Judge Gorsuch chose corporations. In discrimination cases, when he had to choose between the rights of corpora-tions and the rights of employees who had been discriminated against, Judge Gorsuch chose corporations. Time after time, in case after case, Judge Gorsuch showed a remarkable talent for cre-atively interpreting the law in ways that benefited large corporations and that harmed working Americans, women, children, and consumers. When it comes to the rules that pre-vent giant corporations from polluting our air and our water, from poisoning our food, from cheating hard-working families, Judge Gorsuch believes that it should be easier, not harder, for judges to overturn those rules—a view that is even more extreme than that of the late Justice Scalia. Republicans assert that Judge Gorsuch is a fair, mainstream judge, but rightwing groups and their wealthy, anonymous funders picked him for one reason: because they know he will be their ally. And that is not how our court system is supposed to work. Judges should be neutral arbi-ters, dispensing equal justice under law. They should not be people hand-picked by wealthy insiders and giant corporations. For the working families struggling to make ends meet, for people des-perately in need of healthcare, for ev-eryone fighting for their right to vote, for disabled students fighting for ac-cess to a quality education, for anyone who cares about our justice system, there is only one question that should guide us in evaluating a nominee to sit on any court: whether that person will defend equal justice for every single one of us. Judge Gorsuch’s record an-swers that question with a loud no. Republicans have a choice. They can tell President Trump to send a new nominee—a mainstream nominee who can earn broad support—or they can jam through this nominee. If they do jam through Judge Gorsuch, the Re-publicans will own the Gorsuch Court and every extreme 5-to-4 decision that comes out of it. Republicans will own every attack on a woman’s right to choose, on voting rights, on LGBTQ rights, on secret spending in our polit-ical system, and on freedom of speech and religion. Republicans will be re-sponsible for every 5-to-4 decision that

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES2198 April 4, 2017 
throws millions of Americans under the bus in order to favor the powerful, moneyed few who helped put Judge Gorsuch on the bench. Right now, the Presidency is in the hands of someone who has shown con-tempt for our Constitution, contempt for our independent judiciary, con-tempt for our free press, and contempt for our moral, democratic principles. If ever we needed a strong, independent Supreme Court with broad public sup-port—a Supreme Court that will stand up for the Constitution—it is now. If ever there were a time to say that our courts should not be handed over to the highest bidder, it is now. And that is why Judge Gorsuch should not be confirmed to sit on the Supreme Court of the United States. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Hawaii. Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Massachusetts for her impassioned, well-reasoned, persua-sive remarks. All too often, Judge Gorsuch fixates on what we call the plain meaning of a word in the law and decides on his own meaning that he would give to that word. Sometimes he will resort to the Dictionary Act or Webster’s dictionary to ascertain what he would consider the plain meaning of the law, but what he doesn’t do time and again in very important cases that impact lots of lives is that he doesn’t look to the con-text or the purpose of the law, to the point where sometimes his decisions are just bizarre and lack common sense. There was a reference made to the TransAm Trucking case where the truckdriver was in freezing weather. The brakes on his truck were not work-ing properly, so he faced the choice of freezing to death or doing something about it but then risking being fired. So he did something about it. He got fired. Judge Gorsuch, in his reading—a very, very narrow reading of a word in the applicable provisions—deemed that his firing was correct. He was asked by Senator F
RANKEN at the hearing: What would you have done if you had been in that situation? There you are, you are about to freeze to death, and you have a truck that is not operable in a safe way unless you unhook the attachment to it. What would you have done? Judge Gorsuch basically said: I don’t know what I would have done. I was not in his shoes. What any of us would have said—of course we would have done what the truck driver did. But in his very nar-row reading of the words of the applica-ble provision, he came to the decision he did. That is why he could not re-spond to Senator F
RANKEN . It is particularly important that Judge Gorsuch explain to us how he would approach these kinds of cases. It is particularly important in what I would describe as remedial legislation, such as the Individuals with Disabil-ities Education Act, better known as IDEA. This is remedial legislation that protects the educational rights of spe-cial needs children. That is the popu-lation for which this law was enacted. Judge Gorsuch had a case before him, and it was referred to by my colleague from California. A young boy was not getting the kind of educational oppor-tunities that he should have gotten under IDEA, but Judge Gorsuch read that remedial legislation, which should be broadly interpreted to protect the class and the group that the law was passed to help—he read it very, very narrowly. He said that the school needed only to provide ‘‘merely de minimus’’ edu-cation for this child. He put in the words ‘‘merely de minimus’’ effort on the part of the school to provide this young boy with educational opportuni-ties. That was bad enough, but Judge Gorsuch added the word ‘‘merely.’’ So during the time of his hearing, the Su-preme Court, in a related—basically the same law, IDEA, was at issue—and the Supreme Court, while we were hav-ing the hearing on Judge Gorsuch’s nomination, unanimously overturned Judge Gorsuch’s standard of ‘‘merely de minimus.’’ Even the Roberts Court found Judge Gorsuch’s standard of re-view too limiting and too narrow. So the young boy in question—his fa-ther testified at the confirmation hear-ing. I asked him what he was thinking as the decision of Judge Gorsuch came down. He said he knew that this deci-sion would negatively affect hundreds and hundreds of special needs children all across our country. This is why I sought assurance from Judge Gorsuch that he would be the kind of Justice who understands, as he told me when I met with him, that the purpose of title III, which are the Fed-eral courts, is to protect the rights of minorities. So I wanted reassurance from Judge Gorsuch during his hear-ing. I tried time and again to get a sense of his heart, what his judicial philosophy was. I was looking for the reassurance that he was the kind of judge who understands the importance of assuring that victims of discrimina-tion cannot only ask for but can also receive protections from the courts and who demonstrates a commitment to the Constitutional principles that pro-tect the rights of women to make the intimate and personal decisions of what to do with their own bodies. Mr. President, I note that I am joined by my colleague from Washington State, Senator MURRAY . I yield to her. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Washington. Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank my colleague from Hawaii for her really important statement on this. I come to the floor today to ex-press my serious concerns, along with other women from the Senate, about the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court, particularly about what it would mean for women across the country today and for gen-erations to come. Like the overwhelming majority of my Democratic colleagues, I have de-cided to vote against Judge Gorsuch’s nomination, and I will be opposing a cloture motion ending debate. Now, I don’t take this decision lightly, but with the future of women’s health and rights and opportunity at risk, it is a decision I must make. The Trump administration has bro-ken nearly every one of its promises, but one it has certainly kept is its promise to turn back the clock on women’s progress. It is clear that Re-publicans in Congress are committed to doing the same. Last week, just a few days ago, Senate Republicans, with the help of Vice President PENCE , over-turned a rule that prevents discrimina-tion against family planning providers based on the kinds of services they pro-vide to women. It was shameful and un-precedented. Now, not missing a beat, Congres-sional Republicans are already gearing up to attach riders to our coming budg-et bills in order to cut off access to critical services at Planned Parent-hood for millions of patients. There are similar attempts to undermine wom-en’s access to healthcare in cities and States nationwide, and more often than we would like, the Supreme Court is going to be the place of last resort for protecting women’s hard-fought gains. If the buck has to stop with the Su-preme Court on women’s health and rights, I do not want Judge Gorsuch anywhere near the bench. Time and again, Judge Gorsuch has sided with the extreme rightwing and against tens of millions of women and men who be-lieve that in the 21st century, women should be able to make their own choices about their own bodies. Let me just give you a few examples. When the Tenth Circuit ruled in the case of Burwell v. Hobby Lobby that a woman’s boss could decide whether or not her insurance would include birth control, Judge Gorsuch did not just agree; he thought the ruling should have gone further. Judge Gorsuch has argued that birth control coverage in-cluded in the ACA as an essential part of women’s healthcare—one that has, by the way, benefited 55 million women—is a ‘‘clear burden’’ on employ-ers that would not long survive. When it comes to Planned Parent-hood, he has already weighed in on the side of defunding our Nation’s largest provider of women’s healthcare. What was his reasoning? Judge Gorsuch thought that in light of completely dis-credited sting videos taken by extreme conservatives, women in the State of Utah should have a harder time access-ing the care they need. I should note that just last week, the makers of those false videos received 15 felony charges. I also want to be clear, as well, about what Judge Gorsuch’s nomination could mean for a woman’s constitu-tionally protected right to safe, legal

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2199 April 4, 2017 
abortion services under the historic ruling in Rowe v. Wade, which was just reaffirmed last summer by this Court. In his nomination hearings, Judge Gorsuch would not give a clear answer on whether he would uphold that rul-ing, which has meant so much to so many women and families over the last four decades. Judge Gorsuch has donated repeat-edly to politicians who are dead set on interfering with women’s constitu-tionally protected healthcare deci-sions. He has even made deeply inac-curate comparisons between abortion and assisted suicide. I remember the days before Rowe v. Wade very clearly. I have heard the stories of women faced with truly im-possible choices during that time. Women from all across the country have shared those deeply personal ex-periences because they know what it would mean to go backward. Lastly, attempts to control women’s bodies are not always about reproduc-tive rights. Sure enough, Judge Gorsuch is on the wrong side here as well. He concurred in a ruling against a transgender woman who was denied regular access to hormone therapy while she was in prison. This ruling re-jected the idea that under our Con-stitution, denying healthcare services is cruel and unusual punishment. That is not the kind of judgment I want to see on the bench, and I think most families would agree. Families who have already done so much to lead the resistance against this administration and its damaging, divisive agenda are fighting this nomi-nation as hard as they can. They know the Trump Presidency will be dam-aging enough for 4 years, but Judge Gorsuch’s nomination will roll back progress for women over a lifetime. I am proud to stand with them and do everything I can to make sure they are heard loud and clear here in the Sen-ate. I oppose Judge Gorsuch’s nomina-tion in light of everything it would mean for women. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Hawaii. Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator M
URRAY , our as-sistant Democratic leader, for her con-tinuing, longstanding leadership on be-half of women and families in our coun-try. Over the past hour, my colleagues and I have laid out a fair case against confirming Judge Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court. As we approach a vote on his confirmation, I encourage my colleagues to scrutinize Judge Gorsuch’s judicial philosophy, even as he refused to outline for us or describe for us what that philosophy is. But we have come to certain conclusions based on 4 days of hearings. During his hear-ing, Judge Gorsuch refused, as they say, time and again to answer our questions on his judicial philosophy or his approach to the law. He insisted that he was merely a judge, as if the use of the word ended any discussion or scrutiny of his record. Judge Gorsuch painted a picture for us of the Court that is really straight out of a Norman Rockwell painting. He said during his hearing: ‘‘One of the beautiful things about our system of justice is that any person can file a lawsuit about anything against anyone at any time . . . and a judge, a neutral and fair judge, will hear it.’’ Norman Rockwell painting—it is a wonderful idea that anybody can file a claim to protect their rights or inter-ests. It is also a wonderful idea to as-sume that those claims will be heard and ruled upon by neutral judges, ap-parently uninfluenced by their own strongly held and frequently expressed personal views and judicial philosophy. Many of my Republican colleagues have echoed this view and argued that Judge Gorsuch’s credentials should be enough—Columbia, Harvard. They argue that it is wrong or even unfair to question how Judge Gorsuch might ap-proach the kinds of difficult issues that come before the Supreme Court. Of course, if judicial philosophy did not matter, then the Republicans would not have engaged in the unprece-dented act of blocking President Obama’s nominee—as I mentioned, Merrick Garland, a well-credentialed, well-respected moderate nominee— from even having a hearing. In fact, many of the Republican Senators did not even extend the courtesy of meet-ing with Judge Garland. They would not have held the seat open to be filled by the appointee of a Republican Presi-dent, one selected for him by rightwing organizations. When my colleagues and I asked Judge Gorsuch about his judicial phi-losophy, he said that his words, his views, his writings, and his clearly ex-pressed personal views had no rel-evance to what he would do as a Jus-tice. He told us to look at his whole record, so I examined his whole record. I saw in that record too little regard for the real-world impact of his deci-sions. I saw a refusal to look beyond the words to the meaning and intent of the law, even when his decisions lacked common sense, as in the frozen truck driver case, and far too often, to the benefit of big corporations and against the side of the little guy. The decisions of judges have real- world impacts for millions of people be-yond the parties in a particular case. This is especially true of the Supreme Court, which issues decisions that don’t just reach those in the case in front of them—the frozen trucker, the women who work at Hobby Lobby faced with a lack of critical healthcare, the special needs child entitled to edu-cational opportunities under the IDEA. The Supreme Court does not just inter-pret laws; the Supreme Court shapes our society. Will we be just? Will we be fair? Will America be a land of exclusivity for the few or land of opportunity for the many? Will we be the compassionate and tolerant America that embraced my mother, my brothers, and me so many decades ago when we immigrated to this country? These values seem too often absent from Judge Gorsuch’s record and from his view of the law and the Court. The central question for me in look-ing at Judge Gorsuch and his record and listening carefully through 4 days of hearings was whether he would be a Justice for all of us, not just one for some of us. I came to the conclusion that he would not be a Justice for all of us, so I oppose his nomination. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. JOHNSON ). Under the previous order, the time until 5:30 p.m. will be con-trolled by the majority. The Senator from Iowa. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have several of my colleagues on this side of the aisle who want to speak, but I just want to take a minute and a half or so to clarify some things I have heard from the other side that need to be counteracted. First of all, I don’t know whether they mentioned the term ‘‘Ginsburg rule,’’ but we do have this Ginsburg rule that was set out a long time ago when Judge Ginsburg came before the Senate for her confirmation. She said that you can’t comment on things that might come before the Court because obviously you would be violating judi-cial ethics. Then I will comment on some things people have said about Brown v. Board of Education. The very fact that Judge Gorsuch has declined to offer his opinion on legal issues that are likely to come before the Supreme Court demonstrates what we should all expect of him: his judi-cial independence. That is what we ex-pect of every judge. The judge’s deci-sion not to offer his opinion on issues that may come before him is consistent with judicial ethics rules and is con-sistent with what I have referred to al-ready as the Ginsburg rule or the Gins-burg standard, which all Supreme Court nominees in recent memory have followed. As Justice Ginsburg said, commenting on these issues is not fair to parties who might come before the Court in future years. That is what Judge Gorsuch said as well. Questions to this end are nothing more than an attempt to compromise the judge’s independence, and he showed us that he wasn’t going to have his independence compromised because he is going to do what judges should do: look at the facts of a case, look at the law, and make those decisions based only on that and send no signals whatsoever ahead of time of how he might view something. Along these lines, my colleagues said that the judge should have announced that he agreed with the ruling in Brown v. Board of Education but didn’t offer enough information about this opinion in an appropriate discussion of precedent.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES2200 April 4, 2017 
I will quote our nominee. He said this: ‘‘Senator, Brown v. Board of Edu-cation corrected an erroneous decision, a badly erroneous decision, and vindi-cated a dissent by the first Justice Harlan in Plessy v. Ferguson, where he correctly identified that separate to advantage one race can never be equal,’’ end of the quote of our nomi-nee. So the judge spoke about prece-dent very appropriately. He answered our questions in a manner consistent with his obligations and with past nominees. One more point. I keep hearing com-plaints that the judge won’t make a commitment to follow Roe v. Wade, but my colleagues’ requests really boil down to a quest for a promise to reach results that they want. They demand adherence to Roe v. Wade on the one hand and a promise to overrule Citi-zens United on the other hand, as ex-amples. Asking the judge to make com-mitments about precedent is inappro-priate. I have said this so many times, and my colleagues will repeat it many times as well. It compromises the judge’s independence. Instead of being beholden to the President, my colleagues would have the judge be beholden to them. This nominee isn’t going to be beholden to a President, and he is not going to be be-holden to any Senator because if he did that, he would be compromising his views. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from South Dakota. Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, 2 months ago, the President nominated Judge Neil Gorsuch, a judge on the Tenth Cir-cuit Court of Appeals, to the Supreme Court. This week, we will be voting on his confirmation. I want to say that I am grateful to my colleague, the senior Senator from Iowa, for his leadership during this process and for getting this nomination to the floor. We are fortunate to have him as chairman of the Judiciary Com-mittee. We have before us a supremely quali-fied candidate for the Supreme Court. Judge Gorsuch has a distinguished re-sume. He is widely regarded as a bril-liant and thoughtful jurist. Most im-portantly, however, he is known for his impartiality and his absolute commit-ment to the rule of law. Judge Gorsuch understands that the job of a judge is to apply the law as it is written—and here is the fundamental thing—even when he disagrees with it. ‘‘A judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a bad judge.’’ Judge Gorsuch has said that more than once. Why? Because a judge who likes every outcome he reaches is likely making decisions based on something other than the law. That is a problem because there is no such thing as equal protection or equal justice when judges make decisions based on their personal feelings about a case instead of based upon the law. A judge’s job is to apply the law as it is written, whether he likes the result or not. Judge Gorsuch understands this. A lot of people from across the polit-ical spectrum have spoken up in favor of Judge Gorsuch’s nomination, and one thread that runs through their comments is their confidence that they can trust Judge Gorsuch to apply the law as it is written. Here is what Neal Katyal, an Acting Solicitor General for President Obama, had to say about Judge Gorsuch: 
I have no doubt that if confirmed, Judge Gorsuch would help to restore confidence in the rule of law. His years on the bench reveal a commitment to judicial independence—a record that should give the American people confidence that he will not compromise prin-ciple to favor the president who appointed him. 
A former law partner and a friend of Judge Gorsuch’s—a friend who de-scribes himself as ‘‘a longtime sup-porter of Democratic candidates and progressive causes’’—had this to say about Judge Gorsuch: 
Gorsuch’s approach to resolving legal prob-lems as a lawyer and a judge embodies a rev-erence for our country’s values and legal sys-tem. . . . I have no doubt that I will disagree with some decisions that Gorsuch might render as a Supreme Court justice. Yet, my hope is to have justices on the bench such as Gorsuch . . . who approach cases with fair-ness and intellectual rigor and who care about precedent and the limits of their roles as judges.’’ 
Again, that is from a self-described ‘‘longtime supporter of Democratic candidates and progressive causes.’’ During his years on the bench, Judge Gorsuch has had a number of law clerks. On February 14, every one of Judge Gorsuch’s former clerks, except for two who are currently clerking at the Supreme Court, sent a letter on his nomination to the chairman and rank-ing member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Here is what they had to say: 
Our political views span the spectrum . . . but we are united in our view that Judge Gorsuch is an extraordinary judge. . . . Throughout his career, Judge Gorsuch has devoted himself to the rule of law. . . . As law clerks who have worked at his side, we know that Judge Gorsuch never resolves a case by the light of his personal view of what the law should be. Nor does he ever bend the law to reach a particular result that he de-sires. For Judge Gorsuch, a judge’s task is not to usurp the legislature’s role; it is to find and apply the law as written. That conviction, rooted in his respect for the separation of powers, makes him an exemplary candidate to serve on the nation’s highest court. 
Again, that is the unanimous opinion of 39 of Judge Gorsuch’s former law clerks whose political views, in their own words, ‘‘span the spectrum.’’ E. Donald Elliott, an adjunct pro-fessor at Yale Law School, had this to say about Judge Gorsuch: 
Judge Gorsuch’s judicial philosophy isn’t mine . . . but among judicial conservatives, Judge Gorsuch is as good as it possibly gets. . . . Judge Gorsuch tries very hard to get the law right. He is not an ideologue, not the kind to always rule in favor of businesses or against the government. Instead, he follows the law as best he can wherever it might lead. I could go on. The voices raised in support of Judge Gorsuch are numer-ous. Unfortunately, no amount of testi-mony in favor of Judge Gorsuch seems to be enough for Democrats. Senate Democrats are apparently determined to oppose Judge Gorsuch despite the fact that they are struggling to find any good reason to justify their opposi-tion. The Senate minority leader came down to the floor on March 23 to an-nounce his determination to vote against Judge Gorsuch, and he urged his colleagues to do the same. Why? Well, apparently the Senate minority leader is not convinced that Judge Gorsuch ‘‘would be a mainstream jus-tice who could rule free from the biases of politics and ideology.’’ That is right. Despite the fact that everyone—liberal and conservative—seems to describe fairness as one of Judge Gorsuch’s dis-tinguishing characteristics, the Senate minority leader is not convinced the judge will be able to rule without bias. He is worried that Judge Gorsuch won’t be a mainstream judge. Well, over the course of 2,700 cases on the Tenth Circuit, Judge Gorsuch has been in the majority 99 percent of the time—99 percent. In 97 percent of those 2,700 cases, those opinions were unani-mous. I would like the minority leader to explain how exactly a judge who is in the majority 99 percent of the time is out of the judicial mainstream. Is the minority leader trying to suggest that all of the judges on the Tenth Cir-cuit, including the ones appointed by Democrats—which, I might add, is a majority on the circuit—are extrem-ists? The fact is, Democrat opposition to Judge Gorsuch has nothing to do with his qualifications. Let’s just get it out there. I doubt that any of my col-leagues on the other side of the aisle really think that Judge Gorsuch is out of the mainstream or that he lacks the qualifications of a Supreme Court Jus-tice. No, the truth is that Democrats are opposing Judge Gorsuch because they are mad that it is not a Demo-cratic President making the nomina-tion. They can’t accept that they lost the election, so they are going to op-pose any nominee, no matter how qualified. It is extremely disappointing that Democrats plan to upend a nearly 230- year tradition of approving Supreme Court nominees by a simple majority vote simply because they can’t accept the results of an election. Democrats have no plausible reason to offer for opposing this supremely qualified nominee. I hope that a suffi-cient number of Senate Democrats will think better of their opposition and vote—when we have that opportunity later this week—to confirm Judge Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Louisiana.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2201 April 4, 2017 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, there are, of course, two issues before the Senate with respect to Judge Neil Gorsuch. The first issue is simply, should or should not Neil Gorsuch be confirmed as an Associate Justice to the U.S. Supreme Court? There is also a second issue, and the second issue is, Should the Senate even be allowed to vote? Those two questions are both impor-tant and interrelated. I want to talk about the first one first. I sit on the Judiciary Committee. We heard last week—2 weeks ago—about 20 hours of testimony from Judge Gorsuch. I think he answered about 200 questions in writing. One of the objec-tions offered by our friends on the other side of the aisle, the Democratic Party, was that Judge Gorsuch refused to answer some of the questions. Now that is just not accurate. Many of the questions that were asked of the judge by both Republicans and Democrats were fair questions— some of them, not so much. Judge Gorsuch was asked, in effect: What is your position on abortion? How will you vote? He was asked: How will you vote on gun control? He was asked: How would you vote on cruel and unusual punishment, the Eighth Amendment? He was asked how he would vote on questions dealing with the Tenth Amendment. He didn’t answer those questions, and then he was criticized for not answering those questions. He didn’t answer those questions because he couldn’t. He is a sitting judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. Let me read to you canon 3(a)(6) of the Code of Conduct for United States Judges. It states: ‘‘A judge should not make public comment on the merits of a matter pending or impending in any court.’’ Let me read you rule 2.10(B) of the American Bar Association Model Code of Judicial Conduct. It provides, and I quote: ‘‘A judge shall not, in connec-tion with cases, controversies, or issues that are likely to come before the court, make pledges, promises, or com-mitments that are inconsistent with the impartial performance of the adju-dicative duties of the judicial office.’’ Now, say what you want about Mr. Gorsuch, but don’t criticize him for not violating the oath of his office and not making promises, pledges, or commit-ments, like a politician, on how he would vote on the U.S. Supreme Court, because Justices are supposed to decide the case on the merits. As I mentioned, I watched Judge Gorsuch answer questions personally for over 20 hours. He was asked some other questions other than the ones I have referenced, and I was intrigued by some of the questions that Judge Gorsuch was asked. My friends in the Democratic Party kept trying to draw distinctions with Judge Gorsuch be-tween the parties in cases that he had decided. My friends kept talking about the ‘‘big guy,’’ the ‘‘little guy,’’ the corporation, the consumer, the em-ployer, the employee. The suggestion was made that Judge Gorsuch didn’t vote enough for the little guy or little gal, for whatever that means. What struck me when he answered those questions was that we were supposed to be talking about the faithful applica-tion of justice. Now, I was taught in law school that Lady Justice is sup-posed to be blind, that neither the wealth nor the power nor the status of the parties should matter. That is why, in the picture that we see so often of Lady Justice, she is blindfolded. She isn’t looking at the parties at all to see whether they are wealthy or not so wealthy. She isn’t looking at the par-ties to see whether they are a corpora-tion or a consumer or what race they are or what gender they are or what part of the country they are from. Lady Justice is supposed to be blind be-cause we are a nation of laws, not men. Of all the places in our country, an American court of law—and I am very proud of this—is supposed to be the place of last resort, where you can come and get a fair shake. That is how good judges operate. They give every-body a fair shake. A good judge is sup-posed to make his or her decisions based on the law, not the parties. Good judges are supposed to be impartial—to call it like they see it, to call the balls and strikes—and that is exactly what Neil Gorsuch has done throughout his entire career. I can promise that, as I sit on the Ju-diciary Committee, if any President, whether he is a Republican or Demo-crat, ever brings a nomination before the Judiciary Committee when I am on that committee and that nominee starts talking about the wealth or the status or the power of the parties and how it will influence or not influence his decision, suggesting that will make a difference, I will vote against that nominee—I don’t care who nominates him—every single time, because that is not American justice. We talked about two cases in par-ticular, and the Presiding Officer has probably heard them talked about here on the floor. On the surface they don’t seem to be related. Judge Gorsuch ruled in both of these cases, but I think they interact in a very important way. They tell us that he doesn’t play poli-tics and he doesn’t rule for the big guy just because he is a big guy or the lit-tle guy just because he is a little guy. The first case we heard a lot about was a decision by Judge Gorsuch called TransAm Trucking. You are going to hear a lot about that case. In that case, Judge Gorsuch made a decision that was unfavorable to a trucker, and he ruled in favor of the trucking com-pany—little guy versus big guy. Judge Gorsuch ruled for the big guy, and it is important to know why and to look at the reasoning in that case and not just the result. During the discussion on the case, Judge Gorsuch made it very clear that he only made that decision because he believed that was what the statute con-trolling the facts of the case required— a statute that was passed by a legisla-tive body duly authorized by the people that make the law. Unlike our courts, which are supposed to interpret the law, Judge Gorsuch did not decide the case the way he did because he didn’t sympathize with the trucker. He de-cided that case the way he did because he was doing his best to accurately apply the law, as best he understood it, to the facts before him. Once again, that is what is called justice—blind to the parties. Actually, Judge Gorsuch has ex-plained himself and what he thinks about decisions such as this. He did it in another case that I will talk about in a moment. Judge Gorsuch said: 
Often enough the law can be ‘‘a[n] ass— a[n] idiot’’— 
Quoting, of course, Charles Dickens— 
and there is little we judges can do about it, for it is (or should be) emphatically our job to apply, not rewrite, the law enacted by the people’s representatives. Indeed, every judge who likes every result he reaches is very likely a bad judge, reaching for results he prefers rather than those the law compels. 
Now, that statement came from the second case I referenced. It was a case called A.M. Holmes. In A.M. Holmes, a 13-year-old seventh grader was arrested for fake burping repeatedly in class. The majority said it was OK for him to be arrested and that, when his family sued the police officer, the police offi-cer enjoyed qualified immunity. Judge Gorsuch dissented. This time he ruled for the little guy, literally and figuratively. Judge Gorsuch said: ‘‘In my opinion, reading the statute passed by the legislature, this young man’s family can file this lawsuit because disciplining a 13-year-old 7th grader for fake burping in class by arresting him instead of disciplining him is a bridge too far.’’ Now, once again, we had a little guy versus the big guy. This time Judge Gorsuch ruled for the little guy. But again, we have to look beyond the re-sult. Even though he ruled for someone we can all sympathize with, Judge Gorsuch didn’t base his decision on that. He based his decision on a good- faith application of the statutes of the facts controlling the case. He applied the law as written by the legislature. That is what legislatures do, and that is what Congresses do. They make the law and judges interpret the law. To be blunt, that is what we want in a judge. I want a judge. I don’t want an ideo-logue. I am not interested in a judge who will use the judiciary to advance his own personal policy goals. I want a judge who will apply the law as written by the legislature or, in the case of the Constitution, as written by the Fram-ers of the Constitution, as best that judge understands the law, not to try to reshape the law as he wishes it to be. To just comment about the last ques-tion that I raised earlier, again, one

issue is whether or not we should con-firm Judge Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, but the second issue is whether the Senate should even be allowed to vote at all. That is what this is all about when you distill it down to its basic essence. We are going to hear a lot about clo-ture, and we are going to hear a lot about the nuclear option. But this is what it boils down to: Should we or should we not even be able to be al-lowed to vote? Now I understand that reasonable people can disagree. I also understand that unreasonable people can disagree, and everybody in this body has a vote, and we all represent States. There are two Senators from every State—big States and little States—and every-body is entitled to be able to vote his or her conscience. But it is very, very important not only for the American judicial system but for American de-mocracy that the Senate be allowed to vote on Judge Gorsuch. So to my friends on the other side of the aisle, I would say: Please allow us to vote. You can vote for or against Judge Gorsuch. I will not second-guess your judgment if you act sincerely, and I believe many of my colleagues are sincere. They are wrong, but they are sincere. But please allow the Senate to vote on this nomination. That is why I was sent to Washington. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Arkansas. Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, this week the Senate will fulfill one of our most important responsibilities: advice and consent for a nominee to the Su-preme Court. The stakes don’t get much higher than a lifetime appoint-ment to a court of final appeal, espe-cially if the court has presumed over the last two generations to take more and more political and moral questions out of the hands of the people. President Trump has nominated Judge Neil Gorsuch, a distinguished ju-rist who understands the critical but limited role of the Federal courts in our constitutional system. To my knowledge, no Senator genuinely dis-putes his eminent qualifications, his judicial temperament, and his out-standing record over the last decade on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. Indeed, Judge Gorsuch would appear headed toward an easy, noncontrover-sial confirmation based on the com-ments by Democratic Senators. The senior Senator from Colorado in-troduced Judge Gorsuch at his con-firmation hearings with this high praise: 
I have no doubt that . . . Judge Gorsuch has profound respect for an independent judi-ciary and the vital role it plays as a check on the executive and legislative branches. I may not always agree with his rulings, but I believe Judge Gorsuch is unquestionably committed to the rule of law. 
The senior Senator from Indiana re-cently announced his support for Judge Gorsuch, saying: I believe that he is a qualified jurist who will base his decisions on his understanding of the law and is well respected among his peers. 
The senior Senator from West Vir-ginia has noted: 
[Judge Gorsuch] has been consistently rated as a well-qualified jurist, the highest rating a jurist can receive, and I have found him to be an honest and thoughtful man. 
The junior Senator from North Da-kota also praised Judge Gorsuch for his ‘‘record as a balanced, meticulous, and well-respected jurist who understands the rule of law.’’ Remember, these admiring state-ments all come from Democrats, and all of them support an up-or-down vote on confirming Judge Gorsuch. Even those who oppose Judge Gorsuch used to sing a different tune about the standards for judicial con-firmation. For instance, the senior Senator from California put it best when she said: 
I think, when it comes to filibustering a Supreme Court appointment, you really have to have something out there, whether it’s gross moral turpitude or something that comes to the surface. 
Speaking of a previous Republican President’s nominee, she further said: 
Now, I mean, this is a man I might dis-agree with. That doesn’t mean he shouldn’t be on the court. 
In fact, President Obama filibustered a Supreme Court nomination while he was a Senator, yet later expressed re-gret over that decision. He said: 
I think that, historically, if you look at it, regardless of what votes particular Senators have taken, there’s been a basic consensus, a basic understanding, that the Supreme Court is different. And each caucus may decide who’s going to vote where and what but that basically you let the vote come up, and you make sure that a well-qualified candidate is able to join the bench even if you don’t par-ticularly agree with him. 
Despite all of this, though, it appears that a radical Democratic minority in-tends to filibuster Judge Gorsuch’s nomination. The minority leader is en-couraging this extreme fringe, claim-ing, ‘‘If Judge Gorsuch fails to earn 60 votes and fails to demonstrate he is mainstream enough to sit on the high-est court, we should change the nomi-nee, not the rules.’’ I will return later to the minority leader’s central and ironic role in all of this. For now, let’s take a trip down memory lane so as to understand just how radical this partisan filibuster would be. No Supreme Court nominee has ever failed because of a partisan filibuster— never, not once, ever—in the 228 years of our venerable Constitution. One nominee, Justice Abe Fortas—to be elevated to Chief Justice—lost one clo-ture vote in 1968 on a bipartisan basis. He then withdrew under an ethical cloud, but no Supreme Court nominee has ever been defeated by a partisan filibuster. This historical standard has nothing to do with changes in the Senate rules. The filibuster has been permitted under Senate rules since early in the 19th century. It is not a recent or a novel power. The cloture rule was adopted 100 years ago. In other words, at any point in our history, a Senate minority could have attempted to fili-buster a Supreme Court nominee. They had the tools. The rules permitted it. It would have only taken one Senator— just one. Yet it never happened for a simple reason: self-restraint. While written rules are important, sometimes the unwritten rules are even more so. Habits, customs, mores, standards, tra-ditions, practices—these are the things that make the world go round, in the U.S. Senate no less than in the game of life. Our form of self-government de-pends critically on this form of self- government. Let’s reconsider some re-cent nominees in light of these facts. Justice Clarence Thomas was prob-ably the most controversial nomina-tion in my lifetime, perhaps ever. He was the subject of a vicious campaign of lies and partisan smears—a ‘‘high- tech lynching’’ in his words. He was confirmed in 1991 by a bare majority of 52-to-48. Yet Justice Thomas did not face a filibuster. Not a single Senator tried to block the up-or-down vote on his nomination—not Joe Biden, not Ted Kennedy, not Robert Byrd, not John Kerry—not one. Why? Any one Senator could have demanded a cloture vote, could have insisted on the so- called 60-vote standard and, perhaps, defeated Justice Thomas’s nomination, but they did not because they re-spected two centuries of Senate tradi-tion and custom. It was likewise with Justice Sam Alito, whose nomination unquestion-ably shifted the Court’s balance to the right in 2006. He, too, received fewer than 60 votes for confirmation—58 to be exact—but he received 72 votes for clo-ture. Here again, a large, bipartisan majority upheld the Senate tradition and custom against partisan filibusters of Supreme Court nominees. Even Judge Robert Bork, whose name is now used as a verb to mean the ‘‘unfair par-tisan treatment of a judicial nominee,’’ received an up-or-down vote in 1987. Yes, Judge Bork, who only received 42 votes for confirmation, did not face a partisan filibuster. But let’s not stop with Supreme Court nominations. Let’s also consider other kinds of nominations so that we can understand just how radical is the Democratic minority’s position. To this day, there has never been a Cabinet nominee defeated by a partisan filibuster—never, not once, ever—in 228 years of Senate history. To this day, there has never been a trial court nominee defeated by a partisan fili-buster—never, not once, ever—in 228 years of Senate history. Until 2003— just 14 years ago—there had never been an appellate court nominee defeated by a partisan filibuster. That is just how strong the custom against filibusters was. It had never successfully happened in 214 years.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2203 April 4, 2017 
From our founding, through secession and civil war, through world wars, no matter how intense the feeling and how momentous the occasion, no matter how partisan the atmosphere, Senators always exercised self-restraint and al-lowed up-or-down votes on nominees for the Supreme Court, the court of ap-peals, the trial court, and the Cabinet. But that changed in 2003, thanks in no small part to the senior Senator from New York, C
HUCK SCHUMER , now the minority leader. With the help of leftwing law professors, he convinced extremists and the Democratic caucus to filibuster President Bush’s appellate court nominees. For the first time in more than two centuries of the U.S. Senate, a radical minority defeated nominations with a partisan filibuster. Why did the Senate start down this path? Some point to racial politics and Miguel Estrada, who was one of the most talented appellate litigators of his generation and President Bush’s nominee to the DC Circuit. That court is often a proving ground for future Su-preme Court nominees, and Mr. Estrada’s confirmation might have en-abled President Bush to nominate him, subsequently, to the Supreme Court. A Republican President appointing the first Hispanic Justice? Surely, the Democrats couldn’t allow that. Whatever the reason, there can be no doubt that the minority leader has set in motion a chain of events over the last 14 years and has brought us to the point he claims to deplore today. So the Democrats can spare me any hand- wringing about Senate traditions and customs. The minority leader and like-minded extremists in the Democratic caucus can also spare us their exaggerated claims of the Republican obstruction of President Obama’s judicial nominees. The Democrats, after all, were the ones who broke a 214-year-old tradition spe-cifically to obstruct 10 of President Bush’s nominees. Of course, the Repub-licans followed suit, though I would note that they have filibustered fewer judges over more years in their having been in the minority. Put simply, the Democrats broke one of the Senate’s oldest customs in 2003 so that they could filibuster Repub-lican judges, and they subsequently filibustered more judges than did the Republicans. So it should come as no surprise that the Democrats took an even more radical step in 2013 when they used the so-called nuclear option to eliminate the filibuster for execu-tive branch, trial court, and appellate court nominations. They broke the Senate rules by changing the Senate rules with a bare majority, not the ef-fective two-thirds vote required under those rules. The radical Democrats will accept no constraints on their will to power— when in power. Whatever it takes to pack the courts with liberal extremists or to block eminently qualified Repub-lican nominees is exactly what they will do. But don’t take my word for it. Let’s review what the Democrats were say-ing last year when they all believed they would be in power with Hillary Clinton as President and Democrats controlling the Senate. We did not hear much talk about the sacred 60-vote standard back then. On the contrary, the Democrats were promising to use the nuclear option again—this time to confirm a Democratic nominee to the Supreme Court. Former Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid said: 
I have set the Senate so, when I leave, we’re going to be able to get judges done with a majority. . . . If the Republicans try to filibuster another circuit court judge, but especially a Supreme Court Justice, I’ve told ‘em how, and I’ve done it . . . in changing the rules of the Senate. 
The junior Senator from Virginia, who would have been Vice President had Secretary Clinton won, said, quite frankly, about the Supreme Court va-cancy: 
If these guys think they are going to stone-wall the filling of that vacancy or other va-cancies, then a Democratic Senate majority will say, ‘‘We’re not going to let you thwart the law.’’ 
The junior Senator from Oregon warned ominously: 
If there’s deep abuse, we’re going to have to consider rules changes. 
The senior Senator from New Mexico perhaps summed it up best of all when he said: 
The Constitution does not give me the right to block a qualified nominee no matter who is in the White House. . . . A minority in the Senate should not be able to block qualified nominees. 
Do not think for a minute that the radical Democrats would not have made good on these threats. They have exercised little restraint on judicial nominations over the last 14 years. They have betrayed over 200 years of Senate tradition and custom. They would not start respecting those tradi-tions now. In reality, there were good reasons to respect and uphold the old Senate tra-dition against the filibusters of nomi-nees before 2003. First, our responsibility under the Constitution is not to choose but to ad-vise and consent. A partisan filibuster would, essentially, encroach upon the President’s power to nominate the per-son of his choice. Second, nominations are not suscep-tible to negotiation. We cannot split someone down the middle, Solomon- like. We can vote yes or no. This is not the case with legislation, where dif-ferences can be split, compromises ne-gotiated, and bipartisan consensus reached. Third, when legislation fails to win 60 votes, it is not the end of the world; it can go back to the drawing board or be enacted through other legislative vehi-cles. But when nominations are long delayed or defeated, then real work is left undone, cases go unheard, disputes go unresolved, and the law remains un-clear. It would have been better for the Senate if the minority leader and the Democrats had recognized these things in 2003 and not started us down this path, the end of which we reach this week. It is rarely a good thing when an institution ignores or breaks its cus-toms and traditions, its unwritten rules. They should have known better, and they should have acted better. But we have come to this point because the radical Democrats didn’t act any bet-ter. Now they propose to create a new standard never known to exist before: The Senate will not confirm a Repub-lican President’s nominees to the Su-preme Court, because if the Democrats will filibuster Neil Gorsuch, then they will filibuster any Republican nominee. I will never accept this double stand-ard, and neither will my colleagues. Republicans aren’t going to be played for suckers and chumps. After this week, the Senate will be back to where it always was and where it should have remained: Nominees brought to the floor ought to receive an up-or-down, simple-majority vote. And don’t expect to hear regret from me about it. There is no moral equivalence here between the two parties. To suggest any equivalence is to divorce action from its intent and aim. In 2003 and again at this moment, the radical Democrats overturned venerable Sen-ate traditions. The Republicans are acting to restore them. Those who can-not see the difference, to borrow from Bill Buckley, would also see no dif-ference between a man who pushes an old lady into the path of an oncoming bus and a man who pushes the old lady out of the path of the bus, because after all, both men push around old la-dies. So I am not regretful. I am not wracked with guilt. I am not an-guished. I am really not even dis-appointed. There are no school yard taunts of ‘‘you did it first.’’ There are no charges of hypocrisy. There is no pox on both our houses. The Repub-licans are prepared to use a tool the Democrats first abused in 2013 to re-store a 214-year-old tradition the Democrats first broke in 2003, and we are supposed to feel guilty? Please. The radical Democrats brought this all on themselves and on the Senate. The re-sponsibility rests solely and squarely on their shoulders. The minority leader is hoist with his own petard, the Senate is restored to a sensible, centuries-old tradition, and Judge Gorsuch is about to become Jus-tice Gorsuch. Not a bad outcome. Not bad at all. Pretty good, in fact. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Texas. Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to support the con-firmation of Neil Gorsuch to serve as an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court of the United States.

Columbia University and the Harvard Law School and was awarded a doc-torate from Oxford. He is a former law clerk for the legendary Justice Byron White, as well as for Justice Kennedy. He has been a respected Federal appel-late judge for a decade. Judge Gorsuch has spent a lifetime in the law, and his record indicates he will make an exem-plary Justice. Just 2 weeks ago, Judge Gorsuch tes-tified for 20 hours before the Senate Ju-diciary Committee. His conduct during the hearing only further confirmed what his record demonstrates: that Neil Gorsuch is a principled jurist and a good man. And I was glad for all of us to get that confirmation because Judge Gorsuch bears a heavy responsibility— he is being asked to fill the seat of Jus-tice Antonin Scalia. In truth, I doubt anyone could truly fill Justice Scalia’s shoes. Justice Scalia was one of a kind, and his enormous impact on the law and on the Court will impact this Na-tion for generations to come. All of us miss him dearly, but I take solace in the knowledge that one of the ways in which I believe it will be easi-est for Judge Gorsuch to imitate Scalia—perhaps the most important way—is judicial humility. Justice Scalia’s greatest strength was not his amazing wit, his mighty pen, or his larger-than-life personality, as much as we loved those parts of him; rather, it was his consistent unwillingness to ac-cumulate power to himself and to the courts. He refused to impose his own personal policy preferences on the law but instead understood that his role as a judge was simply to apply the law that the elected representatives of the people had enacted. This type of judging doesn’t take otherworldly talents, although Scalia had that in abundance; instead, it takes character, integrity, and humil-ity. Judge Gorsuch’s lengthy record and his hearing testimony demonstrate that he has those attributes as well. He understands that his role as a judge is to apply the words of the Constitution and the laws of the United States to the specific cases that come before him, and nothing more. This is critical in an era when the Supreme Court has come to be seen by many—for good rea-son—as an activist Court, as a super-legislature that seeks to impose its own will in the place of the written law. It is this very humility that angers so many on the left. They don’t want someone who humbly applies the law; rather, they demand nothing less than a person fully committed to enacting from the Supreme Court bench what-ever policies the left is championing at that given moment, because they know their only refuge is the courts because the American people would reject the policies at the voting booth. Judge Gorsuch is clearly not that kind of per-son, so they have committed to oppos-ing his confirmation by whatever means necessary, legitimate or not. Indeed, if this were being decided on qualifications and record, Judge Gorsuch would be confirmed unani-mously. We don’t have to hypothesize about that because Judge Gorsuch has already been confirmed by this body a decade ago by voice vote, without re-corded dissent. Not a single Senator objected—not Ted Kennedy, not Hillary Clinton, not Barack Obama, not Joe Biden, and not even Democratic Mem-bers who still serve in this Chamber, like C
HUCK SCHUMER , D IANNE FEIN-
STEIN , PATLEAHY , or D ICKDURBIN . Not one of them spoke out against Gorsuch’s nomination to the court of appeals—not one. So what changed? The only thing that changed is that the radical left has become angry, extremely angry, and my Democratic colleagues are wor-ried they will get opposed from their left in a primary. That is it. Their base demands total war, total obstruction, and they are begrudgingly bowing to this demand. Unfortunately for them, it has prov-en difficult to invent attacks against an obviously well-qualified judge like Judge Gorsuch. My Democratic col-leagues couldn’t get any legitimate grievance to stick at the hearings last week, despite their best efforts, but it hasn’t stopped them from repeating their outlandish attacks over and over again. If the stakes weren’t so high, it might even be humorous, but it isn’t really funny because the primary argu-ment the Democrats have made is dan-gerous. Their attack on Neil Gorsuch is a direct attack on the rule of law itself. Contrary to the very foundations of our government and legal system, my colleagues from across the aisle are ar-guing that Judge Gorsuch is unquali-fied to be a Justice because he alleg-edly failed to side with the ‘‘little guy’’ over the ‘‘big guy.’’ In their view, it is now the job of judges to reject equal protection, to take the blindfold off of Lady Justice, and instead judges should put their thumbs on the scales to actively discriminate against par-ties based on their identity. This notion of partisan, results-ori-ented judging is directly contrary to the constitutional system we have in this country. My Democratic col-leagues are openly calling for judges to enforce their own political preferences from the bench, and they want to use a person’s willingness or unwillingness to do so as a litmus test for who gets on the Court. This isn’t even a juris-prudential position, it is a political po-sition. And it is difficult to imagine a more effective way to destroy our judi-cial system—the best in the world, de-spite its flaws—than to adopt this re-sults-oriented approach. Make no mistake, the Democrats’ trumpeting of outcome-based judging will have consequences. Judges and po-tential judges nationwide will now have heard their siren call. You want smooth sailing in a confirmation hear-ing from the Democrats? Ignore the law, ignore the facts, and pick sides based upon whom you sympathize with—whoever is politically correct at that moment in time. My Democratic colleagues claim to detest attacks on the independent judiciary, but there aren’t many attacks more dangerous and chilling of true independence and impartiality than the one they are making now. The public—the people who appear in court seeking an honest tribunal—have also heard this open call for bias, for prejudice, for discrimination, and I doubt they will soon forget. Luckily, Judge Gorsuch stood firm in his confirmation hearing. He re-affirmed what was clear from his record—that he will not legislate his own policy preferences from the bench and that he will respect the limited role a judge plays in our constitutional structure. He did all of this in the face of unrelenting opposition from my Democratic colleagues who demanded that he violate his judicial oath and swear to decide certain cases and polit-ical questions in a way that they would prefer. No recent nominee to the Su-preme Court has ever made such pledges, and Judge Gorsuch rightfully refused to do so last week. Their demands of Judge Gorsuch were particularly galling given that this was the most transparent process in history for selecting a Supreme Court Justice. During the campaign, Donald Trump promised the American people that, if elected, he would choose a Justice in the mold of Justice Scalia. He laid out a specific list of 21 poten-tial nominees, including Judge Gorsuch. The voters were able to see precisely whom President Trump would nominate, and they were able to decide for themselves if that was the future they wanted for the Supreme Court. Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, promised a very different kind of Jus-tice. She promised a liberal judicial ac-tivist who would vote to undermine free speech, to undermine religious lib-erty, and to undermine the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. In a very real sense, this election was a referendum on the Supreme Court. The American people could decide for themselves between a faithful originalist vision of the Constitution or a progressive, liberal, activist vi-sion, and the voters chose. Donald Trump is now President Trump, and he has kept his promise to the American people, selecting Judge Neil Gorsuch from that list of 21 judges. Judge Gorsuch is no ordinary nominee. Because of this unique and transparent process, unprecedented in our Nation’s history, his nomination carries with it a kind of super-legit-imacy in that it has been ratified by the American people at the voting booth. Neil Gorsuch is not simply the President’s nominee. It is the direction chosen by the American people, and I urge my colleagues to confirm him. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2205 April 4, 2017 
nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to be an Associate Justice on the Su-preme Court of the United States. The nomination of an individual to serve on the Supreme Court is a matter of tremendous importance. Supreme Court justices have the opportunity to shape, literally, and even to define American history for decades to come. Even more importantly, they have the opportunity to affect the lives and live-lihoods of everyday Americans, now and in generations yet unborn. Few decisions in the Senate have a more profound consequence than the confirmation of a nominee for a life-time seat on the highest Court in the land. I recognize that this is one of the most critical votes that I will take or that any Senator will cast. After reviewing Judge Gorsuch’s record, I have decided to uphold my constitutional duty of service to advise and consent by opposing Judge Gorsuch’s nomination at all stages of the confirmation process, including a vote on cloture or an up-or-down vote. I didn’t come to this decision lightly. I arrived at this conclusion because I be-lieve the next Associate Justice to the Supreme Court must be someone who understands the importance of judicial restraint, someone who will adhere to precedent, someone who will respect and has respect for all coequal branches of government, someone who views the Constitution as a living—not a static—document, someone whose ju-dicial views actually fall within the mainstream of judicial thought and ju-risprudence, and someone who has a deep understanding of the law, the Con-stitution, and its applications. Criti-cally, I believe the next Supreme Court justice must be someone who under-stands the gravity of their work—that their decisions will affect livelihoods, will affect lives, and will affect the lib-erties and the rights that we value— not just for those in places of privilege and power but for all American citi-zens, for all of the people, now and for decades to come. The American people need the next Justice on the Nation’s highest Court to be someone who will protect the rights for all—for everyone—and who will ensure that the words literally in-scribed above the Supreme Court— ‘‘Equal Justice Under Law’’—are made manifest in everyone’s life. After careful consideration of Judge Gorsuch’s record, his judicial philos-ophy, and after meeting with the nomi-nee and examining remarks and an-swers to questions in his confirmation hearing, I do not believe Judge Gorsuch meets this high standard, and I cannot support his nomination to be a Su-preme Court Justice. Judge Gorsuch is truly a well- credentialed jurist, but we must under-stand that a good resume is the begin-ning and not the end point of a stand-ard by which we must measure nomi-nees to serve on the Supreme Court. A good resume is necessary, but it is not sufficient to be on the highest Court of the land. When it comes to the Supreme Court, the Senate’s duty to advise and con-sent means more than merely meas-uring an aptitude or understanding of the law. It means more than just look-ing at someone’s college and law school. It means more than just admir-ing: Does this person have an impres-sive resume? It necessitates an under-standing of it. It actually necessitates an empathy for how these decisions will affect the lives of everyday Ameri-cans. Do they have the capacity to stand for all of us? I take literally the way the Constitu-tion began. It began with the words in the preamble to the Constitution. In many ways, it is a direct point at what is at stake when we nominate an indi-vidual to the Supreme Court. It is a critical way that we began. It begins by saying: ‘‘We the People.’’ The inclu-sion of these words at the start of one of our Nation’s founding documents is actually no accident. It was the subject of consternation and even discussion and debate. It is worth noting that the original draft of the preamble of the Constitu-tion of the United States, as prepared by a man named Gouverneur Morris, had a different beginning. It said: We the people of the States of New Hamp-shire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and so forth. But Morris and other drafters of the Constitution made the conclusion—and, really, the conscious decision—to remove references to States, to bring it back to the people— that the power of government is de-rived by the people and that is the fun-damental aspect of our society; that it is ‘‘we the people’’—not people of any one State, not people of any one reli-gion, not people of any one race or class, but ‘‘we the people’’—all of the people. In a debate about this change, it was James Madison who argued: 
In this particular respect the distinction between the existing and the proposed gov-ernments is very material. The existing sys-tem has been derived from the dependent de-rivative authority of the legislatures of the states; whereas, this is derived from the su-perior power of the people. 
It is a deference and it is a reverence for the understanding of the power of the people—all people. It is no accident that this is how our Constitution began, and it is the spirit in our Nation which has helped us for centuries to ex-pand upon this ideal of ‘‘we the peo-ple.’’ Understand this: Some of our great-est leaders fought to make sure that these ideals were far vaster, far more inclusive. I note, for instance, that Susan B. Anthony said it was ‘‘we the people’’—not we the White male citi-zens, not we the male citizens, but we the whole people who formed the Union. And we formed it not to give the blessings of liberty but to secure them, not to the half of ourselves and to the half of our prosperity but to the whole people—women and men. You see, this fundamental understanding of our Constitution expanded to be more inclusive, to include women and mi-norities and religious minorities. This conception of ‘‘we the people’’ is crit-ical. It is unfortunate that too often, even with the best intentions, our elected officials, Supreme Court Justices, and even Presidents have forgotten the pre-cision of these words which were cho-sen. But despite this, because of heroes like Susan B. Anthony and others, the people of this Nation have remembered them, and our Nation has grown to be who we are now. We often actually take for granted the critical role the Supreme Court has played in focusing on the people—on all the people. This has been the power and majesty of the Supreme Court—this focusing of indi-vidual rights, the dignity, the worth, the value of all people. In the Supreme Court case in Ham-mer v. Dagenhart, the Supreme Court ruled that Congress has the power to enact labor laws that protect children. They remembered ‘‘we the people’’—in this case, citizens against powerful cor-porations. In West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, the Supreme Court upheld the con-stitutionality of a State minimum wage law, again, focusing on the peo-ple—‘‘we the people.’’ In Mapp v. Ohio, when the Supreme Court decided about evidence obtained through the illegal search—the viola-tion of individual privacy—they re-membered, again, ‘‘we the people.’’ In New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, when the Supreme Court protected the rights of everyday citizens to criticize their government, they remembered that sovereignty, that power, that im-portance of ‘‘we the people.’’ In Baker v. Carr, when the Supreme Court established the principle of one person, one vote, they remembered ‘‘we the people.’’ There are so many of the rulings dur-ing the 1950s and 1960s governing issues of race in our Nation, to which so many of us in our Nation owe our very success, the opportunity that was ex-panded because the Supreme Court— against social mores, against laws of States—focused on ‘‘we the people.’’ Perhaps most famous of those is Brown v. Board of Education, when the Supreme Court asserted that separate but equal had no place in the education of our children, and they remembered ‘‘we the people.’’ In Loving v. Virginia, when the Su-preme Court ruled unconstitutional the State laws that banned interracial marriage—that ideal of being able to join in union with someone you love, regardless of race—the Supreme Court remembered ‘‘we the people.’’ In Olmstead v. L.C., when the Su-preme Court reinforced the right of people with developmental disabilities to live in the community and not be in-stitutionalized, they saw a greater in-clusion of all Americans. They remem-bered ‘‘we the people.’’ I stood on the Supreme Court steps and I sat in on the Supreme Court ar-guments in Obergefell v. Hodges, when

the Supreme Court ultimately ruled that State laws cannot stop you from marrying whom you love. They remem-bered. They saw the dignity and the worth of all of the people and ensured that equality. They remembered ‘‘we the people.’’ In each of these cases, so much was at stake—the rights of workers, the rights of children, the rights of people with disabilities, the rights of minori-ties, the rights of women, voting rights, civil rights, our rights—Amer-ican rights. The Supreme Court, with jurists on the right and the left, jurists appointed by Republicans and Demo-crats, looked to people and affirmed dignity and worth and well-being. But these are not just issues that were done in the past. The Supreme Court is going to be again confronted by historic and deeply consequential cases. There is still so much at stake, and that is why this decision before the Senate is so consequential. The right to gain access to birth control, the right to criticize your elected officials, the right to marry someone you love— that is still at stake. I cannot vote in support of a nominee whom I don’t trust to protect Amer-ican individuals, to understand the ex-pansive nature of that idea of ‘‘we the people.’’ Judge Gorsuch is someone who, in his own words, has said judges should try to ‘‘apply the law as it is, fo-cusing backward, not forward.’’ Based on his record and his writing, it is clear to me that Judge Gorsuch’s own judi-cial philosophy leaves out critically important elements of democratic gov-ernance. Judge Gorsuch’s evasive answers to questions during his confirmation hearing didn’t do anything to allay my concerns. ‘‘We the People’’ are the first words of the Constitution. These words, I fear based on Judge Gorsuch’s record, are not his greatest consider-ation. In fact, at times, when he issues his judicial opinions, they look as if those individuals that make up our so-ciety—‘‘we the people’’—are the least of his considerations. Take for example, Alphonse Maddin, the man who was working through the night in the dead of winter as a truck-driver when his brakes unfortunately froze on him. Knowing the danger of continuing to drive with frozen brakes—the danger to himself and other motorists on the road—Alphonse pulled over to the side of the road and called for help. As several of my colleagues have noted in Judge Gorsuch’s confirmation hearing and on the floor, Alphonse waited over 2 hours in the freezing cold without heat, experiencing systems of hypothermia. After no help arrived, Al-phonse feared for his life, and, ulti-mately, left his trailer to find help. Less than a week after the incident, Alphonse was fired for abandoning his trailer. He filed a complaint with the Department of Labor and the case was brought to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, where all but one of the judges ruled in favor of Alphonse—a guy who made a practical decision, an urgent decision, to save his own life and not risk the lives of others. But the judge who ruled against this indi-vidual, in favor of the corporation, was Judge Neil Gorsuch. He chose to save his own life and pro-tect the lives of others who had been put in harm’s way if he chose another option, and he was fired for it. Every judge on the Tenth Circuit supported that decision except for Judge Gorsuch. ‘‘We the people’’ includes Luke, a student with a disability. He was diag-nosed with autism at the age of 2. When Luke entered kindergarten, he began receiving specialized educational services from a school district as en-sured by the Individuals with Disabil-ities Education Act, or IDEA. Congress debated and passed, with Republicans and Democrats, an act that says chil-dren with disabilities are entitled to receive a free and appropriate public education. Between kindergarten and the second grade, Luke achieved many of the goals of his individualized education pro-gram. But when Luke’s family moved to Colorado and he enrolled in a new public school, he had trouble adjusting, and Luke regressed in areas in which he had previously done well. To better suit Luke’s needs, his parents, who tried to get him better care, eventually withdrew him from his local school and enrolled him in a private residential school for children with autism. His parents sought reimbursement for the costs of that private school, but the public school district refused to pay. By the time Luke’s case reached the Tenth Circuit, a Federal judge and two administrative courts had agreed that the school district should pay because Luke did not receive the free and ap-propriate education to which he was entitled. The question for Judge Gorsuch was, What constitutes an appropriate edu-cation? In that ruling, Judge Gorsuch wrote the opinion saying that the edu-cational benefits mandated by IDEA must be ‘‘merely more than de mini-mis.’’ That was the standard that he set for one of our American children. Because the school district gave Luke a merely more than de minimis edu-cation, Judge Gorsuch ruled that Luke’s parents were not entitled to re-imbursement. But just two weeks ago, the Supreme Court unanimously rejected Judge Gorsuch’s ‘‘merely more than de mini-mis’’ standard. They unanimously re-jected Judge Gorsuch’s standard as contrary to the intent of Congress. In fact, at the very moment when Judge Gorsuch testified before the Judiciary Committee, Chief Justice Roberts wrote an opinion rejecting Gorsuch’s IDEA standard, saying: 
When all is said and done, a student offered an educational program providing ‘‘merely more than de minimis’’ progress from year to year can hardly be said to have been of-fered an education at all. Judge Gorsuch’s misinterpretation of the law—depriving a child with a dis-ability of the education he deserves— should be cause for concern to any of my colleagues as they are promoting him to the highest Court in the land. It is this idea that the powerless, who fight against these corporations or big institutions and turn to the court sys-tem as their avenue to get the equal justice under the law that will view them—whether it is a corporation, whether it is a government—as an equal under the law and give them their right to be heard. This is what ‘‘we the people’’ is. It means people like Alphonse Maddin and Luke, whom Judge Gorsuch ruled against. It also means female workers who want access to contraceptive cov-erage but were denied by their em-ployer, denied by a corporation. Judge Gorsuch ruled against the people and for the corporation. ‘‘We the people’’ means those mil-lions of Americans who rely on Planned Parenthood centers for healthcare. Judge Gorsuch ruled against those people seeking what, in some counties, is their only access to contraceptive care. ‘‘We the people’’ means the people harmed by a medical device manufacturer’s urging of unsafe, off-label uses. Judge Gorsuch ruled against the people injured and for the manufacturers, for the corporation. ‘‘We the people’’ means that a worker fatally electrocuted while on the job due to inadequate training, whose fam-ilies sought justice—Judge Gorsuch ruled against the individual and for the corporation. ‘‘We the people’’ means the woman prevented from suing for sexual harass-ment, not because sexual harassment didn’t exist but because she didn’t re-port it quickly enough. Judge Gorsuch supported the corporation against the woman. ‘‘We the people’’ means a transgender woman who is denied access to a bath-room at work. Judge Gorsuch ruled against the individual in favor of the corporation. ‘‘We the people’’ means that every single American deserves to have their civil rights, deserves to have their equality protected by the judicial branch, which is often their last ave-nue toward justice. It is often their last hope against the powerful, against the wealthy. But Judge Gorsuch’s record in everything—from workers’ rights to women’s rights, to civil rights, to the rights of children with disabilities, to the rights of a guy on the side of a highway to save his own life—suggests that he has forgotten perhaps the most important element of the Constitution: It exists to protect and serve the American people, not corporations, not lobbyists, not those rich enough to hire big, fancy law firms. It doesn’t exist to serve a polit-ical ideology. It exists to serve ‘‘we the people.’’ I am not confident in Judge Gorsuch’s ability as a Supreme Court

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2207 April 4, 2017 
Justice to safeguard the rights and lib-erties of all Americans, to prioritize ju-dicial restraint over judicial ideology, to ensure equal justice under the law, and to understand and act in a way that indicates that the lives of real people who are struggling against often seemingly insurmountable odds—that for them, everything is on the line. I am not sure that Judge Gorsuch on the Supreme Court can honor this tradi-tion. ‘‘We the people’’ means an inde-pendent judiciary that will not close the courthouse doors on people, on our civil rights—that will not look at liti-gants as just pawns in the larger ideo-logical context of ideas but will see the humanity of every American; that will have a courageous empathy to under-stand their circumstances and their struggles and put that in accordance with the values of a nation where we all swear an oath for liberty and jus-tice for all the people. Over 75 years ago, Justice Hugo Black encompassed the basic ideal of the role of Federal courts in protecting citizens’ rights when he wrote these words: 
No higher duty, or more solemn responsi-bility, rests upon this Court, than that of translating into living law and maintaining this constitutional shield deliberately planned and inscribed for the benefit of every human being subject to our Constitution—of whatever race, creed or persuasion. 
Yet Judge Gorsuch’s own writings demonstrate a failure to grasp this un-derstanding of the role of courts to pro-tect all people—and I quote, again, Jus-tice Black—‘‘whatever race, creed, or persuasion.’’ In an opinion article for the National Review, entitled ‘‘Liberals and Law-suits,’’ Judge Gorsuch expressed his skepticism about civil rights litigation as merely a pursuit of a ‘‘social agen-da.’’ He wrote: 
American liberals have become addicted to the courtroom, relying on judges and law-yers rather than elected leaders and the bal-lot box, as the primary means for effecting their social agenda on everything from gay marriage to assisted suicide to the use of vouchers for private-school education. This overweening addiction to the court-room as a place to debate social policy is bad for the country and bad for the judiciary. 
I wonder what Oliver Brown, plaintiff in the seminal case of Brown v. Board of Education would say to Judge Gorsuch? Was he ‘‘addicted’’ to the courtroom to advance his social agen-da? Or was the courtroom his avenue to justice against profound oppression? I wonder what James Obergefell would say to Judge Gorsuch. Was he ‘‘addicted’’ to the courtroom when he sought to be able to marry the person he loved? Or did Oliver just want to bring the truth to the idea that sepa-rate but equal was actually discrimina-tory, demeaning, and degrading, not just to the individuals who are dis-criminated against but demeaning to us as a people and a nation? Judge Gorsuch’s actions call into question whether he understands the proper role of the courts. Does he un-derstand that Federal courts are the proper forum for constitutional dis-putes that protect American’s basic rights? This is not about liberal or democrat; this is about individuals who are often fighting battles against pow-erful interests. It was the journalist and editor Wil-liam Allen White who said in 1936: Liberty . . . must be something more than a man’s conception of his rights, much more than his desire to fight for his own rights. True liberty is founded upon a lively sense of the rights of others and a fighting conviction that the rights of others must be main-tained. 
I do not believe Judge Gorsuch pos-sesses this ‘‘fighting conviction’’ that we need in a Supreme Court Justice to forcefully and fearlessly, without re-gard to politics or favor or privilege or wealth, protect the rights of others, to protect the rights of all Americans, to protect the rights of ‘‘we the people.’’ I do not believe that Judge Gorsuch will work to fiercely defend the rights of all Americans. I do not believe he pos-sesses that fighting conviction that ‘‘we the people’’ must be committed above all else to one another. Again, I do not take the decision to oppose Judge Gorsuch’s nomination lightly. I understand what is at stake. I am fortunate to represent hard-work-ing New Jerseyans in the U.S. Senate, and when I took the oath to support and defend the Constitution, I made a promise to my constituents and the American people not to only discharge my duties but at every opportunity to work across the aisle, to protect their rights and interests. That means a lot to me. So many of my proudest moments in the Senate are from this bipartisan co-operation that I have found with so many of my colleagues. I do not stand here today to question their motives. I do not stand here today to impugn them in any way because when I go home, people are not concerned about the partisan politics. They are con-cerned about their lives, their liveli-hoods—about the issues that affect them and their families, their neigh-borhoods, their community. They want people in this body and in the courts across the street to protect the rights of Americans, protect consumers, pro-tect our kids and our environment, but this is, in fact, what I believe the nomi-nee we are all considering has shown that he will not do. It is no secret that Judge Gorsuch’s nomination comes at a very divisive time for this body and a challenging time for this country. We have experi-enced great times of turmoil and polar-ization before in this Nation and in this body. In the Federalist Papers, written over two centuries ago, James Madison warns in Federalist Paper No. 10 about what he calls the ‘‘mischiefs of faction’’ and its inevitability—that citizens of the Nation and their polit-ical parties will undoubtedly disagree and will possess competing interests. Madison asserted that the existence of the legislative branch would guard against some of the worst effects of this reality. He wrote that those elect-ed to represent the American people in the legislature would be those ‘‘whose wisdom may best discern the true in-terests of their country and whose pa-triotism and love of justice will be least likely to sacrifice it to a tem-porary or partial consideration.’’ When this body is at its best, I be-lieve that is true. I have seen that kind of partnership in this body. But I am afraid that we are indeed at a troubling time—a troubling time in history for the Senate where it seems that the re-verse of Madison’s hopes have become reflective of the truth we are experi-encing because we are now facing a vote on a Supreme Court nominee whose confirmation, I believe, would be a sacrifice to temporary and partial considerations as opposed to the larger interests of our country. In my short time in the body—just over 3
1⁄2years—I have come to this floor to speak on the nominations of two different Supreme Court Justices to serve here in the United States. The first was Judge Merrick Garland. He was not only well qualified, intelligent, and capable, he was moderate. Presi-dent Obama even sought input from Republicans about choosing someone who was a mainstream jurist. He was more than qualified to sit on the Su-preme Court, but he was actually someone who could bring folks to-gether. His qualifications, his aptitude to serve, and his moderate philosophy were not reflected in how we dealt with that nomination. I believe he deserved an up-or-down vote. Even if it was a 60-vote threshold, he deserved an up-or-down vote. More than that, he should have had the op-portunity to meet with Senators, Re-publican and Democratic, like Gorsuch has met with Senators, Republican and Democratic. He deserved to have a committee hearing. He deserved to be voted on up or down in that com-mittee, and he deserved to have his nomination come to the floor. Whether a 60-vote threshold or a 50-vote thresh-old, he deserved an up-or-down vote, but he did not get one. The Garland nomination was the bookend to an era we have been experi-encing, that I have been witnessing, of obstruction, and there has been finger- pointing on both sides. But let’s be clear about what happened during the Obama administration. During Presi-dent Obama’s time in office, we saw historic obstruction like never before. Seventy-nine of President Obama’s ju-dicial nominees were blocked by the filibusters. Seventy-nine nominees were blocked at a time when the judici-ary, an independent branch of govern-ment, was saying: We are in judicial crisis in many jurisdictions. Seventy- nine of Obama’s judges were blocked, compared to 68 nominees obstructed under all Presidents combined. All of the obstruction from Democrats and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES2208 April 4, 2017 
Republicans and other parties, and only 68 nominees were obstructed, com-pared to President Obama, where there were 79. I do not possess the same view as those who last year believed this seat should remain vacant and took the ob-struction during the Obama Presidency to a much higher level. I believe that seat should have been filled not by an extreme jurist but by someone who could have tempered the partisanship of our time, someone who could have brought us together. It was a wise choice at a divisive time in our coun-try. President Obama did not choose somebody from further left; he chose a moderate Justice who probably could have—if he had been given an up-or- down vote—commanded 60 votes. At this time, that is what President Trump should have done—put forward a nominee who could have brought this country together, a moderate nominee, someone within the judicial main-stream. But he hasn’t. I believe a 60-vote threshold right now is more than appropriate at this moment in history. There are Repub-lican judicial nominees who could gar-ner 60 votes in this Chamber. The 60- vote threshold exists because a person confirmed to serve on the Supreme Court at this time should be main-stream and independent enough to gar-ner that two-thirds support. The 60-vote threshold exists because confirmation of a Justice to the Su-preme Court is one of the most impor-tant duties we perform, one of the most important positions in all of American Government. It is someone who will have an impact on our society, shaping it and forming it for generations to come. This President should have sought real advice and consent from the entire Senate, but instead he turned to the ju-dicial extreme. Now more than ever, we need a threshold that can pull our nominees back to the mainstream, that can begin to heal the divisions. I do not be-lieve it is in the best interests of my constituents or the American people to confirm someone so extreme on a 50- vote margin. It should be 60 votes. I urge my colleagues to understand that this judge threatens those ideals we hold precious, those words at the very beginning of our Constitution, ‘‘We the People.’’ I urge people to un-derstand that this is the time more than ever that we must continue to fight to defend the marginalized, the weak, the people who do not possess wealth, the people who are standing against powerful corporations, that we cannot reverse a tradition where our courts were the main societal avenue in which people could receive equal jus-tice under the law. We cannot put someone in office who has shown throughout their judicial record to be contrary to that. For the sake of this body, now more than ever, it is my hope that we can see a judicial nominee who will help to heal wounds and not create them, help to elevate the unity of us as a people, who will help to affirm the ideals of our Nation and the very conception that we are one people, we are one Na-tion, and we hold one destiny. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. R
UBIO). The Senator from Virginia. Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, first of all, let me thank my friend the Senator from New Jersey for his statement. I, too, share the belief that there was a better way to go about this judicial nomination process. I think as well that traditions such as a 60-vote mar-gin should be maintained. I think, frankly, neither party comes to this issue completely with clean hands, with the Democrats’ action in 2013. But clearly our colleagues’ ac-tions of not even giving someone of such character as Merrick Garland the courtesy of meetings, a hearing, and then an up-or-down vote—for that and for many other reasons, I will be join-ing my friend from New Jersey in vot-ing against Judge Gorsuch and making sure that we use all of our available tools. So I thank him for those com-ments. 
TRIBUTE TO FEDERAL EMPLOYEES  
KIRK YEAGER , DENNIS WAGNER , EDWARD GRACE , 
AND MARIELA MELERO  
Mr. President, that sense of what we are dealing with now in our politics today is the subject that I want to speak about for a few minutes; that is, the incredibly important efforts made each and every day by our public serv-ants. We often forget that our public serv-ants, our Federal employees, go to work every day with the sole mission to make the country a better and safer place. Day after day they go to work, receiving little recognition for the great work they do. Since 2010, I have come to the Senate floor to honor ex-emplary Federal employees—a tradi-tion that was begun by my friend Sen-ator Ted Kaufman. One of those Fed-eral employees is actually sitting at the desk and has helped me and I know so many other Senators as we have tried to learn this job. The reason I wanted to come back today was because today, in light of a governmentwide hiring freeze, the rein-statement of the so-called Holman rule, a proposed budget that would deeply cut our Federal workforce, and candidly, in these times, the targeting of career civil servants by certain con-servative media outlets, this tradition of honoring those who serve, often-times without recognition, our Federal employees, feels even more important. Our Federal employees—over 170,000 of them Virginians—serve their coun-try dutifully regardless of the party in power. Not only do they carry out the mission of the administration they are serving, but they also provide count-less benefits to the American public. It is my hope that my colleagues and the current administration will remember these facts and set aside ideology when considering actions that affect our Federal agencies and their workforce. Today I want to take a couple of mo-ments to recognize a few Virginians who are working behind the scenes to actually make our government more efficient and more effective. First, I would like to recognize Kirk Yeager. Kirk is the Chief Explosives Scientist at the FBI. In this role, he both responds to crises and oversees the Bureau’s efforts to better under-stand the explosives terrorists use. Having studied bomb-making for more than 20 years, Kirk works with both do-mestic and foreign law enforcement agencies and has developed and pro-vided crucial training to every bomb squad in the United States and to many of our foreign allies. Through his work, Kirk has made U.S. civilian law enforcement personnel and those who serve our country in the military much safer. Next, I would like to recognize Den-nis Wagner. Dennis is the Director of the Quality Improvement and Innova-tion Group at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. As part of a team at CMS, Dennis contributed to the creation of the Partnership for Pa-tients, a public-private partnership to increase patient safety and reduce re-admissions to U.S. hospitals. Their work has produced outstanding results, including 2.1 million fewer patients harmed and $20 billion saved. That is a remarkable statistic, and obviously the work going on at CMS—an agency that does not get a lot of recognition; can-didly, most people don’t even know—a person like this gentleman, Dennis, has made our healthcare system better. Third, I would like to recognize Ed-ward Grace. Edward is the Deputy Chief in the Office of Law Enforcement at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. In that role, Edward has been leading a nationwide law enforcement investiga-tion known as Operation Crash, tar-geting those who smuggle and trade rhino horns and elephant ivory. In ad-dition to assisting in the Department’s efforts to preserve global biodiversity, Operation Crash has led to 41 arrests, 30 convictions, and the seizure of mil-lions of dollars in smuggled goods—re-sults that show that those seeking to engage in this kind of activity—there will be real legal consequences to their actions. Finally, I would like to recognize Mariela Melero. Mariela is the Asso-ciate Director for the Customer Serv-ice and Public Engagement Directorate at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigra-tion Services. Mariela and her team have been working to improve the way USCIS interacts with the millions of people who contact their office seeking citizenship, permanent residency, ref-ugee status, or other assistance. Cen-tral to that mission are the innovative improvements Mariela has made to the myUSCIS website, as well as the launch of Emma, a virtual assistant that in a typical month answers nearly

500,000 questions with a success rate of nearly 90 percent. To ensure that this resource was available to a wide range of customers, Mariela also oversaw the creation of a Spanish-speaking Emma that came on-line in 2016. These important improve-ments have been crucial to driving effi-ciency for the world’s largest immigra-tion system in the world. Again, I hope my colleagues—as we think about budgets and numbers and when we hear people who oftentimes denigrate our Federal employees—will remember some of these individuals who, not for great reward or recogni-tion, actually get up each and every day and go to work, trying to ensure that our government functions for the hundreds of millions of Americans who oftentimes don’t acknowledge or recog-nize their services enough. Mr. President, as I mentioned at the outset, I know this is a time when most of my colleagues are speaking on Judge Gorsuch. I will simply add, after a careful review of his record and my belief as well, that his unwillingness to really give truly straight answers in terms of comments—whether it was basic, decided legal opinions like Brown v. Board of Education or Roe v. Wade or Citizens United—and his fail-ure to even answer those questions has unfortunately led me to join with so many of my other colleagues in voting against him. I still hope that there is a way that we can avoid changing the rules of the Senate during this process. I know there are many colleagues who are working on those efforts. If they are successful, I look forward to joining them. As we think about Judge Gorsuch, as we recognize the challenges we have ahead of us, let us also—those of us who serve in this body—continue to take a moment every day to say thanks to a Federal employee who, in one way or another, works tirelessly day in and day out to make our coun-try a better place. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, last week on this Senate floor, I made the case for Democrats and Republicans joining together to confirm one of the most qualified individuals ever nomi-nated to the U.S. Supreme Court. I was referring, of course, to Chief Judge Merrick Garland. I don’t wish to belabor the point here this evening, but it bears repeating that Judge Garland brought with him more Federal judicial experience than any Supreme Court nominee in the his-tory of the United States. It bears repeating that Judge Gar-land is an extraordinary man, a good man, a brilliant man, a fair judge, and a consensus builder on the bench in a day and age when we need consensus builders on the Supreme Court and other courts across the country. Frankly, we also need them right here on this floor, in this body. It bears repeating that the obstruc-tion of Judge Garland’s nomination was unprecedented in the history of the United States of America and in the history of the Senate. Since the Senate Judiciary Com-mittee began holding public hearings on Supreme Court nominations in 1916, no Supreme Court nominee had ever been denied a hearing and a vote—until Judge Garland. Many of our Repub-lican colleagues refused to meet with him. When his nomination expired at noon on January 3, 2017, 293 days had passed—293 wasted days. A good man was treated badly. I be-lieve our Constitution was treated badly. I believe that the obstruction of Judge Garland’s nomination was un-precedented. I believe it was shameful. From my view, we cannot pretend that this vacant seat on the Supreme Court—what I believe should be Judge Garland’s seat—is anything other than blatant partisanship. I believe that upholding my oath to protect the Constitution means finding agreement on moving Judge Garland’s nomination forward at the same time— at the same time as that of Judge Neil Gorsuch, President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee. I have no choice but to oppose Judge Gorsuch’s nomination this week be-cause anything else would be a stamp of approval for what I believe is play-ing politics with Supreme Court nomi-nees. I cannot support Judge Gorsuch’s nomination because we cannot have one set of rules for Democratic Presi-dents and another set of rules for Re-publican Presidents. Some of my colleagues and maybe some of the Americans listening at home tonight may be asking them-selves: Well, Senator C
ARPER , didn’t the Democrats change the rules for judges when they were in the majority? That is a fair question. To that, I would say yes. That is true for lower court nominees, nominees to Federal district courts and courts of appeals. But it wasn’t because Senator Harry Reid woke up one morning and decided that was the day to change the rules of the Senate. A decision of this mag-nitude didn’t happen on a whim. It was because, by the time November 2013 had arrived, our Republican friends had attempted to block—get this—more nominations in the first 5 years of President Obama’s tenure than all other Presidents combined. Let me say that again. It was because, by the time November 2013 had arrived, our Repub-lican friends had attempted to block more nominations in the first 5 years of President Obama’s tenure than all other Presidents combined. It wasn’t the unprecedented use of cloture motions—79 cloture motions— during those 5 years that precipitated Democrats’ seeking a solution to re-store the capability of the Senate to do its job. It was because our Republican friends refused to consider any nomi-nee—any nominee—to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, despite three critical vacancies on our Nation’s second high-est court. So, yes, it is true that Democrats supported a change that allowed a vote on those nominees, but it was because our Republican friends took the un-heard of position that no nominees—no nominees, no matter their qualifica-tions—were entitled to a vote. I should note that Democrats were careful to preserve the 60 votes for Su-preme Court nominees. Let me just say that, if there is any position in the Federal Government that should require at least 60 votes, my view is it should be the Supreme Court, and that is the rule under which we operate as of this moment. One of the reasons why is because Su-preme Court vacancies come around quite rarely. When they do, we need to ensure that debate is robust, we need to ensure that the nominee is from the judicial and the political mainstream, and we need to ensure that these life-time appointments are held to the highest standards. In other words, I be-lieve we need a nominee like Judge Merrick Garland. Despite his own impressive resume, I have concerns with Judge Gorsuch’s nomination beyond the treatment of Judge Garland, and I have concerns with the way that our debate has not been, frankly, robust. I have concerns that Judge Gorsuch’s views are outside the judicial and political mainstream, and I have concerns about what others have termed ‘‘evasiveness.’’ His eva-siveness before the Judiciary Com-mittee does not meet the high stand-ards that we should expect for those lifetime appointments. I would be remiss if I did not mention what I referred to last week as the cloud that lingers still over President Trump’s campaign. Like many Ameri-cans, I read the news related to Russia and the Trump campaign, and I come to the inescapable conclusion that the cloud is darkening and the forecast is a matter of grave concern for our Con-stitution. FBI Director Jim Comey has testified under oath that there is an ongoing in-vestigation to determine the links be-tween the Trump campaign and Russia, an adversary that attacked our elec-tion and undermined a free and fair election to change the outcome of that election. From all appearances, they did. To hastily move forward with Judge Gorsuch—who is 49 years old, who could serve on the Supreme Court well into the middle of this century—with-out first getting to the bottom of the suspicious and irregular actions of Trump campaign officials would be, in my view, a mistake.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES2210 April 4, 2017 
For many Americans, this Supreme Court seat will always come with an asterisk attached to it. They believe and I believe that it was a stolen seat that belonged to Judge Merrick Gar-land. Many Americans are wondering why we are rushing to fill a lifetime va-cancy while President Trump’s cam-paign remains under investigation and will for at least some while. I believe we have some time. Judge Garland waited 293 days for a hearing and a vote that never came. Judge Gorsuch has waited 48 days for a hear-ing and many of our Republican friends would like to see him seated this week. Again, I would say: Judge Merrick Garland waited 293 days for a hearing and a vote that never, never came. What we face here today, I think, is a rush to judgment. I would just say that we have time. We ought to hit the pause button on this nomination. The American people are watching us, and history will judge us. I fear that history may judge us poorly if anyone other than Merrick Garland is confirmed at this time. I fear that his-tory may judge us poorly if we do not insist that the Trump campaign is first cleared of any wrongdoing before we move forward. We need to get this right. We have time to get this right. The Senate has been through it all. The good men and women of the Senate have always disagreed—sometimes pas-sionately, oftentimes loudly. I under-stand that this disagreement before us may seem irresolvable, but that is only if we seek to cut off debate and admit defeat. Personally speaking, I am not ready to do that today or this week. I believe we have time. I believe we have the opportunity to right a his-toric wrong. We have not just an oppor-tunity to right a historic wrong but also an obligation to get this right. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

TRIBUTE TO RICH RIMKUNAS Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to pay tribute to a fine public servant and an incredible asset to the U.S. Congress. Rich Rimkunas has had a career filled with outstanding achievement at the Congressional Research Service, CSR. After nearly 37 years of service, Rich will be retiring from CRS on Fri-day, April 28. When Rich joined CRS in 1980, he was an analyst working on a broad array of social policy issues. Initially, he worked on issues like child nutrition, poverty, Social Security, social serv-ices for the aged, and unemployment insurance. Rich cocreated and coau-thored a widely circulated CRS report on Federal social welfare spending. He was also a coauthor and contributor to several chapters in the House Ways and Means Committee print ‘‘Children in Poverty,’’ which provided a detailed look at the incidence and characteris-tics of child poverty in the United States. Rich ultimately became heavily in-volved in providing research and ana-lytical support to Congress on many health policy issues, including analyses of aggregate national health expendi-tures, the Medicare hospital prospec-tive payment system, the Medicare Ad-vantage program, and Medicare cata-strophic drug costs. Additionally, he has worked on numerous issues related to Medicaid. He both directed a team of CRS analysts as well as contributed his own analysis to the Medicaid ‘‘Yellow Book,’’ a 1988 House Ways and Means Committee print that provided a com-prehensive analysis of the Medicaid program as it existed at the time. Rich also managed the 1993 update of the ‘‘Yellow Book.’’ Rich’s analyses have typically in-volved quantitative research meth-odologies, modeling techniques, and the use of complex databases. Rich has excelled at developing approaches for simulating the effects of potential changes to Federal benefits and grant allocation formulas. In addition to the direct impact his research and analytical work has had on Federal policies, Rich has made equally important contributions within CRS in managerial roles. During his tenure at CRS, he has served as section research manager of the methodology section, the research development sec-tion, the research development and in-come support section, and the hea1th insurance and financing section. Dur-ing his tenure as an SRM, Rich helped manage CRS work on the 1996 welfare reform law and the 2003 overhaul of Medicare in the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act. Rich helped manage an inter-disciplinary team numbering about 3 dozen CRS analysts that provided leg-islative support during the passage of the Affordable Care Act. Throughout his career, Rich has served as a role model for the highest level of CRS service to Congress, up-holding the Service’s standards of authoritativeness, objectivity, and con-fidentiality. He is known within CRS for his attention to detail, methodo-logical strength, and creative ap-proaches toward conducting analyses. His input is sought on a great many re-search efforts spanning virtually all of the major domestic social policy issue areas that Congress deals with. Rich is renowned for his tremendous work ethic and energizing presence. Those who have worked closely with him appreciate his ability to keep his sense of humor even during the most stressful times. In recent years, Rich has served as the deputy assistant director of CRS’s domestic social policy division. In that role, he has mentored and helped de-velop many of the division’s managers, analysts, and research assistants. He has also played a central role in re-viewing written work produced by the division, helping to ensure its accu-racy, completeness, and quality. More-over, in his work as a division man-ager, Rich has served on numerous ad-visory panels that have recommended organizational practices and policies for CRS, many of which have been adopted. Rich’s policy expertise has been broadly recognized. He is regularly sought for his expertise at professional meetings and conferences. He was nom-inated to the National Academy of So-cial Insurance in 2002 and has served on the steering committee of the National Health Forum. He has also been recog-nized with numerous Library of Con-gress special achievement awards. Rich has devoted nearly his entire distinguished professional career to supporting the work of Congress and to helping build and strengthen CRS and advance its mission. We will miss Rich, but we wish him and his family the best of luck moving forward.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2211 April 4, 2017 
LOW INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to express my serious concerns with the budget for fiscal year 2018 recently pro-posed by President Trump. If adopted, this budget would have severe con-sequences on many Americans, but I am particularly concerned that it would be low-income families who are impacted the most. As vice chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I will do everything in my power to make sure that does not happen. Among countless examples within a budget that is out of touch and that will drive more American families into poverty, the President’s proposal to eliminate the Community Service Block Grant, the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, LIHEAP, and the Weatherization Assistance Pro-gram should be concerning to all of us. These are resources that are essential not only to Vermonters, but to mil-lions of families throughout the coun-try. The Community Service Block Grant ensures that low-income families re-ceive the support they need for basic food and housing assistance, financial planning tools, and fuel in winter months. LIHEAP and weatherization services ensure that families do not have to choose between food and heat. They ensure that families stay safe from harmful asbestos that may be in the walls of their old Vermont farm-houses or their inefficient mobile homes. In States like mine, home heat-ing is a life-and-death matter. We need to show compassion when drafting our budget and provide sup-port for those programs that help hard- working families in need. We must see the faces behind these proposed budget cuts. Vulnerable people should never be at the whim of politically driven prior-ities. We have to do better. I would like to begin by recognizing the crisis so many families will face in this country with-out the help of our community action agencies. Without them, families will go cold. They will choose not to eat so they can heat their homes. They will deny themselves healthcare and miss rent payments so that they can stay warm, so that they can stay alive. Last month, I had the pleasure of seeing a longtime friend and fellow Vermonter Jan Demers, who serves as the executive director of the Cham-plain Valley Office of Economic Oppor-tunity, CVOEO, Vermont’s largest community action agency in Bur-lington. It was Jan who said it best, noting that, ‘‘President Trump’s budg-et is like one amputation after an-other. Not bringing health to the com-munity but cut after cut—loss after loss.’’ I am proud that CVOEO and the other community action agencies con-tinue to meet the needs of these fami-lies and hope all Senators will continue to support them as I have during my time in the Senate. In recognition of their leadership, I ask unanimous consent that a state-ment by Jan Demers be printed in the R
ECORD . There being no objection, the mate-rial was ordered to be printed in the R
ECORD , as follows: 
Good morning, my name is Jan Demers and I am the Executive Director of the Champlain Valley Office of Economic Oppor-tunity. On behalf of the more than 23,000 Vermonters that CVOEO serves: Welcome. We are standing in CVOEOs Weatherization Warehouse. It is a fitting place to talk about President Trump’s recently released budget. Thank you to Senator Leahy and your staff for organizing this press conference and for the leadership you provide for Vermont and the nation. Thank you to Jonathan Bond and our staff and for all the Community Action Agencies who carry on this good work. Thank you to Bobby Arnell, Sean Brown, Sarah Phillips and to our partners in the State of Vermont who uphold the values of care and wellness for all Vermonters. And thank you to Mr. Todd Alexander who typi-fies the strength of those we serve. Community Action Agencies exist to sup-port community well-being. We make sure that everyone can reach their potential and fully contribute to the total strength of our communities. How does Mr. Trump’s budget affect CVOEO? It zeros out the Community Service Block Grant—$990,687. This is the foundational grant that undergirds the ma-jority of our programs. It zeros out the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) that keeps Vermonters warm in the winter. It zeros out the Department of Energy’s Weatherization Program. Thank-fully the State of Vermont is our main source of Weatherization funding. However, this will mean that 30 Vermont homes will not be weatherized in our area. Just those 3 cuts amount to a total of $2,056,675. On top of that there are the cuts to Head Start, Fair Housing, Housing assistance, Mo-bile Home, and Voices Against Violence. There isn’t an area, program, staff person or any of the 23,000 people we served that won’t be touched and experience devastation of services due to this budget. We have heard over and over that the war on poverty didn’t work. However, when the programs that created the War on Poverty in 1964 measured the percent of poverty it was at 20%. Seven years later the percentage of poverty was at 11%. It worked! Then the years of cutting started, cut after cut was enacted weakening the effort substantially. In 2012 the measured percent of poverty was 15%. Currently the percentage of poverty is 13.5%. To me that signifies that the meas-ured efforts put into place during the Obama years are working. There isn’t a CVOEO Program that isn’t decimated by this budget bringing great loss for the entire population of over 23,000 people that CVOEO served in FY 16. Community Ac-tion Agencies exist to support community well-being. Instead of health, this budget is like one amputation after another. Not bringing health to the community but cut after cut—loss after loss. Our vision is bridging gaps and building fu-tures for the people we serve. This budget widens the chasm and diminishes life. This cannot be the last word in the Federal budget for FY 18. Thank you, Senator Leahy for bringing us a better way. f 
PRESIDENT EL-SISI’S VISIT Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this week, Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi is in Washington where he is meeting with President Trump and other senior administration officials, as well as some Members of Congress. President Trump has spoken glow-ingly of President el-Sisi, as he has of Russian President Putin and Philippine President Duterte. ‘‘Strong leaders,’’ he calls them, as if that is enough to justify our wholehearted support. Un-fortunately, world history is replete with examples of strong, messianic leaders who abused their power in ways that caused immense hardship for their people and divisiveness and conflict in their countries. Despite that, the White House has voiced its strong support for President el-Sisi, and for U.S.-Egyptian relations. I have been to Egypt many times, and I have voted for billions of dollars in U.S. aid for Egypt to support eco-nomic and security programs in that country. I have recognized positive de-velopments in Egypt when they occur, such as President el-Sisi’s decision to undertake economic reforms, including by reducing some subsidies. Far more needs to be done, however, if Egypt’s economy is to break free of decades of state control, endemic corruption, and gross mismanagement. I am also aware of the security threats Egypt faces in Libya and in the Sinai, although I and others have ex-pressed deep concern with the flawed tactics the Egyptian Government is using to combat those threats. The U.S. has an interest in helping Egypt confront these challenges by address-ing the underlying causes in a manner that is effective and consistent with international law. President Trump has called President el-Sisi a fantastic guy. Ironically, that says a lot more about President Trump than it does about President el-Sisi. President el-Sisi, a former general who seized power by force, has ruled with an iron fist. He has effectively banned public criticism of his govern-ment since the removal of former President Morsi, enforcing what amounts to a prohibition on protests and arresting hundreds of people in connection with the ban, many pre-emptively. President el-Sisi’s government has engaged in one of the widest arrest campaigns in the country’s modern his-tory, targeting a broad spectrum of po-litical opponents. Local civil society organizations estimate that between 40,000 and 60,000 people are detained on political grounds, such as for pro-testing or calling for a change in gov-ernment. Police have accused many of having links to the Muslim Brother-hood, usually without evidence that they have advocated or engaged in vio-lence. Many other detainees belong to other political organizations or have no party affiliation. A systematic crackdown on Egypt’s independent civil society has left it on the verge of collapse. According to human rights groups, nearly every prominent Egyptian human rights de-fender or civil society leader is banned

from leaving the country as part of a judicial investigation into the foreign funding of their organizations. A law signed by President el-Sisi in 2014 would allow prosecutors to seek 25-year sentences for illegally receiving foreign funding. Parliament has also proposed a new law regulating civil society orga-nizations which, if adopted, would ef-fectively outlaw independent human rights work in the country. Despite repeated requests by U.S. of-ficials, including some Republicans and Democrats in Congress, President el- Sisi’s government has refused to re-lease those detained for political rea-sons for months or years without charge or on trumped up charges like Egyptian-American citizen Aya Hijazi. The media has also been targeted, with authorities threatening and jailing journalists who reported on po-litical opposition. Some foreign jour-nalists have been barred from the coun-try after writing articles critical of the government. As of December 2016, Egypt was the third-highest jailer of journalists, according to the Com-mittee to Protect Journalists. This pattern of harassment and arrests is not new. It has been happening for years, and, contrary to the representa-tions of Egyptian officials, it is getting worse. According to Human Rights Watch, members of the security forces, par-ticularly the Interior Ministry’s Na-tional Security Agency, routinely tor-ture detainees to elicit confessions. This torture usually occurs during pe-riods of enforced disappearance that can last for weeks or months. The widespread use of torture has also been reported by the State Department. De-spite hundreds of reported cases of tor-ture and enforced disappearance, since 2013, only a handful of police officers have reportedly been punished for vio-lating the law. According to information I have re-ceived, prison conditions remain de-plorable, and political detainees are beaten, often deprived of contact with relatives and lawyers, and denied ac-cess to medical care. The government’s use of U.S. aircraft and other military equipment in its counterterrorism campaign against a local ISIS affiliate in the northern Sinai has not only resulted in indis-criminate attacks against civilians and other gross violations of human rights, it has made the terrorism situation worse. Requests by myself, as well as State and Defense Department officials and by independent journalists and rep-resentatives of human rights groups, for access to conflicted areas, have been denied. While President Trump and other U.S. officials unabashedly praise Presi-dent el-Sisi, I wonder how they rec-oncile their portrayal of him with his crackdown against civil society and brutal repression of dissent. In fact, it can’t be reconciled, and it damages our own credibility as a strong defender of human rights and democratic prin-ciples. I want to reiterate what I said in this Chamber on September 27, 2016, when I spoke about Aya Hijazi, the young Egyptian American social worker cur-rently detained in Egypt. Ms. Hijazi, along with her Egyptian husband and five employees of their organization Belady, has been accused of salacious crimes that the government has yet to corroborate with any credible evidence; yet she has been jailed since May 21, 2014. Just last month, a decision in her case was inexplicably delayed until later this month. It is long past time for her ordeal to end. The United States and Egypt have common interests in an increasingly troubled region. Egypt has acted to re-duce the smuggling of weapons into Gaza, and it has helped to broker ceasefires with Hamas. Our support for Egypt is demonstrated by the fact that, over the past 70 years, U.S. tax-payers have provided more than $70 bil-lion in economic and military aid to Egypt. I doubt that many Egyptians know that, as most have a decidedly unfavorable opinion of the United States. After three decades of corrupt auto-cratic rule by former President Muba-rak, Egypt once again has a former military officer as President who has chosen to rule by force. It is neither justified, nor is it necessary. If, on the contrary, President el-Sisi were to demonstrate that he has a credible plan for transforming Egypt’s econ-omy, for improving education and cre-ating jobs, for respecting due process and other fundamental rights, and for addressing the discrimination and lack of economic opportunities that are at the root of the violence in the Sinai, the Egyptian people would support him. They would also have a brighter future. Instead, I fear that, by relying on repression, he is sowing the seeds of misery and civil unrest, which is in the interest of neither the Egyptian people nor the American people.

MONTENEGRO’S ACCESSION INTO NATO Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am pleased the U.S. Senate voted favor-ably to add Montenegro as a permanent member to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO, sending a strong signal of transatlantic unity. NATO plays a vital role in maintaining secu-rity and stability throughout Europe, and including Montenegro in this stra-tegic alliance will strengthen NATO and encourage stability within the re-gion. Montenegro is a growing democracy that has repeatedly proven itself to be a valuable ally since joining NATO’s Partnership for Peace Program in 2006. They are partnered with our Maine Na-tional Guard, and have been a strong ally in the fight in Afghanistan since 2010. Having visited Montenegro, I can say, without a doubt, that it has dem-onstrated a commitment to NATO, the United States, and regional stability. This vote sends clear message of sup-port to our friends in Montenegro. It also sends a strong message to NATO and gives notice that the United States will stand up for Western democracies, despite continued pressure from the Kremlin. We must deter Russia’s desta-bilizing actions in the region, including Moscow’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its continued support for rebels in eastern Ukraine. Putin is learning les-sons from these examples and will con-tinue his quest to expand his influence as far as the world community will allow. This aggression by the Russian Federation undermines peace and sta-bility not only in the Balkan region, but also in all of Europe, which con-stitutes a direct threat to U.S. security interests. Montenegro’s accession to NATO is in the best interest of the United States, NATO, and peace and stability in Europe. This vote by the U.S. Senate sends a clear message of our commit-ment to NATO, to the people of Monte-negro, and to improving stability in the Balkan region. I look forward to Montenegro joining NATO as a full member. f 
ANNIVERSARY OF NATO Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, nearly 70 years ago today, the United States and 11 other nations—in the face of Soviet aggression—joined together in mutual defense to form the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO. Since its inception, NATO has expanded to 28 member nations. The breadth of its mission is impressive—from ensuring regional stability and combating ter-rorism to training partner countries and supporting humanitarian aid. While NATO was founded to ensure Western peace and stability in the face of the Cold War, its work has come to encompass all corners and peoples of the globe. NATO is more important than ever today in deterring regional conflict The U.S. must stand by its ironclad commitment to NATO’s security and solidarity as Russian President Vladi-mir Putin flouts international law and exerts Russian aggression around the world, from meddling in our own elec-tion to the illegal annexation of Cri-mea. Our NATO allies need our support. I applaud Operation Atlantic Resolve, which coordinates the deployment of additional NATO troops to our allies in Eastern Europe. I also commend other U.S. efforts that support our NATO al-lies, like the European Reassurance Initiative. These play an essential role in bolstering our force readiness in the region to deter Russian aggression and demonstrate our commitment to the common cause and democratic prin-ciples that NATO embodies. American support for NATO is and must remain steadfast. The nearly unanimous vote in the Senate ratifying Montenegro’s accession to be a member state is evidence of this well-estab-lished, deeply founded support.

Ukraine’s stated intention to achieve the criteria for joining NATO, too, is testament to the organization’s re-newed importance in our deterrence policy in the region. While the sentiment of NATO’s arti-cle 5—‘‘an attack on one is an attack on all’’—helped guide the U.S. stably through the Cold War, NATO has re-mained a relevant source of stength for the international community, beyond regional deterrence. Since 1999, when NATO identified the risk international terrorism posed for member nations, the organization has remained a stead-fast resource in the fight against ter-rorism. In fact, the only instance in which article 5 was invoked was in the wake of the terrorist attacks of Sep-tember 11, 2001. Since then, NATO has helped ensure freedom of navigation in waters plagued by piracy, helped train Iraqi security forces counter impro-vised explosive devices, commanded counterterrorism operations in Afghan-istan for more than a decade, provided support for Global Coalition to Counter ISIL, and innumerable other contribu-tions. As threats to member nations evolved in the 21st century, NATO demonstrated its ability to adapt. NATO showed the power of strength through solidarity, not only for its member nations, but also for its dozens of partner nations around the globe. The power of NATO’s partnerships lends strength to the global commu-nity as a whole, better equipping re-gions of the world to respond when dis-aster strikes. Programs like NATO’s Centres of Excellence help partner countries fight corruption, piracy, and terrorism and collaborate to stem the spread of weapons of mass destruction and other arms. By serving as a re-source for nonmember countries, NATO not only strengthens the resolve of the international community to strife and instability, but also serves as a beacon for democratic values like gender equality and rule of law. Finally, NATO has long served as a force for human rights. It was central to ending the genocide in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1995, and it helped bring an end to violence in Kosovo in 1999. NATO has served as a vital resource as-sisting with the waves of refugees es-caping from violence and atrocity in Syria, and the organization has been at the frontlines to combat international human trafficking. NATO plays a critical role in combat-ting increased Russian aggression, but its mission is much broader than that. The world is a safer place thanks to NATO, from stemming regional con-flicts, to assisting partners around the world. It serves as an indispensable, in-disputable resource for the inter-national community. As we celebrate the anniversary of this pivotal organi-zation today, we must remain com-mitted to its successful future.

VAISAKHI Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I wish to honor and celebrate the holiday of Vaisakhi, a very significant day for those who practice Sikhism. The world’s fifth largest religion, Sikhism was founded over five cen-turies ago and was introduced to the United States in the 19th century. Today there are over 500,000 Sikh ad-herents in the United States. Pennsylvania is the home of many proud Sikh Americans, who make a positive impact in their workplaces, communities, and to our country. They are an important part of the rich cul-tural fabric of the Commonwealth. There are many gurdwaras, or centers of worship, located across the State, which serve a vital role for both the Sikh community and people of other faiths. This year, Vaisakhi will be cele-brated on Friday, April 14. On this day in 1699, Guru Gobind Singh created the Khalsa, a fellowship of devout Sikhs. Vaisakhi is a festival that marks both this occasion and the spring harvest. This holiday, which is meant to pro-mote service to others, reminds us of the valuable contributions Sikh Ameri-cans make in many of our commu-nities. The Sikh community around the world recognizes this important holi-day with parades, dancing, singing, vis-its to gurdwaras, and other festivities. Celebrations also include performing ‘‘seva,’’ or selfless service, which can include providing free meals to others or volunteering for different service projects in their communities. This year, the Sikh Coordination Committee East Coast has organized a National Sikh Day Parade here in Washington, DC, on April 8, 2017, to commemorate this occasion. Thou-sands of Sikhs from all over United States are participating in this parade, which will celebrate the Sikh identity and culture. As a member of the American Sikh Congressional Caucus, I am honored to represent the Sikh community of Pennsylvania, and I wish the Sikh American community a joyous Vaisakhi. Thank you. f 
ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
RECOGNIZING FLATHEAD VALLEY COMMUNITY COLLEGE ∑Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, today I have the honor and privilege of recog-nizing the faculty, administrators, staff, and students of Flathead Valley Community College for their service to the people of northwest Montana—2017 marks the school’s 50-year anniversary. FVCC serves thousands of students of every age and background. In its five decades of existence, the college and its faculty have won numerous awards for providing a high-quality and low- cost education in Kalispell, MT. The college provides more than 50 ca-reer and technical programs, while also giving students a cheaper and more convenient option for their first 2 years of college. FVCC also has developed programs that can help high school students get a ‘‘Running Start’’ on their college careers. FVCC has given generations of students the tools they need to succeed. The college also serves a vital role in supplying the region’s employers with a skilled workforce. The idea for a community college in northwest Montana began in 1960 when Kalispell School Board chairman Owen Sowerwine noted a study that 80 per-cent of local high school graduates were receiving no higher education whatsoever. Sowerwine worked with other local educational leaders such as Bill McClaren, Thelma Hetland, Les Stirling, and Norm Beyer to create a new community college. The college opened its doors in 1967, and today we celebrate their legacy. FVCC continues to grow and find new and better ways to serve the commu-nity. Its Kalispell campus has grown to eight buildings, with new on-campus housing opening this year. FVCC also has an extension campus in Libby, MT. I look forward to seeing what the next 50 years will hold, and I congratu-late all involved in the success of FVCC on reaching this milestone.∑ f 
TRIBUTE TO SERGEANT JOHN MASSICK ∑Mrs. ERNST. Mr. President, today I wish to honor a living example of the American dream. At 101 years of age, Mr. John Massick of Davenport, IA, has spent a lifetime in service—as a husband, father, soldier, and hero of World War II. John was born on Veterans Day 1915, which proved to be symbolic in his life to come. He enlisted in the Army in 1941 and rose to the rank of sergeant, leading soldiers in combat across Eu-rope as a member of Patton’s 3rd Army. On his 29th birthday, while se-curing a bridge in Thionville, France, his unit suffered a perilous German at-tack, but John survived. It is a day Sergeant Massick describes as ‘‘a birth-day he’ll never forget.’’ He continued to serve through the end of the war in Europe, earning the French Croix de Guerre, Presidential Unit Commenda-tion, and two Bronze Star Medals, among other accolades. After the war, John returned to Dav-enport, married his now-late wife, Velma, and raised two sons while work-ing as a carpet salesman and installer. He finally retired just 6 years ago at the ripe age of 94. Today Iowans who visit ‘‘Popcorn Charley’s’’ in northwest Davenport will hear John tell stories from the war. Some recall the harsh realities of com-bat, others remind us of our humanity, like the one he tells of how he caught a pig to fry porkchops for his men, bringing a bit of Iowa to the battle-fields of Europe. John’s stories, like his life’s experiences, seem to strike the right balance between honor, humility, and a sense of humor. I ask my colleagues to join me as I proudly recognize the service and the

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. P
AUL): S. 823. A bill to ensure the digital contents of electronic equipment and online accounts belonging to or in the possession of United States persons en-tering or exiting the United States are adequately protected at the border, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Govern-mental Affairs. Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I, along with my colleague Senator P
AUL from Kentucky, am introducing the Protecting Data at the Border Act, a bill that protects Americans and U.S. Permanent Residents from warrantless searches of their electronic devices at the border. 1n 2014, the Supreme Court estab-lished in California v. Riley that law enforcement agencies must obtain a probable cause search warrant before they can search someone’s phone or laptop during a ‘‘search incident to ar-rest.’’ Prior to that decision, law en-forcement agencies around the country routinely engaged in warrantless searches of phones and other electronic devices. The Supreme Court rightly recognized that we need new, stronger rules to protect digital information. Although the warrant protections from Riley have been the law of the land for the last three years, a signifi-cant loophole has remained: the border. The Riley decision left unresolved the question of whether or not U.S. Cus-toms can search the smartphones and laptops of U.S. persons as they leave the country and return home. This is not a theoretical concern. According to recent statistics provided by Customs and Border Protection, searches of cellphones by border agents has ex-ploded, growing fivefold in just one

year, from fewer than 5,000 in 2015 to nearly 25,000 in 2016. Five-thousand de-vices were searched this last February alone, more than in all of 2015. My colleague, Senator P
AULand I in-tend to close this loophole, ensuring that U.S. persons crossing the border do not have lesser digital privacy rights than individuals who are ar-rested inside the United States. This bill has four main components. First, it requires that law enforce-ment agencies obtain a probable cause warrant before they can search the laptop, smartphone or other electronic device belonging to a U.S. person at the border. The bill includes an emer-gency exception to this warrant re-quirement, modeled after USA Free-dom Act section 102, which became law in 2015. Second, it requires informed, written consent before the government may re-quest and obtain voluntary assistance from a U.S. person accessing data on a locked device or account, such as by disclosing their password or otherwise providing access. The bill also pro-hibits the government from delaying or denying entry to a U.S. person if he or she refuses to provide such assistance. Third, it requires that the govern-ment obtain a warrant before it can copy and retain a U.S. person’s data, even if the data has been collected without a warrant, during an emer-gency. Fourth, it requires that the govern-ment create and publish statistics on the electronic border searches they conduct. Passage of this bill would ensure that the important privacy rights recog-nized by the Supreme Court in Riley also apply at the border, while still en-abling law enforcement agencies con-tinue to do the important work of keeping our country safe. I thank my colleague Senator P
AUL for his efforts on this bill, and I hope the Senate will consider our proposal quickly. 
By Mr. BARRASSO (for himself, Mr. C
ARPER , Mr. I NHOFE , Mr. B
OOKER , Mr. B OOZMAN , and Mr. W
HITEHOUSE ): S. 826. A bill to reauthorize the Part-ners for Fish and Wildlife Program and certain wildlife conservation funds, to establish prize competitions relating to the prevention of wildlife poaching and trafficking, wildlife conservation, the manaement of invasive species, and the protection of endangered species, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works. Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise to speak about bipartisan legislation that I have introduced to promote in-novative solutions to better manage invasive species, conserve wildlife, and eliminate poaching. I have introduced this in a bipartisan way as the chair-man of the Environment and Public Works Committee, along with Senator T
OMCARPER , who is the ranking mem-ber of that committee, and along with Senator JIMINHOFE , who is a former chairman of that committee. This legislation is called the Wildlife Innovation and Longevity Driver Act, WILD for short. I am a supporter of both conserving wildlife and techno-logical innovation that we have before us. My home State of Wyoming is truly one of the most beautiful places in the world. The people of Wyoming have an incredible appreciation for our wildlife. We applaud the efforts of innovators to help us conserve and manage species much more effectively and at a lower cost. Our State wildlife managers grap-ple with many challenges that innovators can help us solve. For example, poaching has been a major issue in Wyoming. Hundreds of animals are taken illegally in the State. That is what I hear from the Wyoming Game & Fish Department. Poaching is a problem across the coun-try. It is not just the case in Wyoming; it has become pandemic overseas. International poachers seeking to cash in on the ivory trade have reduced the population of African elephants by 75 percent over the last 10 years. It is tragic. Invasive species also present a threat to native wildlife, to water resources, and to our landscape. Invasive species clog pipes and fuel catastrophic fires. In fact, invasive species have a role in 42 percent of the listings under the En-dangered Species Act. It is invasive species that are causing other species to become endangered. We need creative solutions to these threats to our wildlife. Our Nation’s innovators are developing cutting-edge technologies to help us more effec-tively fight poaching, manage wildlife, and control invasive species. A 2015 National Geographic article outlined a number of innovative tech-nologies that are being used today to promote conservation of many of the world’s most endangered species. That includes DNA analysis to identify the origin of illicit ivory supplies, using thermal imaging around protected areas to notify authorities of poachers, and using apps to assist wildlife en-forcement in carrying out their duties. In December, the National Invasive Species Council cohosted a summit, which highlighted innovations that combat invasive species. A few exam-ples are a fish passage that automati-cally extracts invasive fish from streams, DNA technologies to provide early detection of invasive species, and the use of drones to gain spatially ac-curate, high resolution images that could be used to detect and monitor specific invasive species. Innovations like these are why we have introduced in a bipartisan way the WILD Act. This act provides technological and financial assistance to private land-owners to improve fish and wildlife habitats. The legislation does this by reauthorizing the Partners for Fish and Wildlife Program. The WILD Act re-quires Federal agencies to implement strategic programs to control invasive species. It also reauthorizes important laws to protect endangered and valu-able species around the world, such as the African elephant, the Asian ele-phant, the rhinoceros, the great ape, and the marine turtle. Finally, this act creates incentives for new conservation innovation. The legislation establishes four separate cash prizes for technological innova-tion in the prevention of wildlife poaching and trafficking, in the pro-motion of wildlife conservation, in the management of invasive species, and in the protection of endangered species. The Department of the Interior will ad-minister the prizes, and a panel of rel-evant experts will award each prize. Innovation is one of the best tools in conserving endangered species and keeping invasive species under control. The WILD Act will help stimulate that innovation. I thank Senator C
ARPER and Senator I
NHOFE for cosponsoring this important piece of legislation. Thank you.

S. R ES. 109 Whereas, in June 2009, Asia Bibi allegedly insulted the Muslim faith during a con-frontation with Muslim neighbors and drank from a water source shared by these Muslim neighbors; Whereas, in November 2010, Asia Bibi, a Pakistani Christian woman, was sentenced to death by hanging after being convicted of blasphemy by a Pakistani District Court under Article 295–C of Pakistan’s penal code; Whereas, according to the United States Commission on International Religious Free-dom, Pakistan’s blasphemy laws set severe punishments, including death or life in pris-on, and have been levied against religious minorities, including Christians, Hindus, and Ahmadiyya and Shi’a Muslims, as well as Sunni Muslims; Whereas a petition calling for the imme-diate release of Asia Bibi has generated over 690,000 signatures, and 250,000 of the signa-tures, roughly a third of the total amount, were made by petitioners from the United States; Whereas, in January 2011, Pakistani politi-cian Salmaan Taseer, the governor of Punjab province, who campaigned for Asia Bibi’s re-lease and called for reform to Pakistan’s blasphemy codes, outraged religious conserv-atives and was assassinated by his security guard, Mumtaz Qadri; Whereas, in March 2011, Federal Minister for Minority Affairs Shahbaz Bhatti was as-sassinated in Islamabad, Pakistan, after re-ceiving death threats for his support of re-forming Pakistan’s blasphemy codes and calling for the release of Asia Bibi;

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES2218 April 4, 2017 
Whereas, in October 2014, the Lahore High Court of Appeals upheld the death sentence of Asia Bibi; Whereas the execution of Mumtaz Qadri in February 2016 resulted in street protests that called for the death of Asia Bibi; Whereas, in Pakistan, mere accusations of blasphemy, even by private individuals, often lead to violence against those accused by private actors; Whereas Pakistan’s human rights problems include poor prison conditions, arbitrary de-tention, lengthy pretrial detention, a weak criminal justice system, lack of judicial independence in the lower courts, and gov-ernmental infringement on citizens’ privacy rights; Whereas Asia Bibi is at risk of extrajudicial murder even if she is released; Whereas, in Pakistan, violence, abuse, and social and religious intolerance by militant organizations and other nongovernmental actors contribute to a culture of lawlessness in some parts of the country; and Whereas there is great concern for Asia Bibi’s safety during her incarceration due to reports that prisoners who are members of religious minorities face a heightened risk of mistreatment, torture, or murder: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate— (1) urges the Government of Pakistan to immediately and unconditionally release Asia Bibi and ensure that she, her family, and her legal counsel are afforded all nec-essary measures to ensure their safety; and (2) urges the Government of Pakistan to reform its laws to reflect democratic norms and ideals and work to promote tolerance of religious minorities, whether Muslim, Chris-tian, Hindu, or other ostracized, so that no one is in danger of persecution from the gov-ernment or their neighbors for exercising their right to free speech and practicing their religion. f

EGYPT Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss the issue of human rights as part of my office’s on-going effort on what we call the Ex-pression Not Oppression Campaign, where we highlight human rights abuses around the world and tell the stories of political prisoners and other brave leaders who are being repressed, jailed, beaten, or even worse, simply for criticizing the government of a na-tion in which they live. This is an important week for human rights. Two nations with concerning records regarding human rights—Egypt and China—have sent their heads of state to meet with our President. And I will have, I hope, a chance later on this week to discuss the issues we con-front in China, and they are many. Today, I want to discuss the state of human rights and our general relation-ship with Egypt. Over the past 2 days, the President of Egypt, President Elsisi, has been vis-iting our Nation’s Capital. He had the opportunity to meet with the President and other officials in the administra-tion. Earlier today, I had the oppor-tunity to visit with him as part of a meeting with members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Before entering my remarks, I want to make abundantly clear that we are incredibly impressed and grateful and supportive of the efforts that President Elsisi and Egypt are undertaking in battling radicalism and in particular ISIS. They are undertaking this effort, for example, in the Sinai, and it is quite a challenge. I also understand that the ongoing ability to defeat radicalism in the world depends on the stability of our partners internally. That is why the human rights situation in Egypt is concerning. I believe it is fair to say it is at its worst in decades, and that is saying something. It is important. Some may ask ‘‘Why does America care about that?’’ beyond, obviously, our moral calling to defend the rights of all people. It is that it is counter-productive behavior. These abuses—the conditions that exist in Egypt and in other places around the world—are ac-tually conducive to jihadi ideology, which is the ability to recruit people who feel vulnerable, who feel op-pressed. They become more vulnerable to those campaigns when they feel they are being mistreated. The current Government of Egypt, under the leadership of President Elsisi, has cracked down on civil soci-ety. On that, there can be no debate. They have jailed thousands of political prisoners, including, sadly, some Amer-icans, and it has responded with brute force to those who oppose that govern-ment. Again, I reiterate that a strong U.S.- Egypt relationship is important to America—to advancing our interests in the Middle East. I am here to speak on behalf of American interests and why this is so important in our relationship with Egypt and in the stability of the region, but I must do so by describing the situation on the ground. In the national interest of our coun-try, we cannot turn a blind eye to the ongoing repression of Egyptian citizens by their government. It weakens our moral standing in the world, and, as I have already said numerous times, it makes Egypt less secure. If Egypt is less secure, ultimately America will be less secure. Today, I said that to Presi-dent Elsisi. Over the last decades, the American people have provided Egypt with more than $77 billion in foreign aid. This in-cludes what is currently $1.3 billion per year in military aid. But as the human rights situation in Egypt continues to deteriorate and the government refuses to take the serious and necessary steps of reform and respecting the rule of law, then this Congress, on behalf of the American people—who are giving $1.3 billion of their hard-earned tax-payer money—must continue to pursue the reform of our assistance to Egypt to make sure that not only is it allow-ing them to confront the challenges that are posed by radicalism today but that it also promotes progress in a way that does not leave Egypt unstable and ultimately vulnerable in the future. It is in the interest of both our coun-try and Egypt and the Egyptian people to implement reforms and to release all of its jailed political prisoners, in-cluding all jailed Americans. Nations cannot thrive and they cannot prosper if their citizens are oppressed or are unable to express themselves freely without fear of being jailed, tortured, or killed. Inevitably, if these conditions con-tinue, there will be a street uprising in Egypt once again, and it could very well be led by radical elements who seek to overthrow the government and create a space for terrorism. Human rights abuses in Egypt take on many forms. An example is the lack of press freedom. In 2016, Egypt joined other nations in rising to the top of the rankings as the world’s third highest jailer of journalists. According to the Reporters Without Borders’ 2016 World Press Freedom Index, Egypt currently ranks 159th out of 180 countries in terms of press freedom. The media, in-cluding journalists, bloggers, and those active on social media, are regularly harassed and arrested. There are cur-rently 24 journalists who are jailed on trumped-up and politically motivated charges. Their ‘‘crimes’’ have included publishing false information and incit-ing terrorism. Censorship has grown as they continue to interfere in the publi-cation and circulation of news—al-though, by the way, a lot of Egyptian news coverage is very anti-American. These are just a few examples of the ongoing repression of press freedom in Egypt. There are also human rights abuses the Egyptian Government continues to commit with regard to freedom of asso-ciation and of assembly. In November of 2016, the Egyptian Parliament passed a draconian law that, if signed by President Elsisi, would ban non-governmental organizations from oper-ating freely in Egypt. The law would essentially eliminate all independent human rights groups. It would make it nearly impossible for charities to func-tion by imposing strict regulations and registration processes. Individuals who violate this law could face jail time simply for speaking out and fighting to defend human rights. Passing laws like these has a chilling effect on dissent. Here is the good news: President Elsisi has not signed it over 4 months later, and I truly hope it is because he is having second thoughts about it, be-cause he recognizes the terrible impact it will have on his country’s future, on their perception around the world, on their ability to make progress and re-form, and ultimately because he also recognizes the impact it will have on free nations, like the United States, which desires to work with Egypt on many issues of common interest. I strongly encourage President Elsisi to reject that anti-NGO law. There is the issue of political pris-oners. According to the Project on Mid-dle East Democracy, since 2013 at least 60,000 political prisoners have been ar-rested in Egypt and 1,800 people have received death sentences in what many

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES2222 April 4, 2017 
organizations have described as being politically motivated sentences. In 2014, President Elsisi issued a de-cree that expanded the jurisdiction of military courts over civilians. Accord-ing to Human Rights Watch, since the decree was issued, the military courts have tried over 7,400 Egyptian civil-ians. Additionally, individuals who have been victims of enforced disappear-ances in Egypt have claimed that they were tortured and subjected to other forms of abuse when they were taken. There has been little accountability for this excessive use of force. Egypt’s repression is not limited to its own citizens. There are currently a number of Americans who are jailed in Egypt. There is one American in par-ticular whom I would like to raise: the case of American-Egyptian citizen Aya Hijazi. Aya was arrested in May of 2014, along with her husband and other members of her organization, which is called the Belady Foundation, which works with abandoned and homeless youth and rescues these young children off the streets. Three years ago, she was arrested and charged with ridicu-lous allegations, including sexual abuse and paying the children to par-ticipate in demonstrations against the government. To date, no evidence has been provided to back these horrible allegations. Almost 3 years later, this American citizen remains in prison. Throughout that time, I and others here in the Senate have been calling for her release, and it is time that the charges against her be dropped and her husband and the other workers be re-leased immediately because her case and many others like it are an obstacle to better relations. The Egyptian people deserve better than the brutal treatment they are re-ceiving at the hands of their govern-ment. All human beings do. It is in-cumbent upon us, the elected rep-resentatives of the American people, to make clear to friends, allies, partners, and foes alike that no matter what issues we are working with you on, ne-gotiating a resolution to, or dealing with you on in some other way, we are not going to look the other way when human rights are being abused. We are going to encourage you to reform be-cause in the long run, that is in your interest and ours. We have seen in recent history the consequences when governments do not respect their citizens. It creates insta-bility in those countries. Instability is the breeding ground of terrorists and radical elements around the world. Ul-timately, those terrorists train their sights on us. As I told President Elsisi today, Egypt is a nation rich in culture and history and has made extraordinary contributions to the world. It has played a leading role in fostering peace with Israel. But it faces a dangerous fu-ture if it does not create the conditions within the country in which its people can live peacefully and securely with-out fear. Otherwise, Egypt remains vul-nerable to the kind of instability we have seen in Syria, Libya, and other countries. That is why it should matter to the American people. I am disappointed that this issue of human rights did not come up publicly when the President met with the Presi-dent of Egypt. I hope that will change in the weeks and days and months to come, for it is in our national interest to further these goals. Otherwise, sadly, we could very well have yet an-other and perhaps the most important country in the region destabilized and ultimately left vulnerable to becoming a breeding ground for terrorism that ultimately targets our people and our Nation.

EXECUTIVE SESSION 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR—Continued Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate re-sume executive session and then re-sume legislative session following the remarks of the Senator from Oregon, Mr. M
ERKLEY . The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Oregon. Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise to address the nomination of Neil Gorsuch. I will start by noting that just moments ago the majority leader was on the floor and did something that has never before been done in U.S. history; that is, on the first day—in-deed, in the first hours of debate on a Supreme Court Justice on this floor, the majority leader filed a petition, called a cloture petition, to close de-bate. So here we are on the first day, just hours into the debate, and the ma-jority leader has said: Enough. We do not want to hear any more about this topic. We are going to shut down de-bate. The rules provide some protection for this, and that is that it cannot be voted on until Thursday. So there is time be-tween now and Thursday for us to air our views. Historically, often debates went on for a substantial amount of time—a week, some for many weeks— with no cloture petition being filed, with no closing of the debate. Cer-tainly, never before has the majority leader shut down debate, filed that pe-tition on day one in his trying to ram this nomination through. This is just a continuation of firsts— first events that do absolutely no cred-it to this institution, no credit to the Supreme Court, no credit to our Na-tion. In fact, they pose a substantial danger. It was February 13, a little over a year ago, that Supreme Court Justice Scalia died. Almost immediately, the majority leader indicated that when the nomination came down from Presi-dent Obama, this Chamber would not exercise its responsibility of advice and consent under the Constitution in that it would not provide an opportunity for Merrick Garland to be able to appear before a committee and answer the questions of the committee members, the questions of Republicans and the questions of Democrats, so that they could assess whether that individual was appropriate to serve in a Supreme Court seat. The majority leader made it clear that there would be no committee hearing and no committee vote and no opportunity to come here directly to the floor, bypassing the committee. In other words, he closed off every oppor-tunity for the President’s nominee to be considered. This is the first time— this is the only time that has happened in our Nation’s history when there was a vacancy in an election year. What is the essence of this extraor-dinary and unusual action when this Chamber fails to exercise its advice and consent responsibility under the Constitution? Were we at a time of war, like the Civil War, in which the Capitol at times was under assault? Were we at a moment in which the building was aflame and we had to flee or there was some other significant threat to the functioning of this body? Was there some extraordinary set of circumstances—perhaps a massive storm headed for the Nation’s Capital— that led the Senate for the first time in U.S. history to say that it could not take the time to exercise its constitu-tional advice and consent responsi-bility? There was no storm. There was no fire. There was no threat. There was no earthquake. There was nothing that would have prevented this Chamber from doing its responsibility. The President has a responsibility under the Constitution when there is an open seat, and that is to nominate. He proceeded to consult with Members on both sides of the aisle, and he nomi-nated an individual, Merrick Garland, who had an extraordinary reputation and who essentially was considered to come straight down the Main Street of judicial thought, with opinions that were neither labeled ‘‘progressive’’ nor ‘‘conservative.’’ They were straight down the middle. The President made that nomination on March 16, which was a month and 3 days after the seat became vacant, but that was the last action to occur, the last action this Chamber took. A few individuals did courtesy interviews, knowing that it would lead to no com-mittee hearing and no committee vote because the majority team in this Chamber decided to steal a Supreme Court seat. Again, such a theft never, ever has happened in the history of our Nation. There have been a substantial num-ber of seats that have come open dur-ing an election year—16. There have been a substantial number of individ-uals who were confirmed to those 16

seats, and there were individuals who were turned down by this Chamber. Yet, in all of the 15 cases that preceded the death of Justice Scalia, the Senate acted. The Senate exercised its respon-sibility. But this time was different. This time, the majority said: We intend to pack the Court of the United States of America—not by adding seats to it; that would not work under a Demo-cratic President who could then nomi-nate more individuals—to pack the Court by taking a seat, failing to exer-cise the responsibility that each of us has under our oath of office of advice and consent, and send it in a time cap-sule into the next administration, hop-ing that time capsule would be opened by a conservative President who would nominate someone who was very con-servative, indeed, to create a 5-to-4 bias. What was that bias the majority was looking for? It was not a bias to-ward ‘‘we the people’’; it was a bias to-ward the powerful and the privileged. If you take a look at our Constitu-tion, that initial opening of our Con-stitution, it does not say ‘‘we the privi-leged’’ and ‘‘we the powerful.’’ It lays out a vision of a form of government with checks and balances to be de-signed to function of, by, and for the people. The majority was afraid that Merrick Garland would be just that kind of judge, one who would call the balls and strikes under the Constitu-tion in support of the constitutional vi-sion of ‘‘we the people.’’ They did not want a judge who would call the balls and strikes under our Constitution; they wanted someone who would find a way to twist a case in favor of the priv-ileged and the powerful. Tonight, I will lay out a lot of how they knew that was important both from the perspective of the decisions of the 5-to-4 Court that preceded the death of Justice Scalia and also Merrick Garland’s writings and deci-sions, who found every opportunity to take a case and find some word, find some phrase, find some idea—‘‘to oper-ate is not to operate,’’ ‘‘to drive is not to drive,’’ which is just language from one case—in order to find some way to find in favor of the powerful over the people. Merrick Garland’s nomination lasted 293 days. That is the longest time in Supreme Court history. Now I am going to turn and go through the election-year vacancies be-cause I do not want folks to take my word for the case that the Senate has always done its job. For more than 200 years, it has done its job—until now. Let’s take a look at those vacancies. There were a couple of cases—three cases in which there was an election- year nominee and the vacancy occurred after the general election. This hap-pened when President Adams was in of-fice, when President Grant was in of-fice, and when President Hayes was in office. So there was very little time left in the Presidents’ terms. In a num-ber of these cases—all three—the Presi-dent did not change office until March of the following year, but the Senate did not even need those extra 2 months that it had before we amended the Con-stitution. President Adams nominated John Jay. He nominated him 3 days after the vacancy occurred in the year 1800, and the Senate confirmed the nominee. Here is an interesting twist: The nomi-nee then declined the position. You do not see that very often in the history of the Supreme Court. Then you go to 1872 when President Grant was President. He had a vacancy occur on November 28, which was just a month before the end of the year and a few months before the Presidency would turn over. It was following the election. He nominated Ward Hunt. The Senate acted in a little more than a week, and they confirmed him. They vetted him. They exercised their advice and consent responsibility, and they said: Yes, this individual is appropriate to serve on the Court. Then there was President Hayes. A vacancy occurred in December 1880, and he nominated William Woods. Here we have a nominee being put forward very shortly afterwards and confirmed. Those were the first three. That is the set of cases in which the vacancies occurred after the November elections in election years. Let’s look at the next set of vacan-cies. In these cases, the vacancy oc-curred before the elections, but the nominees were not nominated by the Presidents until after the elections. So, again, the Senate had a relatively short period of time in which to act. We have the August 25 vacancy of 1828 with President Adams. He nomi-nated quite a few months later—almost 4 months later—John Crittenden. In this case, the Senate acted, but they acted to table the nomination, so he was turned down. Then we have President Buchanan in 1861, who nominated Jeremiah Black. This is a little strange to us because we think of the Presidency as changing in January, but the Presidency did not change until March. The nomination occurred in February, and the motion to proceed was rejected by the entire body. So that nominee was rejected. Then we turn to President Lincoln. The vacancy occurred in the month preceding the election. President Lin-coln nominated Salmon Chase just after the election, and the Senate said: There is plenty of time. We will review that. And he was confirmed. Then we can turn to Eisenhower. Once again, the vacancy occurred in the month before the election, just 3 weeks before the election. Eisenhower didn’t put a nomination to the Senate until January, but the Senate said: We have a responsibility of advice and con-sent. We will review it, we will vet the nominee, and we will vote. And they voted to confirm. That is the second set of nomina-tions. Those are 7 of the 16 nomina-tions, so there are still 9 to go. Let’s take a look at those. In this case, the Senate had more time to act. The vacancy occurred be-fore the general election. The nomina-tion occurred before the general elec-tion. Before I go through them, let me just note that of these nine, the Senate acted to confirm in 1804, to table in 1844, to table in 1852, to confirm in 1888, to confirm in 1892, to confirm in 1916, to confirm again 6 months later—still before the election; two in the same year—and then finally, in 1932, the Sen-ate confirmed a nomination made in February. On February 15, the Senate acted. Of these nine individuals, we have six who were confirmed and two were ta-bled. But I have left one out. There is one more nomination that occurred in an election year—just one more—and that happened last year. President Obama—we go back to Antonin Scalia dying on February 13 and Merrick Gar-land being nominated on March 16. So of those 16 we have looked at, the pre-vious 15, the Senate acted each and every time because they had taken an oath of office to uphold the Constitu-tion that has a requirement that the Senate participate in advice and con-sent. But this time, no action. No ac-tion. No committee hearing, not a set of committee hearings, not even one. No vote in committee. No effort or ac-ceptance of moving the nomination to the committee of the whole, which would be here on the Senate floor. For the first time in U.S. history, the Sen-ate stole a seat from one President in order to pack the Court. I have to tell my colleagues that it isn’t just a clever new tactic. It isn’t just an excessive exercise of partisan-ship. This is a crime against our Con-stitution and the responsibilities of this body. This effort to pack the Court is a major assault on the integrity of the Court. For every 5-to-4 decision that we see in the future, everybody is going to look and say: Five-four. How would that be different? And it will always be different if the stolen seat and the judge who fills it is on the right side because that side would otherwise have lost. The tie goes to the lower court’s decision. So what this does is not only change the trajectory of our Constitution from one where it is designed for ‘‘we the people’’ to a different vision of govern-ment by and for the people—it doesn’t just change that trajectory, but it draws into question everything the Court does in the future. Wouldn’t it have been incredible if President Trump’s nominee—knowing the constitutional responsibility for the Senate to act, knowing that the Senate seat had been stolen from a pre-vious President, knowing that it would bias all the outcomes of the Court in the future—had stood up and said ‘‘I will not participate in this crime against the Constitution’’ and declined the nomination? Wouldn’t that have been an act of integrity? Well, we

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES2224 April 4, 2017 
didn’t get that act of integrity from President Trump’s nominee, so here we are today, on the first day of the Sen-ate deliberation on this nominee, and just moments ago was the first time in U.S. history that the majority has ex-ercised a petition to close debate on the first day of a Senate debate on a Supreme Court Justice. Why is the ma-jority in such a rush? Why is the Sen-ate majority determined to push this through so quickly, in contravention of the tradition of due deliberation on this floor? I know that if the circumstances were reversed and the Democrats had participated in stealing a seat from a Republican President, my colleagues would be screaming on this floor, and they would be fully justified. I am proud that my colleagues on this side of the aisle have never participated in such an assault on our Constitution or a failure to exercise our responsibil-ities under our oath of office or a theft of a Supreme Court seat or an effort to pack the Court, but if we had, my col-leagues across the aisle would abso-lutely be standing and saying what I am saying tonight—that this is wrong, this is destructive, this is damaging, and we should stop and rethink this. There is really only one nominee who would be a legitimate nominee for President Trump to make—only one way to heal this massive wound, this massive tear and rip in the heart of our Constitution, this massive failure of this Senate body to do its job. There is only one way to heal that, and that is for President Trump to nominate Merrick Garland and for him to get that committee hearing, for him to get that committee vote, for him to get that deliberation here on the floor. Maybe he would be approved and maybe he wouldn’t, because that is what we see every time the Senate has acted. It has not always been to con-firm a nominee, but it has acted and deliberated and voted and decided, as the Constitution calls upon it to do. That would be a healing of the wound. It would be a healing of the wound if the Senators were to vote the same way they would have voted last year had there been a completely legiti-mate, ordinary consideration. Then we could go forward without this damage. So I call upon my colleagues, who I know have—each and every one of them—considered that it is their re-sponsibility to build up and strengthen our institutions of government, not to tear them down. Therefore, I call upon them to reverse this deed before the dark act is completed of stealing a seat and packing the Court. I wish to turn to consider another piece of this puzzle. If the seat had not been stolen and we were simply consid-ering President Trump’s nominee under ordinary circumstances, what would we find? We would find a far- rightwing judge completely outside of the mainstream. Why is it that throughout its history, this body has honored the rule of hav-ing a supermajority needed to close de-bate on a Supreme Court Justice? It has been to send a message to the President that you must nominate someone who is in the judicial main-stream, not way out in one direction or another, with bizarre findings that would undermine the integrity of the Court, not a pattern of attempting to twist the law so that we the people lose and we the powerful win time after time after time—no, someone in the middle of the judicial mainstream. Well, that is certainly where Merrick Garland was, but that is not where Neil Gorsuch is. He is a lifelong conserv-ative activist, rewriting the law to make it something that was never in-tended to be. A Washington Post anal-ysis of his decisions that have been considered by the Supreme Court found that he would be, by far, the most con-servative member of the Court—not where Scalia was, not where Justice Thomas is, not where Justice Alito is; he would be the most conservative member of the Court, to the right of Justices Alito, Thomas, and Scalia. Quote: 
The magnitude of the gap between Gorsuch and Thomas is roughly the same as the gap between Justice Sotomayor and Justice Ken-nedy. In fact, our results suggest that Gorsuch and Scalia would be as far apart as Justice Breyer and Justice Roberts. 
That is the Washington Post. It is a pretty big gap, way to the right. Let’s take a look at some of the cases that lead to this conclusion. There is a case known simply as the frozen truck-er case. Alphonse Maddin, the trucker, was fired for refusing to freeze to death. After waiting more than 3 hours with a disabled trailer on the side of the road, he unhooked the trailer and he started up the cab and he went to get warm before he could return to meet the repairman for the truck. Now, why couldn’t he just carry the trailer with him? The brakes were frozen. Why was he himself freezing? Because the heater on the truck was broken. He fell asleep for some hours, woke up, and his body was numb. He became concerned about his life, so he unhooked the trail-er, went to get warm, and came back to meet the repairman. The Labor Department determined that under the Surface Transportation Assistance Act, he was wrongly fired because that act is designed to say that if you refuse to operate a truck in a fashion that is unsafe for you, the driv-er, or unsafe for others, you can’t be fired for that. Safety comes first. The whole message of the act: Safety comes first. But in this case, Neil Gorsuch dissented. He wasn’t writing the major-ity opinion. He went out of his way to write the minority opinion. The Tenth Circuit upheld the fact that he was correctly operating the truck, leaving the trailer behind. You could ask, Was he operating the full truck or part of the truck? The point is that the Tenth Circuit said yes; the fir-ing was wrong. They upheld the Labor Department under the surface trans-portation act, and said: He did exactly what the act had intended. You have to restore his job. The Tenth Circuit said yes, absolutely. But Judge Gorsuch went out of his way to write a dissent, saying no. It is completely taking words out of context and twisting them. I encourage others to read it for themselves because it is truly a bizarre opinion, an effort to find a way—some way, some path—to find for the com-pany instead of the trucker, who was protected by the laws written and passed in this Chamber and the House and signed by the President. That is how far out of common sense and the-ory of the law Neil Gorsuch is. Let’s turn to a case often referred to as the autism case, Thompson R2–J School District v. Luke P. This case says a great deal because in this case Judge Gorsuch tried to rewrite a law referred to as the IDEA law—Individ-uals with Disabilities Education Act— to effectively invalidate the law. The law written here was to ensure that in-dividuals with disabilities were pro-vided an education by the school dis-trict, not babysitting but an education. Neil Gorsuch rewrote that law to say that babysitting is OK. Despite years of special education in a public school, Luke P. wasn’t show-ing any progress at home. His parents enrolled him in a private school that specializes in autistic children, where he made advances—because the school district was only babysitting him. They fought to get the school district to reimburse them. Gorsuch ruled in favor of the school district. The stand-ard he put forward was the standard that babysitting is OK, even though the law was written to do the opposite. This decision that Gorsuch wrote is so far out of the mainstream, it is so far out of common sense, it is so con-trary to the law written here in this Chamber that the Supreme Court—yes, our Supreme Court, our eight-member Supreme Court—proceeded to say, 8 to 0: That is absurd and wrong, Neil Gorsuch. And they reversed him. When have we had a nominee re-versed 8 to 0? When have we had cases like the frozen trucker case and the au-tistic child case, where he went to great lengths to find for the powerful over the individual? We can turn to the Utah en banc re-quest in a case called Planned Parent-hood Association of Utah v. Herbert. ‘‘En banc’’ means that the entire bench hears a case. Neil Gorsuch was such an activist, so committed to undermining an organization—Planned Parent-hood—that he took the extreme step of initiating, himself, an en banc review of a decision to block a Utah defunding effort. Governor Herbert of that State had used the cover of false and mis-leading videos to strip Utah’s clinics of their funding. The Governor later made clear in testimony that he was in fact punishing Planned Parenthood for its constitutionally protected advocacy and services and that the organization had not done anything wrong.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2225 April 4, 2017 
The Tenth Circuit granted a prelimi-nary injunction against Utah for vio-lating the organization’s—Planned Parenthood’s—constitutional rights. The Tenth Circuit decided this, but Neil Gorsuch—ever the activist judge, rewriting law to make it say the oppo-site of what was intended—sought to have a review by the entire bench. Let me explain, that is not normal. Other people may call for an en banc review because they don’t like the outcome, but to have a participating judge on the Tenth Circuit initiate it is unusual. It is a message to the world: Everyone, pay attention to me. I am an activist, far-right judge, and if you like that— someone who is going to find for the powerful and the privileged over ordi-nary people—pay attention. That is who I am. It is kind of like trying out for a future Supreme Court opening. Gorsuch’s entire adult life has been a mission to revoke a lot of the norms we have come to embrace in our pursuit of the transitions in our society and in our government as we pursue that con-stitutional vision of equality under the law, protections to vulnerable popu-lations, to workers and to kids and to women and to minorities. But Neil Gorsuch doesn’t like that arc of seek-ing to provide the protections our con-stitutional vision laid out. As far back as college, he was an ideological war-rior who championed a severely reac-tionary worldview. In a conservative newspaper article, he characterized efforts to fight racism as ‘‘more a demand for the overthrow of American society than a forum for the peaceable and rational discussion of these people and events.’’ That is a very strange way to characterize ef-forts to fight racism. Racism, discrimi-nation, is to slam the door of oppor-tunity on American citizens because of their gender, because of their race, be-cause of their ethnicity, because of their sexual identity—slam the door and disrupt that opportunity for each and every citizen to be treated equally under the law. He also used the opportunity to advo-cate for social inequality, saying that ‘‘men . . . of different abilities and tal-ents to distinguish themselves as they wish, without devaluing their innate human worth as members of society,’’ and arguing that a responsible system required a governing class of men of ex-ceptional political ability to make the big decisions for society. Well, there is not much equality and opportunity in that statement. As a judge, in case after case, he finds expansive rights for corporations at the expense of their employees, con-sumers, and the public interest. We have talked about the frozen trucker case and the autistic child case. There is also the electrocuted mine construc-tion worker case. A worker started at a project a week after it begun and wasn’t trained on how this should be done. It was a training that was really required because of the highly dan-gerous circumstances. When you are operating equipment near power lines, that is just a setting that everyone in the construction industry knows is ex-traordinarily dangerous. If you connect that equipment to the power line, per-haps somebody has their hand on the side of the equipment, and the next thing you know, they are electrocuted. The worker mistakenly brought a piece of equipment too close to that over-head power line, and it was the worker himself who was electrocuted and killed. The Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission fined the employer for not properly training the worker under these dangerous cir-cumstances. The Tenth Circuit took a look at it and said: Yes, the company failed to do the proper training, and the result was that someone lost their life. But Judge Gorsuch dissented. He said that there was no evidence the company had been negligent. Really? Failure to train in a highly dangerous situation that results in loss of life— there is no problem there. Why should we require companies to train people in dangerous circumstances? Again, there was a complete lack of common sense, a determination to overturn what a re-view board had found, what the circuit court had found. We can turn to the Hobby Lobby case. In this case, Neil Gorsuch found that closely held, for-profit corpora-tions have the right to choose the con-traception coverage, or lack thereof, for their employees if doing so con-flicted with the corporation’s religious beliefs. Now, we didn’t actually have corporations—in the sense that we have them now—when our Nation was founded. There were some charters, but not the modern corporation in the sense that we have. Yet Neil Gorsuch said: We will just give this corporation personhood, and we will let the cor-poration exercise religious beliefs that overrule the religious beliefs of the in-dividuals. But it was the individuals the Constitution was written to defend. It was the individuals’ religious beliefs the Constitution and the Bill of Rights were laid out to protect—not a cor-poration. But in a never-ending quest to find for the corporation, to find for the powerful, to find for the privileged, Neil Gorsuch twisted the law, found that path, and laid it out. In writing a brief as a lawyer in 2005, Neil Gorsuch urged the court to ignore the statutory and legislative history of the Securities Exchange Act, advo-cating that the court limit the ability of those defrauded by corporations to band together to seek redress. This really goes to the difference between ‘‘we the people’’ and ‘‘we the power-ful.’’ We have a nominee before us right now who doesn’t like the idea of indi-viduals being able to operate with a class action suit against the predatory actions of a powerful corporation. In an article about the case, he launched into an attack on the lawyers for providing the ability for individuals to challenge the very powerful corporation, and he said these are frivolous claims—frivo-lous claims—that take an enormous toll on the economy. They put a burden on every public corporation in Amer-ica. I will quote: ‘‘frivolous claims that impose an enormous toll on the econ-omy, affecting virtually every public corporation in America at one time or another and costing business billions of dollars in settlements every year.’’ He didn’t like this burden on corporations to respond when they were challenged for predatory practices. Often, the transactions between a company and an individual are quite small. Maybe they involve a monthly fee to access telecommunications serv-ices. Maybe they involve a purchase of a single consumer item that costs $50. But the corporation misrepresented what that item was or didn’t disclose that it had dangerous paint on it or some other feature. The only way that ordinary people, ‘‘we the people,’’ can challenge the predatory practice of a powerful corporation is to put their cases together in a class action suit so that everybody—the thousands of peo-ple who bought that $50 item—can say: You are doing something wrong. You are selling something dangerous and not telling us. You are selling some-thing our children will choke on and not telling us. You are defrauding us in any of a whole series of possibilities. Perhaps it is in stock cases or other fi-nancial transactions. Perhaps it is the way mortgages are constructed. But the individual couldn’t possibly take on the powerful companies’ roomful of top-notch lawyers to reclaim that $50 or that small modest sum, so a class action is the tool through which the people, ‘‘we the people,’’ proceed to take on the powerful, and Neil Gorsuch doesn’t like that. He doesn’t like workers having the chance to confront corporations on the issues of sexual harassment. In Pinkerton v. Colorado Department of Transportation, Judge Gorsuch joined an opinion discounting Pinker-ton’s evidence of discrimination and concluding that Pinkerton’s perform-ance—not discrimination—resulted in her termination. Judge Gorsuch dis-sented from an opinion—by its very na-ture saying dissent—where the major-ity found a different path, holding that Pinkerton provided ample evidence that she was regularly outperforming her male colleagues yet was treated less favorably than them. The list goes on and on—removing Federal Govern-ment protections in a variety of cases. But there is a third big problem with the fact that we are here tonight con-sidering this nomination. The first big problem was that the seat was stolen by the Republican majority. That is the first time a theft like that has hap-pened in the history of our Nation in an effort to pack the Court. That is a big deal. The second is that Trump nominated somebody completely out-side the judicial mainstream. The third is something that should give every American pause, and that is that at this very moment, investigations are taking place into the conversations, into the meetings between the Trump campaign and the Russians. Now, we know it is very public that the Russians conspired to affect the outcome of our Presidential election. We know the tactics they used. They wrote false news stories. They pro-ceeded to have a building with hun-dreds—I am told a thousand people in a

building—doing social media commen-tating to try to have people in America see those comments and go: Oh, my goodness, isn’t that Democratic nomi-nee terrible? Look at what happened. It was an effort to give, in other words, some sort of validation to the false news stories that they were creating and to spread those false news stories via social media. We know that Russia used a series of bots—basically, computers—around the world designed to reply automatically on social media and Facebook and to do so in order to make it look like there were more than a thousand—mil-lions of people out there—commenting on how terrible the Democratic nomi-nee was. So they amplified this message with the goal of causing the algorithms used by companies like Facebook—affecting those algorithms so Facebook would start streaming the false news on their Facebook site. You see that and go: Oh, my goodness, it must be true; it is on Facebook. That was the core strategy the Russians used. I am not sharing with you anything that is classified. I am also on the In-telligence Committee. All of this is in the public realm, the FBI is inves-tigating not whether all that took place—they continue to look to see what else there is and the details of that—but whether there was coordina-tion or collusion with the Trump cam-paign in how they did this. Let’s be clear. The investigation is not concluded. We don’t know the an-swer. We don’t know if the Trump cam-paign coordinated with the Russians. But let’s also be clear about this: Any-one on that campaign who collaborated with the Russians to affect the out-come of the U.S. elections has com-mitted a treasonous act. So we have this cloud of this inves-tigation over us right now. We find out in a few weeks if there were treasonous acts that completely delegitimize the election that put Donald Trump in the Oval Office. Will we find that? We don’t know. We don’t know the answer to that. What we do know is that we have a risk of being in a situation where a swing vote on the Supreme Court is coming from a team that is being in-vestigated. Let’s get to the bottom of that and, therefore, know whether there is an issue of illegitimacy before we complete this conversation about filling this Supreme Court seat. There is an enormous amount of evi-dence that the Trump campaign was fa-miliar with the efforts of a foreign power to alter the outcome of the elec-tion. The names have come up with the press. Paul Manafort, Michael Flynn, Roger Stone, and other figures in the Trump orbit are under scrutiny for that—several of them. The communica-tions have been articulated where and how, and that cloud is very real. We had the unusual event a week ago Monday in which the Director of the FBI came here to Capitol Hill to talk to the House and to say that it is not normal to confirm that our investiga-tions are under way but that he thought, under this circumstance, it was appropriate that he do so. So those are the three big issues that we are facing. It is why every Senator who values this institution, each Sen-ator who has pondered their responsi-bility under advice and consent and the theft of the Supreme Court seat last year recognizes that the administra-tion is under a big cloud and that cloud has not been resolved in terms of the legitimacy of the election or whether there was collusion with a foreign power. I said that if there was collusion, it was a traitorous act. Here is why. At-tacking the integrity of our elections, as Russia did, is an act of war on the United States of America. It is attack-ing the fundamental institutions of our democracy, of our democratic Repub-lic. We must never let this happen again. We must work with other demo-cratic republics to make sure that Rus-sia isn’t able to do it in other coun-tries, which we know they are attempt-ing to do in other elections. But we should absolutely get to the bottom of it before this Chamber takes a vote on whether to close this debate or before it takes a vote on whether to confirm the Justice. So that is the very broad presen-tation of the three big reasons we should pull the plug on this nomina-tion or at least put it in deep freeze until such a time as the Russia inves-tigation is completed. And we have al-ready considered Merrick Garland. That is what we should do. I am going to spend considerable time going into more detail about these three issues because in my time in the Senate, there has not been an issue that has had such grave con-sequences for the integrity of our Na-tion, the integrity of our Senate, the integrity of the Supreme Court, and, quite frankly, the integrity of the Presidency, as well. It affects all three branches because this crime of stealing a seat couldn’t be completed without the direct involvement of the executive branch’s nominating Neil Gorsuch. So I will go back over each of these in much greater detail. I was pondering why I feel so strong-ly about this—apart from the reasons I have already laid out—and it is that for generations to come, this Chamber will be compromised. For generations to come, the Supreme Court will be compromised. If we act together, if we hit the pause button, perhaps we can prevent that. So I feel more compelled to be here, to raise my voice, and to call for those who care about our Nation to stop the insanity of this judicial nomination discussion here on the floor of the Sen-ate. That is why I am going to go on for some time exploring this. I think back to when I came here in 2009. When I came to the Senate, my memories were of the Senate from the 1970’s and 1980’s, which now makes me really an old guy. I was able to come here as a 19-year-old, as an intern for Senator Hatfield. At that point in time, there wasn’t a camera on the floor of the Senate and there wasn’t email, and it wasn’t easy to get a docu-ment across Capitol Hill in a short time. Interns were put to work running paperwork around the Hill. But I will tell you that the institution was in a very different place. So I came here. I was the third of three interns to arrive that summer of 1976, our bicentennial summer. The most recent intern is put to work open-ing the mail each morning. So I came in early. We had about 100 letters in envelopes. You would run them through a machine that sliced the envelopes opened. You would stack up all the letters, start going through them, and say: This one is on this topic, and this goes to this legislative correspondent. This one is on this topic, and it goes to that legislative correspondent. I think there were three or four in the office of Senator Hat-field. You would go through those 100 letters and put them on the desk of the legislative correspondent. Those correspondents had the newly developed electronic memory type-writers. They had written paragraphs to respond to different topics, and they would mark on the letter the different paragraphs that should go here. This is the introductory paragraph we will use. We need to address this issue in this letter and use paragraph 56 from the memory bank, and we use number 84 to address another issue. Then, those letters, all marked up, would go to the typing team that would run those memory typewriters, and get responses out before the day was over. I saw a lot of it that summer. It was possible to actually get mail to come directly in because we didn’t worry about white powder being inside the envelopes. Now if you write an actual physical letter to a Senator in this Chamber, it goes through a warehouse. It goes through a warehouse where they have to examine it and check it for poisons before it can be delivered to Capitol Hill. It will take weeks. People know-ing this often choose to write by email. So a lot of the mail—most of the mail—comes in electronically. But that summer, one of the legisla-tive assistants was leaving for an ex-tended period for a vacation in South America. He was looking to have some-one take over the Tax Reform Act of 1976. I was asked to take over working on that act. So what that involved was that you would look at all the mail that came in on that tax topic. You would research those issues and you would draft responses. Those draft re-sponses would go up and be approved or modified by the legislative director and by the Senator. Then you would make sure those got into the database and people got their questions answered. I learned a lot about taxes that sum-mer of 1976. I must say, when I was

first asked to work on taxes, I was kind of disappointed because I thought: Well, it will be really interesting to work on education; it will be really in-teresting to work on healthcare; it will be really interesting to work on the en-vironment; it will be really interesting to work on jobs policy. Taxes? Not so interesting. So the next few days, as I threw my-self into responding, drafting responses to these issues being raised in letters, I was transformed in my opinion about working on tax issues because the taxes affect everything in our body of law. Taxes have environmental con-sequences, or they may be an environ-mental incentive, such as the provi-sions we have in the Tax Code to en-courage people to insulate their homes or to drive a non-fossil-fuel burning car. They affect health, such as the provisions we have in the Tax Code that proceed to say that if your em-ployer provides health insurance, it is not considered taxable income. It af-fects job incentives. It affects every-thing. There were farmers writing in about tax issues that were being raised. There were teachers writing in. The teachers were concerned that there was a home office deduction that was on the chopping block. What this means is if you used a bedroom in your home or a study in your home as your office to work as an elementary teacher or a high school teacher, you could deduct the cost or the value of that portion of your house as a work expense. Well, often, when there is an oppor-tunity like that, some people expand the definition of the office to a point in which it is ridiculous, and there were some individuals who were saying: Well, now my entire home is my office. I will deduct the entire cost of my home, which was never the intention. But teachers were concerned that, in the course of correcting that, that they might lose the deduction that was a le-gitimate work expense. There are doz-ens and dozens of these things. So the bill happened to come up on the floor of the Senate, in this Chamber right here. Because I was working that bill, I was assigned to come over and follow the debate. I was up in the seats up above. We considered amendment after amendment after amendment. Now, there was no negotiation between the two sides over what amendment would come up next. Once one amendment was finished, there would be a group of Senators try-ing to get the attention of the Pre-siding Officer. Whoever got that atten-tion first, whoever was fastest or loud-est and was called on, their amendment was next. They presented it, and the staff hovered around following it and tried to get a copy of it and tried to analyze it. Then we would run down when the vote was called and meet our respective Senators coming out of those elevators that are just through those doors right there—those beau-tiful double doors of the Senate. I would stand there, and out would come Senator Church, and out would come Senator Goldwater, and out would come Senator Humphrey, and out would come Senator Kennedy and Senator Inouye, and then my Senator could come out. I would say: OK, here is the story. Here is the amendment. Here is what it does. Here is what peo-ple have said about it. He would come in here and vote. That was a very lucky set of cir-cumstances that I had, but it allowed me to sit up in the Chamber and watch this Senate. You did not have a cloture petition on anything—a cloture peti-tion meaning a petition to close de-bate. Now, there was mutual respect. There was a determination of this body to give people a chance to say what they wanted to say, but very rarely did people go on at length, and more rare than that would be a case where a peti-tion was filed to shut down debate. You know, the principle, the idea that originated with our original Sen-ate, was that there is time for everyone to make their views known to each other so we can benefit from their in-sights, so that we can benefit from their life experience, and then we can make the decision. So it was a mutual courtesy among Senators at the very start of our democratic Republic. I saw that courtesy here on the floor as an intern 41 years ago. What a difference it is today, where today, for the first time in U.S. his-tory, the majority filed a petition to shut down debate on the first day of a debate over a U.S. Supreme Court seat, under circumstances that are more complex and more disturbing than vir-tually any circumstances we have seen in more than 200 years over the nomi-nation of a Supreme Court justice. It is the first time in U.S. history that a nominee in an election year was not accorded any consideration, the first time a seat was stolen, perhaps the first time that a cloud hung over a nominating President—President Trump and his team—because of the way the campaign was conducted and the possible collaboration with Rus-sians. Certainly, it one of the first times. Since the analysts have found that the views of Neil Gorsuch are to the ex-traordinary far right, that too adds a certain change from the tradition of the supermajority of the President nominating from the judicial main-stream. So we have these complex sets of cir-cumstances that should be thoroughly vetted. This should be a situation where no Member of this Chamber would even think about filing a peti-tion to close debate and would not even consider the possibility of trying to cut off debate. Debate has gone on for Supreme Court folks for weeks and weeks and weeks without a petition being filed. Sometimes, that nominee was con-firmed and sometimes the nomination was withdrawn, and in the course of it, the American people learned a great deal, and they were riveted to that con-versation. But this time, the majority said that 200 years of history—that 200 years of developed comity here in the Senate Chamber, the traditions that were still here when I was an intern 4 decades ago—we are going to wipe that away. Well, that is a great concern. After I was here for a summer, I was very in-trigued by the beauty of what we do on Capitol Hill, the profoundness of what we do on Capitol Hill. We can make a policy that can de-stroy home ownership for literally mil-lions of families, or we can make a pol-icy that creates the opportunity of fair home ownership for millions of fami-lies. That is the power of the discus-sions that take place on this floor of the Senate, of this Chamber, and the Chamber on the other side of Capitol Hill. So, during that summer, I was wres-tling with a question, and that ques-tion was: My talents are in math and science. But is there a way to pursue a career dedicated to making the world a better place? Is there a way to actually pursue public policy as a career? I didn’t know the answer to that ques-tion. I went back to college for 1 tri-mester out in California. At the end of that trimester, Presi-dent Carter was going to be inaugu-rated in January of 1977. I thought: You know, it will be very interesting to see what a new President does. Let’s see what policies he puts forward, how he builds his Executive team, how he delivers his ideas to Capitol Hill, how he works with Capitol Hill. So in January, I took a Greyhound bus across the Nation. I arrived here and proceeded to work on a variety of internships while also waiting tables and washing dishes. I worked as a hotel desk clerk up on 14th Street on Thom-as Circle. I worked washing dishes and waiting tables for a Lums Restaurant, which is kind of a sit-down hamburger joint. But it was all so I could be here and see the magic of public policy and the work done that could affect millions of lives here in this Chamber, the work done on the far side of Capitol Hill that would affect millions of families—to the better or to the worse. In the course of that year, I interned for a group called New Directions. It was an environmental nonprofit working on the Law of the Sea. There was a question on the outside of our territorial boundaries: Will the nations cooperate so that we don’t de-stroy the resources in the inter-national space of the oceans? How far should our national space extend? How do we write those rules so that our Continental Shelf is clearly under our control? These are the sorts of ques-tions considered. That treaty, the Law of the Sea Treaty, has never made it here to Capitol Hill. Every time there is a new Presidency coming in, some-one says: Hey, remember that treaty

from four decades ago? It might really strengthen U.S. control of our offshore areas, and maybe we should bring it up for discussion. It still hasn’t been dis-cussed here. But I also went door to door for a group called Virginia Consumer Con-gress. They were working to create at-tention to consumer protection issues in the State capitol in Virginia. They would go door to door. They would have a team go door to door. You would proceed to explain the issue that you were working on—the bill you were working on, that the organization was working on—and ask ordinary citizens to sign a petition in support of that bill being considered at the State capitol. You would ask: Would you like to support the work of this organization so we can keep doing it? If they made a donation, that helped strengthen the organization. This was the model that became the Public Interest Research Group model, or the PIRG model. Specifically, the issue we were work-ing on as we went door to door was to say: We can save consumers a huge amount of money if we can simply im-plement peak-load pricing. Now, what is peak-load pricing? What it means is that you have a meter so that when there is a huge demand for electricity, it charges a higher price. By so doing, it alerts the consumer: Hey, don’t use electricity now; use it at another time. Now, why would that save consumers millions of dollars? Well, here is why. The electric power company wanted to build a nuclear powerplant to meet just the peak load. So they wanted to build a very, very expensive nuclear power-plant, which they would then charge all the utility customers for, and a lot of utilities—it is kind of written in the law—receive an automatic 8-percent return on whatever they invest. So there is an incentive for them to invest more. The more they invest, the bigger their revenue stream is. That revenue stream is paid for by the citizens who buy electricity. So few could convince the utility, in-stead of building a nuclear powerplant, to put in meters that would tell people: Hey, don’t use your dryer now because it is more expensive, and shift that peak load. Then everybody benefitted. You did not have to have the risk of a nuclear powerplant. At that point we had a lot of con-cerns. We had had a lot of difficulties in some of our plants with near melt-downs. The idea that you could have a radioactive cloud or a China syndrome occur somewhere near a metropolitan area was a very scary thing. So you si-multaneously greatly improved public safety while saving people a huge amount of money. So that is what we were petitioning people for door to door. It was my first introduction to a legislative process that was happening outside the na-tional legislative process. I must say, when you go to door to door, you have so many interesting experiences. You never know what is going to happen when you walk through that door and start to explain to people what you are fighting for and they start sharing their stories. The president of the board of VEPCO, Virginia Electric Power Company—I went to his and his wife’s house. I did not know it was their house at the time—a huge, huge house in suburban Virginia. The wife greeted me. She talked with me about these issues. She said: You know, my husband is presi-dent of the board of VEPCO, but, as to the issues you are raising, I never hear them raising those issues, and these are good points you are making. So I want to buy the Virginia Consumer Congress newsletter. It was a $15 dona-tion. That was the biggest donation at the door I ever had while I was working there. There were many, many other conversations. But the reason I came back to be here for those first 9 months of the Carter administration was to continue to see: How does Capitol Hill work? How do nonprofit advocacy groups work? How does a new administration work? How does the Senate work? The Senate was so near and dear to my heart after the internship with Senator Hatfield. In the course of that year, I came to believe that there was a path to work on public policy. Specifically, I decided to work on third-world economic devel-opment. Part of the reason that I choose that area was that, when I was in high school, I had a chance to be an AFS exchange student in Ghana, West Africa. There were only six exchange students sent to Africa outside of apartheid South Africa. Of those six, five went to cities and one went to a modest town with a fam-ily of very modest means. I was the student who was sent to that very mod-est town to the family of modest means. The experience was such that I was surrounded by people barely able to afford to eat or sometimes not able to afford to eat. My host family was middle class. My host father was a schoolteacher, and my host mother was also a school-teacher. One was in a public school, and one was in a private school. Be-cause of the connection to the public school, my host father, who, if I recall right, had a sixth grade or ninth grade education—that was enough to be a teacher because they didn’t have enough people who were high school graduates or college graduates. He was afforded a government-built house that had three concrete rooms and screens over the windows to keep out the mosquitoes. There was elec-tricity in the house, an outlet. The family had one appliance, and that ap-pliance was an iron to iron clothes. Every night, my host father would take the clothing that had been washed that day and he would iron the cloth-ing. Nobody else could touch that iron because that was an incredibly valued appliance. They had one other thing that was considered a real amazing thing for a family to have, and that was a bicycle. They had a bicycle. I wanted to borrow the bicycle to go outside this town and visit some very tiny villages. My host father was so afraid that I was going to break this bicycle, that I wasn’t going to be careful, that I was going to go through potholes, that I was going to dent the rim, because it was such a val-ued commodity to the family. I decided in college, after my time here in 1976 and 1977, that I would work on economic development overseas be-cause I had seen the families who sur-rounded my host family often earning just a dollar a day and trying to feed a family of six or seven. The children couldn’t go to school because they had to go down to the main street, running through town to try to sell things through the windows. The only way for the family to eat was for every child to be working. (Mr. ROUNDS assumed the Chair.) Well, I tell you this because it is all tied in to how I view the sanctity of this room, this Senate Chamber, be-cause the events that were to transpire unexpectedly brought me back to Cap-itol Hill after graduate school. I pursued that path of working on third-world economic development, and I thought I was going to spend my life overseas. When I graduated from col-lege, I was hired for a job to work for the United Nations in the Philippines. My job was going to be going through-out the region to evaluate U.N. devel-opment projects. What a perfect posi-tion, to be able to be in multiple coun-tries—it would have been in Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam, a whole host of nations—to evaluate projects on the ground, giving reports on what was working and what was not working and why. It was a 2-year post. I was so ex-cited about doing this. It just seemed like all life had come together. I was going to have a job after I got out of college, and I could start repaying those student loans. I felt like I was landing on my feet. I went down to the organization, the nonprofit at my university that would set up these jobs. The individual who ran it said: Jeff, come here. I have a letter for you to read. The letter said: The United Nations has just eliminated the position to evaluate those projects in the Phil-ippines. So suddenly, before I ever got on the plane, my job was gone. I didn’t get to go. Again, I was very worried. Well, what am I going to do after I graduate? I proceeded to go down to Mexico and work in a village with the American Friends Service Committee. Then I went to New York and worked an in-ternship with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. I worked on a variety of international issues. Then I decided to join a friend, and we went and bought the cheapest bus available from California to Costa Rica. We pro-ceeded to go through country after

country—Mexico and Guatemala, Hon-duras. We bypassed El Salvador. We got off the Pan-American Highway because in Salvador, in 1980, people were being pulled off of the buses and shot. The other nations were in turmoil. It was the year after the Sandinista Revolu-tion in Nicaragua. In Guatemala, there was an army group who was going from village to village killing the young men. There was a war between one group and an-other group. There was a lot of chaos there. But we went all the way through to Costa Rica. Then I worked in a vil-lage again on an environmental project. I had a chance to work in India. I expected the whole time that I was going to be going overseas for my life. You never know what door is going to close and what door is going to open. After I got out of graduate school and was ready to go fulfill this vision that I developed back in 1977 when I ex-tended my stay here in DC and was doing these internships, I was at the World Bank. I was hired at the World Bank, but I didn’t want to be at the World Bank for long doing mathe-matical modeling. I was doing the shadow pricing of petroleum products. If that doesn’t sound very inter-esting, well, it kind of is, actually, if you love how numbers can give you a vision of what is going on and how the imports and exports of oil products were right or wrong and expensive. By understanding shadow pricing, you could understand the challenges var-ious developing nations faced. Still, it was working with mathematical for-mulas and data here in DC, and I want-ed to be in the field. So I was preparing to go to southern Africa, where I had not been. In that preparation, I was also applying for a Presidential fellow-ship in foreign relations. One of those openings was at the Office of the Sec-retary of Defense. Each year, the Office of the Sec-retary of Defense would have 5 open-ings for Presidential management fel-lows, and there were 12 finalists for this. They called us in, and they had this big kind of arc of the high-ranking folks, civilian and uniform, from the team of the Secretary of Defense. Then they had a chair in kind of the middle of that arc. I just remember thinking it felt like we were going to be interro-gated, and it was kind of an interroga-tion. This is the first question I was asked: We see here that you interned for Sen-ator Hatfield, and he votes against all of the defense appropriations. You worked for the American Friends Serv-ice Committee. They are an arm of the Quaker Church, and the Quaker Church has a peace testimony. Why would we ever hire you here in the Office of the Secretary of Defense? I thought that was a very good ques-tion. I was kind of surprised that I was a finalist for a position, but I re-sponded that national security is so much broader than simply military money, that it involves an under-standing of culture, an understanding of history, an understanding of eco-nomic dynamics, an understanding of the things that trigger dissent and how it might be responded to, an under-standing of alliances, and that all these things put together enable us to have a foreign policy that is part and parcel of our national security. Well, I probably said a more complex version of that, but that was the gist of it, and they hired me. The reason I took that job rather than heading off to Africa was because at that moment, the biggest threat to the world was nuclear power—not nu-clear power electricity but nuclear weaponry, atom bombs. The fact is that we were concerned that there might be a nuclear war that would de-stroy the planet as we knew it—cer-tainly destroy the Soviet Union and the United States. Since that was the biggest threat to the world, I felt com-pelled to pivot from third-world pov-erty to work on nuclear weapon policy, and I did that through the 1980s, first for the Secretary of Defense and then for Congress, which now completes why I was telling you that story, because that brought me back to be in regular contact with this Senate, with this Chamber, with the folks who work here, who are trying to figure their way through a series of difficult issues involving nuclear weapons. Outside of this Chamber, in the path walking between the Russell Office Building, a curved path, and coming into the outside doors that are outside of these double Senate doors, there is a tree. That tree is known as the peace tree. It is directly connected to the work that was being done in this Chamber on nuclear weapon policy. Senator Hatfield and Senator Ken-nedy were working together. A Repub-lican and a Democrat were working to-gether to try to address the risk of nu-clear weapons. Well, in 1985, there was an intern walking with Senator Hat-field. He liked to walk outside on that curved path back to the Russell Office Building. It is a path on which I have had the chance to walk with him a number of times. He talked about the different trees along the way. I remem-ber in particular his lecture on the ginkgo tree. There are several ginkgo trees out there between here and the Russell Office Building. I was relaying this to a 1985 intern of Senator Hatfield’s named Sean O’Hollaren. Sean said: You know, I had those same walks with Senator Hat-field, and he gave me the same stories about the tree. He was interested in that. Sean O’Hollaren said to Senator Hat-field—Sean O’Hollaren obviously was much quicker to seize the moment. It never even occurred to me. He said: Senator Hatfield, you love these trees so much, why don’t you plant one? Senator Hatfield said: Sean, that will be your intern project. So Sean worked on that. Senator Hatfield wanted to plant a tree that doesn’t fit the Olmsted plan for the landscaping of the Capitol. The problem is that the Olmsteds, who had designed Central Park and Forest Park in Oregon and much of the DC land-scape here on the Capitol grounds, had in mind broadleaf trees, not the type of tree Senator Hatfield wanted to plant. What did he want to plant? There is a very interesting story here because in the Pacific Northwest—of course Or-egon is part of the Pacific Northwest— there used to grow millions and mil-lions of a cousin of the grand sequoia and the coastal redwoods. This cousin was different in that it lost its needles during the winter. It went extinct. It was out-competed by the cedars and the Douglas firs and the regular red-woods and so on and so forth. It went extinct, but its fossils are everywhere in the Northwest. How could Senator Hatfield plant this tree when it had been extinct for millions of years in North America? He could plant it because in the late 1940s, a small grove was found in China of this particular tree—the only place on the planet where it still existed. So he arranged to get one of those trees. He was going to plant it there. At that moment, as they were get-ting ready to plant, his team saw Sen-ator Kennedy’s team and said: Senator Kennedy, you should come out and join Senator Hatfield. They went out by this walkway be-tween here and Russell. Senator Ken-nedy said: In honor of the work we are doing together, this bipartisan work on nuclear weapons, this should be known as the peace tree. They were working on the zero op-tion, the nuclear freeze movement— let’s not add any more nuclear weapons to the world; they are already dan-gerous enough. They did a lot of work on nuclear weapons, and I must say I was reminded of it. When I came here, John Kerry and Dick Lugar—a Republican and a Demo-crat—were working on New START to-gether. They considered that treaty here on the floor of the Senate, but it became much more difficult now than then to have this sort of bipartisanship work. At any rate, please take a walk, if you are here in DC and on the grounds of the Capitol, and take a look at that peace tree. That peace tree is just on the verge of becoming the tallest tree on the grounds. It is now 32 years old. Let’s hope that as it becomes the tall-est tree, it will have kind of a Biblical influence and bring more peace to a world in desperate need of it. We need more of that peace tree in-fluence here in this Chamber. That in-fluence is sorely lacking. The type of cooperation between Democrats and Republicans that existed doesn’t exist today, and we are here at this very mo-ment on a tragic course to destroy the centuries-old tradition of a 60-vote, bi-partisan majority to proceed to ap-prove a nominee to the Supreme Court.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES2230 April 4, 2017 
That tradition ensures that Presidents don’t nominate extremists and hope-fully ensures that the folks who serve will serve the Constitution, the ‘‘We the People’’ Constitution, not some ideological extreme to the right or to the left. So I want to go back to the core premises of why I am here tonight talking to the Chamber, sharing these thoughts with all those who are watch-ing the Chamber, and that is we must recapture the type of cooperation and bipartisanship that made this Chamber able to address the problems facing America. Mahatma Gandhi said that to simply operate by the premise of an ‘‘eye for an eye only . . . [makes] the whole world blind.’’ Well, if we operate on the premise of the Senate that we are never going to work together to solve problems because we are of dif-ferent parties or a different party than the President, and we want to make sure the President doesn’t get any credit for having helped improve a sit-uation, then all of us suffer from the broken existing policies, the dysfunc-tion of existing policies, the poison of the superpartisanship. Let’s go back to the basic premises that we need to address—the three premises. The first is that this seat is a stolen seat—and if we could put up the chart with the nine Justices. Here is the story in a nutshell: 16 times in our history there was an open seat dur-ing an election year, 15 times the Sen-ate acted, 12 of those times they con-firmed the Justice, and 3 of those they rejected the Justice. But the point is, in 15 out of 15 times before Antonin Scalia died and Merrick Garland was nominated by President Obama, the Senate acted. Here are nine of those. These are the nominations that oc-curred, like Merrick Garland’s, in which the vacancy and the nomina-tions occurred before the election. So they are most similar to the situation of Merrick Garland. Then there were another seven under more difficult circumstances where the nomination did not occur until after the election, and the Senate had very little time in which to vet and make a decision, but they did make a decision in each and every case until last year, when the majority said: We will not consider the President’s nominee. We will not hold a hearing, we will not hold a vote, we will discourage folks from even talking to him, and we will not exercise our advice and consent re-sponsibility. That is the first big issue. The second big issue is that the nominee himself is from the extreme right. There is a chart that shows—and we don’t have it with us; maybe we will have it later tonight. There is a chart that shows the distribution of deci-sions, and it has basically two curves with a big kind of bell curve with a big gap in between. So it goes up, it comes down, and it goes up and it comes down, and it reflects the ideological di-vision of the Court from decisions they have made. On this chart the folks ana-lyzing these decisions said: Where would Neil Gorsuch be? Would he be in the ‘‘we the people’’ bell curve of deci-sion making? Would he be in the ‘‘we the privileged and powerful’’ bell curve? They found that not only would he be in the ‘‘we the powerful’’ bell curve, but his position on the curve would be to the far right of the curve. I mentioned earlier the analysis by the Washington Post. This is an indi-vidual who was rated by the profes-sional analysts as being more conserv-ative than anyone who serves on the Court. I went through a series of cases, and I will be going through them again as the night wears on, in which he twisted the law to find for the powerful over the individual time and time and time again. Someone who is way out-side the judicial mainstream and who twists the law to find for the powerful over the people doesn’t belong in the Supreme Court of America. So that is the second big problem. The third big problem is that the President’s team is under investigation for collaborating with the Russians interfering in our November general election. This is a very serious ques-tion. There is a very dark cloud over the legitimacy of the election and therefore the legitimacy of this Presi-dent. If President Trump worked to conspire with the Russians or his team conspired with the Russians at his di-rection or his knowledge, that is trai-torous conduct because the Russians attacked the fundamental institutions of our country. Trying to delegitimize and change the outcome of our election and conspiring with a foreign power to attack the foundation of our Demo-cratic Republic—that is traitorous con-duct. We have to get to the bottom of it, and we shouldn’t be considering on this floor a nominee under that set of circumstances. Let’s complete the in-vestigation, find out what went on, and if the cloud clears, then we can pro-ceed. So those are the three substantial issues for why we should not be here considering this nominee. The stories I was sharing with you about how I first came to the Senate as an intern for Senator Hatfield and then came back to Capitol Hill working for a think tank sponsored by Congress, the Congressional Budget Office—my responsibility was to analyze the im-pacts of various potential strategies in the development and deployment of our strategic triad, our nuclear triad. We have air-delivered and ballistic mis-siles, land-based ballistic missile deliv-ered weapons, and marine weapons— that is the triad. That was my job, to consider the implications of the path we might go to. What were the budg-etary implications, what were the per-formance implications, what were the implications for deterrence or the cir-cumstances that might trigger a nu-clear war. So I was back here on Cap-itol Hill in that capacity. What I saw was a Senate fundamentally different than the one we have today. I was reminded of this when, back in 2013, I was working to bring a bill to the floor called the Employment Non- discrimination Act. This is an act that Senator Ted Kennedy had sponsored, and if I recall right, it was first spon-sored in 1994. Then, 2 years later—I be-lieve it was in 1996—it was considered on the floor of the Senate, and it lost by one vote. It lost 50 to 49. The Sen-ator who was missing, it was believed, would have voted for it, and the Vice President breaking the tie would have voted for it, but people felt, well, it will be back up before the Senate soon enough. The point here is that the vote was a simple majority in that setting, and the filibuster was reserved for very rare circumstances. This happened to be a bill related to ending discrimina-tion for our LGBT community in em-ployment, and anything involving what some may construe as a social issue is one that many people have politicized greatly. This was simply an issue of fairness in employment, but nobody re-quired a simple majority to close de-bate. They reserved the simple major-ity for profound principles. It was so that this body can function because it was primarily a simple-majority orga-nization. When I was covering the Tax Act of 1976, the issues on these amendments came up one after another—what seemed like every hour—were simple- majority votes with a lot of bipartisan cooperation. We have become so polar-ized, we have become so divided, and this nomination and this hearing right now are going to reverberate through the decades to come as the lowest point, the biggest failure of this insti-tution. We do have the power to pre-vent that from happening because we haven’t yet voted on closing debate. Yet we have just a short period of time to set this nomination aside. Set it aside. Tell the President we need to heal this institution and the Court by nominating Merrick Garland. Set it aside because the nominee, Neil Gorsuch, is from the radical rightwing fringe, out of the tradition of having mainstream Justices. Set it aside be-cause there is an enormous cloud over President Trump as to whether he is a legitimate President, given the inves-tigations into the conspiracy with Rus-sia. For all those reasons, set it aside. Also set it aside because never before has a majority leader tried to shut down this debate with a petition to close debate on the very first day. It takes 2 days for that petition to ripen. There are folks who have said that al-most never is a Supreme Court nomi-nee filibustered. Well, it gets a little confusing because what does filibuster mean? Does it mean deliberation at length? In this case, we have had a lot of nominees filibustered because they have been deliberated at length. Does it mean that we vote on a petition to close debate? Well, that really changes the analysis because we have rarely had a petition to close debate on a Su-preme Court nominee, and we have never had a petition to close debate filed on the first day of debate because

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2231 April 4, 2017 
of the mutual respect that all the voices would be heard, and with some-one who was controversial enough for people to want to talk for days and days and days, this body heard them out. The American people heard that conversation and responded to it, and trends developed. People said: Do you know what? No, this person really is suitable. And they were confirmed. Sometimes they were withdrawn by a President. The point is, in rare cases was a petition filed to close debate. Yet here we have for the first time in U.S. history—it just happened a couple hours ago—shutting down the debate as fast as they can. That is the opposite of a deliberative body. When I was back here as an intern, we had that age-old saying about the Senate being the world’s greatest delib-erative body. I saw that body. I saw people here on the floor talking to each other, listening to each other, holding a debate, voting on amendments and immediately going to the next amend-ment. I remember on one occasion—I men-tioned that once an amendment was done, there wasn’t another one nego-tiated between the Democrats and Re-publicans, so there were long periods of silence, the way we operate now. No, it was the next person recognized by the Chair, and the Chair heard a lot of peo-ple at once, probably working to send one amendment to the left side of the Chamber and one to the right side of the Chamber, one to a senior Member, maybe one to a more junior Member, but eventually, because of the expedi-tious consideration, everyone got to have their idea considered and pretty much voted on by a simple majority. How different that is from what is happening right now at this moment in this Chamber when we are at the very peak of pointed partisanship coming from my colleagues across the aisle. They have stolen a seat for the first time in U.S. history. They have pro-ceeded to put it on the floor and, for the first time in history, they have filed immediately a petition to close debate. Every 5-to-4 vote from here on until who knows when—our children’s children—will be looked at, and people will ask: Is this a decision because of the stolen seat? Would this have been a ‘‘we the people’’ decision rather than a ‘‘we the powerful’’ if not for that stolen seat? That is a huge erosion of the le-gitimacy of the Court. Do Members of this Chamber really want to do that kind of profound dam-age? They will do that profound dam-age if the current direction continues over the next couple of days, and that is a place in which I do not want us to be. Therefore, this is kind of my own, personal protest of where we have come, and it is my own request that we change direction. I plan to keep speak-ing for quite a while longer, as long as I am able. That will, hopefully, be, at least, a couple of more hours. I am going to go into more depth about these issues that I have laid out, and I am going to start by going through each piece in a lot more detail. Where do we start? This journey began with Justice Scalia’s death on February 13, which was a little over a year ago. Then it was a month later that the President fulfilled his responsibility under the Constitution and nominated Merrick Garland. There were still 10 months left in the administration at that time. Earlier, I heard the majority leader say that no one has ever filibustered a Supreme Court nominee. That is not quite true. There have been some fili-busters, more or less, if I can find them. Yet what happened last year was a 293-day filibuster of Merrick Garland by my Republican colleagues. It was not just an ordinary filibuster but a special sort of failure to exercise their constitutional responsibility of advice and consent. It was the first time in our history that a nominee was not acted on when the nominee was being considered for a seat that came open during an election year. There are a few of my colleagues who like to say that the former Vice Presi-dent, Joe Biden, gave a speech and said—it was theoretical because there was not an open seat—if a seat comes open in the summer of an election year, maybe we should not consider it until the intensity of the campaign has passed, meaning after the election. We saw earlier, when we put up the chart—and I will put it up again—that there were seats that opened up before an election. On these seats here—these four seats—the vacancies were before the elections. They were in August, May, October, and October. The nomi-nations did not come until after the November elections—in December and February or in December and January. Yet the Senate acted in those situa-tions. No matter how you slice it, 15 times there have been open seats. Some oc-curred after the elections, and the Sen-ate acted on the nominees. Some oc-curred before the elections, but the nominations did not occur until after the elections. The Senate acted in these cases. Then there were another nine cases in which the nominations opened up before the elections. Biden made the simple point that, if the seat opens in the heat of the sum-mer, before the November election, maybe it would make sense to hold off considering the nominee until after the election. That is completely consistent with our history. My colleagues tried to twist it into something else—as an argument that we should not consider a nominee during an election year. Of course, that is not what Biden said at all. It was not even close. Let me tell you, when you have to try to find one sentence from 20 years ago from one of the people who has served in the Senate and when that is the only evidence you can find to back up your case, you are not just on thin ice. You have fallen through the ice and into the pond. Your argument is that weak and that terrible. Whenever you hear my colleagues ask: Didn’t the Vice President, when he was a Senator, suggest a theory that we should not consider a nominee during the heat of the campaign right before an election? Yes, he said you should wait until after the heat of the campaign. It was one sentence, 20 years ago, from one Sen-ator. If your argument is that weak, please try to find some better argu-ment to make. We are not here considering some-thing of small importance. We are here, considering an issue that has profound consequences for the integrity of the Senate because it is the first time in U.S. history that a Supreme Court seat has been stolen. It has a huge impact on the integrity of the Supreme Court because this is a court-packing scheme. If the Court is packed, it delegitimizes its decisions. Let’s not pack the Court. That is why I am here, speaking to-night. On February 13, the very same day that Antonin Scalia passed away, the majority leader came to the floor and released a statement that read, essen-tially: We intend to steal this seat. Here is what Majority Leader M
CCONNELL said: 
The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until after we have a new President. 
He reiterated opposition to any Obama nominee on the day that Presi-dent Obama fulfilled his constitutional responsibility by standing in the Rose Garden and nominating Merrick Gar-land. When our majority leader reiter-ated his opposition, what did he quote? He quoted the one passage that was taken out of context from Biden’s speech from 20 years ago. That was the foundation on which he based a proposition to forgo our re-sponsibility as a Senate to provide ad-vice and consent under the Constitu-tion—one sentence out of context. He turned the meaning on its head of a former Senator from 20 years ago. That is how weak the case was that the ma-jority leader presented for failing to perform our constitutional responsi-bility. That was how weak the case was that he presented for stealing a Su-preme Court seat in a court-packing scheme. He said to give the people a voice. The American people voted overwhelm-ingly for Hillary Clinton. She won by more than 3 million votes. She would have won by a lot more if it were not for voter suppression. We have one party that generally believes in voter empowerment—that the foundation is ‘‘we the people’’ and that part of citi-zenship is to vote. We have one party that has resorted to trying to prevent people from voting—voter suppression, gerrymandering, changing the shape of a district to deprive people of having a voice here in Congress, changing the dates in which early voting can occur so that people have less of an oppor-tunity to vote, changing the locations of precincts, which is where your vot-ing takes place.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES2232 April 4, 2017 
Some of the voter suppression tactics involve things that are just misin-formation—false information—and tell-ing people that the vote has already oc-curred or the location has been moved when it has not or that the votes are going to close earlier than they are ac-tually scheduled to close—or a whole host of things. The majority leader said to give the people a voice. The people voted over-whelmingly for Hillary Clinton. So it would follow that the majority leader would come to this floor and say: The people voted overwhelmingly, by 3 mil-lion votes, and it would have been a lot more. So we will now consider Merrick Garland because he was the nominee from a Democratic President—the seat he stole. The people have spoken. The majority has said that we do not want the Republican, that we want the Dem-ocrat. So we will go ahead and hear the Democratic nominee, and we will vet and vote on Merrick Garland. But it is a funny thing in that that did not happen because the goal was not to give people a voice. The goal was to steal the seat and deliver it to a Re-publican President who would nomi-nate someone from the extreme right and pack the Court, undermining ‘‘we the people’’ in favor of ‘‘we the power-ful and the privileged.’’ The Democrats did not politicize the Court. The Republicans politicized the Court. The American people did have a voice in Garland’s nomination. They had a voice by their voting twice for President Obama. Throughout our en-tire history, the Senate has considered the nominee from the President in power, when the vacancy occurs—even when it is an election year—because that is what the Constitution tells us to do—not to steal the seat, not to pack the Court. This politicization, this gamesman-ship, this hypocrisy is so extreme and so dangerous. I heard that some of my colleagues were asked if they would want their election year rule to apply to President Trump—that he could not fill a seat that would come open in the fourth year of his Presidency. That was the principle they advocated for last year. Their answer was no because there was no principle to the position. It was a warfare tactic of partisanship to pack the Court. It was the end justi-fies the means even if the means vio-lates the core premise of the Constitu-tion and does deep damage to the Sen-ate and does deep damage to the Court. Just this past Sunday, while speak-ing to Chuck Todd on ‘‘Meet the Press,’’ the majority leader began to walk back his past statements that a Supreme Court vacancy should not be filled in an election year. Todd asked: 
Should that be the policy going forward? Are you prepared to pass a resolution that says: In election years, any Supreme Court vacancy will not be filled, and let it be a sense of the Senate resolution that no Su-preme Court nominations will be considered in an even numbered year? 
The majority leader responded: That is an absurd question. 
Why is it an absurd question given that it is the principle that election year nominations should go to the next President? I will tell you why it is ab-surd. It is absurd because it is contrary to the Constitution. M
ITCH MCCONNELL , the majority leader—my majority leader, the major-ity leader of the Senate, the top person in charge—was right when he said it was absurd because, of course, we should not abandon our constitutional responsibilities. It is an absurd argu-ment to make today, and it was an ab-surd argument when he made it last year. If it were only absurd and not deeply damaging, then we could all perhaps not be so deeply, deeply con-cerned about the situation. Merrick Garland’s record. Judge Gar-land had more Federal judiciary expe-rience than any Supreme Court nomi-nee in our Nation’s history. So the nominee put forward by President Obama had more Federal judiciary ex-perience than any nominee in our Na-tion’s history. He graduated summa cum laude and valedictorian from Har-vard College. After graduating, he clerked for Judge Henry J. Friendly in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Cir-cuit. He clerked for Justice William Brennan, Jr., in the U.S. Supreme Court. He was in private practice at Arnold & Porter, focusing on litigation and pro bono representation of dis-advantaged Americans. He left his partnership for a low-level prosecutor position in the administration of George H.W. Bush. In 1993, Merrick Garland went to the Justice Department as Deputy Assist-ant Attorney General in the criminal division, and that is where he oversaw prosecutions in the Oklahoma City bombing, helping bring Timothy McVeigh to justice. He helped oversee prosecutions in the case against Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber, and the Olympics bombing committed by Eric Robert Rudolph that killed 1 person and injured 111. He made a name for himself in these cases by being a strictly by-the-book prosecutor. He insisted on obtaining subpoenas, even when companies vol-unteered to hand over evidence. He in-sisted on keeping victims and relatives informed as the cases developed. He served for 19 years on the DC Circuit Court. That is a lot of experience. And all that happened before he was nominated by President Bill Clinton in 1995 for the DC Circuit Court. He received a confirmation hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee in December of that year, but Repub-licans did not schedule a floor vote on his confirmation because of a dispute over whether to fill the seat. So Presi-dent Clinton renominated Merrick Gar-land for the circuit court on January 7, 1997, and he was confirmed on the Sen-ate floor by a vote of 76 to 23 that year, in March. At the time of the consideration of Merrick Garland on the floor, my col-league from Utah, Senator HATCH , had very flattering things to say about Merrick Garland. He said: 
To my knowledge, no one, absolutely no one, disputes the following: Merrick B. Gar-land is highly qualified to sit on the D.C. cir-cuit. His intelligence and his scholarship cannot be questioned. 
He continued: 
I do not think there is a legitimate argu-ment against Mr. Garland’s nomination, and I hope our colleagues will vote to confirm him today. 
Then he said: 
In all honesty, I would like to see one per-son come to this floor and say one reason why Merrick Garland doesn’t deserve this position. 
The Senator went on to suggest that his colleagues who were blocking the confirmation vote were trying to ob-struct his confirmation and were ‘‘playing politics with judges.’’ I so respect the statement that my colleague from Utah made in 1995, ad-monishing his colleagues to quit play-ing politics with judges. But what has happened between 1995 and 2017, over these last 22 years? A huge amplification of playing politics to the point that when Merrick Gar-land came back before this body, only a couple of Republicans were willing to stand up and say: Let’s quit playing politics. And they were quickly si-lenced. During his 2005 confirmation hearing, Chief Justice John Roberts remarked about serving on the Circuit Court with Merrick Garland: ‘‘Any time Judge Garland disagrees, you know you are in a difficult area.’’ So here is the Chief Justice, consid-ered one of the conservatives on the Court, who is saying that if you dis-agree with Merrick Garland, you are in a difficult area. You have to go and fig-ure out why you would disagree be-cause he is so good at working his way through the law and coming to a posi-tion of calling the balls and strikes. That is the type of respect there was for Merrick Garland. And this respect and admiration continued right up to his official nomination on March 11, 2016. Five days before his nomination, my Senate colleague—my colleague from Utah—told a reporter that if President Obama named Judge Gar-land, ‘‘who is a fine man,’’ to fill Scalia’s seat, he would be a ‘‘consensus nominee,’’ and there would be no ques-tion of his receiving a bipartisan con-firmation—five days before the Presi-dent nominated Merrick Garland. The President recognized that the Senate was controlled by the Repub-lican majority. He consulted on both sides of the aisle. He chose a nominee admired on both sides of the aisle. Standing in the Rose Garden on March 16 of last year, President Obama officially nominated Judge Garland to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia, and President Obama called Merrick Garland the right man for the job: He deserves to be confirmed.

His nomination had endorsements from a broad range of organizations and individuals. The American Bar As-sociation, the Hispanic National Bar Association, eight former Solicitors General, including Neal Katyal, Greg-ory Garre, Paul Clement, Theodore Olson, Seth Waxman, Walter Dellinger, Drew Days, and Kenneth Starr. You recognize some of those names. Some come from the right side of the spec-trum, some from the left. The point was that eight former Solicitors Gen-eral—Ken Starr, 1989 through 1993, and Drew Days who followed him, and Dellinger, who followed Days, and Wax-man, who followed Dellinger, and Olson, who served from 2001 to 2004, and Clement, who followed Olson, and Garre, who followed Clement, and then Neal Katyal, who served in 2010 and 2011. Endorsement from the American Bar Association Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary rated him ‘‘well qualified’’ as a Supreme Court nomi-nee, the highest rating they can give, and their evaluation of his record stat-ed that Judge Garland ‘‘meets the very highest standards of integrity, profes-sional competence, and judicial tem-perament.’’ So there we have our President, President Obama, last year consulting in a bipartisan fashion, choosing a nominee who had been highly com-plimented by Senators on both sides of the aisle, seeking to find someone straight down the judicial mainstream, and what was the response of the ma-jority leader of our body, our assembly here? His response was: We are going to steal this seat. It doesn’t matter that this nominee is highly qualified. It doesn’t matter that Democratic and Republican Senators have com-plimented him highly and have high re-spect for him. It doesn’t matter that the Chief Justice has enormous respect for his judicial thinking. We are going to steal this seat in hopes of being able to pack the Court. That is what hap-pened later in the day, after Merrick Garland was nominated. The Senate has always functioned by cooperation, with a big element of tra-dition thrown in. A defining feature of the Senate is a commitment to the tra-ditions of fair play, allowing us to con-tinue functioning to solve America’s problems in politicized circumstances. This is enormously important to the success of this Chamber. I had heard when I was running for the Senate in 2007 and 2008 that some-thing terrible had happened with this Chamber in the years that I had been back in Oregon and that a group had decided that they would use this Cham-ber as a weapon against any Demo-cratic President rather than as a forum to solve America’s problems. I didn’t believe it. I didn’t believe that the Sen-ate I saw as an intern in 1976; that I saw when I was volunteering for orga-nizations and working here in DC, washing dishes and waiting tables in 1977; that the Senate I saw when I was a Presidential fellow with a Republican Defense Secretary, Caspar Weinberger; that the Senate I saw when I worked for Congress in a think tank on stra-tegic nuclear weapon policy for the Congressional Budget Office—I couldn’t believe that a group of Sen-ators had decided to use this Chamber as a weapon against the executive branch, if the executive branch hap-pened to be from the other party. I didn’t believe it. I dismissed the com-mentary I was hearing about what was occurring in this Chamber. Then I arrived in 2009, and I quickly saw that I was wrong; that the stories about this Chamber being taken over by an urge to use it as a weapon against Democratic Presidents had, in fact, been true. We all were nearly knocked over when the majority leader announced that his goal was to make sure—his top goal, his determining vi-sion—was to use this Chamber to pre-vent President Obama from being re-elected. And we are sitting here going: Let’s work together on healthcare pol-icy. Let’s work together to make a fair tax system. Let’s work together to de-velop the infrastructure that is so needed because the infrastructure our parents built is wearing out. Let’s work to develop that infrastructure be-cause we have new demands of a dif-ferent economy. We need better bridges and better railways and better ports and better electric transmission lines, and we certainly need better broadband, or at least broadband of some kind, as a starting point in rural America. Those are the challenges we face. Let’s work together. And then I watched as a key issue was turned into a political weapon against the President, rather than working to solve problems here in America, and that issue was healthcare. In April 2009, I was handed a brief written by Frank Luntz, who was a strategist for the Republican team, and that brief said, Whatever ideas that the Democrats work to pursue on healthcare, here is our strategy: Don’t cooperate; call it a government take-over—whatever they do. I came to the floor of the Senate, and I gave a floor speech in 2009. I waved around the Frank Luntz memo, and I said: This is what is wrong with Amer-ica. We have millions and millions of people without access to healthcare in America, and instead of working to-gether, the Republican strategist is saying, Whatever ideas to improve the healthcare system they come up with, oppose them and call it a government takeover. Democrats said: You need bipartisan cooperation to get a healthcare bill through here. So they held 5 weeks of hearing in the HELP Committee— Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-sions Committee. I was assigned to that committee. Senator Ted Kennedy had assigned me to be on that com-mittee, in partnership with Majority Leader Harry Reid. I was so happy to be on that committee. For 5 weeks around a square table, I saw idea after idea presented as amendments were discussed, debated, and voted on. Ap-proximately 150 Republican amend-ments were adopted. Imagine a com-mittee adopting today, under the con-trol of the Senate, 150 Democratic amendments on a major bill—adopting, not just considering. Democrats went through every title, with television there and all of America watching for 5 weeks. That was just for the HELP Com-mittee. Then there was a whole other process with the Finance Committee in which Senator Baucus led a group with Senator G
RASSLEY , if I am not mis-taken. They had three Democrats and three Republicans, and they worked on the finance side to come to a bipartisan conclusion. But eventually Frank Luntz’s vision won out: Whatever is suggested, oppose it and call it a gov-ernment takeover. That would do the most damage to the President. That was the strategy. Democrats said: Well, it looks like we are going to have to take the Re-publican healthcare plan. What was the Republican healthcare plan? The Republican healthcare plan was to use a marketplace in which pri-vate companies would offer their insur-ance. Compare the insurance, one pol-icy to the other, to find out which one best suited your family, and then based on income, you could get tax credits to be able to afford to acquire that insur-ance policy, so that essentially we would have a pathway to healthcare for every American citizen, for the mil-lions and millions of people who didn’t have that pathway. That was the Re-publican plan. It came out of the Amer-ican Enterprise Institute as the mar-ketplace solution for healthcare. It wasn’t a public option. It wasn’t, let’s lower the age of Medicare. It wasn’t single buyer. It was the Republican marketplace plan. It was already one that had been tested by a Republican Governor in Massachusetts. It was known as RomneyCare. So it was a Re-publican think tank plan and a Repub-lican Governor-tested plan. Democrats said: OK, let’s go that way. We think there are better path-ways, but we will go with that because we need to be able to bring this Cham-ber together. But my colleagues across the aisle, under this vision of using the Senate as a weapon against a Democratic Presi-dent, decided they were going to oppose it just like Frank Luntz laid out in those first few months of 2009. We see that same profound partisan-ship in this first-ever theft of a Su-preme Court seat. We see that same profound partisanship in the strategy behind that theft, which is to pack the Court. We see that same profound strategy in the action that happened a couple hours ago. That was the first time in U.S. history a motion to close debate was filed on the first day of a Senate debate.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES2234 April 4, 2017 
So turn the clock back to those first 13 States and 26 Senators trying to fig-ure out how the Senate would operate. They weren’t really planning on it being a public forum, but they did have this sense that it would be wrong to close debate before every Senator had shared from their experience. So they had a rule. In their initial rules of the Senate, they had a rule to close debate. They never used it. They never used it, as far as we know, not once, because they wanted to give everyone the chance to be heard. Of course, the Sen-ate was only a quarter of the size—26 Senators instead of 100 Senators. When they rewrote the rules of the Senate, they said: We don’t need to have a rule for closing debate by simple majority called to question, if you will. We don’t have to have it because we are going to hear everybody out before we vote. So that kind of launched that tradition of hearing each other out. Later, when the Senate restored a rule in which a supermajority could close debate, it took a supermajority. At another point, the Senate said: We need to have a little smaller super-majority. The reason that triggered, going back to having a strategy for closing debate—and I know historians will cor-rect me if I have this wrong—in World War I, the President wanted to put military defenses on some of the com-mercial ships to fend off the threat from the Germans. There were Sen-ators who said: This will draw us into war. We are not in the war yet. This will draw us into war by weaponizing our commercial ships. There was a date set for the Senate to adjourn. They proceeded to keep talking until that time arrived so the Senate could not act to pass that law, which the vast majority of the Senate thought was appropriate. They said: Well, we can’t have just a small group, which basically would be the tail that wags the dog. That denies our ability to make decisions. So we will have to have a strategy for closing debate. So they established that strategy. The general principle behind it was most of the time you hear people out here in the Senate rather than closing debate. But what we saw tonight for the first time in U.S. history—a clo-ture petition filed on the very first day. James Madison, speaking to the Con-stitutional Convention, remarked that the Senate was a necessary fence to protect the people from the transient impressions into which they them-selves might be led. It was a reason for the longer terms for the Senate. They have 2 years in the House; we have 6 years in the Senate. The Senate ro-tates so a third are elected every 2 years for 6-year terms. There is a saying attributed to Presi-dent Washington—as far as we know, he never said it, but still it was clever enough that it has reverberated on down through the centuries—that the Senate would be the cooling saucer, so that you had your tea and it was too hot, and you poured it into the cooling saucer until it was just right. You don’t act impulsively because you have 6-year—longer—terms and a smaller body who can ponder the issues more carefully. So here is the Senate, intended to be the cooling saucer, but what do we have right now? We have the stove turned up to the highest possible tem-perature. There is no stepping back from this course of undermining the in-tegrity of the Senate and the integrity of the Court. It is full steam ahead. File the petition on the first day of de-bate so we can close this debate and have this vote done by Friday, the ma-jority leader said. Vote on Thursday. Somehow we are going to maybe change the rules and vote on Friday if there are not enough votes to close de-bate. Back in 2013, there was an enormous blockade using the advice and consent power to obstruct both executive branch nominees and judicial nomi-nees. This enormous blockade was used by colleagues across the aisle as a weapon against the judiciary and exec-utive branch. When the conversation occurred back among the Founders, they said: Advice and consent power won’t have to be used very often to turn down a Presi-dential nominee because just the very fact that the Senate can serve as a check on a Presidential nomination will cause a President to make wise ap-pointments. They had actually wrestled with how to construct this situation. How do you construct this check and balance? Some said: The executive branch— why don’t we have the President head it but have the positions filled by Con-gress? Others said: That is not such a good idea because one Senator’s friend will be nominated for this position in ex-change for another Senator’s friend being nominated for that position, and the people will never really know who, where, why. There is no accountability. That is what it came down to. So we will have a single person—the President—nominate for the executive branch. Plus, that way the President can nominate people to help fulfill the vision the President campaigned on, which makes a lot of sense. The people didn’t just elect a name; they elected a vision for the country. And the person responsible for helping to implement that—the executive branch—the Presi-dent, should have a team who can go forward with that vision. Then the crafters of the Constitution said: But what if the President goes off track and starts nominating people who don’t actually have the skills to fill the positions to which they are nominated? What if the President nominates people because they have done some favor for the President in the past, so that there is a conflict of interest? What if the President nomi-nates someone of poor character? Shouldn’t there be a way to put a check on a deeply misguided nomina-tion? The founders said: Yes. We will cre-ate an advice and consent power for the U.S. Senate to be a check on misguided nominations. So here we are looking at that origi-nal philosophy of the Senate and the responsibility to stop misguided nomi-nations through advice and consent, and we have had two profound betray-als of that responsibility last year and this year. The betrayal last year was that the Senate refused to exercise its responsibility at all. It stalled the seat. It sought to pack the Court. Now we have a deeply misguided nomination before us, an individual who is from the extraordinary right, not from the mainstream, who has twisted the law time and time again to find for the powerful and the privileged over ‘‘we the people,’’ and yet that nomination is here on the floor, not a single vote in the Judiciary Committee from across the aisle. This chart reflects the distribution of Federal judge ideology. If we had been putting up this chart decades ago, we would have probably seen a single bell curve. There would be folks on the right and folks on the left. But now we have the twin peaks chart of judicial decisionmaking. So the decisions are falling more and more into a ‘‘we the people’’ camp that says ‘‘Let’s fulfill the vision of our Constitution’’ and a ‘‘we the powerful’’ camp that says ‘‘Let’s turn the Constitution upside down and run this country by and for the powerful.’’ Where does this nomi-nee fall? Not into the ‘‘we the people’’ vision of our Constitution and not even within the left side of that ‘‘we the powerful’’ twin peak but to the right side of it. That is where we are. The supermajority to close debate— commonly referred to as the fili-buster—is a power we have sustained in order to have nominees who are not from the ideological extremes. But now we have one. We have one who, when a trucker was protected by the law—be-cause of his personal safety, and he was freezing in subzero temperatures and had to go get warm and come back, and the law protected him from getting fired—he got fired. The court said: Ab-solutely, you can’t fire someone for protecting their safety or others. Judge Gorsuch found a way to turn that on its head. When we wrote a law to say that you have to provide an education to dis-abled children, Judge Gorsuch said that babysitting is fine, as long as there is basically—not exact words, kind of mere fringe of advancement— something that was essentially equiva-lent to babysitting. And the Supreme Court, all eight Justices occupying both of those peaks, said that was ab-surd, and they overturned Judge Gorsuch, 8 to 0. We have this role from our Founders of being the cooling saucer. We have

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2235 April 4, 2017 
this role of being a check on the abuse of or misguided Presidential nomina-tions, and we failed it last year by not doing our job. We fail it this year by considering anyone other than Merrick Garland. And we certainly fail it in the context of closing—considering the possibility of closing debate. That is the conversation that the majority leader has been invested in—that if this judge is so extreme as to not to get the 60 votes to close debate, we will change the rules. Well, how about we change the nomi-nee? How about we save the integrity of the Senate? How about we save the integrity of the Supreme Court? Change the nominee. Ideally, put Merrick Garland up, because that way we solve the problem of the stolen seat—this enormous court-packing plan that is unfolding right before our eyes. And if the schedule on which the majority leader has said he wants to complete this court-packing occurs by Friday, it will be too late. We will have done the damage. George Washington shared his view of the Senate’s role. The story goes that Thomas Jefferson returned from France to take on the duties as our first Secretary of State. He was having breakfast with President Washington and called for the President to account for having supported an unnecessary legislative Chamber in the Senate of having this conversation. That is when that conversation came up. We believe it to be apocryphal, but still the re-sponse, as written down at some later point in time, was that Washington asked: Why did you now pour that cof-fee into your saucer before drinking? Jefferson responded: To cool it. My throat is not made of brass. Washington said: Even so, we pour our legislation into the Senatorial sau-cer to cool. Is there a way that we can avoid what is unfolding now, this tragic mis-carriage of the Senate’s responsibil-ities? Whether that conversation took place, as I mentioned, is not actually known, but the fact that the story is still here means that it had some power behind it, whether it took place or not. And that was that for 200 years and counting, the government has counted on the Senate to pause, to not give acceleration to the momentum of the day, but to pause and be thoughtful in considering the integrity of our in-stitutions. And that integrity, that moment when we need to be the cool-ing saucer, is now. Unanimous consent has been a tool that the Senate has used. Many times, if you are watching the Senate, you will hear ‘‘unanimous consent’’ to do this or that. Earlier, the majority lead-er came and spoke. He said: ‘‘I ask unanimous consent,’’ and he laid out a plan for tomorrow about how this de-bate would proceed. That unanimous consent—each and every one of those represents a form of cooperation, often the last vestige of cooperation. It also goes to this observation that the Sen-ate is about hearing each other and working together. Robert C. Byrd once remarked: 
That is what the Senate is about. It’s the last bastion of minority rights, where the minority can be heard, where a minority can stand on its feet. One individual, if nec-essary, can speak until he falls. 
Well, you can’t keep speaking if a cloture petition has been filed. So come Thursday, the phrase is the ‘‘pe-tition ripens,’’ which means that it will be voted on, and generally it is 1 hour after we convene after an intervening day. So tomorrow, Wednesday, is the intervening day, and the vote will occur on Thursday. That is the oppo-site of what Senator Byrd was referring to because at that point, anyone who wants to be heard, can’t be heard. The tradition of having weeks and weeks of conversation about a nomina-tion that creates complexities or has complexities behind it—that is being destroyed. That comity permeated many controversial debates the Senate has had over time. That willingness to hear each other and to vote is some-thing that was embedded in the Senate as I saw it four decades ago and later in my life when I was working for Con-gress. There is no denying that the Su-preme Court nominations have always been subject to a certain level of poli-tics, but there has also been a certain level of cordiality to the process. Dan-iel Patrick Moynihan, in a debate on the nomination of Ruth Bader Gins-burg back in 1993, said: 
[The Senate] is perhaps most acutely at-tentive to its duty when it considers a nomi-nee to the Supreme Court. That this is so re-flects not only the importance of our Na-tion’s highest tribunal but also our recogni-tion that while Members of the Congress and Presidents come and go . . . the tenure of a Supreme Court Justice can span generations. 
We are not here on the floor debating who will serve in some office in the ex-ecutive branch for the next couple of years. We are here debating the nomi-nation for the highest Court that could ‘‘span generations,’’ in the words of Daniel Patrick Moynihan. So what else would we consider more important than a Supreme Court nomi-nation to adhere to the traditions of the Senate and to honor the 60-vote re-quirement in our rules? We don’t al-ways like the nominee the other side has selected. We question them vigor-ously in confirmation hearings, and we end up voting against them. But until the situation last year with the death of Antonin Scalia, every vacancy in an election year for which a President proposed a Justice who has made a nomination—every time, the Senate did its job. It confirmed most. It re-jected a few, but it did its job. Over the course of our Nation’s his-tory, there have been a total of 164 Su-preme Court nominations; 124 of those were confirmed, roughly 3 out of 4, in-cluding elevating current Justices to Chief Justice. There have been 112 indi-viduals who have served on the Su-preme Court, and 39 Presidents to date have appointed at least one Supreme Court Justice. But only once—last year—has the majority conspired to re-ject its responsibility to consider a nominee for a position that opened in an election year. Only once has the ma-jority conspired to steal an election- year Senate seat and send it to the next President and pack the Court. The action last year is different from anything that has occurred before. There were some individuals—some colleagues across the aisle—who advo-cated for the Senate fulfilling its con-stitutional duty in the case of Merrick Garland and for continuing the tradi-tions of this great institution. One of my colleagues told a townhall audience last year—one of my Repub-lican colleagues said: I can’t imagine the President has or will nominate somebody that meets my criteria, but I have a job to do. I think the process ought to go forward. 
Another colleague sat down and met with Judge Garland, even knowing that the Republican leadership was saying that he would not get a hearing. That colleague declared, and I quote, that colleague was ‘‘more convinced than ever that the process should proceed. The next step, in my view, should be public hearings before the Judiciary Committee.’’ So I pause to thank my Republican colleagues who worked to stand up for the integrity of the Court and the in-tegrity of the Senate and for due delib-eration on a Presidential nomination during an election year. Thank you to my colleague from Kansas. Thank you to my colleague from Maine. There may have been others I didn’t hear about, and I imagine there were because I think Members of this body take their responsibility extremely se-riously. They take their oath of office seriously, and they were put in an im-possible position when their leadership asked them not to exercise their advice and consent responsibility under the Constitution. That is where we were last year. Here we are, on the brink of doing devastating damage to the Court. Shouldn’t we pause and be the cooling saucer? Shouldn’t we send this nomina-tion back to the President and ask for him to put forward Merrick Garland or someone who basically is on the same path that Merrick Garland was on—the path that was so honored and com-plimented by Senators on both sides of the aisle? Shouldn’t we address this before we set the precedent of a stolen seat? Think about what this precedent means going forward. A few years from now, there may well be another va-cancy, and this vacancy may be under a Republican President, and maybe the Democrats control this Chamber. At that point, do they say: We are going to rectify the wrong in the past and re-store the integrity of the Court by tak-ing that seat and forwarding it to the next President, hoping that it will be a

Democratic President, and there will be a nominee who will restore the in-tegrity of the Court because there will be a nominee more like Merrick Gar-land? Or will there be future leadership that says: Hey, their team stole a seat that occurred—an opening that oc-curred in January of election year. Let’s steal one that happens in October the year before the election to balance it out. If you can steal it for 12 months, why not steal it for a few more? Where does that end? What good does that do to our institution? What honor does that give to the 5-to-4 decisions of the future? That is where we are headed. We are headed to a place that is breaking two centuries’ worth of tradition and estab-lishing a precedent that will do enor-mous damage to the Senate and to the Presidency and to the Court. That is why I am here addressing it at length tonight. I did find that when the ma-jority leader didn’t want to put into a resolution that the same rule he advo-cated for last year should apply to this President, it was clear—as clear as you could possibly make it—that what hap-pened last year had no principle in it; it was an issue of partisan tactics to amplify the strength of one party and one vision—that of government by and for the powerful—at the expense of the other vision. Don’t we owe more in our role as Senators, especially on some-thing as important as the Supreme Court and the integrity of the Court, than just another partisan strategy? I will tell you, I think about why it is that we are at this place right now. There are a couple of things that are very, very different from the Senate I first saw four decades ago and the America of four decades ago. One of those is that Senators four decades ago lived here with their families. They had a Monday-to-Friday workweek. They had evenings to build relation-ships, and they had weekends to do things with other colleagues across the aisle. They took a lot of bipartisan congressional delegations. They all knew each other well as friends. But now the Senate comes in on Monday night for a vote at 5:30 p.m. and we leave after a vote at roughly 3:30 p.m. on Thursday. So it is 3 days— Monday afternoon to Thursday after-noon. We don’t have the time in the evenings because of that compressed schedule. We don’t have the time on the weekends because we are back in our home States or traveling some-where else. So we don’t have the rela-tionships. We just don’t have the com-mon activities. There used to be lunches where the Democrats and Republicans ate to-gether. Now there is a partisan Repub-lican lunch, three out of three lunches and two out of three for the Demo-crats. We don’t have that meal to-gether to get to know each other, so you have to work extraordinarily hard to set up a meeting to try to work with a colleague on a topic. If it is some-thing larger than you can discuss here during the middle of a vote, it can take a month to get a 20-minute meeting to ponder with a colleague how we might work together on a problem. So that is a change in this Chamber, but there is another big change. That second big change is related to the role of the media. We had big issues in our country decades ago, but we also had community newspapers, and we had three network television stations that essentially provided a foundation of in-formation. We might have had dif-ferent views about that information and different views about what we should do in the future, but we had a common foundation of information. Now we don’t have a common founda-tion of information. Information flows in every possible direction, much of it made up. I was very struck when—I hold a lot of townhalls. My first summer as a Senator—2009—I was out holding town-halls. I do one in every county every year. Folks said: You know, why are you supporting this Senate healthcare bill that has a death panel in it? That was one of those false news stories. What was the real story? The real story is that a Republican Senator from Georgia had proposed—a Repub-lican Senator had proposed that we pay doctors for the time they spend with their patients informing them about how to do a living will so that if they were incapacitated in the future, their desires would be followed, not someone else’s desires—not a death panel, their desires would be followed. That is as American as apple pie. We were going to make sure that we could control, each of us, our own fu-ture. It was a Republican proposal, a good proposal, a proposal that made a lot of sense so that people could have control over their future medical deci-sions if they were incapacitated. But for partisan political reasons, a can-didate had twisted that into a death panel and turned it on its head, that someone else would make the decisions instead of you making the decisions for yourself, which is what it was all about. So I was at this townhall, and a con-stituent, an Oregon citizen, raised this issue. I said: You will be happy to know that they don’t exist. You will be happy to know that the idea from which the false news story began was about empowering you to make your own decisions. Don’t you feel better now knowing that the conversation in the Senate was about you controlling your own destiny? The woman said to me: I don’t be-lieve you. I said: Well, you don’t have to believe me; I have the text right here that was proposed. I had heard about this issue, and so I wanted to make sure that people knew about it and that I could answer if asked. So I shared the text with her. She said: Well, I don’t believe you. Who am I going to believe—a U.S. Sen-ator or a television policy analyst? She meant Glenn Beck. Glenn Beck and others were simply making stuff up and putting it on their television show or their radio show, designed to infuriate people by setting up this false story—this false story that there was a government takeover and this false story that there was a death panel. If you want to understand what hap-pened 2 weeks ago in the House when the House failed to pass a healthcare bill to replace ObamaCare, it is a story about false news. It is a story about partisanship over policy. It is a story about a year-plus of bipartisanship being trumped by Frank Luntz’s vision of whatever is proposed, call it a gov-ernment takeover. Even if—his memo didn’t say this, but as it turned out, even if it was the Republican strategy of having a marketplace for people to get their health insurance, call it a government takeover. So when the Republicans said they were going to replace ObamaCare, the problem was that ObamaCare was the Republican plan, so they did not have anywhere to go. They could either tear down healthcare completely and put 24 million people on the ice—that is, out of reach of healthcare—by the way, not just individuals but rural healthcare institutions because the rural clinics were powerfully strengthened through the Affordable Care Act. The rural hos-pitals were powerfully strengthened through the Affordable Care Act. There was so much uncompensated care pre-viously that hospitals and clinics had to give away for free, and now they were getting paid because people had insurance, so they were much stronger. So it was about 24 million people, but it was also about a vast healthcare in-frastructure in rural America that the Republican plan would destroy. But they could not propose their own plan because their own plan had been adopted in 2009—marketplaces with pri-vate companies competing against each other, tax subsidies, tax credits so people could afford to buy those poli-cies. That was the American Enterprise Institute plan. That was the Repub-lican Governor’s plan. That was RomneyCare. So where do you go if your plan has already been enacted into law? If 150 of your amendments were accepted as part of that process, where do you go when you have used a false story, a false commentary to the American people year after year after year saying that something is some terrible thing that it is not? Well, where you go is the process blew up. That is where it went because it was based on a false foundation, the entire 8 years of attack on the Affordable Care Act—a false premise just like Sarah Palin’s death panels were a false attack. We can’t keep going through this ex-treme partisanship and save the Senate at the same time. Another challenge we have—in addi-tion to the fact that the friendships that cemented the Senate together are not as developed as they were decades

ago because we are not here and we don’t spend enough time with each other—another problem is that we have all of these false stories being gen-erated continuously to make people angry with each other. Those are cer-tainly problems, but we have another big problem, and that problem is the concentration of campaign money, the dark money, the Citizens United money that is corrupting our political system. I can’t convey how much damage this has done. Let’s just review the biggest example of this strategy. The Koch brothers decided in 2013 that they wanted to have a legislature that would support their extraction and burning of fossil fuels. There was this pesky little problem threatening the entire planet called global warming in which the burning of those fossil fuels was polluting the air, raising the tem-perature of the Earth, and having pro-found consequences. So people were talking about, how do we transition off of fossil fuels? The Koch brothers said: Well, that is our business. We can’t let that happen. We have to have control of the House and Senate. So the story with the Senate is they decided to spend a vast sum of money on the campaigns of 2014. The result was that they influenced the elections and had a positive outcome, from their point of view, in Louisiana, Arkansas, North Carolina, in Iowa, Colorado, and Alaska. There were a few other States that they came to that year, including Oregon, my home State. So they won most of those campaigns. They put the Republican majority into office so they would have a Senate that would not be discussing the biggest threat to our planet—carbon pollution and global warming—and instead would have one that would sustain tax breaks to accel-erate the extraction and burning—the profitability of extracting and burning fossil fuels. Then they did something that should be recorded as a significant moment in U.S. history. In January, as the Senate was coming in with this new Repub-lican majority, they did not say: Well, that is great. We have a Republican majority, and now we have folks who will support our fossil fuel extraction and combustion. We will make a lot of money. They will keep the tax breaks in place for us. No, they didn’t say that. They said: Pay attention. This was January 2015, 2 months after the election, and we were just coming in. The Republican majority was just coming in. The Koch brothers said: Pay atten-tion. We are committing to spend the better part of $1 billion in the next election 2 years from now. I don’t know that such a statement has ever been made by a body in the United States, a similar statement. Next election—we had just had this election—next election we are going to spend almost $1 billion. They wanted everyone in this new Republican-majority Senate to know who was in charge. The Koch brothers are in charge. They paid for the third- party ads that put your election in the victory column. You will pay attention—at your own risk if you don’t. A number of my colleagues shared that this was a very real threat, that the Koch brothers would be happy to find a primary opponent and not just undermine them in the general elec-tion or fail to fund them in a general election—and the first bill up was one of the Koch brothers’ top priorities, the Keystone Pipeline. So we now have a body about which, at least, you can say that a very significant behind-the- scenes force of this body is the Koch brothers. Well, how does this tie in with what happened in 2016 when Antonin Scalia died and there was an open Senate seat? Here is how it ties in: You had a 5-to- 4 Supreme Court that had decided that it was OK for groups like the Koch brothers to spend billions of dollars in dark money, third-party campaigns, eviscerating the opponents on the other side of the issue. Four Justices had said no. In our ‘‘we the people’’ Republic, having that con-centration of power is a corrupting force. It is an attack on the very design of our country, but you had five others who said: No, no, no, it is OK. That makes me think about a letter that Jefferson wrote. Jefferson was writing to a friend, and he said: There is a mother principle, a mother prin-ciple in our design of the government. He said: That is that decisions will only be made in the interest of the peo-ple if each person carries an equal voice. He recognized in using the term ‘‘voice,’’ something broader, more pow-erful than just a vote. That is why I said ‘‘voice.’’ What has happened with Citizens United, with respect to the five Jus-tices, is that it is OK to have some in-dividuals who have a voice in our cam-paign that is equal to thousands or tens of thousands or even 100,000 other citizens. We didn’t have such a way to amplify one’s voice—not anything close to that amplification when the Founders de-signed our government. Yes, you could put an article in the newspaper. Yes, you could hand out pamphlets. But with the growth of radio and television and now the internet and all the strat-egies through social media and inter-net advertising, through all of that, money can amplify one’s voice. You can have the equivalent of a stadium sound system that drowns out the voice of the people. That is the oppo-site of Jefferson’s mother principle, Jefferson’s principle that we will only be a government that pursues the will of the people if each citizen has an equal voice. Now, granted, we all know that vi-sion was flawed. Women weren’t given the vote. Many minorities were ex-cluded. But we have worked overtime toward that vision of inclusion, oppor-tunity, and equality, and we have come a long way. But in one case, we have gone in the opposite direction, and that is the Citizens United concentration of money corrupting our elections, under-mining the legitimacy of this Chamber and undermining the legitimacy of the House Chamber. Instead of being elect-ed to do government of, by, and for the people, it is the product of an enor-mous concentration of power by and for the few. You can see it in the poli-cies that are pursued. Three decades after World War II, we had an economy that worked really well for working America. American workers participated in the wealth that they were creating, and the result was that families had a leap forward. My parents have lived under humble circumstances. I had a grandmother who at one point had lived in a railroad car. I had a grandfather who put all the children into a car and drove from Kan-sas to Arizona with all of the individ-uals in the family and their possessions in a single car, going west, trying to find work and find a future. Those were incredibly hard times. Folks were liv-ing in shacks. Then, after World War II, we had these three decades when we had this big leap forward in the standard of liv-ing, as workers shared in the wealth they were creating. From about the time I got out of high school, which was 1974, in the mid-dle of that decade—let’s call it 1975— and in the next four decades, virtually all of the new income in America has gone to the top 10 percent, which means that 9 out of 10 Americans have been left behind in this economy. I live in a blue collar community, the same community I have lived in since third grade. I was there from third grade through graduating from high school. I moved back into that commu-nity the year my son Jonathan was born 20 years ago. It is a blue collar community. It has changed over time. It has become much more of a diverse community. There are many ethnicities from all over the world, and a lot of languages are spo-ken in the school. It is a blue collar, working community. Folks there say: My parents were able to buy a house in this community, but the only way I am going to own a house in this community is to be able to inherit it from my parents because of the disappearance of living-wage jobs. That is what has been going on in this economy. We provide these enor-mous, enormous tax breaks for the best off in our society. Well, there is a concept referred to as the Buffett rule. Warren Buffett said: Why should I, a billionaire, be taxed at a lower rate than my secretary? Why does my secretary pay a higher rate than I do?

correct that and say: Hey, a billionaire should pay at least the same tax rate as the secretary or the janitor. But we haven’t corrected it because the vast influence of funds in this Chamber are working on behalf of the privileged and the powerful. So here we are, trying to figure out why last year we had, for the very first time, a majority leader who engineered the theft of a Supreme Court seat from the Obama administration to another administration. It was the first time in U.S. history. To understand 2016, you have to understand 2014, when the Koch brothers invested this vast sum in all the campaigns so they could control the Senate. You have to understand that in January 2015, the Koch brothers sent a message that you had better pay attention. You have to understand that the Koch brothers’ strategy is based on the dark money, third-party campaigns that Merrick Garland might possibly have voted against—a 5-to-4 Citizens United decision that Merrick Garland might have found 5-to-4 in the other di-rection. We don’t actually know where he stood on this. He was so square down the middle and so complimented by people on the right as well as the left. We don’t know how he would have voted on that. But in order to ensure that the dark money could continue, in order to ensure that decisions would be made by and for the powerful, to ensure that the fossil fuel companies could be swept clear of regu-lations that would diminish the amount of fossil fuels they could ex-tract out of the ground and sell for combustion, in order to ensure the profits of the Koch brothers, that drove this unique case of the theft of the Su-preme Court seat last year. There was that effort to pack the Court by sending that seat to the next President in the hopes that it would be a conservative President and then to have that nominee say: I will only nominate somebody who comes off a list from two conservative groups on the far right—boy. That was exactly the vision. It has unfolded exactly as— I guess you could say—those in that powerful group wanted it to unfold. We have a different responsibility. We don’t have a responsibility to a ‘‘we the powerful’’ vision. We don’t have a responsibility to a ‘‘we the privileged’’ vision. We have a ‘‘we the people’’ Con-stitution. We have Jefferson’s mother principle that says: We should be in a situation, if we want the will of the people to be enacted, in which people have an equal voice. There is this third-party, dark money that is corrupting America, our fundamental institutions, our election institutions. It is corrupting this insti-tution—both sides, the House and the Senate. That is why I hope there is a Supreme Court that eventually says this is wrong; this is out of sync with our constitutional vision. The Court said: We think trans-parency will do the job. They kind of assumed that there would be trans-parency in where the money came from and where it went. It used to be that colleagues on the right side of this Chamber would say: Oh, we love transparency. Trans-parency will be the sunlight that dis-infects the potential corruption of campaign donations. We love trans-parency. Many of those who opposed McCain- Feingold caps on donations said: We love transparency, the sunlight, the disinfectant. Won’t that be wonderful. Then, we had a transparency bill on the floor and said: People have to know where every donation comes from so there is not this dark money, unidenti-fied money surging through the veins of the American campaign system, surging through the arteries. Suddenly they say: Oh, wait; we don’t like trans-parency so much because that might hurt the prospects for the powerful folks who got us elected. So then you have the picture of why this unique circumstance occurred and why we are where we are and how much damage it is going to do and how it un-dermines the legitimacy of the Court. Merrick Garland’s treatment is un-precedented in the history of Supreme Court nominations. There was a hast-ily fabricated pretext that we shouldn’t do a normal process under our advice and consent responsibilities in the final year of a Presidency or the fourth year of a Presidency. Now, you can read the Constitution from one end to another, but you won’t find that principle in the Constitu-tion—that suddenly we can ignore our responsibility in the fourth year of a Presidency. The responsibility to be here in the Senate Chamber doesn’t end in a fourth year. No other responsibility ends. The responsibility of the President to nominate for empty positions doesn’t end, but that pretext was one which was so quickly concocted. The founda-tion was so quickly destroyed, and it was just revealed for the destructive partisan tactic that it was—this Court- packing tactic. One colleague said: We have 80 years of precedent of not confirming Su-preme Court Justices in an election year. That is an exact quote. One colleague came to the floor—a colleague, by the way, who ran for President—and said: We have 80 years of precedent not confirming a Supreme Court Justice in an election year. Wrong. There have been 15 vacancies in an election year, and 15 times the Sen-ate acted, and in most of those cases, it was to confirm the Justice. We could even look at the fact that there were some vacancies that occurred before an election year and were confirmed in an election year, just like the nomination of Anthony Kennedy—who sits on the Supreme Court today—in 1988. To my colleague who said we have 80 years of precedent of not confirming a Supreme Court Justice in an election year—that is his exact quote—not only is that not true, if you look at history, at every single nomination vacancy that occurred in an election year—and most were confirmed, but the Senate always acted—it is simply not true, if you look at Justice Anthony Kennedy, who sits on the Court a few yards from here, who confirmed just a few years ago—in 1988—within the memory of most Members who serve in this Cham-ber. If you go back just one more elec-tion—let me put it differently. Until Merrick Garland’s nomination last year, we hadn’t had an election-year vacancy for a sizeable period of time. That is why I am going to have these three charts put back up. If we look at these charts here in this situation, these are some vacancies that occurred in an election year. Look at this group here—in 1928, 1860, 1864, and 1956. Well, 1956 was a good pe-riod of time ago. That was about 60 years ago, 61 years ago. That is quite a while. Let’s look at the next chart. Well, vacancies in an election year—year 1800, year 1872, year 1880. They hap-pened a long time ago. How about the last chart of nine. Again we see a lot of 1800s—1804, 1844, 1852, 1888, 1892, in 1916 twice, and 1932. The point is taken that it has been quite a long time since we have had a vacancy in an election year. So if you concoct a premise within an hour or two of a Supreme Court Justice dying and get it wrong—but then there is also a colleague who had the time to look up the facts who got it wrong as well. In the 1932 election between Franklin Roosevelt and Herbert Hoover, we did have an election of a Supreme Court nominee. Hoover nominated Benjamin Cardozo to succeed Oliver Wendell Holmes. On February 24, 9 days later, the Senate confirmed Cardozo. That was the last time we had a Supreme Court seat open up in an election year, except for the Eisenhower occasion. Why don’t we go back to Eisenhower. The seat opened up 1956, an election year, and it was the following January that he was confirmed. So we can look to the fact that the Senate acted on all 15 of the 15 elec-tion-year vacancies, confirming most of them. Here we see two out of the four confirmed, and of these eight be-fore Merrick Garland, we see six of the eight confirmed. Then the other group of three were the folks where the va-cancy occurred after the general elec-tion, but the Senate still confirmed all three, whether up or down. So if you look to history, my col-league who said that we were in a situ-ation where we had been in the tradi-tion of not confirming people during an election year, 80 years of precedent not confirming a Supreme Court Justice in an election year, well, that is a phony, phony, incorrect, fallacious—insert your own adjective here—argument be-cause in our entire history, every sin-gle seat that became vacant in an elec-tion year was actually done by the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2239 April 4, 2017 
Senate before the next President took office. Three vacancies occurred after the general election. We saw the three in this chart here. John Jay in 1800, with the Adams administration, was nomi-nated to be Chief Justice on December 18 after Chief Justice Oliver Ellsworth retired. Jay was the first Chief Justice but retired in 1795 to serve as the sec-ond Governor of New York for two terms. After that, Jay’s nomination was confirmed in the Senate, and he ended up declining the position and re-tiring from public life instead. For those of you who are thinking about political trivia, who was the election-year nominee confirmed by the Senate? The vacancy occurred late in December. He was confirmed 3 days later and declined it. Now you know the answer. It is the nominee John Jay, who had served as Governor of New York for two terms. Adams was more successful when his second choice, John C. Marshall, was confirmed on January 27. That con-firmation happened after the term. In 1872 Ward Hunt was nominated by Ulysses Grant a month after easily winning reelection, on December 3, 1872, to replace the retiring Justice Samuel Nelson. Hunt was confirmed by the Senate 8 days after being nomi-nated. William Woods was nominated by Rutherford Hayes in 1880. He was nomi-nated to replace William Strong, who was stepping down while still in good health at the age of 72. That set an ex-ample for several infirm colleagues who refused to do the same. I hope his influence was substantial because that is one of the challenges of having a lifetime appointment—sometimes the Justices stay in office beyond their ability to exercise clear reasoning. It is a good example that William Strong set. As a member of the U.S. circuit court, Justice Woods was easily con-firmed by the Senate 39 to 8 on Decem-ber 21, 1880. He was the first person to be named to the Supreme Court from a former Confederate State. So there is another little bit of Supreme Court trivia. There were four vacancies that oc-curred before the general election but the nomination didn’t occur until afterward. Why did Presidents delay until afterward? This probably is a dif-ferent story in each case. We see basically a four-month delay with J.Q. Adams. We see it delayed an-other 9 months with President Buchanan. There was a delay of a cou-ple months by Lincoln and 3 months by Eisenhower. One reason might have been to clear from the heat of the elec-tion season. That would be interesting because that is essentially what Biden referred to when he said if a vacancy occurred in the heat of the election season in the summer, we should per-haps wait to act on it until after the election season is over, until after the election. John Crittenden was nominated in 1828 by John Quincy Adams. In 1828, a month after losing his bid for reelec-tion, President Adams nominated Mr. Crittenden to replace Justice Robert Trimble, who had died in August from malignant bilious fever. On February 12, the Senate voted to table his nomi-nation, but they acted. They acted in their advice and consent role, unlike what happened last year. Although President Adams’ nominee was not confirmed, he did receive a fair shot when the Senate voted on his nomina-tion on the Senate floor. Jeremiah Black was nominated in 1961 by President Buchanan. On Feb-ruary 5, 1861, President Buchanan nom-inated his Secretary of State, Jeremiah Black, to fill the seat of Justice Peter Daniel, who had passed away at the end of May. On February 21, 16 days later, the Senate rejected Mr. Black’s nomi-nation, and they rejected it by a single vote. They did so not by tabling the nomination but by rejecting the mo-tion to proceed to the nomination. There has been a change in Senate rules in regard to that motion to pro-ceed to a nomination. But again, even though his nomination was rejected by a single vote, Jeremiah Black still re-ceived the treatment of the Senate. The Senate acted. They considered and they acted. Salmon Chase in the Lincoln admin-istration, 1864. Chief Justice Roger Taney passed away October 12, 1864, and 2 months later, on December 6, 1864, after winning his reelection in a landslide, President Lincoln nominated his Treasury Secretary, Salmon Chase, to fill Chief Justice Taney’s seat. Well, in this case, on the same day he was nominated, December 6, 1864, the Sen-ate confirmed him and confirmed him by a voice vote. Well, I don’t think we are going to see another Senate or an-other Supreme Court nominee con-firmed by a voice vote for a very long time to come. William Brennan, Jr., was nominated by President Eisenhower in 1956. On October 15, just 2 weeks before the gen-eral election, Justice Sherman Minton stepped down because of his declining health. On that very same day, Eisen-hower named William Brennan, Jr., as his nominee. Then on January 14, the recently reelected Eisenhower offi-cially nominated Justice Brennan to the Supreme Court. First he was nomi-nated as a recess appointment—an-other interesting piece of Supreme Court trivia—but then in January he was renominated as a regular nominee to be considered by the Senate. The Senate was back in session, and his nomination—that is, the President’s nomination—did face opposition from the national news. They were worried that, as a Catholic, he might rely more on religious beliefs than on the Con-stitution. That is an interesting con-versation that is hard for us to identify with today. Justice Brennan was opposed by Sen-ator Joseph McCarthy because he made a speech decrying the overzealous Com-munist investigations as ‘‘witch hunts.’’ But on March 1957, Justice Brennan was confirmed by the Senate almost unanimously. The only ‘‘no’’ vote was Senator McCarthy. Let’s take another look at those va-cancies that occurred before the gen-eral election where the nomination also occurred before the general elec-tion. We have William Johnson in 1804, who was nominated by President Jef-ferson. On January 26, Justice Alfred Moore had stepped down because of de-clining health, and 2 months later, President Jefferson nominated William Johnson. Two days after that nomina-tion, he was confirmed to the Senate by a voice vote. Then we turn to a couple of nomina-tions the Senate considered, but they rejected them through votes to table the nomination. President Tyler nomi-nated Edward King in 1844. Justice Henry Baldwin passed away on April 21, and on June 5, President Tyler nom-inated Edward King to fill the seat. But the Senate did deliberate on that nomination and decided to reject it. They tabled it. Later that year, Tyler renominated King to fill the vacancy, but the Senate again voted to table the nomination. They said: What was said before still goes. Mr. King did not make it to the Su-preme Court, but he did have the op-portunity to present his case and have the Senate act on his nomination, not once but twice. In 1852 Edward Bradford was nomi-nated by the Fillmore administration. Edward Bradford was nominated on August 16, about a month after Justice John McKinley passed away. He too had his nomination tabled by Members of the Senate—by the full Senate—vot-ing and saying no, but they did act. They did vote—Melville Fuller under Cleveland. Now we get into a whole se-ries in which the Senate said yes, not only in reacting but in ‘‘we think you are qualified to serve on the Court.’’ They made it not just from the advice stage but to the consent stage. (Mr. SCOTT assumed the chair.) Justice Morrison Waite passed away in March of 1888, and President Grover Cleveland nominated Melville Fuller to fill the vacancy on April 30. Over the course of his nomination, Fuller faced opposition because he had avoided military service during the Civil War, and he had tried to block wartime leg-islation as a member of the Illinois House of Representatives. Those were the flaws that the Senate found as they vetted his nomination. He did not receive every vote in the Senate, but the Senate did act. The Senate voted, and they voted 41 to 20, by a 2-to-1 margin. The Senate looked at his record and said: Yes, it has flaws, but on balance, it is qualified and ap-propriate. And they confirmed him. President Harrison nominated George Shiras in 1892. Earlier in the year, in January, Justice Joseph Brad-ley had died, but it was not until July

19 that Harrison nominated George Shiras to fill that seat, which was still before the election. In spite of the 6- month period between the vacancy and the nomination, Shiras was confirmed, yet again, by a voice vote in the Senate one week after being nominated. Now we turn to the 20th century, the 1900s. President Wilson nominated Brandeis. This seat was open because, in January, Justice Joseph Lamar had died. Because Brandeis’ nomination was bitterly contested, it became the first time in American history that the Senate Judiciary Committee had held a public nomination hearing. Today, we think of the fact that nominations have always gone to the Judiciary Committee when, in fact, the Senate used to serve as a Committee of the Whole. The nomination came to the floor and was considered by the entire Senate—debated by the entire Senate— without there being a previous com-mittee action, committee hearing. Brandeis was the first for whom the Judiciary Committee held a hearing. He was denounced by a number of folks because they argued that he was unfit to serve. There was, by many people’s estimations, a heavy dose of anti-Semi-tism at work. Despite that, Justice Brandeis was confirmed by the Senate by a vote of 47 to 22. Then we turn to John Clark—also in 1916. Justice Charles Hughes had re-signed from the Court in June of that year in order to run for President against the sitting President, Woodrow Wilson. He is the only Supreme Court Justice ever to resign from the Court and run against a sitting President. In fact, as far as I know, he is, perhaps, the only one to resign from the Court and run for President at all. A month later, on July 14, Wilson nominated John Clark to fill the open seat. On July 24, 10 days later, the Senate con-firmed him. This brings us to Benjamin Cardozo in 1932. Benjamin, prior to Scalia’s dying, was the last of this group of nominees who had the vacancy occur before the election and the nomination occur before the election. Benjamin Cardozo was nominated on February 15 by President Herbert Hoover to replace retiring Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes. Because he was a Democrat who was appointed by a Republican President, his nomination is considered to be one of the few Supreme Court ap-pointments in which one could find no trace of partisanship. On February 24, 9 days after the nomination, Justice Cardozo received a unanimous voice vote by the Senate. So there are the 15 times that there has been a vacancy in an election year, and in all 15 times, there was action by the Senate until last year. That brings us to 2016 when the vacancy occurred, the nomination was made, and the Sen-ate chose not to act. We certainly have entered new terri-tory with this decision to amp up par-tisan tactics to pack the Court by stealing a Supreme Court seat. No one in this Chamber should be comfortable with that. For any of my colleagues who are feeling comfortable with it, just pause for a moment and ask your-self: Would you feel comfortable if the parties were reversed? If this were a Democratic majority stealing a Su-preme Court seat from a Republican President, I ask you: Would you feel comfortable if the tables were re-versed? I think, probably, every Member on the Republican side of the aisle would say it would be outrageous if the Democratic majority stole a seat—a tactic never before used in our his-tory—to deliver it to a future Demo-cratic President. That would be unac-ceptable. That is the ability to walk in someone else’s shoes and to look at an issue from the viewpoint of our obliga-tion to the institution rather than from simply advancing the desires of the short-term political rewards, if you will. For 293 days, no action was taken on the nomination. It was a complete break with Senate tradition, with Sen-ate precedent, with U.S. history. There were 16 nominations to fill a Supreme Court seat that became vacant in an election year, and only one seat was stolen—the seat that opened up when Antonin Scalia died and Merrick Gar-land was nominated. Among the hastily crafted pretexts for stealing this seat—and I mentioned this earlier, but I will mention it again—some raised the so-called ‘‘Biden rule.’’ There is no such rule in our rules, and there is no such speech that presented a rule. There was a speech in which Vice President Biden said that if there is an open seat, the Senate might be wise in an election year not to consider it in the heat of the election. That is simply a state-ment of respect for the Senate’s ability to be the cooling saucer, to have thoughtful dialogue that maybe could not take place in the final months of a Presidential campaign. I think most of us would say, if we had a nomination and we were coming together in September or October of an election year to consider it, maybe it would be better to wait until after the election in November to be able to have that thoughtful dialogue then. That is really merited by the impor-tance of a Supreme Court vacancy and nomination. Virtually everyone here would agree with the comment that Senator Biden made, but recognize this: His comment was in the abstract. There was no open seat. His comment was in the context of a speech in which he went on to say shortly thereafter, with regard to his theoretical situation in which he would consult with both sides of the aisle, if the President were to nominate some-body in the mainstream, he would probably win his vote, which was con-veniently left out by my colleagues who referred to this. The idea that we try to depoliticize and thoughtfully consider, which was the gist of Biden’s comment, is one we should all respect. If you have to go back to a comment that was made in a speech many, many years ago by one Senator in order to justify the stealing of a Supreme Court seat and if you ig-nore history, ignore precedent, and ig-nore the Constitution in order to do so, you really know that your argument is not just on shaky ground, but it has no grounds. I will read a little bit of what this was all about. These are the remarks I have that were given back then. It begins: 
Given the unusual rancor that prevailed in the (Clarence) Thomas nomination, the need for some serious reevaluation of the nomina-tion and confirmation process and the over-all level of bitterness that sadly affects our political system and this Presidential cam-paign already, it is my view that the pros-pects for anything but conflagration with re-spect to a Supreme Court nomination are re-mote. In my view, politics have played far too large a role in the Reagan-Bush nominations to date. One can only imagine that role be-come overarching if choices were made this year, assuming a Justice announced tomor-row that he or she was stepping down. Should a Justice resign this summer . . . actions that will occur just days before the Democratic Presidential Convention and weeks before the Republican Convention, it is a process already in doubt in the minds of many and would be become distrusted by all. Senate consideration of a nominee under these circumstances is not fair to the presi-dent, to the nominee, or to the Senate, itself. 
There it is. Depoliticize the debate that we are to have. Move that debate outside of the context of the heat of a campaign. He went on to say: 
President Bush should consider following the practice of [some] predecessors and not . . . name a nominee until after the Novem-ber election is completed. 
Get the nominee out of the heat of the political campaign. That was actu-ally something that we saw in a couple of these nominees. These are cases in which the vacancies occurred before the elections, and the Presidents wait-ed until after the elections to name the nominees. That is the essence of what Biden was referring to: Get the nomi-nation out of the heat of the campaign. I do think that you have such an im-balance in this argument to anyone who opens his eyes to the conversation. You have, on the one side, our history of 15 vacancies during an election year, when the Senate acted on all 15 before Antonin Scalia died. On that same side of the scale, you have our constitu-tional responsibility to provide advice and consent. On the other side of the scale, you have a comment by former Senator Biden, then Vice President Biden, who was saying, actually, take a nomination out of the heat of political passion for it to be considered, which is completely consistent with our his-tory. It is the Constitution and our history versus an out-of-context comment made by a former Senator, in a theo-retical situation, but he actually did

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2241 April 4, 2017 
not say what folks said he said. It is clear where the weight of this argu-ment lies. That is what makes it such a transparent transgression against our Constitution, a transparent trans-gression against the integrity of the Senate because the majority leader asked the Senators not to do their con-stitutional responsibility to provide advice and consent, a transgression against the Supreme Court because we now have a stolen seat and a precedent that will haunt the legitimacy of the Supreme Court for decades to come should we proceed down this route, should we continue with this conversa-tion, should we have a vote, and should we—and I so hope we do not conclude with this theft being fully accom-plished this week. It is such significant damage to everything—our institu-tions, the credibility of the Court, our responsibilities. Well, some have said: Why filibuster? Every time I say ‘‘filibuster’’ it gets very confusing because it is hard for people to think—what does ‘‘filibuster’’ mean? Is it speaking at length? Well, yes, it is. In some historical context, speaking at length has delayed action. It was the set of speeches when Wood-row Wilson wanted to arm commercial ships before World War I that pre-vented the Senate from acting to ap-prove that. Those speeches were around the clock. By the way, the term ‘‘filibuster,’’ where does it come from? What does it mean? Well, it is, I guess, an evolution of the word ‘‘freebooter.’’ A freebooter was a pirate, so I guess you could say piracy. The folks who spoke at length to stop consideration of putting arms on our commercial ships took over the Senate and didn’t let it act. But that is one way to view it. Another way of viewing it is that we had the courtesy of hearing everyone in the original Senate. The Senate got rid of the direct motion to close debate because they didn’t need it, because they wanted to hear from everyone. It is a tradition of letting everyone be heard and protecting that tradition. So now that we have restored this motion to close debate, where the Sen-ate rules require a supermajority, they were basically saying most of the time we are going to hear everybody out. It will take the large bulk of the Senators to close debate. That was used in a very few circumstances—almost never on a motion to proceed, almost never on an amendment, and rarely on final passage of a bill because it was consid-ered that the Senate needs to act. It is a legislative body. On the other hand, we don’t want to have this place be paralyzed. To use the analogy of George Wash-ington’s cooling saucer, he said the Senate should be a cooling saucer, not a deep freeze. But too often, the abuse has resulted in the Senate being unable and paralyzed to act. So here we stand with this concept that it is hard to put your hands around, and many of us are saying we should not close the debate on this nominee, if such a debate—if such a vote is held on Thursday, we should vote against closing debate. In the modern Senate rules, that is what a fil-ibuster is; you are voting against clos-ing debate. It comes down to this: 60 Senators have to be supportive for someone to be on the Supreme Court. That is to protect the integrity of the Court so that you don’t have nominees from the extreme edges. The President, knowing that the Senate might not have 60 votes for someone from ex-tremes, is thereby encouraged to produce a nominee that is someone from the mainstream. That is the power of the supermajority. And hav-ing people from the mainstream of ju-dicial thought sustains the integrity of the Court in the eyes of the citizens. That is why many of us believe that we should vote against closing debate. If we close debate on Thursday—and let me repeat again that this is the first time in U.S. history that the ma-jority leader has filed a petition to close debate on the very first day of de-bate, the first time another of this stream of incredibly partisan tactics designed to pack the Court—the first time in U.S. history. It takes two days before the vote can actually be held. The majority leader announced to file the petition earlier today, and the vote cannot be held until Thursday. When that vote is held, there will be at least 41 Senators who say we should not close debate. In other words, there will not be a super-majority of 60 necessary to close de-bate. That is what I am predicting. That is what my crystal ball says. Why do I believe that there will not be 60 Senators to vote to close debate? Well, I will tell you now that I can say that is very likely because at least 41 Senators have announced that they will vote against cloture. They have made their announcements. Turn the clock back to when I first stood up and said: This seat is stolen, and we should not vote to close debate. We must filibuster, which means the same thing under the rules of the Sen-ate. I said this in order to stop the theft of Supreme Court seat-stealing. If this theft is successful, it will damage the Court forever, and it will result in not just the integrity of the Court being damaged, but the different deci-sions—a different set of decisions be-cause, while we don’t know exactly how Merrick Garland and Neil Gorsuch would vote on any individual case, we know from their records that one is straight down the middle and the other is on the very, very far right from a list vetted by two rightwing Repub-lican organizations. So we can ask: Did the President ask the nominee how they would vote on this case or that case? Take, for example, the right of a woman to reproductive health that she feels is correct, keeping the politicians out of the exam room. Well, what we know is that the nominee before us at this moment came through a process of rightwing vetting through two organi-zations before being put on a list that was sent to the President. So we have a pretty good idea of how the nominee is going to vote on this issue. The nominee wouldn’t answer any questions before the Judiciary Com-mittee. It was pretty much what you would call a farce: a question asked, a question not answered; a question asked, a question not answered; a ques-tion asked, a question not answered. A number of my colleagues went into that Judiciary Committee hearing feel-ing they were really open to hearing the judicial thought and seeing if this nominee was really as far off the charts as everything else indicated. And the fact that he refused to answer a ques-tion over a week of hearings basically said to them, yes, now we know; now we know the answer. So it is to protect the integrity of the Court that we must not close this debate on Thursday. That is why we want to insist on keeping the 60-vote standard. That is why the 60-vote standard exists. There are some who have said: Hey, maybe we should try to figure out a way that we can preserve the 60-vote standard by not really using it as a tool for this particular nominee, and by not making it an issue, we have a tool for their future. It is kind of like coming into a confrontation and a per-son has a confrontation and they pull out their swords, and then say: I am going to lay down this sword and let you have your way until next time be-cause that way I will still have my sword when I come back again. So you come back again next time: Oh, I have to lay down my sword again. What are they confronting? Why are they saying we should perhaps consider not honoring the tradition of utilizing the 60 votes when there is a cloud over a nominee—not utilize the filibuster? There is this goal of saying: Well, that way maybe we keep the rule as it is. And why are they worried about that? Because the majority has said that they will consider changing the rule. Well, many of us have a message for the majority—a message based on the way the Senate has acted over hun-dreds of years. If you don’t have the votes, change the nominee, not the rule. That is the way it has been done time after time after time. On those 15 occasions when there was an open seat prior to Antonin Scalia passing away, the Senate didn’t approve every nomi-nee; they rejected several of them, but they considered every single one. And when they were rejected, they didn’t change the rule; the President changed the nominee. That is what should hap-pen in this case. Some have said: Well, we have seen such disrespect for the Constitution. We have seen the urging of the major-ity leadership to not exercise our ad-vice and consent responsibility under the Senate last year, and they made it happen. They enforced it. We have seen

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES2242 April 4, 2017 
the first-ever filing of a cloture peti-tion to close debate on a Supreme Court nominee on the first day of a Senate debate; it has never happened before, to ram this through in a way never seen before in U.S. history. And is it too much to imagine that the Sen-ate majority would also, instead of fol-lowing Senate tradition when a nomi-nee doesn’t have the votes and telling the President to change the nominee, would instead change the rules? Yes, it is possible, when you look at that. But that is a decision that we can’t control on our side. When we looked at the tremendous obstruction that was being used for ex-ecutive nominations and lower court nominations, we had to find a way to quit having advice and consent being used as a tool of legislative destruction against the other branches of govern-ment. Our whole Constitution was founded on three coequal branches of govern-ment, but you can’t have three coequal branches if one branch wields a tool—a tool that was intended to be used very rarely—of rejecting nominees when nominees weren’t suitable, using it as a wholesale power to destroy the execu-tive branch and undermine the judici-ary. So we addressed that in 2013, but we left in place the supermajority for the Supreme Court. In some ways, you can think of the fact that, well, we tol-erate a wide range of positions coming out of the lower courts. There is a check and balance there. It is called the Supreme Court. But there is no check to the Supreme Court. They are the final decision maker. That is why you leave in place the supermajority requirement to tell a President: Do not nominate from the extremes. We have a President who likes to, well, I would say run counter to tradi-tion. So that is maybe part of the ap-peal and why he is in the office. He looked at the power of the Senate, and we don’t know if he even actually un-derstood any of the background as to why we had a supermajority to close debate, why we had a 60-vote require-ment. He said that he didn’t care; he was going to nominate from the ex-treme anyway. And having nominated from the extreme, now the same groups that want extreme rulings for the pow-erful and the privileged are pushing tremendously hard, just as they did last year, for the majority to steal the seat in the first place. But aren’t we 100 individuals who could possibly set aside those tremen-dous pressures from those powerful dark-money interests and actually do the right thing for the Constitution and the Senate and the Supreme Court? Don’t we have the ability, the soul, the insight to defend this institu-tion at this moment? What everyone here must understand is that when peo-ple look back—if the decision this week is to destroy the 60-vote require-ment that tempers the nominations to the final decider about what our Con-stitution needs—this is stripping away a key element in protecting the integ-rity of the Court, and it will be looked on as a very, very dark moment in which the Senate failed in its responsi-bility. Let us not fail. Let’s have some Sen-ators who will remember that they stood up on that podium and they took an oath of office, and that had to do with advice and consent which was vio-lated last year. Embedded in that was the responsibility to protect this insti-tution and the rest of the other two branches of government, so they could function in a way our Founders in-tended them to. I know that come Thursday, if there is a motion to change the interpreta-tion of the rule—the way this works is that the majority won’t actually change the rule. They will change the interpretation of the rule. For all prac-tical purposes, it is basically the same thing. At that moment, we are going to be put to the test. The reason it is called the nuclear option is because changing a rule—a basic function of the Senate, designed to protect the integrity of the Supreme Court—and undermining and damaging the integrity is like blowing up the in-stitution. That is why it is nuclear. It is the big bomb. It is the most destruc-tive weapon known in the legislative arsenal. There will be some Members, I know, who will hesitate, some from the view-point that they have a responsibility to protect the institution. There will be others who will hesitate from political expediency. They will say: Yes, this is a pretty good deal to get the justice in place that our backers want. But on the other hand, the shoe might be on the other foot in 4 years. There may be a Democratic President, and maybe that President gets three nominations. If we blow up this rule, there will be nothing to temper the type of appoint-ment made by that future President. That is something I am sure people will consider. Apart from the out-of-context, stand-ing-on-its-head example from Vice President Biden’s speech, the other ar-gument was: Well, let’s let the Amer-ican citizens decide. That was the sec-ond excuse for stealing the seat. Well, the people did speak. They spoke when they elected Barack Obama in the first election, and they spoke again when they elected him for the second elec-tion. They didn’t elect him to serve 3 years out of 4, but to serve 4 years out of 4. They didn’t elect him to execute his constitutional responsibilities 3 years out of 4. They elected him to serve his responsibilities, including nomination responsibilities, for 4 out of 4. He won that second term by a margin of over 5 million votes. That is a big margin. President Trump lost the citizens’ vote by a margin of over 3 million votes. That is a pretty big dis-parity. It is an 8 million vote disparity between Obama’s victory and Trump’s loss of the citizen vote. So if we want to have the people have a voice, they have weighed clearly and President Obama considered his nominee. As to the fact that they wanted the people to weigh in, they weighed in and said they trusted Hillary Clinton more than Don-ald Trump to execute the responsibil-ities of office. That is the citizen vote by more than 3 million. When the President campaigned, he said: I am going to drain the swamp, I am going to take on Wall Street, and I am going to help out workers. We have seen quite the opposite. The very first action he made—the very first action— was to make it $500 a year more expen-sive for families of modest means to buy a house. How does that possibly fit with fighting for working Americans? How does that possibly fit with that? Then he put forward a plan on healthcare—TrumpCare—in partner-ship with Ryan. Ryan wants it to be called TrumpCare; Trump wants it to be called RyanCare. Neither one wants their name on it because it takes away healthcare from 24 million Americans. It makes healthcare out of reach for working Americans. That certainly wasn’t fighting for working Americans, stripping healthcare. It is, basically, a weapon that hurts in two ways: If you don’t have access to healthcare, you are worried that your loved one won’t get the care they need. Then you are worried that if you do find access by basically paying much higher rates than anyone with insurance has, you will be bankrupt, and America had this vast number of bankruptcies. So Trump, who campaigned on help-ing workers, said: I am going to strip away your healthcare. I am going to take away your peace of mind that your loved one will get care. We are going to return to a world where, if you do find care, you will be bankrupt. How do you like that plate of potatoes? Working America didn’t like it. They called Capitol Hill and said: Stop this diabolical plan to undermine healthcare. Stop this plan. They said it on phone calls, they said it on emails, they said it at the townhalls, and the House abandoned the plan due to the outcry of workers across America who had finally—finally—found access to healthcare, thanks to the Affordable Care Act. Then President Trump sends his anti- worker budget—what they called the skinny budget, the outline of the budg-et—over here to Capitol Hill. I was out doing townhalls in rural Oregon, and I think I got much the same reaction that probably everyone else did across the Nation. This wasn’t America first. This was rural America last, including rural workers—especially rural work-ers. The President campaigned for work-ers. He makes buying a home more ex-pensive. He tries to strip away their healthcare, and, then, he hits them with a budget in rural America that will devastate their communities. You have a challenge with affordable hous-ing? I am going to take away a good share of the housing grants used as a

flexible tool. You have other chal-lenges in your community that you use community development block grants for. We are going to strip those as well. Your rural county has a lot of Fed-eral land? This is probably more true in the West, where I come from, than in many other States. Your rural coun-ty has a lot of Federal land so you are compensated through Payment in Lieu of Taxes, the PILT Program? I am going to devastate that program. Your rural community has essential air service? Well, we don’t need that. Let’s take that away. We don’t need air service in rural America. It made me think about the airport in Klamath Falls, in my home State. Klamath Falls is not on an interstate. I–5 goes down through Medford and goes through Ashland. So it travels further west, on into California, not through Klamath Falls. We have some very substantial man-ufacturing capability in Klamath Falls. We have an F–15 base. Both of those are essential to the community. But to keep that manufacturing there, to keep those companies there, to keep that airbase there, we have to have a func-tioning airport. The company that was servicing that town stopped, moved their assets somewhere else, and left that town stranded. I immediately called the mayor and called the House Member representing that district and said: We have to get air service back. The managers of the manufacturing capability in doors and windows are not going to want to have their operation in a place they can’t fly into. Flying into Medford and driving a dangerous, winding mountain road for well over an hour—often impassable or very dangerous in winter—is not going to cut it. We have to restore that air service. We went to work and we teamed up. We teamed up with col-leagues across the aisle. Why did we undertake this? Because air service was essential to that economy. So here is President Trump, sending a ‘‘rural America last’’ budget which devastates rural air. Let’s talk about the Coast Guard. Or-egon is a coastal State. My colleague presiding is from a coastal State. Our Coast Guard is pretty important to our States. But President Trump said: Let’s savage the Coast Guard. Here is the thing. The Coast Guard actually stops a lot of bad things from hap-pening along our coastlines. They save lives, and they stop drug traffickers. Ere is Trump’s anti-worker budget: Let’s take away the wall along the ocean—the Coast Guard—which stops drugs and other bad things from hap-pening, and rescues people, and spend it on a wall on the southern border. What? I thought, Mr. President, you said the wall on the southern border was going to be paid for by some other country—that country on the southern side of the border, not the American taxpayers. You are going to essentially take away that virtual wall of defense along our coastlines in order to build this wall on the southern border? I went down on a congressional dele-gation to meet with Mexican officials in Mexico City. We met with the Attor-ney General. We met with the head of their economic policy. We met with a whole group of Mexican senators, and we heard a lot. But what I found even more interesting was going to the bor-der on the American side and talking to the American experts on the border. We asked them: How do drugs come across the border? They said: Well, they come through freight. There is so much freight mov-ing. You can tuck drugs into a freight truck. We find some of them but not most of them. They said: Second of all, it comes across in tunnels. The tunnels are very expensive to build. They are often very long, well-engineered, and very expen-sive. You don’t use them for people be-cause they would be easily detected then and shut down and you would lose your investment. You use them to bring drugs into the country. The point the border experts made is that the wall will be useless against stopping drugs from coming into our country because the drugs come through freight and they come through tunnels, but they don’t come through backpacks. OK. That was interesting for the President to argue that was something he was going to address, to stop this massive inflow of people com-ing from Mexico to the United States. We looked at statistics, and it turns out that over the last 8 years, the net flow has been out of our country to Mexico, not into our country from Mexico—by a million people. So that is really a situation where you have the triple threat against workers that President Trump is ap-plying—making home ownership more expensive, proceeding to take healthcare away from millions of American families, and putting forward a budget that savages rural America in method after method after method. I am sure my colleagues will work on both sides of the aisle to stop the sav-aging of rural America, but clearly that is the President’s vision. That was the worker part. Then you had the ‘‘I am going to take on Wall Street’’ part. What did he do? He put the economy under the con-trol of Wall Street. He had attacked a colleague here in the Senate from Texas during the primary campaign for his ties to Goldman Sachs. He attacked his general election opponent, Hillary Clinton, for ties to Goldman Sachs. Then he puts Goldman Sachs in charge of our economy, Treasury Secretary, strategic adviser. The list goes on and on. So much for taking on Wall Street. Then there is the ‘‘drain the swamp’’ proposition. Well, big, powerful, fabu-lously rich folks deeply connected to those interests—that is the Cabinet. So you have Big Oil and big banks and bil-lionaires. That is the Cabinet. That is the swamp Cabinet. So all three promises the President made, after he lost by 3 million votes, he has gone on to devastate over the last few months. That is the founda-tion for saying ‘‘Let the people speak’’? The people spoke against—they voted majority against this President. They voted vastly for the election of Barack Obama, and the vacancy occurred on Obama’s watch. This is a seat stolen from one Presidency and shipped to an-other with the packing the Court and a flimsy excuse from a quote from Biden taken out of context, a flimsy excuse of ‘‘Let the people speak.’’ When the peo-ple spoke, they supported President Obama by this vast number of popular vote. And Trump lost. So I guess the people did speak, but they spoke to the opposite side. So much for the founda-tion for this crime against our Con-stitution. Speaking of the President, it is unac-ceptable that we are considering this nomination at this moment. At this moment, when the Trump campaign is under investigation—an investigation being conducted by the FBI, another investigation by the House Intelligence Committee, and another investigation by the Senate Intelligence Com-mittee—it is unacceptable that we are considering this nomination at this moment when there is a cloud over the Presidency because of the conduct dur-ing the campaign. We know some things, and we don’t know others. We know that Russia sought to influence the U.S. election. We know they used an extraordinarily intense, carefully crafted strategy to influence the American election. What we don’t know is the full extent of the conversations between the Trump cam-paign and the Russians who sought to get Trump elected. We don’t know that. That is why we are having inves-tigations. If those investigations find that there was collaboration between the Trump campaign and the Russian Gov-ernment, that is traitorous conduct— conspiring with an enemy to attack the institution at the foundation of our democratic republic, our elections. That is a very big deal, and that is why this debate should not be here on the Senate floor until that issue is fully addressed. We should not have the sit-ting President’s nominee debated with the potential of being put on the Su-preme Court when many questions re-main about whether they conspired with a foreign government to under-mine and tip the election we held in November. Then there is the fact that the nomi-nee is an extreme far-right nominee, even further right than Justice Scalia or Justice Thomas. Analyzing the opinions of the Tenth Circuit since Judge Gorsuch joined in 2006, the Washington Post found that Gorsuch’s actual voting behavior sug-gests that he is to the right of both Alito and Thomas, and by a substantial margin. The magnitude of the gap be-tween Gorsuch and Thomas is roughly the same as the gap between Justice Sotomayor and Justice Kennedy during

the same time. In fact, our results sug-gest that Gorsuch and Justice Scalia would be as far apart as Justices Breyer and Chief Justice Roberts. Gorsuch has advocated far-right con-servative positions—not ‘‘we the peo-ple’’ positions, ‘‘we the powerful’’ over the people positions—positions even Scalia has opposed. This nomination matters. Are we going to have decisions that reflect our Constitution, ‘‘we the people’’ deci-sions, or decisions that turn our Con-stitution on its head and create a gov-ernment of, by, and for the powerful? We have a 4–4 split—the analysis of de-cisions to concede the twin peaks. Dec-ades ago, we would have probably seen a single bell curve, not twin peaks, but what used to be here has migrated. Half of the Court migrated over there, as the Court has gotten further and further away from the fundamental vi-sion of the five-vote majority. The Court now, without Scalia, is split 4 to 4, so this nominee will change the bal-ance of the Court. There is certainly an opportunity to put in somebody who is straight down the middle. We didn’t really know ex-actly where Justice Merrick Garland would end up, and by all counts, it was anticipated he would be right down the middle. We know something different about Neil Gorsuch. The Court is split 4 to 4 now, and this nomination will change that balance. That is a very im-portant reason that accentuates why this nomination should be set aside until we know if the President’s team conspired with the Russians. We should clear up that cloud first. I am going to go back and review some of the cases that give us substan-tial concern. I am going to try to lo-cate more details. Meanwhile, I will just share a little bit about the record of 5-to-4 decisions. Senator W
HITEHOUSE has proceeded to do an analysis—or shared an anal-ysis done by others—to look at 5-to-4 decisions of the Court and what has happened in recent memory. Were those decisions designed to accentuate the ability of powerful special interests that changed the makeup of the body? Was it that sort of interference? Was it interference that favored corporations or decisions that favored corporations over people? If I can get the details, I will go through it in detail. What this analysis found was that the previous decisions of the Court with Scalia on it made campaign fi-nance decisions and other decisions re-lated to things like the Voting Rights Act that made it harder to have the elections that really reflected the voice of the people. Let me give some context. The Vot-ing Rights Act was passed in 1965. It was passed because different groups around America were messing with the elections to try to keep people from voting. There were elements of this that went way back in our history. There were tests that were applied, constitutional tests. African Ameri-cans might try to seek to register to vote and would be given a test that was an impossible question to answer. The same test would be given to White vot-ers. There were all sorts of strategies to try to bias the election process. So it was a big deal in 1965, and the Senate and the House said: No, we are not going to allow these types of tac-tics to be developed and utilized be-cause they are an attack on the rights of Americans—the fundamental right to vote, to have a voice, and to help di-rect the direction of our country by campaigning and voting for those who have a better vision of where we are going to go. So Congress acted and did so by say-ing: If you have new strategies for how you are going to control the elections, you are going to have to get those strategies preapproved because the record in your particular State has been that you abused those strategies to suppress the fundamental right of individuals to vote. So one of those decisions was to say by a 5-to-4 decision: We are going to take away the power of the Voting Rights Act—which is almost unexplainable. The argument was more or less a version of, we don’t need this anymore. We moved past that. We don’t have the same problem. So we should have the same rules for all the States. But what we immediately saw with the lifting of the Voting Rights Act was that those States that were under the Voting Rights Act immediately started working to do voter-suppres-sion tactics—efforts to prevent individ-uals from voting in all kinds of ways— phony ID strategies, all sorts of manip-ulation of the precincts. (Mr. CRAPO assumed the Chair.) So it matters. The fifth seat on the Court matters a great deal. We have six decisions that have flooded the elec-tions with special interest money and affected access to the ballot. In these 5- to-4 decisions, the people have lost in all six cases. So I am going to share those. Then there are 16 cases in which there have been 5-to-4 decisions. In all 16, the 5-to-4 Court ruled in favor of the corporations over the people. So in terms of campaign shenanigans, we have lost in 5-to-4 decisions 6 to 0. When I say ‘‘we,’’ I am talking about the American people who care about the integrity of elections have lost all six times under the Court that Scalia was on. On corporations over people, we have lost 16 to 0. I will start sharing these cases to show how much this matters. Let’s look at the issue of unleashing corporate spending. Citizens United v. the FEC in 2010. Under the First Amendment, donations and political contributions are considered free speech. The government does not have the right to keep corporations from spending money on political can-didates. Money may not be given di-rectly to candidates but instead may be spent on any other means necessary to persuade the public. The decision held that political speech is crucial to a democracy and that it is equally as important when coming from corporations. So it essen-tially said: Look, if we translate that, what that means is that you have a group who was designed to take small amounts of investments from many, many people and combine them to-gether to create the ability to take on larger commercial enterprises. That is a corporation. They sell shares. People provide funds through those shares. They provide those funds to the cor-poration by buying the shares, and the corporation can take on the big projects. Out of those sometimes hundreds of thousands of shareholders, there is a small group, a board who decides how that money is spent. So you don’t have the shareholders deciding how that money is spent; you have the small board. They aren’t spending their own money; they are spending other peo-ple’s money without asking their per-mission. Are you kidding me? This entity didn’t exist in this form. The Constitu-tion didn’t say that corporations are people and that these entities that really didn’t even exist then have the same rights of ‘‘free speech.’’ The Con-stitution didn’t say money is speech. No. Remember Jefferson’s mother prin-ciple, which was that we will only make decisions and be successful as a democratic republic if each citizen has its equal voice. Citizens United is the opposite. It says: Those who sit on the board of gazillion-dollar corporations get a voice that is a gazillion times larger than the voice of an ordinary citizen. It is a complete contravention of the Constitution, and it is deeply corrupting and damaging our Nation. That is the 5-to-4 Citizens United case. Then there was the American Tradi-tion Partnership v. Bullock case in 2012. That overturned a Montana Su-preme Court decision that banned cor-porations from spending money on po-litical candidates and campaigns and found that political speech is protected regardless of the source, even when it comes from a corporation. In other words, Citizens United applies to this case as well. The four dissenting judges did not be-lieve that the Court was ready to re-view the same issues as discussed in Citizens United in spite of the fact that Montana’s Supreme Court had noted the extreme power of corporations in politics. OK, what is the story behind this? Montana was controlled by the copper kings. Back about 100 years ago, the people said: Enough. We want Montana to be controlled by the people of Mon-tana, not by this vast concentration of special interest money that is making all the decisions. So they passed a law, and they kept corporate money out of their elections to restore the integrity of elections. The Supreme Court turned a deaf ear on that case.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2245 April 4, 2017 
How about McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission in 2014, which eliminated aggregate campaign limits. The decision found that aggregate cam-paign limits are invalid under the First Amendment because they restrict po-litical expression. Aggregate limits do not further the government’s interest in preventing the appearance of corrup-tion—one of the main goals under the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act. They also found that corporations cannot be limited in the number of po-litical candidates they donate to, as this restricts the influence of the cor-porations which they were equating to free speech. So this was another erosion of the ef-fort to have the vision Jefferson spoke to, the mother’s principle that the gov-ernment would express the will of the people. That is the same basic idea that Lincoln had when he phrased it in his famous address and said ‘‘govern-ment of the people, by the people, for the people.’’ But if you allow this vast concentration of money to be spent on campaigns to corrupt those campaigns, it is not government of, by, and for the people. It is like the copper kings. It is the fossil fuel kings. It is the Koch brothers running it. In the Copper King case in the State of Montana, which Montana shrugged off and reclaimed and restored their government—versus the situation we have at the national level now with a similar parallel—the fossil fuel kings, the coal kings, the oil kings putting vast sums in—to Citizens United. There was a case that had to do with whether laws were OK that restricted judicial candidates from directly solic-iting donations for their campaign. My memory is that the Court said: You know what, it is OK to restrict judges who are directly soliciting donations because that would affect and bias their decisions and it would create the appearance of bias. So there was the re-ality of bias and the perception of bias. In other words, it would corrupt the courts. So on an issue involving Justices, that ‘‘we the powerful’’ group—Rob-erts, Alito, Thomas, Scalia, Kennedy— that group said: Do you know what? No. No, we can’t let money corrupt the election of judges. But none of them have served in the Senate or the House, and they couldn’t translate the fact that they wanted to defend the integrity of judges and that that was important under the Con-stitution and allow restrictions on how campaigns were done—they couldn’t translate that to the bias and the cor-ruption of what happens here. I mean, anyone looking at the United States can see that a few years ago, we had a whole host of Republican envi-ronmentalists who cared about the next generation and the generation after and fought for clean air and fought for clean water. It was Presi-dent Nixon who put forward the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act. It was President Nixon and the Repub-licans who proceeded to create the En-vironmental Protection Agency. But what happened when the fossil fuel money fueled the campaigns that created the new Republican majority in the Senate? All concern for the envi-ronment was gone. That is corruption, plain and simple. The Supreme Court—five Justices— proceeded to rubberstamp that it is OK to have that corruption—the complete opposite of the vision of our Constitu-tion. They understood it when it was for judges, but they found for the pow-erful and the privileged and supported the corruption when it came to this body and the House. Then there is the suppression of ac-cess to the ballot box. The Shelby County v. Holder decision of 2013 struck down section 4 of the Voting Rights Act, which included a suspen-sion on many of the prerequisites or tests to vote. The Court held that this part of the Voting Rights Act no longer reflects the current conditions of vot-ing. The formulae for determining whether a State can change its voting laws should no longer be federally re-viewed, the Court said. The decision declares that this sec-tion puts undue burden on local gov-ernment during elections. Really? We saw how the fundamental right of citi-zens to vote was savaged in these States before the Voting Rights Act, and we have seen how those practices have returned after the Supreme Court struck down section 4 of the Voting Rights Act. That is why it matters. Let’s take a look at Bartlett v. Strickland in 2009, a case that affirmed the North Carolina Supreme Court de-cision that the State’s redistricting plan does not violate the Voting Rights Act section 2. State officials do not have to ensure that minority voters have the opportunity to join with crossover voters to elect a minority candidate. In this case, the Court found that the vote would not be diluted because the minority was comprised of less than 50 percent of the voting population. Due to the fact that the African-American minority was only 39 percent on the voting population, State officials had no requirement to redraw district lines. What are we talking about here in real terms? Is gerrymandering OK to change the outcome of the congres-sional delegation? And the Court said it is OK. Then there was Vieth v. Jubelirer— redistricting of a Pennsylvania con-gressional delegation from a Repub-lican-controlled State legislature to favor Republican congressional elec-tions. The Pennsylvania General As-sembly was challenged by Vieth—that is the name of the challenger—that the redrawing of the lines was political gerrymandering, violating Article I and the equal protection clause in the 14th Amendment. The opinion of the lower courts was affirmed, and Scalia wrote the four- member plurality which dismissed the case due to the fact that the Justices could not agree on an appropriate rem-edy for political gerrymandering. Scalia wrote the four-member plu-rality. Kennedy wrote a concurring opinion—so it is 5-to-4—but sought a narrow ruling so that the Court would still seek a solution. Well, the bottom line is that in a 5- to-4 Court, that fifth vote matters. In these six cases, the decisions were all in favor of undoing the vision of voter empowerment and supporting the strategy of voter suppression, undoing the restrictions on gerrymandering to change the makeup of the congres-sional delegation or the makeup of State delegations and supporting such bias being written into the system. These 5-to-4 decisions were all about allowing the most powerful, richest people to have a voice equivalent to a stadium sound system that drowns out the people in a position completely contrary to the equal-voice premise that Jefferson called the mother’s pro-vision, the foundation for whether or not our government would be able to make decisions that reflected the will of the people. Then there is a set of decisions 5-to- 4 opinions that were relevant to cor-porations over individual rights, and some of those overlap: Citizens United, McCutcheon, the American Tradition Partnership v. Bullock that we have al-ready covered. Let’s look at some of the others. How about Burwell v. Hobby Lobby. Fighting to require corporations to provide female employees free access to contraceptives violates the Reli-gious Freedom Restoration Act. The Court held that Congress intended RFRA to be applied to corporations. Corporations face a significant burden if they are forced to fund an action that goes against the corporation’s re-ligious beliefs. So let’s give corpora-tions a soul that has a religious belief. So not only has the Court extended the vision to corporations that they are somehow the equivalent to a super-rich bazillionaire individual, but they also have a soul and a religious belief. So concentrating this fantastic concentra-tion of power and realizing that if the corporation made the decisions on the basis of the stockholders, with all of them having, essentially, input—but they don’t because that is not the way a corporation works. You have a very difficult time trying to influence the thinking of a board of directors. You can make efforts. Rarely you might have a successful vote by a group of shareholders who take something to the annual meeting. But in general, that board operates in a world all its own, and they are spending the money—not their own money; they are spending the money of the stock-holders without disclosing it to them. They actually steal the political speech by using the money in political speech without disclosing what it is. But that was the decision in Burwell

which gave a corporation the ability to follow its religious choices—that is, the board’s religious choices—over the workers’ religious choices in an area as sensitive as women’s access to repro-ductive birth control. Let’s turn to Walmart v. Duke in 2011, a class action lawsuit brought by six women against Walmart claiming that Walmart policies resulted in lower pay and longer time for women to ac-quire a promotion—lower pay and longer time to get a promotion. The Supreme Court found that the six women who were applying could not represent a class of the 1.5 million women employed by Walmart. They found that the employment decisions for this large number of people did not have enough commonality to be rep-resented in one case—a 5-to-4 decision. In a class action lawsuit, you have principals, and they represent a class of folks who have been treated simi-larly. Certainly this is an example of where in general you would expect that the experience these women had could represent the experience that women were getting at Walmart as employees, but the Court turned them down 5-to-4. Four said these women and other like- treated individuals deserve a hearing, and the majority of five said: No, no, no, let’s protect Walmart. Let’s look at American Express Com-pany v. Italian Colors Restaurant. Sev-eral merchants of the American Ex-press credit card company brought in-dividual cases alleging that the com-pany’s card acceptance agreements vio-late antitrust laws. The Supreme Court found that the American Express clause prohibiting class action lawsuits is enforceable. The high cost of bring-ing cases forward on an individual basis, which is impossible for an indi-vidual to do, was not a sufficient rea-son for the Court to override the com-pany. Federal antitrust law does not guarantee a cost-effective process. So here you have a 5-to-4 decision in which, again, you have individuals who have been on the receiving end of bad practices or at least alleged bad prac-tices by a financial company saying: We were shorted a few dollars or maybe a few hundred dollars, but we can’t pos-sibly take on this powerful company’s enormous office building full of law-yers unless we have a class action where we have everyone who has been similarly affected able to bring their case at one time, with one set of rep-resentatives, so that maybe there will be a little bit of a fair playing field. You can’t hire lawyers. It will cost you $1 million to hire lawyers to pur-sue a $100 issue. So unless there is a class action, there is no justice. It is justice denied and a green path for predatory practices by the large and powerful. Five-to-four decisions mat-ter. Comcast Corporation v. Behrend. SCOTUS ruled that a district court is not allowed to certify a class action lawsuit without acceptable evidence that the damages can be measured on a class-wide basis. They found that the lower court failed to properly establish the impact of the damages on all of the plaintiffs. Courts must find that the model to prove damages are class-wide and quantifiable. Let’s translate this. What does this mean? The Court, on a 5-to-4 basis, is setting very high standards for estab-lishing the legitimacy of a class action lawsuit. You have to be able to prove that the entire class is affected, not just probably, and it is quantifiable. So they are making it very difficult. Four Justices said: No, that is ridicu-lous. That is absurd. That is a standard that makes no sense. But the five rul-ing for the powerful and privileged said: OK, we can tighten this up and make it harder to challenge predatory actions by large corporations. We have AT&T v. Concepcion. Cus-tomers of AT&T brought a class action claiming that the company’s offer of a free phone was a scam because they were still charged the sales tax on the new phone. It wasn’t free; they had to pay a tax. SCOTUS found that the Federal Arbi-tration Act displaces State law stop-ping companies from offering contracts that do not allow class action lawsuits. Therefore States cannot make laws that allow companies to prohibit their customers from bringing forward class actions. But the bottom line is that the way this was framed, it had an impact of a 5-to-4 decision with corporations over people. Janus Capital Group v. First Deriva-tive Traders in 2011. Most folks didn’t even know there were these many cases affecting power-ful corporations and their predatory practices and the ability of ordinary people to take them on, but here they are one after another. Janus Capital Group created Janus Capital Management as a separate en-tity from Janus Capital. The plaintiffs claimed that JCG should be held liable for misleading statements by JCM re-garding various funds, most notably the market timing of the fund’s prac-tice of rapidly trading in and out of a mutual fund to take advantage of inef-ficiency in the way the funds are val-ued. This was not permitted. The Fourth Circuit Court found in favor of the plaintiffs because the investors would have inferred that even if JCM had not itself written the alleged statements, JCM must have approved the state-ments. After all, JCM was created by JCG. But SCOTUS reversed the circuit court’s finding that the false state-ments were made. So each of these cases involved ef-forts to tighten or narrow the channel through which ordinary people can challenge the conduct of the powerful. The powerful can use a series of strate-gies—in this case, creating a sub-sidiary—to bypass responsibility for misleading statements. Ashcroft v. Iqbal in 2009. The case concerns the arrest and subsequent treatment of Javaid Iqbal at the Met-ropolitan Detention Center in Brook-lyn, NY. Iqbal and several thousand other Arab Muslim men were arrested as a part of the investigation into the then recent September 11 terrorist at-tacks. Upon his release, Iqbal brought suit alleging discrimination and 21 con-stitutional rights violations by the De-partment of Justice, Bureau of Prisons, and FBI. The defendant argued that their official government roles pro-tected them from suit. The U.S. district court denied the de-fendants’ motion to dismiss—that is, protected the ability of the suit to be brought—and supported their qualified immunity defense. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit af-firmed the district court’s ruling with one exception: They ruled that under the defendant’s qualified immunity de-fense, it was not a violation of due process given the context of the ter-rorist attacks’ unique circumstances. The Supreme Court then upheld the finding of the Second Circuit. Again, each case is a narrowing and a finding of individual against a corpora-tion or a larger entity in a 5-to-4 deci-sion. These cases—I don’t think I will go through all of these remaining six cases, but I think you get the general idea. The bottom line: In 5-to-4 opin-ions, corporations won 16 times and or-dinary people won zero times. So I want to go back to the fact that Gorsuch himself is an extreme judge, and I think it is important to talk about the cases he was involved in di-rectly. What I have just been laying out is that a 5-to-4 Court makes an enormous difference. Is the Court going to look for every possible way to deny the opportunity for ordinary citizens to take on the powerful and the power-ful to get away with predatory prac-tices, or are they going to honor the vi-sion of government of, by, and for the people? That is the fundamental ques-tion in a 5-to-4 Court. And Gorsuch fits right into that because the vision of honoring the ability of people to take on the powerful in a system of justice versus a system that perpetrates injus-tice by allowing the powerful to get away with predatory practices against ordinary people and constrains the right of individuals and expands the rights of corporations—that turns cor-porations into predator superhumans with more money than any one indi-vidual and more power than any one individual and more campaign cash than any one individual. In fact, a cor-poration will often have more cash to be spent in a campaign than the rest of America—perhaps the entire rest of America put together. When the Koch brothers said in Janu-ary 2015 that they were going to spend nearly $1 billion in the next election, do you think there were many Ameri-cans who said: Well, well, I can do that. No. That would represent the political spending by virtually all the rest of America. That is the challenge of the concentration of power in our country.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2247 April 4, 2017 
We have seen that there are a whole series of cases that allow gerry-mandering and voter suppression and campaign spending and dark money de-signed to corrupt the ‘‘we the people’’ elections, the foundation of our demo-cratic Republic. We saw a whole series of cases that involve finding for the powerful corporations in restricting the rights of people to band together to challenge them through class action lawsuits. That is the difference be-tween these two parts of the judicial decisions, and Neil Gorsuch is way to the right. So let’s look at the preamble to our Constitution: ‘‘We the People of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice’’—those are the next words, ‘‘establish justice.’’ What kind of justice is there if the Court continuously allows the corrup-tion of our elections? What kind of jus-tice is there if the Court continually restricts the power of ordinary people to bring a case against a predatory practice of a powerful institution? That is the question. Our Constitution that starts out with those three beautiful words that I quoted many times tonight, ‘‘We the People,’’ also has a vision of estab-lishing justice. How is it that this group of Justices has forgotten that our Constitution was about estab-lishing justice? Well, that is a big con-cern. However, what we find is that Neil Gorsuch is coming to his court deci-sions and to his writing from a view-point of how to arrange the details to help the powerful come out on top. (Mr. STRANGE assumed the Chair.) Let’s look at the frozen trucker case. Anphonse Maddin was transporting cargo through Illinois when the brakes on his trailer froze because of subzero temperatures. Maddin did the respon-sible thing: He didn’t move the trailer anymore because without brakes, he would have been endangering the lives of everyone on the road. So to protect others, he refused to operate the truck. After reporting the problem to the company, he waited 3 hours in freezing temperatures for a repair truck to ar-rive. He could not even wait in the cab of his truck to keep warm because the auxiliary power unit was broken. After waiting 3 hours in subzero tem-peratures, his torso went numb, and he began having difficulty breathing. He could not feel his feet. He felt his life was at risk. He unhitched the disabled trailer with its frozen brakes because he thought it was absolutely dangerous to drive with a full load without brakes, and he drove the cab to a place where he could get warm. Even as he was driving away, even after he had reported his numbness and difficulty breathing, the company was still radioing Alphonse Maddin to wait in the dangerous, frigid condition or to drive with a full load and frozen brakes. The company wanted him to drive with frozen brakes. The company wanted him to drive in those tempera-tures, with ice on the road, and with a full load. Help arrived about 15 minutes after Maddin made the decision to leave. As soon as he heard that, he turned around, and he returned to the trailer, but TransAm Trucking fired him for leaving the trailer unattended. The argument that TransAm Truck-ing had used for firing Alphonse Maddin was, instead of remaining in the dangerous, freezing conditions and refusing to drive because of there being a disabled trailer, he drove away with-out the disabled trailer. In the com-pany’s mind, Maddin had two choices: one, freeze to death or, two, drive the disabled vehicle with the frozen brakes and trailer attached, putting other peo-ple’s lives at risk. He had two choices: Put his own life at risk or put every-one’s life at risk. The Department of Labor looked at this and said that the truckdriver was fired in violation of the Surface Trans-portation Act’s protections and that he should be reinstated with back pay. The case made its way up to the Tenth Circuit. The Tenth Circuit said: Absolutely, the law is written so that truckdrivers will not operate under dangerous conditions in order to pro-tect their safety and the safety of the public. That is the way the law is set. The Tenth Circuit said: Yes, that is the way the law is set. That is what is written in the law. Judge Gorsuch wrote a dissent. He twisted and strained the statute. He wanted to find ways to minimize the word ‘‘health’’ and the word ‘‘safety’’ and stated that the finding for the driver was improper because it used the law as a springboard to combat all per-ceived evils, which is a quote: ‘‘as a sort of springboard to combat all per-ceived evils.’’ No, the law was designed to protect against a specific evil, which is people operating vehicles in a manner that en-danger themselves or others. You can-not be fired as a truckdriver for oper-ating a vehicle in order to protect the lives of others. The truckdriver, who was operating responsibly—Alphonse Maddin, who was operating respon-sibly—said: I am not going to endanger others. He was fired for it. The Department of Labor said: No, you cannot fire him. That is why the law is written that way. The Tenth Circuit said: No, you cannot fire him. That is why the law is written that way. Yet Neil Gorsuch found some way of twisting the words to say: Huh, let’s find a way to make this work for the corporation rather than the individual. Even the law says that you are pro-tected from being fired for refusing to operate a truck that endangers your-self or others. Even the law says that. Let’s find a way to go the other direc-tion and find on the side of the com-pany. Gorsuch wrote that his employer gave him the very option the statute it must. Once he voiced safety concerns, TransAm expressly permitted him to sit right where he was and wait for help. They gave him two choices: Sit and freeze in the cab, even though his torso had gone numb and at his own risk to his own health, or drive the trailer and endanger everybody’s life— a lose-lose proposition. Gorsuch ig-nored the side of the statute that in-volved the safety of the driver as well as of the people. He dismissed the Department of La-bor’s view in saying that there is sim-ply no law that anyone has pointed to us giving employees the right to oper-ate their vehicles in ways their em-ployers forbid. Yes, there is. The law says that you cannot fire someone for driving or for refusing to operate a vehicle in a man-ner that endangers other people’s lives. The majority of the court that sup-ported the Labor Department’s rea-soning called Gorsuch’s reasoning ‘‘cu-rious.’’ That is the polite way of saying that we have no idea how he could pos-sibly have twisted the law in this fash-ion. If Gorsuch had gotten his way, there would have been no justice for Alphonse Maddin—a pure decision of the frozen trucker, a decision devoid of common sense, totally detached from the law as written. That is the frozen trucker case. Let’s look at the autistic child case of Thompson R2–J School District v. Luke P. Because he is a youngster, his last name was not used. It was a 2008 case. Luke P., a young child with autism, began receiving special education serv-ices in kindergarten at his public school. He had an education plan that was specific to his needs as was re-quired by the Individuals with Disabil-ities Education Act, or IDEA. In early grades, he had made progress in skills related to communication, self-care, independence, motor skills, social interactions, and academic func-tioning, but he was not making progress in generalizing his skills and applying skills learned in school to other environments, such as his home life. Despite the situation at school, there were a lot of problems in his conduct, and the public school’s inability to meaningfully improve Luke’s ability to generalize basic life skills beyond the walls of the school posed significant limitations on his future. The basic story is this: The school was failing to provide the type of edu-cation that was necessary for Luke to gain the ability to operate in life. They found a school that could provide that ability. They said: To save our child, we will transfer him to that residential school near Boston that specializes in serving children with autism. It was a great opportunity for him to learn, and he got in and began to flourish—a huge change. Luke’s parents, in their knowing that IDEA entitles children with dis-abilities to a free education, applied to the school district for reimbursement of the tuition. The school district re-fused.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES2248 April 4, 2017 
The long and short of it is that, at a State-level hearing, Luke’s parents prevailed. The case went to the Federal district court, and his parents pre-vailed under the Individuals with Dis-abilities Education Act. At each level, a hearing officer or judge determined that Luke was not getting the help he needed at his public school. They con-cluded that the school district had failed to provide him the free and ap-propriate education that was entitled to him under the law. You have decisions made at multiple levels that the school district was not meeting the standard of the law. Each declared that only a residential school could provide Luke with the education he needed. Therefore, the reimburse-ment of the tuition to the family was necessary and appropriate under the law. The school district appealed all the way up to Judge Gorsuch on the Tenth Circuit Court. In writing the opinion for the majority, Judge Gorsuch—and they reversed the lower court’s rul-ing—stated that the educational ben-efit that was mandated by IDEA must be ‘‘merely more than de minimis.’’ Here is the new judge’s—Neil Gorsuch’s—law. He is rewriting the trucker law so that truckers can be fired for protecting their safety and the safety of others. He is rewriting Indi-viduals with Disabilities Education Act so that, instead of having an education that is appropriate to the student, in fact, all that is required is ‘‘merely more than de minimis.’’ ‘‘De minimis’’ means the minimum— like nothing, like babysitting. Gorsuch said that the benefit provided to Luke—essentially, the babysitting— satisfied that standard. In effect, Judge Gorsuch argued that, under IDEA, all the school system had to do was to pro-vide disabled children with the bare minimum, which is an incredibly low bar. I will tell you that the whole intent of IDEA—the whole debate held here in the Senate, the whole debate held in the House, the signing, the whole framework for this act—was that we have to do right by our disabled chil-dren. Therefore, schools were mandated to provide appropriate education. The whole of Gorsuch’s finding was to say: No, I am rewriting the law—minimal, babysitting, ‘‘merely more than de minimis.’’ It is merely more than noth-ing when translated. What would be enough? It is as if the whole debate had never occurred over the vision of requiring schools to pro-vide an appropriate education to stu-dents. This is not just an example of some narrow reading of the law. This is judi-cial activism—rewriting the law to a completely different thing than it was intended to say. How could Judge Gorsuch argue put-ting disabled children like Luke in a room and giving him nothing other than merely more than nothing after having met the standards of a substan-tial act of Congress that was fully de-signed to give an appropriate education for disabled children? How do those things even come close to equating? ‘‘Merely more than nothing’’ versus ‘‘you must provide an appropriate edu-cation’’—how do you square those two things? How do you have a judge com-pletely rewrite the law and say that he is qualified to sit on the Supreme Court? We can tell you that the High Court disagreed completely with Judge Gorsuch. We can tell you this because, just this year—just a few days ago—the Supreme Court ruled on this case, and they overturned Judge Gorsuch. They did so not by 5 to 3; they did so by 8 to nothing—8 to zero. Eight Justices—four conservative, four liberal—looked at this and said that the law says ‘‘appropriate edu-cation.’’ Judge Gorsuch said ‘‘merely more than nothing.’’ That is not the law as written. That is rewriting the law to find on behalf of the powerful, the larger—in this case, the school dis-trict—over the individual. It is a pat-tern we see in his rulings time and time and time again. That is why, if you do nothing about the fact that this seat was stolen for the first time in U.S. history—a seat stolen for the Supreme Court from one administration and sent forward in an effort to pack the Court—and if you did not know anything about that and if all you knew was this set of decisions, you would ask: How can we possibly put on the Supreme Court an indi-vidual who rewrites the law to mean the opposite of what it is written to say—that black is white and white is black; that ‘‘do something significant’’ means ‘‘do nothing’’ or ‘‘merely noth-ing’’; that protecting those drivers who operate in safety for themselves or safety for the people on the road— Judge Gorsuch says to strip away that protection.

JORDYN ASHBURN 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 4, 2017 Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and applaud Jordyn Ashburn for receiving the Adams County May-ors and Commissioners Youth Award. Jordyn Ashburn is a 9th grader at Mapleton Early College High School and received this award because her determination and hard work have allowed her to overcome adversi-ties. The dedication demonstrated by Jordyn Ashburn is exemplary of the type of achieve-ment that can be attained with hard work and perseverance. It is essential students at all levels strive to make the most of their edu-cation and develop a work ethic which will guide them for the rest of their lives. I extend my deepest congratulations to Jordyn Ashburn for winning the Adams County Mayors and Commissioners Youth Award. I have no doubt she will exhibit the same dedication and char-acter in all of her future accomplishments.

RECOGNIZING THE VFW POST 7327 AMERICANISM AWARDS RECIPI-ENTS 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 4, 2017 Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to rec-ognize the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 7327 in Springfield, Virginia and the winners of its 2017 Americanism Awards. The Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) traces its beginnings to 1899 when veterans of the Spanish-American War established local orga-nizations to bring awareness to their service and to advocate for veterans retirement bene-fits and improved medical care. Annually, the nearly 2 million members of the VFW and its Auxiliaries contribute more than 8.6 million hours of volunteerism in the community, in-cluding participation in Make a Difference Day and National Volunteer Week. With approximately 600 Comrades and 150 Ladies Auxiliary members, the Springfield VFW Post 7327 stands out for the depth of its commitment to our community. Often called ‘‘The Friendliest VFW Post in Virginia,’’ Post 7327 has one of the most aggressive Adopt- a-Unit programs in the entire VFW organiza-tion to support our service members stationed overseas. VFW Post 7327 visits the VA hos-pital at least quarterly, bringing along goodie bags for our Wounded Warriors. Each Thanks-giving and Christmas, VFW Post 7327 adopts military families in need through the USO and provides them with meal baskets for each holi-day, gifts for children, commissary cards for the parents, and a Christmas party where the children can meet Santa and receive a gift- filled stocking. The Ladies Auxiliary members collect, sort, and distribute more than 2,000 pieces of clothing each month to various chari-table organizations. VFW Post 7327 is a strong supporter of local youth organizations, including the Boys Scouts, Girl Scouts, and Little League Base-ball, that contribute greatly to the education and well-being of our children. Each year, VFW Post 7327 bestows awards to local students who have submitted out-standing essays on a theme and to local teachers and public safety officers in recogni-tion of their extraordinary actions and dedica-tion. I am honored to include in the RECORD  the names of this year’s honorees: 
PATRIOT ’S PEN  
1st Place: Alexia M. de Costa 2nd Place: Austin Matthew Lathrop 3rd Place: Serina Ahmed 
VOICE OF DEMOCRACY  
1st Place: Timothy A. Withington 2nd Place: Jenna L. C. Huber 3rd Place: Sean M. Franklin

PUBLIC SAFETY AWARDS  
Assistant Chief Gary E. Gaal Police Officer First Class Christopher Cosgriff Lieutenant Justin Palenscar Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in thanking VFW Post 7327 for its contin-ued efforts on behalf of our community and in congratulating the honorees of the 2017 Amer-icanism Awards.

IN MEMORY OF REVEREND RICHARD KEVIN BARNARD 
HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 4, 2017 Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Reverend Richard Kevin Barnard, who passed on March 18, 2017. Reverend Barnard has served as a minister in the Reformed Episcopal Church since July of 1989. Prior to that, he served 18 years at The Chapel of the Cross in Dallas, Texas and most recently at Christ Church Angelican Ft. Worth. Before coming to The Chapel, Reverend Barnard was Director of Communications for the International Bible Society, which was then located in East Brunswick, New Jersey. In that capacity he was a regular participant in the monthly White House Forum for Religious Or-ganizations during the Reagan Administration and represented the Bible Society at public and private events, traveling to Central Amer-ica, Europe, Africa and Asia. At my invitation on July 26, 2006, Reverend Barnard served as Chaplin of the Day for the United States House of Representatives. Reverend Barnard’s gracious presence and true dedication to the work and word of Christ has been an instrumental part of my life. He encouraged his congregation to remain faithful to pursuing our walk with Christ daily. f 
HONORING STUDENTS WHO RAISE MONEY FOR LEUKEMIA AND LYMPHOMA 
HON. LAMAR SMITH 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 4, 2017 Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, today, I want to recognize a few high school students from San Antonio and the surrounding area who raised over $500,000 in 7 weeks while campaigning for the Students of the Year title, a campaign launched by The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society. Ella Behnke, 16, a senior at Alamo Heights High School, raised over $334,000 in 7 weeks to become The Leukemia & Lymphoma Soci-ety’s ‘‘2017 Student of the Year.’’ Ella was di-agnosed with non-Hodgkins Lymphoblastic Lymphoma at the age of 2. She has been in remission for several years now. P.J. O’Toole, 15, a freshman at Smithson Valley High School in Spring Branch, Texas, raised over $50,000 during the 7-week cam-paign, becoming the ‘‘2017 Student of the Year Runner Up.’’ P.J. was the only freshman to run in the campaign against 11 upper classmen. P.J. is also a leukemia survivor. At the age of 6, he was diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). With only a 70 percent chance of survival, today P.J. is in remission. Raising over $50,000 each means that both Ella Behnke and P.J. O’Toole will have the op-portunity to name an LLS research grant in honor of whomever they choose. For the South Central Texas Chapter—San Antonio Inaugural Campaign, 12 candidates raised an outstanding $502,000 this year. The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society’s Stu-dents of the Year campaign is a fundraising competition in communities across the United States in which participants vie for the title of Student of the Year. They raise funds for blood cancer research in honor of local chil-dren who are blood cancer survivors. In appreciation of all they have done, Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking them for their efforts to advance the treatment of Leukemia and Lymphoma.

IN RECOGNITION OF NRECA INTER-NATIONAL VOLUNTEERS FROM ALABAMA RURAL ELECTRIC AS-SOCIATION OF COOPERATIVES 
HON. MARTHA ROBY 
OF ALABAMA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 4, 2017 Mrs. ROBY. Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize and thank nineteen constituents from my district who work for Central Alabama Electric Cooperative, located in Prattville, Ala-bama; Covington Electric Cooperative, located in Andalusia, Alabama; and Alabama Rural Electric Association of Cooperatives, located in Montgomery, Alabama. Volunteering as power linemen and staff liaisons for NRECA International, these Journeyman Linemen have dedicated themselves to building and up-grading power lines to help communities re-ceive affordable, safe and reliable electricity. They have worked side by side with NRECA International in the town of Guastatoya, Gua-temala, and in the city of Puerto Barrios, Gua-temala, and most recently on the USAID-fund-ed Pilot Project for Sustainable Electricity Dis-tribution in Caracol, Haiti. In Guatemala, they constructed a power line to electrify three villages, Mirador, Tamarindal, and Castanal, bringing a better way of life to more than 300 families. In the latest project, more than 9,000 consumers in Caracol and 10,000 more consumers in surrounding com-munities will eventually be connected with electricity. The service and sacrifice of these linemen and electric cooperative staff will ultimately im-pact the lives of thousands of Guatemalans and Haitians, resulting in improvements in healthcare, education, and economic oppor-tunity. For all of you who have given your time, Bruce Adamson, Kevin Anderson, Lamar Daugherty, Reed Daugherty, Jimmy Gray, Aaron Ismail, Keith Hay, Michael Kelley, Mi-chael Longcrier, Darren Maddox, Ross Parker, Kevin Powell, Heath Smith, Ted Stettler, Alan Thrash, Josh Till, Clay Walker, Josh Winburn, and Julie Young, I thank them for their serv-ice.

RECOGNIZING THE 38TH ANNIVER-SARY OF THE TAIWAN RELA-TIONS ACT 
HON. SCOTT DesJARLAIS 
OF TENNESSEE  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 4, 2017 Mr. D
ESJARLAIS. Mr. Speaker, Monday, April 10th marks the 38th anniversary of the 1979 enactment of the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA). The United States and Taiwan are bound by shared values, and the TRA commits the U.S. to providing Taiwan with the arms needed for its defense, while advocating a peaceful reso-lution to the contentious issues separating Bei-jing and Taipei. The people of Taiwan may rest assured that regardless of changes in ad-ministrations or the partisan composition of Congress, the TRA endures. Taiwan’s free-dom, democracy, and security will remain one of the highest interests of the United States, and our relationship will continue to grow and strengthen in the years and decades to come. In 1982, three years after the TRA’s enact-ment, President Ronald Reagan issued the Six Assurances, another important component in strengthening this relationship. Together, the TRA and the Six Assurances have been instrumental in providing Taiwan with the se-curity and space necessary for its people to build one of the most vibrant democracies and societies of the Asia-Pacific region. Mr. Speaker, I was gratified to hear that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to the TRA and the Six As-surances in his confirmation hearing earlier this year. I know many of my colleagues will join me in seconding this commitment. I also noticed that Chinese President Xi is visiting the United States this week. It is our hope that the upcoming Trump-Xi meeting is constructive as U.S. engagement of the PRC is important to the peace and stability of the region. It is also our hope and insistence that US-Taiwan relations and Taiwan’s security and interests are not in any way com-promised. I look forward to working with my colleagues and the Administration in moving forward on the issues that are of mutual interest between our two countries, and I offer my best wishes to the people of Taiwan on the occasion of this 38th Anniversary. f

HONORING ASBURY UNITED METHODIST CHURCH 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 4, 2017 Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speak-er, I rise today to honor Asbury United Meth-odist Church. If you desire to eat for a year, plant rice. If you desire to be remembered ten years later, plant a tree. If you desire to save future gen-erations, educate a child. But if your desire is to preserve mankind, plant rice, a tree, edu-cate a child and build a church. It was this philosophy, spurred by the divine inspiration of God, that Asbury UMC was or-ganized. The year was 1872. Since that time Asbury has experienced physical and spiritual growth as was evident by the fact that it was in 1898 under the leadership of Rev. D.D. Goodwin. The church’s trustees were L.K. Levridge, J.L. Thompson, F.L. Jones and Henry Raspberry. As the years past, Asbury prospered and was remolded in 1926, this time under the leadership of W.L. Marshall. Realizing that there is indeed strength in unity, Asbury and what was to become known as her sister church, Kingsley Chapel United Methodist Church of Edwards, Mississippi, were united on the same charge. The min-isters who spearheaded and supervised that unification were J.B. Brooks, J.M. Shummpert and H.C. Trice. For the next fifty years, Asbury continued to worship God through service to humanity. This was done under the ever present watchfulness of Reverends Walton Taylor, A.L. Johnson, N.R. Ross, J.B. Watkins, A.L. Pittman and E.B. James. A church without a past has no future, with-out a present there can be no future. In 1972, Asbury realized that it had an even greater fu-ture and challenge ahead as it became and continues to be a United Methodist Church. Pastoring Asbury before, during, as well as after this period of name change, was the Rev. Dr. Oscar Allen Rogers, Jr. During Dr. Rogers’ tenure, 22 years, the longest in the history of Asbury, the church experienced many positive changes, including an extended renovation in 1975. In May of 1984, Dr. Rog-ers accepted the Presidency of Claflin Col-lege, Orangeburg, South Carolina. The departure left a void, but one which was soon filled by Rev. Coleman Turner, a na-tive of Bolton, as well as a member of Asbury’s extended family. Before coming to Asbury, Rev. Turner was pastor of Pratt Memorial UMC of Jackson, Mississippi. Although his stay was brief, his leadership was inspiring. In 1985, the Rev. John Baker came to As-bury from Anderson UMC, Jackson, Mis-sissippi. He accepted the challenge of Chris-tian leadership and proved a positive influ-ence. On the Fourth Sunday in June of 1987, As-bury welcomed the Rev. Dwight Prowell and his wife Patricia. They quickly and effectively became an involved part of the Asbury family. Although it was a short relationship, Asbury and the Prowells shared many joyous mo-ments; perhaps the highlight being an addition to their family, a son, Christopher. Christopher arrived in Mississippi on a Homecoming Sun-day. It was truly a special day. In 1988, The Rev. Alphanette Bracey Martin became the spiritual leader of Asbury UMC. Rev. Martin was also the director of the Wes-ley Foundation, located on the campus of Alcorn State University, Lorman, Mississippi. Under Rev. Martin’s leadership Asbury contin-ued to shine as the ‘‘church by the side of the road.’’ The Reverend Reuben C. Witherspoon served as leader of the flock from June 1994 to June 2000. He brought to Asbury a re-newed commitment to spirituality among the members. He also made improvements within the church. Reverend Herman Peters accepted the leadership of Asbury June 25, 2000 and served through December 2002. He inspired continued commitment to spiritual, financial and physical growth. Asbury is presently under the charismatic leadership of the Reverend Sam Lee, Jr., who accepted the top post in January, 2003. We have also been privileged to have the following ministers from 1924 to present: Rev. J.B. Brooks, 1924–1927; Rev. W.E. Rucker, 1927–1928; Rev. Prince A. Taylor, Sr. 1931– 1932; Rev. J.C. Hibbler, 1933–1934; Rev. A.C. Trice, 1935–1936; Rev. Allen L. Johnson, 1937–1939; Rev. N.W. Ross, 1940–1941; Rev. Walter S. Taylor, 1942–1943; Rev. J.B. Watkins, 1944–1946; Rev. L.M. Pittman, 1947; Rev. E.B. James, 1948–1952; Rev. V.C. McInnis, 1953; Rev. Richard D. Gerald, Sr., 1954–1955; Rev. Henry Bartee, Sr., 1959– 1962; Rev. Dr. Oscar A. Rogers, Jr., 1962– 1984; Rev. Coleman Turner, 1984–1985; Rev. John L. Baker, 1985–1986; Rev. Dwight d. Powell, 1987; Rev. Alphanette B. Martin, 1988–1994; Rev. Reuben C. Witherspoon, 1994–2000; Rev. Herman Peters, 2000–2002; Rev. Sam Lee, Jr., 2003–Present. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing my home church, Asbury United Methodist Church of Bolton, Mississippi.

38TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE TAIWAN RELATION ACT (TRA) 
HON. BLAKE FARENTHOLD 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 4, 2017 Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, April 10th marks a very special day for the United States and Taiwan. It was on this day in 1979 that the Taiwan Relations Act was enacted as United States law that codifies the relationship between Taiwan and the United States. It out-lines our relationship with Taiwan regarding trade, cultural exchanges, and security among other important areas. In addition to the Taiwan Relations Act, the Six Assurances also guides the relationship between the United States and Taiwan. In 1982, three years after the passage of the Tai-wan Relations Act, the ‘‘Six Assurances’’ of the United States to Taiwan were given by then President Ronald Reagan. Both the Tai-wan Relations Act and the Six Assurances have guided our relationship with Taiwan for more than 30 years. We celebrate the 38th anniversary of the Taiwan Relations Act by thanking Taiwan for its great friendship and its support as a beacon of democracy in East Asia. I also noticed that Chinese President Xi is visiting the United States. It is our hope that the upcoming Trump-Xi meeting is construc-tive as U.S. engagement of the PRC is impor-tant to the peace and stability of the region. It is also our hope and insistence that US-Tai-wan relations and Taiwan’s security and inter-ests are not in any way compromised. We are so proud of Taiwan’s accomplish-ments over these thirty-eight years and look forward to ever further strengthening our eco-nomic relations with Taiwan in the future. f 
CONGRATULATING KELLY MURPHY FROM WILMINGTON, IL 
HON. ADAM KINZINGER 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 4, 2017 Mr. KINZINGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate a constituent of mine, Kelly Murphy, on her achievements as a member of the 2016 U.S. Women’s Volleyball team. Volleyball runs in the Murphy family. Her mother, Sandy played volleyball at Illinois State University, and Kelly herself started playing at the age of 11. Prior to being con-firmed on the team in July of last year, Kelly was a four-year varsity player at Joliet Catho-lic Academy from 2004 to 2007. During her four seasons there, she helped her team to a 133–31 record, winning four regional titles, three sectional titles and posting fourth and third-place finishes in state competition in 2005 and 2006. In 2007, Kelly was named the Gatorade High School National Player of the Year. Following her career at Joliet Catholic, Kelly moved on to the University of Florida, where she was the 2008 SEC Freshman of the Year and the 2010 SEC Player of the Year. Having started every match during her career at Flor-ida, Kelly led her team to a 107–17 record, two Southeastern Conference titles, and she made the all-conference team four times in a row. In 2016, Kelly achieved the honor of being one of 12 players selected to represent our country at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Kelly and the team came home with the bronze medal after defeating the Netherlands in four sets. This accomplish-ment in Rio continued the tradition: marking three straight Olympics in a row where the U.S. Women’s Volleyball team has won a medal. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Sixteenth Congressional District, I would like to sincerely applaud Kelly Murphy for her commitment to her sport, her team, and her country. We are all truly proud of her and her achievements.

HONORING THE LIFE OF BISHOP JOSEPH J. MADERA 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 4, 2017 Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Bishop Joseph J. Madera, who passed away on January 21, 2017 at age 89. Bishop Madera was a loving son, brother, and leader of the Central California Catholic community, who was called ‘‘the people’s bishop’’ by those he served. Born on November 27, 1927, Bishop Madera was raised in Mexico. He entered the seminary at age 15, studying priesthood in Coyoacan, a neighborhood in Mexico City. After being ordained on June 15, 1957, Bishop Madera was sent to the Archdiocese of Los Angeles where there was a need for priests who understood the needs of Catholics of Mexican decent. He served in Los Angeles for 15 years until 1976, when he became a pastor in Fowler in the San Joaquin Valley. Four years later, in 1980, he was ordained bishop for the Diocese of Fresno. While Bishop of Fresno, Bishop Madera cre-ated specialized ministries for families and youth, and became very involved in the His-panic community. He started an education tel-evision station in Fresno to spread his mes-sage on Catholicism, which would later be-come Channel 49 (KNXT). In 1991, Bishop Madera became an auxiliary bishop for the Archdiocese for the Military Service until his retirement in 2004. Bishop Madera was lcnown as the bishop for the people. He had a passion for getting to know all his worshippers, and always wanted to be actively involved in the community. He was the first Hispanic to lead a California dio-cese since 1896, overseeing eight counties of 348,300 Catholics, half of whom were His-panic. Bishop Madera spoke four languages, and was unique amongst other Bishops in the United States because he was from a Mexican background. Bishop Madera is survived by his sister Carmelita and numerous nieces and nephews. Mr. Speaker, today I ask my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to the life and service of Bishop Madera, whose passion, selfless service, and kind heart made an instrumental impact on the lives of those in the Valley. His humble nature and great character is some-thing to be remembered. I join the Catholic and Hispanic community in honoring his life, his love for his worshippers, and passion for making a difference. He will be greatly missed. REMEMBERING WILLIE SUMMERVILLE HON. RODNEY DAVIS 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 4, 2017 Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speak-er, I rise today to remember Willie Summer-ville, a friend and beloved community member, who passed away on March 7, 2017 at the age of 72. Willie served as choirmaster for the Saint Luke Christian Methodist Episcopal Church in Champaign for over 50 years, and was a longtime music teacher in Champaign and Urbana schools and the University of Illi-nois. In addition, he served as choir director for several community choirs. The impact Willie left on the community stretches far beyond the conductor’s podium. Willie found a passion in teaching others. He served as outreach coordinator for the African American Studies Program at the University and taught classes on African-American and European sacred music. He also offered his talents to music students of all ages through private lessons in voice and piano. Willie first arrived in Champaign-Urbana in the 1960s when he came to the area to play tuba for the Marching Illini. Since then, he has become a well-established musician and a re-spected community leader. Willie was a loving husband, father, and grandfather, and most of all, he was a treas-ure in the Champaign-Urbana community who will be greatly missed. His love for music and his devotion to the community will always be remembered. My thoughts and prayers are with his family during this difficult time.

CONGRATULATIONS SPRINGFIELD NEWS-LEADER 
HON. BILLY LONG 
OF MISSOURI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 4, 2017 Mr. LONG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to rec-ognize the Springfield News-Leader and its dedication to 150 years of excellence in jour-nalism. The Springfield News-Leader was first pub-lished on April 4, 1867, and has been a vital part of the Springfield, Missouri, community ever since. After 150 years, the Springfield News-Leader has reached almost 55,000 con-secutive days of print, for both morning and evening newspapers. In January of 1927, after several changes in name and ownership, the newspaper was offi-cially known as the Springfield Daily News. 120 years later, in 1987, after printing both a morning and evening edition, the afternoon edition of the newspaper was discontinued and consolidated with the morning edition to become the Springfield News-Leader. Today, the Springfield News-Leader is com-bined with a number of other print publica-tions, websites and digital marketing services as part of the News-Leader Media Group. This group is the largest multi-media marketing so-lutions company in southwest Missouri, serv-ing the local and regional business commu-nity. For 150 years, the Springfield News-Leader has caught the moments that have shaped our nation, Missouri and Missouri’s 7th Congres-sional District. I am confident that in the next 150 years the Springfield News-Leader will continue to be the newspaper that keeps the people of the 7th District informed and up-to- date. Congratulations to the Springfield News- Leader. f 
RECOGNIZING THE LIFE AND SERVICE OF MARK V. DENNIS 
HON. CHARLIE CRIST 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 4, 2017 Mr. CRIST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and service of fallen Navy Hospitalman, 3rd Class, Mr. Mark V. Dennis. Mr. Dennis was born on September 21, 1946, to Charles and Vera Dennis of Miamisburg, Ohio, where he grew up with his brother and two sisters. He went on to serve in the United States Navy in a Marine unit as a medical corpsman during the Vietnam War. A man of strong faith, Mr. Dennis also served as acting chaplain for his unit, and had dreams of being a missionary after completing his service. Sadly, those dreams would not be realized. He was killed in action when his helicopter crashed after taking enemy fire in South Viet-nam in the summer of 1966. At such a young age, 19 years, Mr. Dennis made the ultimate sacrifice in service to his country. In 1970, a photograph in Newsweek maga-zine showed a Prisoner of War with an un-canny resemblance to Mark. Devastated by the loss, and plagued by nagging doubt, his family, led by his brother Jerry, began a quest for answers as to what happened to Mark. Last August, the Defense POW/MIA Ac-counting Agency released a report determining through DNA testing that the remains from the deadly helicopter crash are those of Mr. Den-nis. Thanks to the Dennis family’s determina-tion, and work by the Defense POW/MIA Ac-counting Agency, we now know conclusively that Mr. Dennis died while serving and pro-tecting his country. Mr. Speaker, the Dennis family has been through a lot over the years. I pray that they will now have the closure they so deserve. Mr. Dennis will soon be laid to rest alongside his parents at the Garden Sanctuary Cemetery in Seminole, Florida, with full military honors. I am humbled to honor the life of this young man, and all of our servicemen and women who were taken from this Earth too soon. May he, and his family, now finally find peace. RECOGNIZING EDWARDSVILLE HIGH SCHOOL’S SENIOR GUARD MARK SMITH HON. RODNEY DAVIS

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 4, 2017 Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speak-er, I rise today to recognize Edwardsville High School’s senior guard Mark Smith, who is now better known as Mr. Basketball of Illinois for the 2016–2017 season. Mark received the Mr. Basketball honor after a senior season in which he filled up the stats sheet. Over the course of the season, Mark averaged 21.9 points, 8.2 rebounds, 8.4 as-sists, and 2.1 steals per game. He recorded double figures in 31 of the Tigers’ 32 games, and had eight games in which he scored more than 30 points. In the championship game of the Ottawa sectional, Mark scored a career- high 45 points in Edwardsville’s win over Danville. Outside of Mark’s individual statistics, the Tigers’ boys basketball season was an unfor-gettable one in the Metro East, as the team finished 30–2 and played in the Class 4A Super-Sectional in Normal. In addition to the Mr. Basketball honor, Mark was named the ‘‘Illinois Gatorade Player of the Year,’’ and has scholarship offers from mul-tiple Division 1 schools. I had the opportunity to meet Mark at an event for the Mannie Jackson Center for the Humanities last month, and was truly im-pressed by this young man. I am proud to congratulate Mark on his spectacular senior season and receiving this honor, and look for-ward to continuing to follow his basketball ca-reer.

RECOGNIZING THE CLARKSON UNI-VERSITY WOMEN’S HOCKEY TEAM 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 4, 2017 Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the hard work and skill of the Clarkson University Women’s Hockey Team, who just ended their already impressive season by win-ning the NCAA Division I championship. Led by Coach Matt Desrosiers, the Golden Knights defeated the number one seeded Wis-consin Badgers for the championship title. This is the team’s second Division I title, with the Golden Knights being the only team out-side of the Western Conference to ever win the championship. Under the leadership of seniors Corie Jacobson, Jessica Gillham, Genevieve Bannon, McKenzie Johnson and Carly Mercer, the team was able to regroup from a rough early season and achieve this impressive vic-tory. Junior goaltender Shea Tiley was an in-strumental part of this victory, allowing zero points against the strong Wisconsin offense. In New York’s 21st District, we are incred-ibly proud of all of these women and their in-credible achievements. I hope that their hard work and dedication serve as an inspiration for generations to come.

HONORING ADAMANTIA KLOTSA 
HON. GUS M. BILIRAKIS 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 4, 2017 Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Florida’s Consul General of the Hellenic Republic, Ms. Adamantia Klotsa, a model for-eign representative and distinguished member of the Greek community in my district. Ms. Klotsa was recently honored by the Federation of Hellenic American Educators for her ‘‘continuous effort to execute professional and outstanding duties towards the language, the culture and services for the Greek commu-nity of Florida.’’ Before her diplomatic mission in Tampa, Ms. Adamantia Klotsa was born in Athens. She holds B.A.s in both Archeology and Law as well as an M.A. in Prehistoric Archeology from the University of Athens. Ms. Klotsa en-tered the Diplomatic Service of the Hellenic Republic in 1998. In the Ministry of Foreign Af-fairs of the Hellenic Republic, she served in the Office of the Secretary General, the NATO Department, and the Personnel Department. As the co-Chair of the Hellenic Caucus and the Congressional Hellenic-Israeli Alliance and a former member of the Foreign Affairs Com-mittee, I deeply appreciate the hard work and consummate professionalism displayed daily by our foreign diplomats, especially Ms. Klotsa. As a proud Greek-American, I am thankful that Ms. Klotsa in her official capacity has en-couraged Greek-Americans fully appreciate the diversity of their heritage. As a young boy, my grandparents, parents, aunts and uncles instilled in me an appreciation for our beautiful culture, which focuses on family, community, and faith, and it is with great pride, that I con-tinue to uphold these values today. Ms. Klotsa’s current diplomatic mission in Tampa has also served to reinforce Florida’s possession of remarkable Greek cultural treas-ures like Tarpon Springs in my district, home to the largest Epiphany celebration in the Western Hemisphere and world renowned Sponge Docks, and St. Augustine which boasts the earliest colonization of Greeks in the New World. Additionally, she recently in-troduced the application of a Sisters City rela-tionship with the city of St. Augustine and Koroni, Greece. Initiatives like these will con-tinue to contribute to the rich cultural and eco-nomic success in Florida’s Twelfth Congres-sional District for years to come. I commend the Federation of Hellenic Amer-ican Educators for recognizing the contribu-tions of Ms. Klotsa, and I hope every foreign diplomat can learn from and emulate the dedi-cation of this Greek public servant to peace and prosperity between our nations.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF DR. ABRAHAM FISCHLER 
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 4, 2017 Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and work of my good friend and a most dedicated public servant, Dr. Abraham ‘‘Abe’’ Fischler, who, sadly, passed away on April 3, 2017. He was 89 years old. For 22 years, Abe Fischler was President of Nova Southeastern University (NSU). There were only 17 students enrolled when Abe joined NSU. He became President in 1970 and oversaw NSU’s growth into the large and well-respected institution that it is today. Abe was born in Brooklyn on January 21, 1928. He was a member of the ‘‘Greatest Generation,’’ serving in the United States Navy during the Second World War. He mar-ried his beloved wife of 68 years, Shirley, in 1949 and in 1951, graduated with a degree in Biochemistry from the City College of New York, eventually earning a Doctorate in Edu-cation in 1959 from Columbia University. Among the many innovations Dr. Fischler brought to NSU was the development of a long-distance learning program. Abe thought there should be a way for professionals who wanted to pursue advanced degrees to do so without having to leave their jobs. We didn’t have the prevalence of internet technologies we do now at the time, so Abe would actually have the university fly adjunct instructors to various spots around the country to teach small groups of students outside of regular business hours. At the time, this was very un-usual, but today, long distance education is both common and expected at most institu-tions of higher learning. Abe Fischler was one of the first to do it. In 1992, Abe retired from NSU, but he did not spend his retirement idly watching the world go by. By 1994, he was back in the thick of it, and got elected to the Broward County School Board, where he would serve for four years. He continued to be involved in educational issues, as well as his involvement with Nova Southeastern as President Emeritus until his passing. Dr. and Shirley Fischler have four children, four grandchildren and one great-grandson. My own son holds a Doctorate from, and is part of, the Nova Southeastern Family I am honored to have worked with Abe Fischler and to have represented him in Congress. He was a wonderful friend and will be dearly missed. f

1975, he became a TV news anchor at ABC30 (KFSN) until 1987, when he joined CBS47 (KGPE) as an anchor for the evening news. In addition to his journalism career, John’s love for sports was a large part of his life. He was the public address announcer for the Cali-fornia League’s Fresno Giants baseball team. He served on the board of the Fresno Athletic Hall of Fame, was president of the Fresno State Timeout Club, and spent four decades working with the Bulldog Foundation at Fresno State, serving as President and Chairman of the Board of Trustees. In 2014, he received the Harold S. Zinkin, Sr. Award by the Fresno Athletic Hall of Fame for his contributions, and was inducted into the Clovis Centennial Hall of Fame. John was a loyal community supporter who championed for local organizations. He was a friend and an inspiration to many, and had a contagious enthusiasm for life. He was very active in the community, serving on the board of the WestCare Foundation and volunteering with Break the Barriers and Valley Children’s Hospital. John will be missed greatly by his family, friends, and the entire community. He is sur-vived by his wife Cheri; children Cass Dilfer, Cameron Weishaar, Paige Wise, Carson Franzman, Taylor Franzman; and eight grand-children.

OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 4, 2017 Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my constituent, Virginia State Po-lice Trooper Kress Adamson, for his recogni-tion by the Rotary Club of West Springfield as an Outstanding Virginia State Trooper of the Year for 2016. Trooper Adamson is a credit to his unit and uniform and the long tradition of our Common-wealth’s State Police Force. In August of 2015 he was dispatched to a vehicle crash on the Capital Beltway. Upon arriving at the scene, he found two citizens who were trying to aid an individual lying near the wreckage on a very busy and dangerous stretch of I–495 and his fellow Trooper Steven Muller had begun special rescue breathing and CPR. A Fairfax County Rescue team then arrived and asked the two troopers to continue their life-saving efforts until the Rescue team was could apply an automated external defibrillator. After sev-eral minutes of these combined advanced life-saving techniques, they were able to regain a pulse in the victim. The victim was then trans-ported to INOVA Alexandria Hospital where he remained in critical condition until his recovery. Due to the initial valiant efforts of both civilians and these two troopers, the victim had a better chance of recovery from this life-threatening accident. Trooper Adamson has served the Virginia State Police for seven years. Upon graduating from the State Police Academy, he was ini-tially assigned to Arlington (Area 45). He is currently with the Springfield office (Area 48). Originally from Baltimore, Maryland, he served in the U.S. Air Force for nine years and de-ployed to Iraq in 2007. His MOS was medical support, and he currently is working on com-pleting a bachelor’s degree at Thomas Edison University. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Trooper Adamson and in thanking him for his years of service to Fairfax County and the Commonwealth of Virginia. He has demonstrated exceptional dedication to public safety and the mission of law enforce-ment, and for that, we owe him a special debt of gratitude.

HON. TOM REED 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 4, 2017 Mr. REED. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of John Alban Finch. Fifty years ago today, on April 5, 1967, a fire broke out at Cornell Heights Residential Club, an off-campus student dormitory in Ithaca, New York. The fire claimed the lives of eight students and one professor from Cornell University. Mr. Finch was the professor who perished in the fire. On the night of the tragedy, he imme-diately took action by awakening his neighbors and calling the Cornell Safety Division. De-spite heavy smoke, Mr. Finch ran back into the building to help other occupants escape to safety. A total of 62 people escaped the fire, many of whom attributed their survival to Mr. Finch’s heroic and selfless actions. Tragically, Mr. Finch did not survive. Mr. Finch gave his life to save those in need—the true definition of a hero. Mr. Finch was an Associate Professor and Faculty Advisor for the Ph.D. Program at Cor-nell University. He originally came to Cornell in 1960 as a graduate student on a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship. Mr. Finch earned a Mas-ter’s Degree in 1961 and a Ph.D. in 1964. The following year, he began working as an Assist-ant Professor of English and an instructor in the English Honors Program. Mr. Finch was a distinguished scholar and highly valued faculty member. I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the life of John Alban Finch and recognizing his life-long commitment to serving others.

CELEBRATING 100 YEARS OF WOMEN IN CONGRESS 
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 4, 2017 Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate 100 years of women in Congress. Representative Jeannette Rankin of Montana was the first woman to serve in U.S. Congress in 1916.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE443 April 4, 2017 
Rankin was on the frontlines of the national suffrage fight and advocated relentlessly for the creation of a Committee on Woman Suf-frage, serving on that committee once it was created. Casting an ‘‘aye’’ vote for the Nine-teenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, Rankin was the only woman who ever voted to give women the right to vote. Rankin is just one of many shining exam-ples of women knocking down barriers. I be-lieve the history of outstanding women and many others should be shared with all Ameri-cans to uplift and inspire them. I would like to share several outstanding women from Texas who have been several ‘‘firsts,’’ but certainly not ‘‘lasts’’ of their time. Lera Millard Thomas was the first woman elected to Congress from the state of Texas. When her husband died in February of 1966, a special election was called in March and she was elected as a Democrat to succeed her husband. Thomas served on the Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee where she helped to expand the Houston Ship Channel, one of the country’s busiest seaports. She chose not to run for reelection and instead dedicated her time to members of the armed services in Vietnam as a special liaison to the Houston Chronicle. Barbara Jordan was the first black woman elected to Congress and the first woman to represent Texas in her own right in the House of Representatives. Jordan was the first black woman to serve in the Texas State Senate and stayed there for eight years. Elected to the House in 1972, she served until 1979 and gained national praise for her legislative prow-ess and for her rhetoric and high morals. After retirement, Jordan returned to her former pro-fession of teaching. Unfortunately, in Texas, the number of women in Congress is historically very low. Currently, there are three women members; myself, Congresswoman S
HEILA JACKSON LEE, and Congresswoman K
AYGRANGER . In the Senate, former Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison was the first and only woman to represent Texas. In 2017, this is unacceptable. When Jeannette Rankin said that she would not be the last woman in Congress, I believe that she imagined a Congress much different from this one, a Congress that mirrored our society.

125TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DAILY CARDINAL NEWSPAPER 
HON. MARK POCAN 
OF WISCONSIN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 4, 2017 Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 125th anniversary of The Daily Cardinal newspaper serving the University of Wisconsin-Madison Campus since its debut on April 4, 1892. This distinguished student newspaper has been a valued staple on the University of Wis-consin-campus since it was founded by two natives of Monroe Wisconsin, who originally distributed the newspaper on horseback. One of its founders, William Wesley Young, was the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s first journalism graduate. In fact, the current home of UW-Madison’s School of Journalism in Vilas Hall is built on the site of former Cardinal of-fices. Thousands of students used the Daily Car-dinal to pursue investigative journalism, ex-pose corruption and develop photographic and storytelling skills. Alumni of the paper have subsequently become not only leaders in jour-nalism, but also in politics, business, law, and medicine. Some of these students have even subsequently gone on to win Pulitzer Prizes, Emmys, Peabody awards, and Nobel prizes. As one of the oldest college student news-papers in the United States, The Daily Car-dinal has survived and thrived through dec-ades of change at the University of Wisconsin- Madison. Its editorial board has proudly been on the forefront of advocating for important issues and advancing progressive stances from women’s suffrage to civil rights to mar-riage equality, while also fighting injustice and racism. Today, it is my honor to commend The Daily Cardinal staff, advisors, and distinguished alumni for all they have accomplished at this venerable student newspaper for the past 125 years. Mr. Speaker, it is with great honor that I rec-ognize the 125th anniversary of The Daily Cardinal. f

Sen-iors Jordan Lipson, Katelyn Turk, Julia Duquette, Melissa Ames, Erin Brand and Camille Leonard close out their collegiate ca-reers with an impressive four year record of 111–5–4. Additionally, Erin Brand was honored as the Most Outstanding Player at the NCAA Division III Championship with Camille Leonard and Melissa Sheeren also earning a spot on the All-Tournament Team. Leonard, the team’s goaltender, ends her career with the most vic-tories in NCAA Division III history, as well as the highest save percentage and the second most shutouts. In New York’s 21st District, we are incred-ibly proud of these women and their incredible achievements. I would like to congratulate the SUNY Plattsburgh Cardinals on their victory and hope that their hard work and dedication serve as an inspiration for generations to come.

HONORING MITCH LASGOITY FOR BEING NAMED THE 2017 SENIOR FARMER OF THE YEAR 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 4, 2017 Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Mitch Lasgoity, of Madera, Cali-fornia for being recognized as the 2017 Senior Farmer of the Year by the Madera District Chamber of Commerce. Receiving such an honor is well deserved by this hard working and humble man. Mitch was born in Madera, California on April 11, 1930. His father, Jean Lasgoity immi-grated to the United States from the Basque country of France, where he was a sheep herder. After settling in Madera, Jean married Jennie Ospital in 1928 and they started their sheep livestock business on the plot of land Jennie grew up on. Growing up on this family farm business, Mitch learned from a very young age, the skills it would take to become a successful farmer. Even as a young boy, Mitch was trust-ed to help around the farm, from prepping chickens for dinner to raising hogs to sell to a meat company. As he got older, he became more involved in raising ewes into lambs, re-fining the skills needed in the sheep business. By the age of ten, Mitch could fully operate and drive a tractor and began doing summer work operating a grain harvester at the age of 15. After graduating from Madera Union High School, Mitch went on to attend Santa Clara University, graduating with a degree in busi-ness in 1952. After college, Mitch partnered with his father in the sheep business. Later, at the age of 26, he bought the farm from his fa-ther and officially became self-employed. In 1957, Mitch married Rosemary Mastrofini, who gave birth to their four children, Michel, Monica, James and John. While raising a fam-ily, Mitch was determined to expand and refine his business with the help and support of his wife, Rosemary. In no time, Mitch had an outfit of 5,000 ewes and expanded their grazing ter-ritory to Joe and Bob Heguy’s ranch in Elko County, Nevada. In addition, Mitch partnered with Rosemary’s uncle, Herb Buchenau, and together they created Copper Sheep Company in Ely, Nevada, where they had 10,000 ewes and 500 cows. Not stopping there, Mitch bought his first ranch, the Collins Ranch, in 1967 near Eastman Lake. Around this time he also began to farm a 320 acre ranch within Western Madera County. From then on, Mitch decided to expand his agriculture business to the best of his abilities. He has since diversi-fied to producing almonds, grapes, wine and cattle. Now farming 3,500 acres, and owning a cattle operation which grazes over 33,000 acres, Mitch has shown what true hard work and dedication can achieve in the farming and agriculture industry. Mr. Speaker, it is with great honor that I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating and honoring Mitch Lasgoity for this prestigious award as 2017 Senior Farmer of the Year. It is both fitting and appropriate that we honor Mitch for his commitment to the farming indus-try and outstanding accomplishments. I ask that you join me in wishing Mr. Mitch Lasgoity continued success. PERSONAL EXPLANATION HON. RALPH LEE ABRAHAM

RECOGNIZING VIRGINIA STATE TROOPER STEVEN MULLER 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 4, 2017 Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my constituent, Virginia State Po-lice Trooper Steven Muller, for his recognition by the Rotary Club of West Springfield as an Outstanding Virginia State Trooper of the Year for 2016. Trooper Muller is a credit to his unit and uni-form and the long tradition of our Common-wealth’s State Police Force. Trooper Muller has been nominated for this Rotary award by his superiors, who note that in August of 2015 he was dispatched to a vehicle crash on the Capital Beltway. Upon arriving at the scene he found two citizens who were trying to aid an individual lying near the wreckage on a very busy and dangerous stretch of I–495. Trooper Muller checked the victim for signs of breath-ing and a pulse and found the victim unre-sponsive. Immediately after, he began special rescue breathing and CPR. Trooper Kress Ad-amson arrived a few minutes later to aid Trooper Muller. A Fairfax County Rescue team then arrived and asked the two troopers to continue their life-saving efforts until the Res-cue team could apply an automated extemal defibrillator. After several minutes of these combined advanced lifesaving techniques, they were able to regain a pulse in the victim. The victim was then transported to INOVA Al-exandria Hospital where he remained in crit-ical condition until his recovery. Due to the ini-tial valiant efforts of both civilians and these two troopers, the victim has a better chance of recovery from this life-threatening accident. Trooper Muller has served with the Virginia State Police for five years. After graduating from the State Police Academy, he was as-signed to Springfield (Area 48), where he cur-rently serves. Originally from Brocton, New York, he holds a bachelor’s degree in criminal justice from Fredonia State University. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Trooper Muller and in thank-ing him for his years of service to Fairfax County and the Commonwealth of Virginia. He has demonstrated exceptional dedication to public safety and the mission of law enforce-ment, and for that, we owe him a special debt of gratitude.

STATEMENT COMMEMORATING NEW YORK STATE YELLOW RIB-BON DAY 
HON. PAUL TONKO 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 4, 2017 Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate New York State Yellow Ribbon Day. On April 9th, the State of New York will ob-serve Yellow Ribbon Day to honor current and former members of the United States Armed Forces. Yellow Ribbon Day has occurred on April 9th each year since 2006 following unan-imous support for resolutions by the New York State Legislature, and Proclamations by New York’s governors. New York State Yellow Ribbon Day, which was originally held at the Saratoga-Wilton Elks, and now takes place at the Halfmoon Town Hall, truly represents the spirit of the New York’s 20th Congressional District and its commitment to supporting and recognizing our service men and women. Yellow Ribbon Day is championed each year by Carol Hotaling, a resident of New York’s 20th Congressional District, who began making yellow ribbons to donate to the family members of troops deployed during Operation Desert Storm. Ms. Hotaling stands as a bea-con of goodwill and an outstanding member of our community by virtue of her dedication to creating a meaningful occasion to honor our troops. Ms. Hotaling chose the date of April 9 in honor of Matt Maupin, a U.S. Army Staff Ser-geant who was captured while serving in Iraq on that date in 2004. Staff Sergeant Maupin was the first U.S. military service member who went Missing-In-Action during Operation Iraqi Freedom. It is an honor and privilege to recognize our troops on this solemn occasion, and always, for their example of honor, sacrifice, strength, sense of duty, and leadership. On behalf of New York’s 20th Congressional District, I offer my heartfelt gratitude for their service in de-fense of our freedom, security, and way of life. f 
INTRODUCTION OF THE POLICE TRAINING AND INDEPENDENT REVIEW ACT 
HON. STEVE COHEN 
OF TENNESSEE  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 4, 2017 Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of The Police Training and Inde-pendent Review Act, a bill I introduced earlier today with colleague L
ACY CLAYof Missouri, and with Senator T
AMMY DUCKWORTH of Illi- nois. If enacted, the Police Training and Inde-pendent Review Act would help ensure the independent investigation and prosecution of law enforcement officers in cases involving their use of deadly force. It would also help ensure that law enforcement officers receive appropriate training. America received a wakeup call in Fer-guson, Missouri. We received another in Stat-en Island, New York. We received yet another in Ohio, South Carolina, Illinois, Minnesota, Louisiana and Oklahoma. Our nation faces sobering questions about the basic fairness of our criminal justice sys-tem. And we face sobering questions about race. These questions simply cannot be ig-nored. For too many, for too long, justice has seemed too lacking. Nearly 2 years ago, President Obama’s Commission on 21st Century Policing sug-gested several common sense reforms, includ-ing the use of independent prosecutors for po-lice-involved civilian deaths, as well as addi-tional training for law enforcement officers. Unfortunately, Congress has not yet acted on these recommendations. We need to stop asking local prosecutors to investigate the same law enforcement officers with whom they work so closely, and whose relationships they rely upon to perform their daily responsibilities. Prosecutors also often seek the support of their local police when they run for reelection. This is an inherent conflict of interest, and if we are serious about restoring a sense of fair-ness and justice, we must remove this conflict immediately. To be sure, the vast majority of prosecutors and law enforcement officers are well mean-ing, dedicated public servants, and we depend upon them to keep us safe from criminals. And they have dangerous jobs, as we have seen all too frequently. But the fact remains that some officers go beyond the law in a callous disregard for due process. When it comes to investigating, and potentially prosecuting, these actions, there is often a perception of unfairness, and that per-ception poisons the public trust. That is bad for law enforcement as well as citizens, making their work more dangerous. The Police Training and Independent Re-view Act would give states an incentive to use independent prosecutors when police use of deadly force results in a civilian death. It would also give states and incentive to provide training to police to help them better under-stand the racial and ethnic diversity of the communities they serve, as well as how best to work with individuals who are disabled or mentally ill. If states refuse to use independent prosecu-tors or provide appropriate training, they would begin to lose a portion of their federal funding. I urge my colleagues to help pass this legis-lation quickly, and help restore some much needed faith in our criminal justice system. I want to thank my colleague LACYCLAYfor his partnership on this bill. He is a tireless ad-vocate on these issues, and I am honored to work with him. I also want to thank Senator D
UCKWORTH for her leadership on this bill in the Senate.

TRIBUTE TO THE LIFE OF DR. JOAN L. VORIS 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 4, 2017 Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the life of Dr. Joan L. Voris, who passed away on February 11, 2017. Joan was an incredibly hard worker who dedicated her life to bettering the lives of others. Through her leadership as Associate Dean of the UCSF Fresno Medical Education Program she touched the lives of many that had the pleas-ure of knowing her. The passing of Dr. Voris has left a void in the Central Valley. Dr. Voris was born on August 5, 1941, in Brooklyn, New York, and lived much of her young life in Belmont, California. She then went on to earn her undergraduate and med-ical degree at Stanford University. She moved to Fresno in 1971, with her late husband Zirno Bezmalinovic, and dedicated the rest of her life to improving the central San Joaquin Val-ley. In 1980, Dr. Voris started her career at the Children’s Clinic at Valley Medical Center. This center cared for children who were pre-dominately low income. Coinciding, Dr. Voris

began her residency program, pulling all- nighters to get training so she could be an ex-pert in her field. In 1990, she became a mem-ber of the UCSF Fresno faculty, and then be-came president of the medical staff at Valley Medical Center in 1996. Dr. Voris was integral in helping facilitate the transition of the med-ical education program to the Community Medical Center, which cared for indigent pa-tients. Dr. Voris lived an incredible life and she uti-lized her passion for medicine to help others long before she became a Dean. Dr. Voris contributed her summers to providing care to children in rural Mexico, which is something she was able to share with her husband, as he did similar work in Bolivia. In 2002, Dr. Voris became Associate Dean of the UCSF Fresno Medical Education Pro-gram. During her service, she successfully in-creased the number of faculty from 77 to 229, as well as increased the number of residents and fellows trained annually by 70 percent. She not only helped her patients directly but helped protect future patients by ensuring that residents were well trained. Dr. Voris’ accomplishments and contribu-tions to the Valley have not gone unnoticed. In 2010, she was recognized as one of the Top Ten Professional Women by the Marjorie Mason Center, and in 2012 she was awarded the Physician Community Service Lifetime Achievement Award from the Fresno-Madera Medical Society. Dr. Voris ended her term as the longest-serving associate dean in its his-tory. She is survived by her children, Beatrice Bezmalinovic-Dhebar and husband Anirudh Dhebar of Wellesley, MA, Margaret Bezmalinovic of Sacramento, CA, and John Bezmalinovic and wife Tracy of Fresno, CA; and grandchildren, Mia Bezmalinovic, Arun Dhebar, and Chetan Dhebar. It is my honor to join Dr. Voris’ family in celebrating the life of this inspirational and hardworking woman. She truly led by example and improved the lives of others throughout her leadership. Mr. Speaker, it is with great respect that I ask my colleagues in the House of Represent-atives to pay tribute to the life of Dr. Joan Voris, whose expertise and generosity will be truly missed.

PFC Davis joined the Sheriff’s Office in 2009 after retiring from the U.S. Marine Corps as a gunnery sergeant. PFC Davis works in the Fairfax County Sher-iff’s Office Civil Enforcement Branch, where he is responsible for the processing and service of civil documents on behalf of the courts and is assigned to West Springfield and Burke in Fairfax County.

This past summer they partnered with 17 Starbucks stores to collect toiletries and baby care items for Artemis House, Fair-fax County’s only 24-hour domestic violence shelter. PFC Davis volunteers for many other Sheriff’s Office activities beyond his regular job assignment. He is a member of the award- winning Honor Guard team. He also partici-pates in Project Lifesaver, which assists fami-lies and caregivers of individuals with autism spectrum disorders, Down syndrome, Alz-heimer’s, and related conditions and disabil-ities.

Mrs. Friar was bom on July 22, 1929, in Holmes County, Mississippi. She was the third child of seven children born to Perry McKennie, Sr. and Mannie Pitchford McKennie. Mrs. Friar began her Christian journey at a very young age at Rockport Missionary Baptist Church, Lexington, Mississippi. She later moved her membership to Lebanon Mis-sionary Baptist Church, Lexington, Mississippi, where she taught at Lebanon School and started as an educator together, with her hus-band, the late Samuel Friar. She was a faithful member of Lebanon Missionary Baptist Church until her health declined. She was a Sunday School teacher, choir member, and chairperson of various ministries.

IN SUPPORT OF COMMEMORATING EQUAL PAY DAY AND EXPRESS-ING SUPPORT FOR PAYCHECK FAIRNESS ACT 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 4, 2017 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate Equal Pay Day, a day in which President John F. Kennedy, on June 10, 1963, proclaimed the simple principle that women deserve equal pay for equal work. The symbolism of this day is expressed in that, as we are more than three months into the year, women’s wages are only now begin-ning to catch up to what men were paid the previous year. Today, women on average make 78 cents for every dollar earned by men, amounting to an annual disparity of more than $10,876 dol-lars between full-time working men and women. It is important to understand what 78 cents to ever dollar means to a family: $10,876 could purchase 86 more weeks of food; $10,876 could afford more than 3,200 addi-tional gallons of gasoline; $10,876 could sup-port families in incredible ways, and yet, even today, $10,876 annually is exactly what women currently do without simply because of being women. For African American women and Latina women, the wage gap is even higher. African American women on average earn only 64 cents, while Latina women earn 54 cents to every dollar earned by white, non-Hispanic men. In my home state of Texas, however, the average wage gap for African American women is 59 cents to the dollar. For Latina women, it is an abysmal 45 cents to the dollar. This is why I support H.R. 1869, the Pay-check Fairness Act, which addresses loop-holes in the 1963 Equal Pay Act. H.R. 1869 would protect employees who voluntarily share their own salary information at work from retaliation by an employer and remove obstacles in the Equal Pay Act to fa-cilitate plaintiffs’ participation in class action lawsuits that challenge discrimination. H.R. 1869 would also better align key Equal Pay Act defenses with those in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, requiring employers to prove that pay disparities exist for legitimate, job-re-lated reasons. On this Equal Pay Day, I call upon House Republicans, all of whom have so far refused to co-sponsor the Paycheck Fairness Act, to answer this simple question: why are you op-posed to woman earning the same amount as men? I ask House Republicans to stop wasting the time of this Congress with attempts to re-peal the Affordable Care Act and focus on leg-islation that would actually help the American people. Let us call this opposition to the Paycheck Fairness Act, and opposition to all acts of Congress dating back to the 1960’s that have attempted to ameliorate the glaring disparities in wages between women and men, for what it is: deliberately and blatantly sexist. I ask all my colleagues to make the Pay-check Fairness Act a reality. We should remember: equal pay is not sim-ply a women’s issue—it is a family issue. It is time now to update antiquated pay equality laws and to eliminate the wage gap entirely between men and women. It is time for equal pay for equal work. f

HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 4, 2017 Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to rec-ognize the Burke Volunteer Fire and Rescue Department on the occasion of its 69th Annual Installation of Officers Banquet, and to thank its volunteers for filling an essential role in keeping our community safe.

RECOGNIZING HUGH MAHR 
HON. RODNEY DAVIS 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 4, 2017 Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speak-er, I rise today to recognize Hugh Mahr, a West Point cadet from my district who dis-played profound courage in saving the lives of two motorists last fall. Last November, Hugh and his parents en-countered a traffic accident on the interstate while on their way to their home in Mt. Au-burn. Hugh spared no time in approaching the vehicles, checking both the driver of the car and the driver of the tractor trailer. He quickly took control of the scene and de-termined that the driver of the car had a seri-ous head injury. Hugh administered first aid, applied pressure to her wound, and success-fully kept her conscious until first responders could arrive. Hugh also kept the tractor trailer driver from being removed from his vehicle until emergency personnel had evaluated the extent of his injuries, possibly saving his life. Without a doubt, Hugh showed true bravery in helping the individuals involved in the acci-dent. He was awarded the Army Achievement Medal for his actions which, ‘‘are in keeping with the finest traditions of military services and reflect great credit upon himself, the United States Corps of Cadets, the United States Military Academy, and the United States Army.’’ I am immensely proud of Hugh for the self-lessness he displayed in offering his assist-ance to civilians in need. I am glad he will soon join the finest men and women in our Armed Forces upon his completion at West Point. I thank Hugh for his courage. It is an honor to serve him in the United States Congress.

HONORING PERCY NORWOOD, JR. 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 4, 2017 Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speak-er, I rise today to honor Percy Norwood, Jr., who is a retired Captain, Commanding Officer, and Executive Officer of the United States Coast Guard. Mr. Norwood and his wife, Marie, have 36
1⁄2 years of marriage and live in Carrollton, Mis-sissippi. They are the proud parents of four adult children: Angelia, Kelvin, Lindsey Marie and Matthew, grandparents of five children: Devon, Shynell, Nathaniel II, Alexis and Camerin; and great-grandparents of one child, Alexander. Percy Norwood, Jr. retired from the United States Coast Guard in 2000 with the rank of Captain after almost 30 years of outstanding and dedicated service to our nation. At the time of his retirement, he held three key posi-tions: Commanding Officer of Coast Guard Headquarters Support Command, Com-manding Officer of Coast Guard Headquarters Staff, and Executive Officer of Coast Guard Headquarters in Washington, DC. Mr. Nor-wood also served as the first Director of the Coast Guard Recruiting Center from July 1995 to May 1998, where he was responsible for re-cruiting the best men and women to meet the Coast Guard’s military personnel needs. Dur-ing this assignment, Mr. Norwood led recruit-ers in creating the most diverse Coast Guard in our nation’s history. In 1993, Mr. Norwood served as team lead-er for the Vice President of the United States’ National Performance Review Task Force where his team explored ways to improve Coast Guard fisheries law enforcement out-comes. As a result of his team’s efforts, the Coast Guard maximized the use of technology to drastically reduce illegal fishing in U.S. terri-torial waters. While pursuing his Coast Guard career, Norwood performed numerous other jobs that included search and rescue; oil and hazardous material cleanup; conducting inves-tigations, evaluations and training; planning, logistics, budgeting and personnel support; and teaching Chemistry courses at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy. Mr. Norwood’s education and training in-cludes: graduating from Marshall High School in North Carrollton, MS in 1964 as class Val-edictorian; a Bachelor of Science in Chemistry from Alcorn State University in 1968; a Master of Science Degree in Analytical Chemistry from Tuskegee University in 1970, and a Mas-ter of Science Degree in Human Resource Management from the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, CA in 1980. His thesis entitled, ‘‘A Comparison of the Fit Between the Organization Climate of the Coast Guard, the Job/Career Expectations of Black College Graduates and their Perceptions about the Coast Guard’’ provided the basis for several initiatives that would ultimately change the ra-cial and gender makeup of the Coast Guard. Mr. Norwood is a 1977 graduate of the De-fense Race Relations Institute. He is a 1992 through 1993 Department of Transportation and Council for Excellence in Government Fel-low and a past member of the Senior Fellows Group whose focus is improving government. Mr. Norwood received numerous personal military awards that included the Legion of Merit, two Meritorious Service Medals, two Coast Guard Commendation Medals, and the Coast Guard Achievement Medal. His non- military awards include the National Image In-corporated Award (1993), the National Naval Officers Association’s (NNOA) Dorie Miller Award (1993), the National Association For Equal Opportunity in Higher Education (NAFEO) Distinguished Alumni Award (1995), and the NAACP Roy Wilkins Renown Service Award (1995). Mr. Norwood was inducted into the Alcorn State University Hall of Honor in 2006 for his outstanding leadership and serv-ice and elected by his fellow alumni as Alcornite of the Year in 2008 as Alcorn State University’s most distinguished Alumnus. Three of his four siblings (Laura, Willie and James) are also graduates of Alcorn State University. Mr. Norwood is a past president of the Met-ropolitan Washington, DC Area and the St. Louis, MO Alcorn Alumni Chapters, and the Immediate Past National President of the Alcorn State University National Alumni Asso-ciation. He is a past Vice President for Mem-bership, Eastern Region Vice President, and National President of the National Naval Offi-cers Association. He is a member of Rho Gamma Lambda Chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. where he chairs their Project Alpha Mentoring Program and serves as Chairman of the Greenwood Alphas Founda-tion. He also serves as President of the Board of Directors for Leflore-Carroll-Montgomery Counties Memorial Garden Cemetery, Record-ing Steward of Helm Chapel Christian Meth-odist Episcopal Church, and President of the Montgomery-Carroll-Grenada County Alcorn Alumni Chapter. He was recently appointed by the Carroll County Board of Supervisors as the Veterans Service Officer for Carroll County where he is helping veterans get the services and support they have earned and need. He also mentors two young men who are stu-dents at J.Z. George High School and tutors two Middle School students and one elemen-tary school student. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Mr. Percy Norwood, Jr., a Cap-tain, Leader and Educator for his dedication to serving others and giving back to the African American community.

HONORING THE LIFE OF MAX STAUFFER 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 4, 2017 Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to the life of Max Stauffer, who passed away on March 10, 2017, at the age of 69. Max was a well-re-spected business leader who owned the be-loved Yosemite Mountain Sugar Pine Railroad in Fish Camp, CA, just outside Yosemite Na-tional Park. Max Stauffer was born on June 7, 1947, in Switzerland and immigrated to the United States at the age of three. His father, Rudy and mother Luce, with the help of Max and his brothers, Guido and Bob, first opened the Yo-semite Mountain Sugar Pine Railroad in 1965. The railroad is a beloved tourist attraction that takes visitors on a four-mile scenic excursion through the Sierra National Forest. Max oversaw the business for more than 40 years. During his time running the popular tourist stop, Max gained the trust and respect of the community, as well as visitors from all over the United States. Known for his giving spirit, Max dedicated his time to those in need. He never denied a request for donations to charity and ensured the railroad was involved with the Boys and Girls Club, as well as the Make-a-Wish Foundation. Max wanted to make an impact on the pub-lic and dedicated much of his time to making a difference in any way he could. For 20 years he held the position of director of the Mountain Area Ski School. He was at one time the president of the Yosemite Sierra Visitors Bu-reau and a board member for 30 years. An advocate for education, he was a 22-year trustee of the Bass Lake Joint Union School District. Ensuring his time and labor was spent giving back to the people, shows the morale and great character he held. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to the great life of my friend Max Stauffer, whose humbleness, compas-sion, and generosity will be greatly missed. Max’s memory will live through his family and friends, and it is my honor to join them in cele-brating his impactful life, which will never be forgotten.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 4, 2017 Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my former high school basketball coach, Kris Glintborg, for his well-deserved in-duction into the Springfield Sports Hall of Fame. Mr. Glintborg has enriched the lives of many students through his 36 years as a teacher, coach and athletic director in our public schools. Throughout his career, Mr. Glintborg went above and beyond by taking on the re-sponsibility of coaching both girls’ basketball teams, in addition to boys’ basketball and track, when funding for women’s sports was limited, to ensure all students had equal op-portunities to pursue their dreams in sports. In addition, his leadership and dedication to our community has also been demonstrated through his commitment to coaching youth sports and officiating basketball, football and volleyball outside of our schools. Mr. Glintborg is someone I am proud to call a mentor and coach, and I can personally attest to values of teamwork, perseverance and love of the game he instills in all of his students. Mr. Glintborg has been a truly influential in-dividual in the lives of many young athletes in Springfield, including myself. Mr. Speaker, I would like to again formally congratulate Mr. Glintborg and thank him for all of his dedica-tion and service to students.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 4, 2017 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate University of Iowa senior Cory Clark of Pleasant Hill, Iowa, on winning the NCAA Division I Wres-tling Championship in the 133 pound weight class on March 18, 2017. This was the third consecutive year that Cory made it to the finals at the NCAA cham-pionships. After falling short in the previous two years, Cory walked onto the mat deter-mined that this year would be different. He left giving the Hawkeye Wrestling program their 82nd individual championship in program his-tory. Becoming an NCAA Division 1 Champion was no easy feat, especially this season. The four-time All-American had to wrestle through an arm injury for three months, including dur-ing his final match, which forced him to make some changes to his training routine, as well as wear a protective sleeve. Because of the dedication and toughness that Cory has exhib-ited on and off the mat, his injury did not stop

TRIBUTE TO EAGLE SCOUT GAVIN M
CKIBBEN 
HON. DAVID YOUNG 
OF IOWA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 4, 2017 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Gavin McKibben of Waukee, Iowa, for earning the rank of Eagle Scout. Gavin is a member of Boy Scout Troop 182. The Eagle Scout des-ignation is the highest advancement rank in scouting. Approximately two percent of Boy Scouts earn the Eagle Scout Award. The award is a performance-based achievement with high standards that have been well-main-tained over the past century. To earn the Eagle Scout rank, a Boy Scout is obligated to pass specific tests that are or-ganized by requirements and merit badges, as well as complete an Eagle Project to benefit the community. For his project, Gavin saw a need for a convenient way to collect worn U.S. flags to be properly disposed of in a retirement ceremony. Partnering with the Waukee Amer-ican Legion, who sponsored his service project, Gavin built a wood and metal box that is now permanently stationed outside the American Legion building where residents can drop off flags. The work ethic Gavin has shown in his Eagle Scout Project and through-out his scouting career speaks volumes about his commitment to serving a cause greater than himself and assisting his community. Mr. Speaker, the example set by this young man and his supportive family demonstrates the rewards of hard work, dedication, and per-severance. I am honored to represent Gavin and his family in the United States Congress. I know that all of my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives will join me in congratulating him on obtaining the Eagle Scout ranking and in wishing him nothing but continued success in his future education and career.
