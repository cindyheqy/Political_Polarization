Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, almost a quarter of the United States’ energyrelated greenhouse gas emissions are from fossil fuels that are produced from our Federal lands and waters. However, recent Government Accountability Office reports show that we don’t have very good data on much of these emissions, including the methane gas that is released that is leaked, vented, and flared. The first step on the path to reducing carbon pollution is simply to know what we are dealing with: What are the greenhouse gas emissions, and where are they coming from? That is why I am pleased to introduce a commonsense, bipartisan bill with my friends in the Climate Solutions Caucus and the congressional Safe Climate Caucus, which would simply require the Department of the Interior to calculate and publish, online, the amount of climatedamaging greenhouse gas pollution from oil, gas, and coal extracted from our Federal lands and waters. I urge the chairman of the Committee on Natural Resources to move swiftly to hold a hearing on this bipartisan bill and provide the American people with the transparency around energy production that they deserve. 
PHYSICIAN SHORTAGES (Mr. HARDY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. HARDY. Mr. Speaker, a recent study in the American Medical Association found that, in the next 10 years, we could be facing a shortage of over 100,000 physicians. To help combat this extreme doctor shortage, I have introduced the GO MED Act. My bill would implement a program to reallocate unused medical residency slots paid for by Medicare on a rolling basis to States feeling the worst effects of the physician shortage. It is widely accepted that where medical residents learn, they stay and practice. But in 2014, Medicare only paid for 137 residency slots in my State; whereas, the top 25 States average over 3,000 positions. That is because of an outdated system. We don’t have opportunities for students to stay in Nevada. Nevada isn’t the only State getting shortchanged. The top five States receiving funds through this program account for nearly half of what is spent annually. If we are serious about addressing access to care, my bill is a step in the right direction.

CONGRATULATIONS TO HOWARD AREA LIONS CLUB (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Howard Area Lions Club located in Pennsylvania’s Fifth Congressional District. The Howard Area Lions Club recently celebrated their 40th anniversary. The club has consistently earned the recognition as the largest Lions Club in Pennsylvania. There are probably many factors that have led them to this title, but none more significant than their commitment to the Lions Club motto, ‘‘We serve.’’ The members of this club have served as the chartering organization for Howard Scout Troop 353. I have been honored to serve as a Scoutmaster of their troop since they first assumed this responsibility. The Howard Area Lions operates a food bank that provides access to food for those struggling to make ends meet, including driving food to those individuals that have limited transportation. Very few community needs are addressed in the local community where the Lions are not a part of the solution. Mr. Speaker, as a fellow Lion, I am honored to offer my congratulations to the members of the Howard Area Lions Club. I am confident they will continue to serve the needs of their neighbors and communities. 
WE ARE UNWAVERING IN SUPPORT OF ISRAEL (Ms. GRAHAM asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. GRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, today I stand in support of the bilateral military aid package agreed upon by our Nation and the State of Israel this week. Israel, our greatest ally in the Middle East, faces threats from all sides: shells from Syria are landing in the Golan Heights; Hamas terrorists are stockpiling weapons in Gaza; Hezbollah fighters are gathering in Lebanon; and ISIL is fighting for control of the Sinai. Yet, surrounded by this chaos and terror, Israel is still dedicated to democracy, liberty, and justice—the same ideals we live by as Americans. This is why our relationship is so strong and why we must continue to support Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish state. This aid agreement makes it crystal clear to our enemies and allies that we are unwavering in our support for Israel and will help defend them against all who threaten their sovereignty. f 
ZIKA REGISTRY PROGRAM FOR WOMEN AND INFANTS (Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, yesterday I introduced the pregnancy and infant Zika registry. This bill will establish a CDC registry program for pregnant women and will track infants up to the age of 5 so that researchers can get a better understanding of the Zika impact. This registry will collect information on pregnancy and infant outcomes following laboratory evidence of Zika virus infection during pregnancy. The data collected will be used to update recommendations for clinical care, to plan for services for pregnant women and families affected by the Zika virus, and to improve prevention of Zika virus infection during pregnancy. I invite all my Floridian colleagues and fellow Members to cosponsor this bill. It is a responsible tool to increase our knowledge of Zika and help increase the quality and standard of care for patients. 
END HUNGER NOW (Mr. MCGOVERN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, as we recognize September as Hunger Action Month, I rise to draw attention to the widespread problem of hunger among teenagers. While our Nation’s recovery is progressing, 7 million teens remain food insecure, and we know they often face additional hardships. Today the Urban Institute is briefing Members of Congress and their staff on two new reports that highlight these circumstances and explore how teens cope with hunger. Among a number of troubling conclusions, the report finds that teens fear the stigma of being hungry and often refuse to accept food or assistance. They skip meals and sometimes turn to dangerous behaviors just so their parents or siblings can eat. They often feel 
the need to bear the responsibility for feeding their families. Teenagers deserve a normal childhood. They should be focused on school and developing their passions, not worrying about where their next meal is coming from. I encourage all of my colleagues to read these reports and join me in working to end hunger now. 
b0915 PROHIBITING THE TRANSFER OF ANY DETAINEE AT UNITED STATES NAVAL STATION, GUANTANAMO BAY, CUBA Mr. FORBES. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 863, I call up the bill (H.R. 5351) to prohibit the transfer of any individual detained at United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 863, the amendment printed in part A of House Report 114–744 is adopted, and the bill, as amended, is considered read. The text of the bill, as amended, is as follows: 
H.R. 5351 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. PROHIBITION ON ANY TRANSFER OF ANY INDIVIDUAL DETAINED AT UNITED STATES NAVAL STATION, GUANTANAMO BAY, CUBA. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill, as amended, shall be debatable for 1 hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Armed Services. The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. FORBES ) and the gentleman from Washington (Mr. SMITH) will each control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia. 
Mr. FORBES. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on H.R. 5351. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Virginia? There was no objection. Mr. FORBES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in support of H.R. 5351 offered by Mrs. WALORSKI  of Indiana. H.R. 5351 would temporarily suspend the transfer of detainees held at the detention facility at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay. Under this bill, the suspension would last until either the National Defense Authorization Act for the next fiscal year becomes law or until the new President takes office on January 21, 2017. Mr. Speaker, the circumstances of the last several months have brought the need for such legislation to light. In 2009, a special panel convened by the Obama administration evaluated every detainee then at GTMO. The Obama administration made it clear at the time that it was lawful for some detainees to be held, without charges, pursuant to the laws of war. Such detainees, the Obama administration believed, included those who had a ‘‘significant organizational role with al Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated forces.’’ Other detainees, the Obama administration believed, should continue to be lawfully held in 2009 included those who had ‘‘advanced training or experience,’’ a ‘‘history of associations with extremist activity,’’ or had ‘‘expressed recidivist intent.’’ In other cases, the Obama administration has recommended that certain detainees be prosecuted and some sent to other countries. But even for those GTMO detainees to be sent elsewhere, the Obama administration noted that the United States had the legal authority to hold these detainees, and the detainees could still be threatening. The Obama administration argued then and since that a few selected detainees could be transferred to other countries from GTMO only if ‘‘feasible’’ and ‘‘appropriate’’ security measures could be instituted to mitigate the dangers posed by these very threatening individuals. Mr. Speaker, this is precisely why this legislation is needed. Since January, the Obama administration has sent 46 detainees from GTMO to other countries. In August alone, 15 detainees were transferred. I worry that whatever arrangements might exist in the receiving countries will be woefully insufficient to keep the danger at bay. I am concerned that these detainees will again threaten the United States or our partners, just as other detainees have done. I fear detainees are being hurriedly moved from GTMO in order to fulfill an 8yearold campaign promise to close GTMO. Mr. Speaker, this bill is a sensible and sound response. Today, there are 61 detainees in GTMO. The Obama administration has made it clear that at least 20 of these detainees should be sent elsewhere. H.R. 5351 prevents any GTMO detainee transfers for the next several months. The bill prohibits GTMO transfers to the United States or to other countries until the National Defense Authorization Act for this fiscal year takes effect or until the new administration assumes office, whichever happens first. This means the new President will be able to consider anew the grave risks which GTMO transfers pose. It will also mean that the new administration will know how the provisions of a bipartisan National Defense Authorization Act will govern its actions. The United States military notes that it is ‘‘committed to ensuring detainees are kept in a safe, secure, humane environment’’ at GTMO. It also reports that ‘‘intelligence gained at GTMO has prevented terrorist attacks and saved lives.’’ A pause in GTMO transfers prevents rash and sudden actions to empty GTMO on an arbitrary and selfimposed deadline. Mr. Speaker, that is why I strongly support H.R. 5351, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 5 minutes. The gentleman from Virginia described very well the process that the Obama administration put in place in 2009. It was a significant improvement. The real problem that we had with Guantanamo was, when it was originally conceived as a place to hold detainees under the law of war, there were, at one point, nearly 800 detainees there. A lot of them were brought there without much in the way of vetting or assurances that they were, in fact, threats. In fact, under the Bush administration, well over 500 of those detainees were released, and there really wasn’t much of a process. Somewhere in the neighborhood of over 20 percent of those detainees did return to the battlefield and did present a threat to the country. There simply wasn’t a process. So, as Mr. FORBES described quite well, in 2009, the Obama administration put in place a process. At the time, there were 242 detainees remaining in Guantanamo Bay. The process they put in place was to go through every single one of them and say: Who are these people? What is their threat level? They evaluated all of them and put them into different categories. They determined that some were not a threat and could be released. 
Regrettably, something we don’t like to talk about, as I sort of alluded to earlier, is that a number of these people were picked up erroneously, either with the wrong name or the wrong information, and we really didn’t have any evidence on them, or the evidence we thought we had turned out to be wrong. A fair number of these detainees were being held really for no good reason, so they tried to determine who those were. Now, there are also some very, very bad people at Guantanamo Bay. As Mr. FORBES also indicated, the President reaffirmed our right under the law of war to hold those people, and I support that very strongly. But what the Obama administration has done to get that number down to 61 is they have transferred the ones that a board of defense, intelligence, security, and Justice Department experts had determined were not a threat to the United States and were transferable. The problem that came up was: Transferable, but to where? Who would take these people? Then, there was the last provision that Mr. FORBES also mentioned. Wherever they were transferred to, the Obama administration wanted to make sure that there were some assurances from those countries that they would look after those folks, hold them securely, and make sure that they were not a threat. So that is what has got us down to the 61 number is the release of detainees that this board, again, of defense, intelligence, Justice Department, and security experts determined were not a threat to the United States and were transferable. Now, of that number, since 2009, that returned—at this point, I think just this morning, two more detainees were determined to have returned to the battlefield; for the most part, this is return to fighting with the Taliban in Afghanistan—is still a number around 6 percent of all folks that have been released from Guantanamo Bay, under the Obama administration, that have been deemed to have returned to the battlefield. The previous group, under the Bush administration, was somewhere between 20 and 30 percent, depending on how it was calculated. So, they have done a very careful job of who should be vetted and where they should be transferred to. Of the 61 that are left, there are 20 that are currently eligible for transfer. There are 10 in the military commission system and 31 others that are reserved for continued law of war detention. The Obama administration is of the opinion that there are only 20 of the remaining 61 that are potentially transferable. They have been vetted through this very lengthy process that I have described that has been successful to the point that, again, only 6 percent have been deemed to have returned to the battlefield. What this bill would do is stop this President, frankly, from being President on this issue for the last however many months there are left in his administration. If, in fact, we can find secure places to transfer these 20, then it is the right thing to do, and the President ought to be allowed to do it. There is no reason to stop him from doing it. Now, the argument that you will hear repeatedly from the other side is: we can’t take the chance. Yes, they have been vetted; yes, the percentage is low; but this person might do something bad if we release them. I would suggest that that turns the American justice system on its head. There are a whole lot of people walking the streets in this country who might do something bad. You do all kinds of analyses to determine that they might. Maybe we should lock them up, no trial, no process, no nothing, and say: look, better safe than sorry. But that is not the way we do things. Now, we do have a process here. And there are some that, under the law of war, are determined to be dangerous. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. SMITH of Washington. I yield myself an additional 1 minute. Once we have determined that they are not a threat, under our opinion, and are transferable, to say, look, sorry, we are just going to hold you because we want to, is really a violation of the U.S. Constitution and due process of law. To hold this process up even for a few months is not necessary. As I said, we are talking about 20 people that the Obama administration is trying to determine if they can find a safe place to send them. This is not about closing Guantanamo. I strongly support closing Guantanamo. I will skip that argument for the purpose of this debate. That is not going to happen. We have had votes on the House floor. There is not support in Congress for it. There is a prohibition in law that continues to be in law on transferring any of those detainees to the United States or spending any money to detain them in the United States. So it is not going to happen. The question really is about the 20 people who have been deemed not to be security threats to the U.S., who have been deemed to be transferable, and whether or not we can transfer them. This bill would say ‘‘no’’ and would hold those 20 people for the next 5 or 6 months, regardless of the evidence and regardless of the vetting process. Now, it is possible these 20 people won’t be transferred, that we won’t find a country for them, but there is no reason to strip the President of his lawful authority to do that. Again, I want to emphasize that the Obama administration has gone through a careful vetting process, unlike the Bush administration, so I don’t think we should interfere with that vetting process. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. FORBES. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. WALORSKI ), my friend and colleague who has done such a great job in working this piece of legislation. Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express strong support for my bill, H.R. 5351, which would prohibit the transfer of any individual detained at Guantanamo Bay. Mr. Speaker, last night, the news broke that two more former GTMO detainees have rejoined militant groups. This is just the latest case of GTMO detainees being released, only to return to the fight. In fact, the President’s own Director of National Intelligence reports 30 percent of former detainees are known or suspected to have reengaged in terrorist activities. Yet, the President continues to release more and more detainees. When President Obama came to office, there were 240 detainees at GTMO. The number is now down to 61, after the most recent and largest ever transfer last month. Another 20 have been cleared for transfer. When Hoosiers in my district hear these numbers, they worry that these transfers are leaving our Nation open to new vulnerabilities and will make Americans less safe. I could not agree more. While I wish we didn’t have to stand here debating this bill, it is an unfortunate reality that our President remains willing to continue putting a misguided campaign promise ahead of the national security. Why else would detainees, who were once deemed too dangerous to transfer by President Obama’s own GTMO task force, have been released to begin with? That is what happened with 8 of the detainees who were part of the largest ever transfer of GTMO detainees last month. The task force’s recommendation was reversed. These dangerous detainees were redesignated as safe for transfer, and they were sent to the United Arab Emirates. With all this in mind, it was, sadly, no surprise when, in March of this year, Mr. Paul Lewis, the President’s Special Envoy for Guantanamo Closure, testified in front of the House Foreign Affairs Committee that ‘‘Americans have died because of GTMO detainees.’’ What else will it take for the President to change course on this flawed campaign promise? As a recently released, unclassified report on Guantanamo detainees highlighted, the individuals remaining at GTMO today represent truly the worst of the worst of the post9/11 era. These are hardened terrorists. These are al Qaeda bomb makers, bodyguards, plotters, and recruiters. Among them is Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the mastermind of the September 11 attacks. Americans are safer with these dangerous detainees securely locked up. b0930 I have been to GTMO. I have seen our military, the greatest fighting force 
the world has ever seen, standing guard to protect the American people from those who would do us harm. I know the GTMO facility is the safest, most secure place for these detainees. But this isn’t just about the terrorists themselves. There are also significant concerns about the capacity and the capabilities of the countries receiving these transfers and the adequacy and transparency of the agreements being made by their governments. Take, for example, the recent case of a former detainee who was released to Uruguay, but sparked an international manhunt after he disappeared shortly before the Rio Summer Olympics; or the former detainee who was transferred to Sudan, a state sponsor of terrorism, and reappeared in Yemen as a leader of the al Qaeda affiliate there. It is clear these individuals desire to return to the battlefield, and that the countries receiving them may not have adequate resources to effectively track and monitor their whereabouts and activities. Unfortunately, despite repeated inquiries of the administration, we, as Members of Congress, still don’t know much about the commitments our government has or gets from these countries. We don’t know what, if any, penalties have been levied against countries that lose track of our former detainees. Transparency is long overdue. That is why I authored this language in this year’s National Defense Authorization budget that would require complete written agreements for any transfers between countries to be shared with the appropriate congressional oversight committees. To those who may have concerns about my bill, I want to be clear what this legislation does and does not do. First and foremost, this legislation would not enact a permanent, lasting ban. What it does do is halt transfers until either this year’s NDAA is signed into law or until President Obama leaves office on January 20, 2017. Mr. Speaker, as recently as last week, we heard the President say that he was ‘‘not ready to concede’’ that he cannot close GTMO before leaving office. The week before, we heard a similar message from Vice President BIDEN. With President Obama’s time in office winding down, accelerating transfers to achieve a campaign promise puts Americans at risk. I am grateful to stand here with the national security leaders in this House on this bill, and to remind the American people that our first priority is the safety and security of our fellow Americans. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this important legislation. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. NADLER ). Mr. NADLER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill that would block all transfers out of Guantanamo for the remainder of the year or until the end of the President’s current term. This bill would, for the first time ever, impose a complete ban on all transfers out of Guantanamo. Not only would the bill block all transfers of Guantanamo detainees to the United States, even for purposes of prosecution in Federal court, but it would also ban the resettlement or repatriation of detainees cleared by the United States for transfer to foreign countries. The bill would be effective until the earlier of January 21, 2017, or the effective date of the next National Defense Authorization Act. To quote the ACLU: ‘‘This bill violates the bedrock constitutional prohibition on Congress passing any legislation that violates the Constitution’s Bill of Attainder Clause.’’ In effect, it finds all the inmates at Guantanamo guilty of something unspecified, without trial, and sentences them to life without parole. That is what this bill does, along with the other series of bills. But by saying you can’t transfer anybody anywhere, you are saying they must remain there indefinitely whether they have been tried or not, whether they have been found guilty or not, whether our own experts think they are a threat to the United States or not. Even if we find that someone is factually not guilty of any act of terrorism or anything else and we have no right to hold them, we still cannot release them. By what right do we claim such a power? Since when is it okay for Members of Congress to put people in jail and keep them there who are not guilty of anything? How can an American legislative body pass a provision that says we will hold someone in jail forever not only without trial, but even if we have determined that he is innocent of everything? That is the basic argument here. This bill, the idea that we will keep people in jail forever without their having been found guilty of anything, without their having been tried, it makes a mockery of the American Constitution. It makes a mockery of all our pretenses to stand for liberty. It makes a mockery of habeas corpus. This would even say that if someone were granted a writ of habeas corpus, he could not be released even if a Court granted him a writ of habeas corpus. Plainly unconstitutional, not to mention immoral. I will say one other thing on a completely different level. This expires either when we pass the next NDAA or when the next President takes office. It says, in effect, this President is not really our President, for all practical purposes, for every practical purpose. He was elected by the American people 4 years ago, but we don’t like him, so we are going to say he can’t do certain things that his successor can do. We are going to put something in writing only for this President. Now, if this said this expires when the next NDAA is passed or it expires a year from now or whenever, that would be one thing. But this says the NDAA or when the next President takes office. In other words, very much like the Senate is doing with Judge Garland. We don’t trust the President. Maybe we don’t. That is a political decision, but it is not a right decision. We don’t trust the President to act as President. We repudiate the judgment the American people made in the last election. We say that, for certain purposes, his term has expired and we will wait for the next President. That also is pernicious and against our constitutional values. On every level, this bill is probably unconstitutional and certainly immoral, and I oppose it. Mr. FORBES. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. WILSON), my friend and colleague. Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. I thank Chairman RANDY FORBES . Mr. Speaker, when I was first elected, one of the first persons to greet me was my classmate of 2001, Chairman RANDY  FORBES . From the beginning, I saw what a gentleman he was, what a dedicated Member of Congress he has been. I so appreciate his leadership on behalf of national defense, promoting peace through strength. Additionally, he and his wife, Shirley, are stalwart Christians, promoting religious freedom successfully around the world, making a difference. I am grateful to be an original cosponsor of H.R. 5351, prohibiting the transfer of Guantanamo detainees. Introduced by Congresswoman JACKIE  WALORSKI , this further protects American families by halting the transfer of any detainee to any location. During the August recess, sadly, the administration released 15 more dangerous detainees from Guantanamo Bay. The prisoners that are being held there—and I have been to Guantanamo Bay twice, I know the professionalism of the American military—these are the coconspirators of Osama Bin Laden, trained mass murderers. By holding them there, we show our resolve and that we have not forgotten the mass murderous attacks of September 11. The President’s reckless release of detainees puts American servicemembers and families at risk. The deterrence of incarceration has never been more important. We, today, have a greater spread of terrorist safe havens than in the history of the world. From Algeria in North Africa, through the Middle East, through South Asia, all the way to Indonesia and the Philippines, these safe havens of Islamic terrorists are going to receive persons to come and be reinforcements. In March, the Director of National Intelligence reported that at least 116 detainees, nearly a third, released from Guantanamo have returned to the battlefield. What we have further is Reuters reports that more have returned to 
the battlefield to threaten and kill American families. I appreciate the leadership of Congresswoman WALORSKI of Indiana, and I urge my colleagues to vote in support. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. In the prime sponsor of this bill’s remarks, there are a whole lot of sort of halftruths and assumptions that got jammed together that don’t actually make sense and are not actually the facts that are before us to paint a very dark picture that isn’t what we are dealing with. Let me just run through those. We heard that 30 percent of the people have returned to the battlefield or are suspected to have returned to the battlefield. That 30 percent figure relies, again, on the folks that were released before the Obama administration when, again, quite frankly, people were picked up in a very haphazard manner and released in a very haphazard manner. Since 2009, since the Obama administration did the vetting process of all of these people, the actual rate of people who have been deemed to have returned to the battlefield, even with the two that were counted this morning, is 5.6 percent. So when you hear 30 percent—oh my gosh, 30 percent of these people are returning to the battlefield; how can we release them—that is not the number. Okay? Now, you can argue about the 5.6 if you want, but let’s at least get the number right. Since the Obama administration did the proper vetting process, the number is 5.6 percent to have been confirmed to have returned to the battlefield, including the two that were added this morning. It is also worth noting that when we say the ones that are left are the worst of the worst, there is truth in that. Obviously, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed would fall right up at the top of that; and 41 of the folks who are there do fall into that category of the worst of the worst. None of those 41 have been cleared for transfer. What we are talking about is the 20 who have been cleared for transfer, and the President—those are the people that President Obama has released and repatriated to other countries over the course of the last 7 years, are people who have been cleared for transfer; with one exception, which I am sure will come up at some point, and that was in the prisoner swap for Bowe Bergdahl. And we can relitigate that argument as well, but that has really got nothing to do with what is going on here. There, the President made a decision to transfer five people that had not been cleared for transfer in exchange for our captured member of the military. So except for that situation, all of these people who have been released have been vetted and cleared. Lastly, I just want to—well, not lastly, actually two more things. The most disturbing thing that was said was that these people who have been released are people who, at one time, were suspected of being dangerous, and that is true. They wouldn’t have been there if they weren’t suspected of being dangerous. But it turns out in these cases we were wrong. And you can go back through the history of post9/11, you can find a number of instances when we were wrong. I remember right after 9/11 there was a doctor in San Antonio who had done a whole bunch of suspicious things, and everybody was absolutely convinced that this guy was tied in with al Qaeda. He was held for an extended period of time, and then people looked into it and they said: Oops, sorry, we got the wrong guy. We are going to let you go. That happens, and I don’t blame law enforcement in the least bit for that. It is a difficult job. In this case, when you are talking about terrorists, you should err on the side of caution. If you have probable cause, you should pick somebody up and you should be sure. But now what this side is saying, once you have been suspected, even if it turns out that you were completely wrong in that suspicion: Sorry, we are just going to lock you up for the rest of your life without due process or a possibility of trial. That is unbelievably unconstitutional and just flat wrong. Yes, these people were suspected. They wouldn’t be in Guantanamo if they weren’t. But what was determined was that, of those people who were suspected, a number of them turned out we were wrong. And of the ones that are left, there are 20 out of the 61 that are eligible for transfer. Now, again, finding the right country to send them to, it might not happen. All right. So no one is talking about releasing the worst of the worst. The President has made it clear those 41 are not transferrable. We are talking about the 20 that have been deemed to be transferrable. Just because you were suspected at one point, I would hate to think that we would have a country that says: If you are suspected of a crime, sorry, we are going to lock you up and that is it, even if evidence later shows that we were wrong. That is not the way we should do things in law enforcement. Lastly, we have heard that this is all about a campaign promise to close Guantanamo. Again, this has nothing to do with closing Guantanamo. Now, the President and the Vice President are reluctant to give up on what they think is the right policy, closing Guantanamo Bay. So until they leave office, they are not just going to say: We are not going to do it. They think it is important. Again, I won’t relitigate that argument, but there are people who feel passionately that it is the right thing to do. But that is not what we are talking about doing here. We are talking about 20 people who have been deemed not to be a threat to the United States that we are, nonetheless, incarcerating, and the President is talking about transferring them. We are not talking about transferring the 41, not talking about closing Guantanamo. It is still in law that we can’t close Guantanamo. So it is not about a campaign promise. It is about upholding the values in the Constitution of the United States of America that says that if we have you incarcerated and it turns out that our evidence was wrong and you are not guilty of what we thought you were guilty of or, in this case, not a threat to us in the way that we thought you were, then we should release you, not hold you. We are not a dictatorship. We are not a country like Saddam Hussein used to run, where he just locked people up because he wanted to. That is not who we should be. This bill takes away the ability of this President to transfer those 20 people who have been clearly deemed transferrable by the Defense Department, the Justice Department, Homeland Security Department, Intelligence Community experts. They want to stop, as Mr. NADLER  said, this President from being President. Now, they never wanted him to be President in the first place, and it is incredibly inconvenient that he got elected twice, from their perspective. But he is the President and he should have the authority to exercise the Office of the Presidency until January 20 of next year, when he is done. b0945 This bill unfairly strips him of that right. Again, we are talking about 20 people who have been deemed to be transferable. So let’s get the facts straight and then argue based on those facts. It is not 30 percent; it is 5.6. We are not talking about releasing the worst of the worst. We are not talking about closing Guantanamo Bay. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. FORBES. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. HARTZLER ), my friend and colleague. Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, I thank so much, first, my colleague JACKIE WALORSKI for introducing this very important piece of legislation that I am proud to cosponsor, and secondly, Chairman FORBES . I thank the gentleman for his leadership on national defense, on faith, and so many other issues important to our country. This bill is crucial. It prevents the Obama administration from transferring any remaining detainees from the Guantanamo Bay detention facility in the last months of his Presidency. Now, this is important because the administration seems determined to clear the facility. In 2016, 46 detainees have been transferred. Last month alone, 15 terrorists were released. More are expected as Vice President BIDEN has 
stated that it is the President’s intention to empty GTMO by the time he leaves office. This rush to close Guantanamo is dangerous, reckless, and shortsighted. Already we have learned that 30 percent of those who have been released have returned to the battlefield. American soldiers who fought so hard to take the enemy off the battlefield now have to face them again. But this release is beyond dangerous; it is an injustice. Let me share an example. In 2011, shortly after taking office, I received the gutwrenching news that a young soldier from my district had lost his life in the war on terror in Afghanistan. Christopher Stark was a combat engineer serving one of the most dangerous missions of the war: clearing roads of IEDs so his unit could pass by safely. Day after day he saved others, but, ultimately, he wasn’t able to save himself when an IED exploded. Christopher gave his life to save others. His country gained a hero; his mother lost a son. She has become my friend and is a hero in her own right as she bravely comes to terms with his sacrifice—relying on her faith to give her daily strength while accepting the burden and hallowed position of being a Gold Star mom. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. FORBES. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30 seconds. Mrs. HARTZLER. So you can imagine my dismay and consternation when I learned that, in his rush to fulfill campaign promises to close GTMO, the administration released a terrorist by the name of Obaidullah in the last round of detainee transfers. Who was he? He was part of an al Qaedaassociated improvised explosive device cell that targeted coalition forces in Afghanistan. He was captured by U.S. security forces during a raid in his compound, where they found 23 landmines as well as a notebook containing electronic and detonator schematics involving explosives and mines similar to the one that killed Christopher. Releasing Obaidullah was wrong. He was targeted for prosecution and his status was changed. American soldiers like Christopher Stark lost their lives due to his activities. We need to ensure our American soldiers stay safe and also that justice is served. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass this important piece of legislation. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds to make two quick points. The Obama administration is not determined to clear the facility before they leave office. They want to close the facility. But, again, those 41 that have been deemed dangerous, it is the Obama administration’s position that they shouldn’t be held in Guantanamo Bay, that they should be held in secure prisons in the United States, not to let them go. I think that is one of the most misleading things about this argument that is being made by the other side repeatedly that they simply want to let them all go. It is not their goal to empty GTMO before January 20. It is their goal to still try to close the prison so that they can be held here in the U.S. Again, that is a separate argument, but I just want to make sure that it is clear it is not the goal of the administration to simply empty out the prison and send all 61 wherever. We are talking about 20 that have been deemed eligible for transfer. Mr. FORBES. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from New York (Ms. STEFANIK ), my friend and colleague. Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, first, I want to thank my HASC colleague and friend, JACKIE WALORSKI , for all of her efforts to prevent the transfer of terrorists from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and introducing H.R. 5351, of which I am a proud cosponsor. I stand here today as the Representative of the Army’s 10th Mountain Division, resilient warriors who have been an integral force in the war on terror in Afghanistan and Iraq since 9/11. As we all know, GTMO is comprised of some of the world’s most heinous terrorists, and we have lost many servicemembers’ lives in their pursuit. As the 10th Mountain Division and others continue to serve in harm’s way, it is our duty to provide oversight and ensure the administration is held accountable before any American dies at the hands of a released detainee. Releasing these terrorists and closing GTMO is a true national security concern at home; therefore, I urge my colleagues to stand with our brave men and women in uniform and show them that their sacrifices have not gone to waste and vote today in support of H.R. 5351. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds before yielding to Mr. NADLER . I want to make clear; I represented Joint Base LewisMcChord for 16 years, until 2012, and wrote hundreds of sympathy cards to family members who lost loved ones from that base in Afghanistan and Iraq, and I will take the backseat to no one in terms of respecting what they did, how they fought, and what they sacrificed, making sure that we do everything we can to protect them and give them the tools they need to protect our country and protect themselves. I thank the Republicans for working in a bipartisan manner on that issue. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. NADLER). Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, we keep hearing that the people of Guantanamo are the worst of the worst, that they are very dangerous, and that their release would pose a threat to the United States. Some are, it is true. Some are probably the worst of the worst, but some aren’t. Some are people who were picked up by mistake. Some are people who were sold for a bounty. If you go into a wild place like Afghanistan and you let the word out that we will pay $5,000 for a terrorist and the McCoys are fighting the Hatfields, the McCoys will turn in a Hatfield and say that he is a terrorist. Some of that happened. It is our job not to keep everybody in jail for life but to figure out who is who: who is the worst of the worst; who is innocent; who is there because of a mistake. Release those who are innocent; release those who do not pose a threat; and release those who didn’t do anything. Simply getting up and repeating time after time on this floor that the people there are the worst of the worst doesn’t make it true. What kind of a system of justice or anything else is it where you say: We are going to hold forever, with no trial, people who we have already determined to pose no threat to the United States, who we have already determined have done nothing wrong, but we are going to hold them in jail forever because some of them are bad people—no trial, no proceeding, hold them in jail forever? By what right would we do that? How do we appear to all the countries and to all the people that we are trying to appeal to, saying our way is the rule of law, go with our way, don’t go with the Taliban, we are fair to people, they are not, and then we have people in jail forever with no hope of release, with no trial, no proceeding, nothing? That is what this bill is. This bill is unAmerican in the extreme. It is counterproductive because it gives the Taliban and everybody else the propaganda against us that we are a bunch of hypocrites, which we are if we pass bills like this, and we shouldn’t pass it. Mr. FORBES. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Indiana (Mr. MESSER ), my friend and colleague. Mr. MESSER. Mr. Speaker, first, I want to thank Chairman FORBES for his leadership on this issue and for his distinguished career here in Congress. The gentleman certainly will be missed. Mr. Speaker, some issues just boil down to common sense. Despite the rhetoric of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, there is no evidence of Good Samaritan sweet peas being kept at Guantanamo Bay. Common sense would tell you that it is a very bad idea to bring the world’s worst criminals to America’s shore. It is an equally bad idea to release them. That is why I rise today in support of H.R. 5351, a bill that would stop the transfer of individuals detained at the United States Naval Station at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Last Sunday, our Nation recognized the 15th anniversary of the worst attack on U.S. soil, an attack where we 
lost nearly 3,000 American lives. That tragic event marked the beginning of a war against terrorists who espouse radical Islam. Since then, Guantanamo Bay has been instrumental in detaining enemy combatants engaged in that war. Today, there are 61 suspected terrorists remaining at GTMO. They are largely regarded as the worst of the worst. They are the folks that no other country would take—too dangerous to transfer, the most dangerous criminals in the world. But the President wants to release these terrorists or, worse yet, bring them to American soil, putting Americans at risk. That is a really bad idea, and we can’t, in good conscience, let that happen. That is why we have had bipartisan support for keeping GTMO open in the past. There are simply not enough standards in place to make these transfers without endangering American lives. I am proud of the leadership of my colleague, JACKIE WALORSKI , on this important issue, and I urge my colleagues to stop any reckless transfers of terrorists to American soil. Not one American life is worth the risk. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds to say, regrettably, the previous gentleman is simply wrong. He said that America would not arrest as a terrorist someone who turned out not to be a terrorist. The facts are simply clear that that is just not the case. It is not that we are doing anything malicious. It is a complicated and difficult job. As Mr. NADLER pointed out, there is a lot to sort out. It is not even in dispute that we have arrested and incarcerated people because we thought they were terrorists and found out that we were wrong. That is not debated. A number of them have been released. So to say that, well, if we arrested them and put them in there, they must be bad and they can’t be sent out is precisely what is wrong with the thinking behind this piece of legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. FORBES. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time. I am prepared to close, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, the most interesting thing about this debate is that, as we have moved on from speaker to speaker, the proponents of this legislation keep saying the same things over and over again that simply are not true. Again, I just want to close by saying I wish we could debate this on the actual facts, on what is in front of us. There certainly is an argument to be made that we should err on the side of just locking them up no matter what. I think that is the wrong argument. I think Mr. NADLER has very clearly articulated why, as a country, we shouldn’t do that, we shouldn’t pick people up and say, if there is any possibility we might be wrong, we are just going to take away your freedom and lock you up without due process. It is a violation of the fundamental principles of our country. We could at least have that debate. But we keep hearing a number of things that simply are not correct. Number one, this is just the President trying to fulfill a campaign promise to close down Guantanamo Bay and get everybody out of there before he leaves office. That is completely wrong. There are 41 people at Guantanamo Bay who this administration has said under no circumstances are they transferable. Those are the worst of the worst, and they are not talking about transferring them. What we are talking about are the 20 people who have been deemed transferable. Then we have the argument, well, gosh, they wouldn’t be in there if they hadn’t done something wrong. As we all know, law enforcement occasionally makes mistakes. So that is not correct either. These 20 people have been examined and deemed to be transferable, and we should not hold them because the 41 other people who happen to be there are really bad people. That is not, again, according to the way that we should do justice in our country. So this is not about closing Guantanamo. We have had that debate numerous times, and I have lost that debate on the House floor. I understand that. This is about the Obama administration doing what the Bush administration should have done in the first place, which was to be a lot more careful about whom you put in there; and then once they are in there, examine it, make sure you actually have sufficient evidence and these are people you need to hold. That is what the Obama administration did in 2009 with the 242 inmates who were being detained at Guantanamo. They determined that some of them were there incorrectly and were transferable. That is what we are talking about. b1000 This bill would stop that. This bill would say basically that President Obama is not actually President in this area for the rest of his term. That is wrong. He got elected and he ought to be able to make those decisions. I will also say in this area, he has proven to be vastly more careful than his predecessor. Again, the recidivism rate of those released in 2009 is 5.6 percent. Prior to that, that number was closer to 30. So a process was put in place that actually did work, and we ought to respect that process and not restrict the President’s ability to basically do justice. Finally, I just want to say, as has been noted a couple of times, Mr. FORBES will be leaving our committee. I have enjoyed serving with him during my time. He is—as Stephen Colbert would say—a worthy opponent, and I enjoy that. We have had a lot of great debates on the committee. I am very, very sorry to see him go. I thank him also for his service. We have worked in a very bipartisan fashion on a number of issues and upheld, I think very, very well, the bipartisan tradition of the House Armed Services Committee. So I have enjoyed serving with him. I appreciate that service. I wish him the best of luck in the future. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. FORBES. Mr. Speaker, could I inquire as to how much time I have remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Virginia has 14 minutes remaining. Mr. FORBES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, let me, first of all, say I have enormous respect for the ranking member, and he has done an admirable job today, as he always does, of defending the President and the President’s actions in Guantanamo Bay. Unfortunately, the President’s actions in Guantanamo Bay have not been quite as admirable. We have heard throughout the discussion today several catchphrases. We have heard that we wanted to discuss what was actually true. We wanted to discuss what the facts actually were. We talked about this incredible vetting process this administration had. We talked about the need to have a process and to have that process work before they took action. We have heard the phrase, We don’t want to turn the American justice system on its ears. And we have also heard that, We don’t want to hold up the process for a few months because that could be problematic. Mr. Speaker, let me try to take us back a little bit and put some facts around this whole debate as to why we got here in the first place. The reality of this situation is that this administration, before they ever took office, before the President ever raised his hand and took the oath, before any cabinet members were appointed, or before anybody had been placed in his administration, this President and this Vice President made a commitment to close Guantanamo Bay before they ever went down there and actually investigated and looked at what was there. The other situation is that when they made that promise, they had made no vetting process. They had no process in place. The other fact, Mr. Speaker, is that when this President raised that hand and took that oath, the former administration that my good friend, the ranking member, has talked about how terrible they were, they had a prosecutor and a team of prosecutors who were prosecuting some of the worst terrorists this country had ever seen. Most Americans don’t know the names of the people in Guantanamo Bay, but they know we had coconspirators in 9/ 11 who were sitting down there, and 
that former administration had a prosecutorial team who had gone through months after months after months with a stack of motions this high, and that prosecutor said to anyone who would go down there, including me and the former chairman of the committee, Ike Skelton, that he would have had guilty verdicts or guilty pleas by those coconspirators within 6 months. When this administration came in with their great vetting and their great process without talking to that prosecutor, without looking at that at all, he disbanded that entire prosecution, terminated that prosecutor, terminated that entire team. And, to this day, no one on that side of the aisle can even tell us when they are going to have convictions on those conspirators of the worst terrorists this country has ever seen. When I hear the President and the Vice President stand up and say, We haven’t given up on the promise to close Guantanamo Bay, I listen and I listen and I listen to deafness for the President or the Vice President to say, We haven’t given up on getting convictions of the worst terrorists in the United States. So when I look at Guantanamo Bay and I hear, We are not really going to close it, forget what the President is saying, forget what the Vice President is saying, they don’t really mean they want to close Guantanamo Bay. All they want to do is bring those terrorists to the United States. We have stood on this floor and fought that for 8 years, and here is the reason. Because let me ask which of you want those terrorists brought to your community with every single act of terrorism we are seeing now and the repercussions of that? Because the moment you put them in your community in any jail or any prison, it is not a matter of whether we can hold them there, but you have just put a target on every school, every business, every mall in that community. When you talk about justice and you talk about fairness, we just believe that is wrong. So when you talk about just giving a little more time to the President for a few months, doesn’t it make a little bit of sense that if this administration was given the time to come in and stop the prosecution of the worst terrorists the United States has ever seen, that maybe, just maybe we ought to have a temporary hold and let the next President, whoever that President might be, have a few months to determine before we release these terrorists whether or not they want to prosecute them and they really want to bring them to a conviction instead of just talking about it for 8 years? Let me close, Mr. Speaker, with this. Years ago, when I stood on this floor on one of the first motions we had, it was a motion to recommit for the defense authorization bill to stop this administration from bringing these detainees to the United States. My friend and chairman on the other side of the aisle, Ike Skelton, stood on the floor right where my good friend, Mr. SMITH, is sitting today, and Mr. Skelton said this: When it comes to terrorism, there shouldn’t be any light between the Republicans and the Democrats. And he supported that motion not to bring those terrorists to the United States. So, Mr. Speaker, today, after all of the rhetoric, it is a pretty simple deal, prosecute them if you want to prosecute them, but don’t fulfill some campaign promise of shutting down Guantanamo Bay and the impact that could have on these terrorists. And I would say, as my good friend, Ike Skelton, said today, there shouldn’t be any light between Republicans and Democrats when it comes to terrorists, but there certainly shouldn’t be any light in with any Member of this Congress when it comes to defending and protecting the United States from these terrorists who have one goal in mind, and that is to kill Americans. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this bill. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 863, the previous question is ordered on the bill, as amended. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the passage of the bill. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. FORBES. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered.

b1035 Mrs. DINGELL, Mr. BISHOP of Georgia, and Mr. AL GREEN of Texas changed their vote from ‘‘yea’’ to ‘‘nay.’’ So the bill was passed. The result of the vote was announced as above recorded. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. Stated for: Mr. HARDY. Mr. Speaker, on rollcall No. 520 I was present on the House Floor and used my voting card to register a ‘‘yes’’ vote on H.R. 5351, To prohibit the transfer of any individual detained at United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Due to a malfunction in the voting device, my ‘‘yes’’ vote was not recorded. Had I been present, I would have voted ‘‘yes.’’ 
LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCARTHY ), the majority leader, for giving us the schedule. (Mr. MCCARTHY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, on Monday, no votes are expected in the House. On Tuesday, the House will meet at noon for morning hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business. Votes will be postponed until 6:30. On Wednesday and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning hour and noon for legislative business. On Friday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business. Mr. Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next week, a complete list of which will be announced by close of business tomorrow. The House will also consider H.R. 3438, the REVIEW Act, sponsored by Representative TOMMARINO , which ensures that new agency rules that place $1 billion or more in costs on the economy will not take effect until after any litigation over the rule is resolved. Additionally, the House will consider H.R. 5719, the Empowering Employees through Stock Ownership Act, sponsored by Representative ERIKPAULSEN . This critical bill, which is part of the Innovation Initiative, gives startups the opportunity to attract the talent necessary to advance innovation and grow the economy. The House will also consider two important bills related to Iran. The first is H.R. 5461, the Iranian Leadership Asset Transparency Act, sponsored by Representative BRUCE POLIQUIN . It requires the Treasury Department to report on the total assets of senior Iranian and political and military leaders and make that information public on their Web site. The second, H.R. 5931, the Prohibiting Future Ransom Payments to Iran Act, sponsored by Representative ED ROYCE , will prohibit all cash payments, including deadofnight ransom payments, and ensure transparency in congressional review of any future settlements with Iran. Now, finally, Mr. Speaker, as we approach the end of September, Members are advised that additional items are possible, including legislation to fund the government. Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for his comments. Mr. Speaker, the legislation we will be considering next week, I am sure, has support in a number of quarters. The majority leader mentioned, in the last line, that we will be considering efforts to fund the government, the so called continuing resolution. Mr. Speaker, as the Speaker knows and the House knows, we have not passed any appropriation bills through the Congress and sent them to the President, nor have we adopted a budget. In the absence of both of those, certainly in the former, we need to have a funding of government passed by September 30th. I ask the majority leader, therefore, Mr. Speaker, if the majority leader has any knowledge of the status of the CR, either in this House moving forward or in the other body. I yield to the gentleman from California. Mr. MCCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Yes, we are continuing discussions on the appropriation process and how to ensure the government is funded after September 30th. As soon as it is finished, Members will be advised when floor action is scheduled. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the majority leader for that. Let me say that I would hope, given the fact that we have a maximum of eight or nine legislative days left before the end of the fiscal year, end of the September 30 fiscal year, that the CR hopefully will be a document on which we have consensus on all its parts. The majority leader, I am sure, Mr. Speaker, has heard the same kinds of rumors I have heard, which is not unusual, that the Senate may pass a CR and then decide their work, at least prior to the election, is done. If that is the case, or, in any event, whether it is the case or not, and we initiate a bill, it will be critically important that that bill be a bill that can be supported by both sides. So I look forward to working with the majority leader to ensure that when a CR is brought to the floor, either a Senate bill—which will be a House bill amended by the Senate, I presume—or a House bill, that we have agreement, Mr. Majority Leader, on the component parts of that continuing resolution so we do not put at risk the shutting down of the government of the United States. I don’t know whether the gentleman wants to respond at all. I yield to the gentleman from California. b1045 Mr. MCCARTHY. I look forward to working with the gentleman. Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman. In addition to the CR, which is necessary to fund government, we have a crisis in America, a health crisis. We spent a lot of time talking about it last time. We won’t spend a long time, but Zika continues to be a real challenge. We have continuing incidents. The moral and fiscal costs of not addressing this issue are of great magnitude, great seriousness. Can the gentleman tell me whether he believes that sufficient resources to respond to the Zika crisis will be included in the CR or whether it may be a freestanding bill that we could reach consensus on and send to the President? I yield to my friend. Mr. MCCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. The gentleman is correct that this is a crisis before us. The gentleman and I have worked on this issue when it first arose, putting individuals into committee and looking at what we needed to accomplish. This House actually acted and acted early. Your question is: Would it be combined with the continuing resolution? I believe that is what we would see, along with the continuing resolution to solve this challenge with Zika. Unfortunately, it has been stuck in the Senate. In the conversations I have been having with the other house, I am very hopeful that that will get done. Mr. HOYER. I thank the majority leader, Mr. Speaker. I would reiterate, Mr. Speaker, the observation that I made last week, that the Senate has, in fact, passed a Zika response with 68 votes. And if the Senate fails to move legislation, the majority leader—and I share his view— hopes it will be included in a continuing resolution. In the event that does not occur, I would urge the majority leader, Mr. Speaker, to consider putting a House bill in which reflects the Senate compromise supported by more than twothirds of the Senate and a bill which I represented to the majority leader last week—but I want to represent again—I can’t say unanimously 
but overwhelmingly, with well over 180 votes, in my view, we would support. I give that information, Mr. Speaker, to the majority leader so that he will know that in the event we have not responded in the CR that I believe the Senatepassed legislation incorporated into a House bill and brought to the floor can pass on suspension and may well even be able to pass on unanimous consent. I don’t know that that is the case, but it certainly could pass on suspension. I would urge him to consider that as an alternative available to us to respond so that we do not have the situation which we had in July of leaving town for 7 weeks without having addressed this crisis that confronts the health of our people. Mr. Speaker, let me indicate that we have a number of other pieces of legislation that I would last like to ask the majority leader about. There are rumors that our schedule is going to be over in the next few weeks. I don’t know. The Senate was planning on going presumably to the first week of October. I don’t know that they are going to do that. We are planning to go to the end of September. There are a number of other pieces of legislation which I think need to be addressed. We continue to be very concerned about our failure to respond to the Flint crisis. The mayor of Flint was in my office yesterday. They are still drinking bottled water because the water in their pipes that is being delivered to their homes is still unfit for human consumption unless a filter is in place and unless that filter is working efficiently and effectively. We really need to, I think, help on that. With respect to opioids, we passed a piece of legislation that was, Mr. Speaker, a bipartisan piece of legislation. We continue to believe, however, the resources to carry out the policies included in the authorizing bill need to be addressed. Lastly, Mr. Speaker—I mentioned this before—we continue to urge that in light of the scourge of gun violence in America that we take up two bills sponsored by the former chairman, Republican chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security. They are not Democratic bills, although Democrats support the bills and are cosponsors of the bill, but they are PETER KING’s bills to provide greater safety. First of all, Mr. Speaker, we have adopted the premise that background checks are a good thing. We require background checks. The problem is, we don’t require background checks in every instance of a transfer of a weapon from seller to buyer. The problem with that, of course, is if you want to buy a gun for a nefarious purpose, one would assume you are not going to go and have your background checked. You will find some other way to purchase that gun. We would hope that bill would be brought to the floor. The second bill that Mr. KINGhas, of course, seems to us to be a very reasonable piece of legislation, which simply says, if you are judged too dangerous to fly on our airplanes, you ought to be too dangerous as well to buy weapons to injure people in our country; we think you are too dangerous to go on an airplane and that you might injure people in that fashion. I would urge, Mr. Majority Leader, Mr. Speaker, before we leave before the election, two things, that we bring those to the floor and we carry out— and I want to repeat again because I think it is important. Speaker PAUL RYAN said on October 29, 2015, just a year ago: ‘‘We will not duck the tough issues; we will take them head on . . . we should not hide our disagreements. We should embrace them. We have nothing to fear from honest disagreements honestly stated.’’ Mr. Speaker, I share that view. I think the bills that I have mentioned— Flint, opioids, gun violence, and certainly Zika, and, yes, there are others—ought to be brought to this floor, and the House ought to work its will. I would hope that in the next few days that are available to us that the majority leader, Mr. Speaker, gives careful consideration to bringing those pieces of legislation to the floor. In the gun violence case, the polls reflect that over 85 percent—and in one case over 90 percent—of Americans support those pieces of legislation. They would pass, Mr. Speaker, overwhelmingly. The only reason they haven’t passed—the only reason they haven’t passed—contrary to the statement that we will not duck the tough issues, said by Speaker RYANjust about a year ago, the only reason they haven’t passed is because they have not been brought to the floor. I would urge, Mr. Speaker, the majority leader consider that. Mr. MCCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for his advice. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
ADJOURNMENT FROM THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 15, 2016, TO MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 19, 2016 Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 2 p.m. on Monday, September 19, 2016, and that the order of the House of January 5, 2016, regarding morning hour debate not apply on that day. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. 
REMEMBERING THE LATE HONORABLE MARK TAKAI The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Ms. GABBARD ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. 
Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Hawaii? There was no objection. Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, we are holding this Special Order today to honor our colleague and friend, Mark Takai. Many of our colleagues are here to share their own memories and remembrances of our friend. In Hawaii, the word ‘‘aloha’’ holds a very special place in our hearts. It is a word that we use every day to say hello and goodbye, but, in saying that word, we are actually conveying a much deeper meaning. In the deepest and truest sense of the word, aloha means I come to you with an open heart and offer you my deepest respect, love, and care. It is a word that describes a way of life. Living aloha brings people together regardless of their unique backgrounds or things like age, race, religion, or social class. This open heart, this spirit of aloha, is what I think of when I think of my colleague, my fellow soldier, and my friend, Mark Takai, because he carried this aloha spirit with him wherever he went. He shared it with everyone that he came into contact with. During a celebration of Mark’s life held in his hometown of Pearl City on Oahu just a few weeks ago—this is the community that he served for over 20 years as a State legislator—I heard from one of Mark’s high school teachers named Mike, who shared her amazement that not only was Mark a great student, not only was he an all American swimmer, but he would spend his free time doing things like organizing voter registration drives and getoutthevote parades in his neighborhood, encouraging his community to make sure that their voice was heard. As a student at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, Mark was a leader among his peers, one of whom is here today, our colleague, Congresswoman TAMMY DUCKWORTH . He served as president of the Associated Students of the University of Hawaii at Manoa, was a champion on the varsity team for 4 years, and was editor in chief of the campus newspaper, Ka Leo O Hawaii. I recently had an intern in my district office who is a part of ASUH, and he told me about how the University of Hawaii student government members today tell stories of the legends of Mark Takai’s courage and leadership as student president, taking on difficult issues like sexual harassment and assault, resulting in his being sued by the University of Hawaii professors union. But no matter the challenge, the difficulty, or the obstacle, the legends are true; Mark Takai never backed down. At age 27, he was elected to the Hawaii State House of Representatives, representing his hometown of Pearl 
City and neighboring Aiea from 1994 to 2014. In 2002, I was elected to the State House where I first got to know him, learning of his commitment and passion for the University of Hawaii, and his and Sami’s love for all things Disney, showing me the memorabilia they brought home from the Disney parks they visited around the world, and sharing copies of the cookbook he distributed throughout his Pearl City district, always making time, always ready with a helpful tip and a helping hand. In 2014, after a hardfought campaign, Mark came here and joined us in Congress, representing the First Congressional District of Hawaii. While here, he served on the Committee on Armed Services, as well as the Committee on Small Business, working hard always, putting first and foremost his constituents. Even after he was diagnosed and going through treatment, he was always there attending his committee hearings, doing things that no one really expected he would do. I was amazed, during our annual NDAA marathon markup session that often lasts over 16 straight hours, Mark was there in the wee hours of the morning passing out the Hawaiimade chocolate macadamia nuts to our colleagues. For 17 years, while simultaneously fulfilling his responsibilities as an elected official, Mark also served as a citizen soldier in the Hawaii Army National Guard, where he earned the rank of lieutenant colonel, deployed to Kuwait in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, and served as president of the Hawaii Army National Guard Association. Because Mark had a master’s degree in public health, he came into the National Guard as a direct commissioned officer. What this meant in practical terms was he didn’t have to go through basic combat training or OCS. b1100 When I came back to Hawaii from my basic training in South Carolina, I was assigned to our medical command, the same unit as Mark. He was a first lieutenant. I was a private first class. As I was rendering him a salute, he would joke around, asking me to teach him how to render a proper salute and how to march in a formation because he never got to learn those through basic training. Mark was incredibly proud to wear the uniform. He was deeply committed to the National Guard, extremely active with the National Guard Association both in Hawaii and here in Washington, always looking to find ways to support the institution and its service to our soldiers and airmen in Hawaii and across the country. I have heard from so many of Mark’s soldiers and peers in the Hawaii Guard who express disbelief that he is actually gone and how much they truly valued the time they spent with him and served with him. Mark’s service to Hawaii and our Nation spans nearly a quarter century. His legacy of aloha and his commitment to service touched the lives of so many people along the way. All of the stories and remembrances we will hear today I think capture the essence of Mark, his heart for service, his spirit of aloha, his love for God, his love for his family, and caring and sharing aloha with everyone. To our colleagues here today to share their memories of Mark, thank you for opening your hearts as we honor and remember and say aloha to our dear friend. To Mark’s staff, thank you for being strong, for serving Mark and our State of Hawaii, and continuing to serve the people of Hawaii through this difficult time. Finally, I would like to recognize Mark’s family, who have just arrived here in the gallery. I would like to recognize Mark’s wife, Sami; his children, Matthew and Kaila; his parents, Erik and Naomi; and his siblings, Nadine, Nikki, and Ross, all of whom have been incredibly generous in sharing their time and opening their family to all of us, to people across the State of Hawaii, and yesterday during the beautiful and historic service that was held in Mark’s honor. I want you to know that you were always with him wherever he went. He was always speaking about you proudly. You were the light of his life. Mahalo, Mark, for the lasting impact that you had on all of us, for sharing your aloha with us, and for dedicating your life to the service of others. I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. GRAHAM ). Ms. GRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for loaning me her lei and hosting this Special Order in honor of our colleague and friend, the late Congressman Mark Takai of Hawaii. I was fortunate to develop a very close friendship with Mark, as we were part of the same freshman class elected in 2014, and sat next to each other on the House Armed Services Committee. In the panhandle of Florida, the area I represent, we have an attitude toward life we call ‘‘The North Florida Way.’’ It means we care about public service, we take care of our neighbors, and we do what is right. And even though the panhandle is about 5,000 miles from Hawaii, The North Florida Way is a lot like the aloha spirit. As we have learned here today, Congressman Takai embodies the aloha spirit. As a public servant, he stands as a role model for all of us. He first ran for public office at 27 years old, and served 10 years in the Hawaii House of Representatives before coming to Congress. At the same time, he was also serving in the Hawaii National Guard, where, over 17 years, he earned the rank of lieutenant colonel and served in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Mark cared about his neighbors, representing the people of his State with distinction, and always cared about those around him, as a father, a husband, a friend, and a colleague. Sitting next to him in committee, he would always greet me with a smile and a warm aloha. He cared about doing what was right, especially for his fellow servicemembers in the military. As we remember Congressman Takai today, I hope we all continue to honor his memory and aloha spirit throughout the end of our own service. Let’s all honor him by practicing a little more of the aloha spirit every day. Let’s remember to represent our constituents, to care about each other, and to do what is right. That is what Mark always did, and that is what he would want us to do. Mark was a role model for us all, in and out of Congress. Our thoughts, prayers, and love are with his family. Ms. GABBARD. I yield to the gentlewoman from Guam (Ms. BORDALLO ). Ms. BORDALLO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor and celebrate the life of my good friend, Congressman Mark Takai of Hawaii. Mark was a fierce advocate for the people of Hawaii and was a champion of issues important to the AAPI community. Prior to his two decades as a representative in the Hawaii State House, Mark briefly lived in Guam, my home, and attended school there, which helped to inform his perspectives on the unique challenges affecting the territories. Here in Congress, Mark was an embodiment of the aloha spirit. I worked with him on a number of issues impacting Guam, Hawaii, and the Pacific region. As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, I truly appreciated his insights and views, especially his experiences as lieutenant colonel in the Hawaii Army National Guard. Mark’s passing creates a void in Congress that cannot be replaced, but his life and his legacy will forever live on in all of us who knew him and in the many public policies that he helped to enact to make life for all Americans better. On behalf of the people of Guam, I extend my condolences to his wife, Sami; his children, Matthew and Kaila; and the entire Takai family. Mark, you will be deeply missed. As we say in Guam: Un Dangkulo na Si Yu’os Ma’ase, Mark. Ms. GABBARD. I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. TEDLIEU). Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak about my friend, Mark Takai. We came in last year in the freshman class together. Through various orientation events, my wife, Betty, and our children had the honor of getting to know Mark’s family, Sami, Matthew, and Kaila. Having gone to his beautiful memorial ceremonies in Hawaii and here, we had the honor of meeting Mark’s extended family. The grace and dignity with which they have handled this has been tremendous. I want to talk a little bit about Mark. He was a joy to be around. He 
was warm, he was happy, he was energetic, and he exemplifies the best of America. Having served in our Armed Forces, serving the State legislature and here in Congress, he always tried his best to represent Americans and do what he thought was best. I know we all dearly miss Mark. I know that when he said he is going to be fine and is going to be in heaven, a smile comes to my face when I think about Mark looking down at all of us and how happy he would be to see us here today. We all miss him dearly. Ms. GABBARD. I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER ), our esteemed minority whip. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for taking this Special Order hour. We are all sad and lament the fact that an extraordinary human being was taken from us far too early. I tell my colleagues, this picture says it all: that wonderful, warm, accepting, engaging aloha smile that is represented in this picture of our colleague, Mark Takai. I join my colleagues in celebrating and remembering a life well lived. Though he only served alongside us in this House for a short time, he made a big impact on us all with his kindness, his sincerity, and his intellect. All of us admired the steadfastness with which he fought for his constituents and the courage with which he fought his illness. All of us saw Mark on this floor, determined to serve his constituents for as long as his health allowed him to do so. As was said yesterday, Mark did not greet us with any selfpity or any wringing of hands, but with a positive attitude to the end. I wasn’t with him at the very end, but my, how we were blessed to be with him for the short time that we had him. What an example he set for all of us to overcome adversity and welcome opportunities rather than focusing on that which he could not do. Not only was Mark an outstanding Member of Congress, he was, as has been said by his fellow officer, a warrior willing to serve, to risk, and to save this great country, its democracy, and its people. As a lieutenant colonel in the Hawaii Army National Guard, he deployed on Active Duty to Kuwait in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. He earned the Army’s Meritorious Service Medal for his achievements there. We all are standing here to speak of the meritorious service he gave right here. Yes, on the battlefield; yes, at the point of the spear; but right here as well. He drew on his experience in the Army as a veteran when he served as chairman of the House Committee on Veterans, Military, and International Affairs in the Hawaii legislature, and later as a member of the House Committee on Armed Services here in Congress. A proud native of Hawaii, Mark dedicated his life and career to the people of his beloved State. He was elected to the Hawaii House of Representatives at the age of 27. I can empathize with that because I was elected to the Maryland State Senate at the age of 27. We talked about that. Some have entered earlier, but that was pretty early. It gave us a great opportunity to serve. Mark believed strongly that every child deserves a chance to learn in a safe and nurturing environment. In my own State, there are 52 Judy Centers named after my late wife, who died almost 20 years ago, that serve 3and 4 yearold children. Mark had that same kind of compassion and concern and focus on making sure that young people received all that we could give them early in life so that they could succeed later in life, as Mark Takai did so extraordinarily. I have other words that I will submit for the RECORD because there are so many of my colleagues who want to speak about Mark and their relationship to him, their respect for him, their love for him, and his love for us. I thank Congresswoman GABBARD for taking this hour, and I thank her for being such an example. Both of you define aloha. God bless. Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues today in remembering the life of our friend, Representative Mark Takai, who lost his battle against cancer in July. Though he only served alongside us in this House for a short time, he made a big impact on us all with his kindness, his sincerity, and his intellect. All of us admired the steadfastness with which he fought for his constituents and the courage with which he fought his illness. Not only was Mark an outstanding member of Congress, he also served our nation in uniform. As a lieutenant colonel in the Hawaii Army National Guard, he deployed on active duty to Kuwait in support of operation Iraqi Freedom, and he earned the Army’s Meritorious Service Medal for his achievements there. He drew on his experiences in the Army and as a veteran when he served as chairman of the House Committee on Veterans, Military, and International Affairs in the Hawaii Legislature and later as a member of the House Committee on Armed Services here in Congress. A proud native of Hawaii, Mark dedicated his life and career to the people of his beloved state. Elected to the Hawaii House of Representatives at the age of twentyseven, he spent two decades working hard to improve lives, strengthen communities, and bring jobs and opportunity to Hawaii. He championed education and fought for better schools. Mark believed strongly that every child deserves a chance to learn in a safe and nurturing environment. He stood up for Hawaii’s veterans and worked to combat homelessness among those who were coming home from war. Concerned about the dangers of climate change and rising sea levels, Mark did more than just support green energy through tax credits; he outfitted his own house with solar panels and drove an electric vehicle to show others how easy it is to live sustainably. When Mark ran for Congress in 2014 and won, all of us believed he would be making a difference here in Washington for many, many years ahead. He was one of those who loved being a legislator, who had the experience and talent to get things done in Congress. All of us are deeply saddened that our country lost Mark at such a young age, with surely many great achievements ahead. Losing a colleague is always difficult, but with Mark Takai it was more than that—we lost someone who had quickly become our friend, someone as warm as he was dependable, as jovial as he was wise. My thoughts continue to be with Mark’s wife Sami and their two children, Matthew and Kaila. My heart goes out to them and to the people of Hawaii’s first District he served so ably. I also offer my condolences again to Senators SCHATZ and H IRONO and Representative TULSI GABBARD , Mark’s colleagues in the Hawaii Congressional delegation, who worked closely with him every day. We will miss him dearly in the halls of Congress, and I thank Representative GABBARD  for leading the effort to pay tribute to him in the United States House of Representatives today. b1115 Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. TAKANO ). Mr. TAKANO. Mahalo to my colleague from Hawaii, Congresswoman GABBARD , for the time. Mr. Speaker, on July 20, the world lost a kind man, this Congress lost a great leader, and many of us here lost a very dear friend. I didn’t expect to have this welling of emotion. Mark Takai represented everything America wants in a public servant. He was selfless, he was humble, and he was passionate about strengthening his community and protecting his country. He served 17 years in the Hawaii National Guard, including a deployment to Kuwait in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. When he came home, he fought for the middle class and for the people of Hawaii. He will be remembered by me and many of us here for his incredible spirit, which he bravely maintained through his illness. He will be remembered for his easy laugh, which brought joy to all those who knew him. And he spent a lifetime working to give a voice to those who struggled to be heard. If I may depart from my prepared remarks for a moment, I remember going to Hawaii for his unofficial swearingin in Honolulu with Leader PELOSI , and just seeing the outpouring of support from the people who elected him and the great hope in such a new young leader from the State of Hawaii, which has been going through great changes. Getting to know him here and watching him, the losses that I feel are just that he was so full of potential. He loved Congress. He loved serving. He loved the potential to change this institution into a better place. He 
reached out to Republicans, not a mean bone in his body. I hesitate to say this last part because I can’t say the name of the restaurant that we both went to in Southeast, in that part of town, but it serves doublefried Korean chicken wings, and he thanked me very much that we could share it. He loved food. I feel very lucky to have called him a friend. I will miss him very much. Thank you. Mahalo to you, Mark Takai, for having been my friend. Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. AGUILAR ). Mr. AGUILAR. Mahalo, Ms. GABBARD . I appreciate the gentlewoman from Hawaii yielding to me to talk about my colleague and my friend Mark Takai. As I stand here in aloha attire, I am sure my colleague would admire my dress, yet shake his head at my tie. We do love our rules here in Congress, but even the Speaker acknowledged yesterday that Mark continually talked with him about the need to embrace the aloha spirit and to maybe, just maybe, relax our rules occasionally. Like many in our class, I met Mark during freshman orientation in December of 2014, when we were both elected. Instantly, all of us gravitated to him. He was easy to love. As I reflect on the impact that he had on me, I am struck by four key things that you will continue to hear my colleagues share in their stories. First was his pleasant attitude, demeanor, smile, and his fullhearted laugh. He had a deep concern for his colleagues, even as he battled his illness. I can’t tell you the number of times he would sit right up here and we would talk about the bills and the issues of the day, and I would try to say something to make him laugh, and he would give that big smile and that fullthroated laugh. He took a lot of pride in that. I am not sure there is anyone in this Chamber who didn’t enjoy spending time with Mark. He was just that special. Second was his pride in Hawaii and of his service in the military. Mark’s eyes never got bigger than when I told him that my wife, Alisha, and I were going to attend the 70th anniversary ceremony in Hawaii aboard the USS Missouri, with a bipartisan delegation led by Mr. FORBES . He was so happy that I would get an opportunity to meet Admiral Harris, but also to see Oahu and to enjoy its beauty. He was the best mayor Oahu never had is the reality of the situation. Whether it was restaurants, beaches, hiking trails, military installations, he always had a suggestion of something you should see and do. We have to go—again, we can’t say the restaurant names. You have to go to ‘‘blank,’’ and he would tell you the restaurant’s name that started with a Z and he said was the President’s favorite. And that turned into: Let’s go there right now. And so Sami and Alisha and I, we went to this restaurant that is unique to Hawaii that Mark said was the President’s favorite. When you walked in with Mark, you were bound to be recognized because he knew everybody; and you were going to eat whatever he said, as well. Third was how driven and competitive he was. Don’t take that smile and that laugh to mean that he was a pushover. He was absolutely driven to represent his region and to do his job effectively. He would quiz me on the politics of my district, asking me questions about my race and giving me advice. He would talk about his own race and races in the past, and it was clear that he wasn’t a pushover when it came to politics and fighting for his communities. But he always had a plan, and that wasn’t ever more evident than when he stayed on the floor just about the entire day, State of the Union Day 2015, to get a prime seat for the State of the Union. I still have the photo—I looked at it last night—of him directly behind Leader PELOSI . She was next to Whip HOYER , and he is beside J OHN LEWIS. Mark was a freshman, sitting right there within camerashot, wearing his lei, and he wanted everyone back home to know he had arrived. It was brilliant. The last point was about his family. He truly loved his family and his faith. As fathers spending a significant amount of time away from our two kids, we talked about them often, how proud we were of them, how much we missed them, and how we used technology to try to fill the void in communication. Attending weekend sporting events for swimming and soccer for Matthew and Kaila, even if it meant traveling and being home for only 30 hours, he wanted to do it. He wanted to be there. He wanted to be present. Your dad loved you so, so much, and he talked about you so, so often. Sami, I don’t know how you do it. But he would comment on that. He would look at me, and we would be huddled in the back back there, and he would say: We wouldn’t be able to do anything without our wives. And I said: Yeah, of course. We know that. He says: No, no, no. I mean you should know that. You should send a text message or something to Alisha right now. We spent a relatively short amount of time with him here in Washington, D.C., but he touched our lives and was a source of strength and humor. I will always remember his spirit, his faith, and his commitment to his community. Aloha, friend. Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. PELOSI ), our leader. Ms. PELOSI. What a beautiful picture of Mark. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman GABBARD for bringing us together in this Special Order to salute a very special person, our colleague, Mark Takai. It is a solemn privilege for all of us today to give voice to the sorrow of the U.S. Congress at the passing of our colleague and dear friend. We have lost someone truly special, a person who held the respect and friendship of colleagues on both sides of the aisle, on both sides of the Capitol, up and down Pennsylvania Avenue. In fact, the President himself paid tribute to Mark when he died. He said: ‘‘Michelle and I were saddened to learn of the passing of Representative Mark Takai. ‘‘Mark was always a fighter,’’ the President said. ‘‘It’s the spirit he brought to more than two decades of public service on behalf of the people of Hawaii. ‘‘He stood up for America’s most vulnerable. He championed our troops and veterans, and proudly wore our Nation’s uniform. And his relentless push for cancer research inspired countless Americans fighting the same battle as him. ‘‘Simply put, our country is better off,’’ the President said, ‘‘our country is better off because of Mark’s contributions. He leaves a legacy of courage, of service, and of hope.’’ Michelle and he said: ‘‘Our thoughts and prayers are with Mark’s wife, Sami, their two children, and many friends and family.’’ Many of the friends and family are here today: Sami, of course; Matthew and Kaila; his parents, Mark’s parents, Erik and Naomi; his sister, Nadine; her husband, Ronnie, and daughter Nelani; his sister, Nikki; his brother, Ross; his fatherinlaw, Gary Kai; and all of the people of Hawaii who may be watching this, certainly all of our colleagues. He was effective from the start, I think, because he was such an experienced legislator, 20 years in the Hawaii Legislature, and that made him, with his energy and as our colleague, Mr. AGUILAR said, his competitiveness. Who but a competitive soul, and an imaginative one, would be bringing leis—I guess it is lei, singular is plural—to Selma to match what happened in the sixties, when Martin Luther King and our colleague JOHN LEWIS wore leis in the march. And who but he would, only a few weeks in Congress, decide that all these hundreds of lei would be sent from Hawaii for people to wear on the 50th anniversary of Selma. As I said yesterday in Statuary Hall, many of the Members were thinking, ‘‘Why didn’t I think of that?’’ but that is how Mark was. I don’t want to say competitive, but nonetheless. As far as his seating here, Mr. AGUILAR , I was privileged to appoint him as a part of the escort committee. Because of the President’s origins in Hawaii, I wanted Hawaii to be represented on the escort committee; but as you said, he exploited the opportunity, and we were glad that he did. I really wish that he were here, but I wish that everyone could have seen him on our codel to Asia. Congresswoman MATSUI did, and others. We were in Burma, Cambodia, Korea, 
Japan, Vietnam. We began in California, came to Hawaii to be briefed at the Pacific Command, to go on to Asia and then come back through Alaska. Now, here he was, a relatively new Member of Congress. This was like April of last year. He was in Congress maybe 3, 4 months, but he was on the Armed Services Committee, so he spoke with great authority because this was a security trip as well as a values, human rights trip and our economic interests trip. So I said to him—getting back to Mr. AGUILAR —I said to him: We are going to begin in California with some briefings, and then we will go to Hawaii, and then you will preside as we meet with the Pacific Command. So would you like to join us in California? He said: Would I like to join you in California? I could be home with Sami. I could have a night with Sami or I could be with all of you in California. I will meet you in Hawaii. It was very clear that any chance he got he wanted to be with his family. Certainly he, again, was part of the delegation. Only a few months in Congress, with such dignity, we forgot that he was a new Member of Congress. With great knowledge of our national security, with great diplomacy in how he conveyed his thoughts, and every place he went, he was beautifully received. I wish all of you could have seen how, especially in Japan, where they took special interest to embrace him as a Japanese American Member of Congress. b1130 Everything he did, he did with excellence. He died as he had lived: loved and surrounded by family and friends, with great dignity and great courage. He used his time well—used his time well—and, again, understood what the opportunity of serving in Congress was, and he made an honorable contribution. His service here brought luster to the Congress. It is a privilege to call him colleague for all of us, and an even bigger privilege to call him friend. In the Hawaiian way of family, he has bound us together. We are all family. I hope that the Takai family knows that they have family always in the Congress of the United States. Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from American Samoa (Mrs. RADEWAGEN ). Mrs. RADEWAGEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of a truly good and humble man. In the time I had the pleasure of knowing Mark, I was able to call him not only a colleague, but also, proudly, a friend. Mark and I came to Congress in the same class almost 2 short years ago. Upon meeting Mark, I instantly knew that I had a new colleague that I could talk openly to, and I knew that he would always listen with an open mind. We also shared a mutual love and desire to serve our constituents who also have so much in common, including a shared heritage. Mark’s heart was that of a public servant. Always willing to do whatever it took to best serve the people of Hawaii, Mark set an example for us all on how to put our communities above ourselves and serve for the betterment of everyone. This includes his service in the United States Army National Guard, during which time he served as a medical officer in Operation Iraqi Freedom. I want to express my deepest condolences to Mark’s wife, Sami, his two children, Matthew and Kaila, and wish for them comfort during this difficult time. I know that they can take solace in the fact that Mark was a great man who will always be respected and revered not for what he did for himself, but what he did for others. I am grateful for the opportunity to talk about my friend, Mark. He will be dearly missed. I thank Representative GABBARD . God bless Mark, his family, and the United States. Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. BRENDAN F. B OYLE ). Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Ms. GABBARD , for her very eloquent words yesterday. All the speakers did a remarkable job in a ceremony that was sad and poignant that really captured the spirit of who Mark was. In the Hawaiian Islands, there is a word for family. Forgive my pronunciation—being from Pennsylvania—if I botch this, but I believe it is pronounced ohana. Ask anyone who lived or grew up there and they will tell you it is more than a word. It refers to not only your immediate family, but to extended family and beyond, even to strangers that you may not know. It is a very unique and strong bond amongst the Hawaiian people who live there. I experienced that ohana firsthand when I met Mark and his family during our congressional orientation. Sami and my wife, Jenny, immediately bonded, as did Mark and I, and the way Matthew and Kaila played with our daughter, Abby. I have many memories of that orientation and I actually was looking at a number of the pictures last night reflecting on Mark, reflecting on the ceremony yesterday, and preparing for today. As Leader PELOSI pointed out, this picture of Mark really captures his warmth, his spirit, and the way he approached life. It inspires me, and I think all of us, to approach each and every day with a smile on our face no matter the difficulties of the moment or the seeming difficulties that in the larger scheme of things might not quite be as difficult or as important as we take them to be. In this political crucible that we call Congress, Mark brought his personal sense of ohana to our body politic: his sense of understanding and willingness to find compromise where there often seemed to be none, his sense of seeing you as a friend with differences to work out and not as an adversary or an enemy, and his commitment to making sure we all found the common ground that so often eludes us. He was here a brief period of time, but he left his mark. Any of us may serve 2 years or 20 years or beyond. I don’t think each of us, though, will be able to say that we have actually left our mark. I hope we will be able to. It can be said about Mark Takai in his short period here that he touched every single person who knew him. I love you, Mark, and I miss you. I love his beautiful family. Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. LOWENTHAL ). Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman GABBARD for giving us this opportunity to say a few words about somebody whom we cared about and respected so much and who brought so much joy and positivity to this Congress. To his family—to Sami, to Matthew, and to Kaila, thank you for sharing him with us. It meant a lot to us. The Hawaiian word ‘‘pono’’ means righteousness. It is the idea that moral character leads to happiness. It means doing what is morally right and selfless. It is the word that so captures my feelings about Mark Takai, and that is what we see here in this picture. Too often our society takes the notion of public service for granted. Mark was the embodiment of the idea of public service, an idea that he was so proud to take part in—first, in the military and, at the same time, also continuing on in government. As I mentioned before in this House, Mark was a force of positivity. He was a leader who did not lead by force of will, but he led by being humble. He listened, he was effective at what he did, and he always brought us great warmth. He was the embodiment of bravery first in his service to his Nation—our Nation—and then in his battle against cancer. His passing is a great loss to his family, to Hawaii, for this Chamber, and our Nation. Mr. Speaker, we have truly lost one of the good guys. Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. BEYER ). Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman GABBARD for scheduling this Special Order. Mr. Speaker, Mark was a special presence in the freshman class of the 114th Congress. He brought his Hawaiian cheer to every room he entered, and I got to enjoy this perhaps more than most because he was my fourth floor Cannon hallmate. Early on, Mark decided that as hallmates, our staffs should get together and break bread. A Hawaiian pizza party was born, and Mark burst in with a hearty aloha and bearing 
gifts of chocolatecovered Macadamia nuts and Hawaiian coffee. He regaled the staff with a few good stories, and it always seems that he led with his island shirt, a lei, and an enormous smile wherever he went. Our hearts are with Sami and the children. Mark will be sorely missed. After Mark was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, he was resolute, brave, and determined to do all possible to battle a very difficult disease. But months later, when it was clear that Mark was dying, he seemed different to me. He grieved for his children, for Sami, for his myriad friends, and perhaps especially for all that he wanted to accomplish here in the people’s House. We never know when our time will come, and Mark’s life and death teaches us that we must make the most of each and every day. Mark Takai was a superlative role model and a beloved friend. God bless you, Mark, and all your generations to come. Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. DUCKWORTH ). Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman. Twentyeight years—1988—that is how long I have known Mark. As long as I have known him, he always was the champion for the most vulnerable. We met at the University of Hawaii. He was the serious one—if you can imagine that—and focused. At the Ka Leo O Hawaii student newspaper where he was editor, he investigated sexual harassment at a time when victims were routinely blamed and disbelieved. Perhaps that is not too hard to believe because even today that is happening, but almost 30 years ago, he stood up for the victims. We were there watching him as he stood up and was sued by the very same union that later on became some of his biggest supporters for his stance on education. In fact, he brought millions back to Hawaii for education—work that took not months or years, but sometimes a decade of steady work. He was worried about the education of our military children who must follow their servicemember parents from base to base. He wanted to make sure that they got good, continuous education and did not lose out because their parents were serving our Nation. Mark had so many aspects to him. Some of it was funny, some of it was annoying, and some of it was so unique to him. But it was all part of what a great person—a great human being—he was. I remember the months of emails and conversations we would have long distance—I was in Illinois and he was in Hawaii—when he was about to get his first Nissan LEAF. He was so proud he would get the very first one on the islands, and then his annoyance when the commanding general of the Hawaii National Guard got the first one and he got the second. I told him he was being ridiculous, that it didn’t matter, and that what he was doing was going to be good for the environment and the world regardless. I had no idea that I was opening the door for years and years of conversations with Mark where he would detail exactly how much wattage he had sold back to Hawaii Electric from the solar panels on his roof or how long he had been able to go without having to recharge his electric vehicle. He was there when my husband convinced me that we should ourselves buy an electric vehicle and the conversations the two of them would have about how important it was. It tried even this progressive Democrat’s patience. But he was always also there for others. I think one of the greatest skills that Mark had was to get others to join him in his cause, whatever that was; to get others to come and help share the load, whatever the load needed to be. Every time I went to Hawaii, whether it was on a family vacation or just to visit my mom who, by the way, lived in Pearl City, his Hawaii district, he would say: ‘‘Tammy, I need you to do this. I need you to go to this middle school and talk to these kids. Tammy, I need you to come do this. I need you to go to the University of Hawaii. I want you to go to the memorial. We need to talk and be there for the family of this fallen servicemember. Do you remember your friend from the Hawaii Guard?’’ It was always: ‘‘Tammy, we have got something to do.’’ b1145 And do you know what? He made it so much fun that you always did anyway. You went, and you were better for it, Hawaii was better for it, and the constituency got the service of a man who was never, ever on vacation, who never stopped. One of the things that I think you have heard from other folks here was just the pure joy of living that Mark had—all the meals that we would eat. He would show up, and you might just want to go get a sandwich someplace, but you were always off for an adventure for a new restaurant or a better place to eat. It was actually at one of those unforgettable meals when he mentioned to me that he was interested in running for Congress. The minute he said it, I knew that I was on board because he was perfect for this House. He was perfect to be here to work on behalf of not just the people of Hawaii but for the people of the United States. He was audacious but gentle. He was crusading and firm. I couldn’t think of anyone who belonged here more. He had planned to serve for years, decades, gaining seniority to serve Hawaii. I miss him every day. He would sit in that seat over there next to me in my wheelchair. I don’t sit there now. I stopped when he could no longer be here. It was too much to try to sit next to the empty seat where Mark would sit. I would only go back when he was back here to vote. Before his illness, we had planned to reserve adjacent military morale welfare recreation cabins at Barking Sands missile range for a joint family vacation. As he took a turn for the worse, he actually came up to me on this floor and said he was sorry, he was sorry that he couldn’t keep our date with our families. The man was dying, and he was apologizing to me. That was Mark. Even as he was fighting for his life, as he was working to secure the future for his two beloved children and the love of his life, he was concerned for others. He sat through the entire NDAA until 3:00 in the morning. When we were exhausted and tired and didn’t think we could make it, there was Mark, fighting cancer, a big smile on his face, flashing a shaka to everyone. I will treasure always one of our final trips together to Israel where we visited an Iron Dome battery together. Even as he was fighting for his life, he was concerned and working to ensure that the security of our Nation and our ally Israel was secure. I am so glad he made it here and that he served. I am so glad that he made such a big difference in so many lives here. But that was Mark. From the time he was a young man to the day that he left us, he was about service to others. Thank you very much—mahalo nui loa—Mark, for being my friend, for showing me how to be a better person, and for showing me a better way to serve. I miss you. I will never forget you. Until we meet again—a hui kaua. Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. TORRES ). Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman GABBARD . Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and the legacy of my colleague, Mark Takai. I first met Mark when we were elected together. We were freshmen, and we were going through orientation. All of us were competing for staff office space and competing on who could get to class the quickest and who could find their way from point A to point B the quickest. We had a lot of fun together, and we got to know each other through those brief few days. After we returned to Washington, we were sworn in as Members of Congress. I have a clear memory of how deeply Mark cared about his home State and his family. Congress is a tough place, and Mark was even tougher. Mark and I were competing for a subcommittee assignment on the Natural Resources Committee. He and I both wanted to serve on the Natural Resources Committee Subcommittee on Indian, Insular and Alaska Native Affairs that oversaw the territories’ natural resources of Hawaii and Alaska native affairs. I got the spot, and Mark came marching into my office with chocolate in his hand. He didn’t make an appointment, by the way, and he had no staff with him. We were going to have a conversation, more of a spar over this 
committee assignment. And over chocolate, Mark made me promise that his beautiful home State of Hawaii would always be my priority, and I did. Mark created so many opportunities for us to visit and get to know his home State, the beauty that it offers with its natural resources. He actually created a long list of people that I should meet in order to fully understand the needs of the island. I am sorry, Mark, that I didn’t get to join you in Hawaii, but thank you for the opportunity to know you. Sami, thank you for sharing such a wonderful man with not only the freshmen class, but with the entire membership of Congress and the Senate. We love Mark, we love you, and your family, and we are here for you. Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. MENG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with great sadness to honor a colleague and a friend, Congressman Mark Takai. Even though I only had two short years to work with Mark, that’s all I needed to gain a sense of his overwhelming passion for public service. He served Hawaii as a state representative for 20 years, and defended our freedoms as a Lieutenant Colonel in the Hawaii Army National Guard. Mark honorably represented his constituents in the House of Representatives, and was a model to those who put service to others before themselves. He always talked about his wife Sami, and kids, Matthew and Kaila. He beamed with excitement when they were coming to visit or when he was going back home. Mark was very humble—when he was curious about something he didn’t hesitate to ask questions. He was a fierce advocate for Hawaii, small businesses, and veterans, and was always thinking of ways to help. We are all better for having known him, and he will be missed. Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and remember a friend and dear colleague who was taken from us far too soon. Congressman Mark Takai was a true statesman, public servant and an inspiration to each and every person who had the honor of knowing him. All of us in this Chamber are heartbroken by this loss. Throughout his life—as a National Guardsmen, a leader in the Hawaii state legislature, and as a Member of Congress, Mark epitomized what it means to serve. He fought tenaciously to better the lives of his constituents, and showed courage and strength in the face of adversity. Mark loved his family—his wife Sami and his children Matthew and Kaila. He wanted to make this country better for them and for everyone who calls it home. Mark was an example of what Congress should be, and his legacy will live on through his vision and unyielding commitment to bettering the lives of others. My sincerest thoughts and prayers continue to be with Mark’s family. I can only imagine the sense of loss they feel, because I lost a friend and there is a hole in my heart. We thank them for sharing Mark with us. May they find comfort in knowing that his impact on the American people and the people of Hawaii is indelible and will not be forgotten. REMEMBERING THE LATE HONORABLE MARK TAKAI The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. HONDA ) for 30 minutes. Mr. HONDA. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. MATSUI ). Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. GABBARD for bringing us together here this afternoon. I have to say that this is a special time here for all of us. I was sitting here listening to all of the wonderful memories of Mark. We are so privileged to have known Mark. May I just say this: I have been in and around Congress a long time, and this is so highly unusual for an individual, any individual, who has been here to have this kind of response. Mark was special. Amongst our sadness that we feel here, we can’t help but smile when we think about him. That is what he did for us all the time. I didn’t know Mark very long at all, but I feel like I have known Mark forever. He has been a joy to all of us. He is somebody that has come into our lives and grabbed our hearts in such a meaningful way. And he came to Congress with a purpose. He said: Oh, he is merely a freshman. Mark Takai was never merely a freshman. He came with his commitment and his duty and his love of country wanting to do the best thing. His impact was immediate. He had already been in the legislature and served in the Army National Guard. He had experience. He understood what it meant to be American and to do the right thing. He also understood what it meant to be a loving father, a husband, a son, and a wonderful sibling. He was the complete person. We don’t meet many of those people in our lives. And when we do, we remember, we will always remember. He demonstrated a selfless dedication to public service, to all of us, from a young age, by being a State representative for two decades, and through his service to our country in the Army National Guard and in Congress for such a short time. My memories of him are just so joyful because I watched his commitment. I went on that trip with Leader PELOSI  last April, and he was so privileged to be a part of that group. As the Leader said, we started out in San Francisco and then we went to Hawaii. We met many service people, and we were meeting the military with security aspects in mind. Leader PELOSI said to Mark: Mark, you are our expert here, you have served, and you understand. And Mark said: Oh, yes, ma’am. Then he turned to me after a while and said: DORIS, I am just a freshman. I said: You are not a freshman; you know what is going on; and you can stand up to the generals and everyone else because you understand. And do you know what? He was our expert, and we were so proud of him throughout that whole trip. That is what I remember so much about him. He took responsibility, but he also understood the human side. Because on that trip, as we went through our official duties, there would be Mark always with a smile and a laugh and always trying to find a better place to eat, a place he had heard about from someone he met on the street, some person who said: You have got to try this little restaurant. So sometimes after our official dinners, he would say: Do you want to go to this little restaurant that I just found? We would say: No, we don’t want to do that. But do you know what? He was a Pied Piper. He was a Pied Piper, and we wanted to be with him. We are going to miss him so much. He was a complete person. We love him. We are going to miss him. Let me just say this: Sami, Matthew, Kaila, the family, we will never forget him. He touched us in a way that few people have. We love him, and we will miss him. We love you, and we will always remember him. b1200 Mr. HONDA. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. LOFGREN ). Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, so much has been said about Mark today, I can’t repeat it all. But as I have been looking at this picture, I just find it hard to accept that he is gone. You know, we meet each other here in the House. There are 435 people. We don’t know each person who is here. We tend to meet each other best when we serve on committees. I actually first met Mark on the airplane, of course, because each Member of the California delegation flies home to California every week. It is to be forgiven if Members from Hawaii or Samoa don’t go every week because, by the time you get there, it is time to come back to Washington, but Mark went home every week. And I would get on that plane, and there he would be, because he was so devoted not only to his constituents, but to his wife and to his children. He needed to be with them every week. Much has been said about this trip to Asia. I was on that trip. And on these congressional delegations, spouses are invited to come to keep company with the Members. My husband was not able to come, and Mark’s wife was not able to come either, so we sat next to each other for that entire trip. I heard all about his wonderful wife and his wonderful children throughout that trip in Asia. I have such precise memories of Mark, as DORIS MATSUI has said. He was a freshman Member but someone who was on the Armed Services Committee, who had served in Iraq, who was Active Duty Hawaii National 
Guard, and who spoke with such clarity and poise not only with our American military, but, as we met with foreign leaders, was able to hold his own. I have vivid memories of us meeting with the communists in Vietnam and facing off with those communist leaders to advocate for human rights. Mark did that for freedom. He believed in freedom. He believed in this country. He loved his family. He loved this institution. We will miss him greatly. But I actually think, in a way that is very profound, his short time here has changed this institution for the better. We thank Mark for that, and we thank his family for letting him serve here with us. Mr. HONDA. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the Northern Mariana Islands (Mr. SABLAN ). Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman HONDA for yielding. It is a great sadness to lose a neighbor, and Mark Takai was my neighbor. He was a man of the Pacific, an islander. And though our islands are thousands of miles apart, for the people of the Pacific, distance does not separate. Distance and the knowledge that we have the stamina, the ability to read sea and sky and the courage to trust in our own capacity—distance connects us. Distance makes us neighbors. Mark Takai was my neighbor. As islanders, our foothold is trimmed by the vast sea, but our vision sweeps beyond the horizon. Look at the legislation Mark Takai brought out in his brief time here. We can see the islander’s breadth of vision reflected in his concerns: veterans, students, smallbusiness people, homeowners. Mark Takai took them all to heart, wanted to help them all. As an islander, he cared too. He cared a lot about the natural environment. We who have so little land cherish it all the more. We take seriously our responsibility to steward the land, to pass it on to the next generation whole and thriving. We honor the deep wisdom that the land is inseparable; my land and yours are one. We know the union of neighbors. Mark Takai was my neighbor. Here in Congress as well, Mark’s office stands across the hall from mine in Cannon. We could have opened both our doors and, seated at our desks, seen each other at work. We would pass in the hall, share a word, feel the connection of our shared experience. We both traveled a very long way from very different cultures to be here. In that, we were neighbors. Now his door is closed. Now his lights are dimmed. Farewell, Mark. Farewell, neighbor. Our Lord decides our time—I Saina Man Des Popone. Mr. HONDA. Mr. Speaker, I was going to start out by saying that I rise today in mourning, but I don’t think it is about mourning. It is about celebrating Mark’s life. We have heard all about Mark’s character, his person, his presence in this Hall; and I think it is important for not only the family to hear this, but for Matthew and Kaila to hear it, too. For their short lives, they must have shared their dad intermittently. And while he was here, I used to ask him: Did you call home? Did you call your kids? Well, he always said yes, so I stopped asking him because I knew that that was part of the way he lived his life here. It is fitting that we talk about Mark here in the dome, the Capitol, because I think there are three places that Mark did his work. He did his work in church, under this dome, and his home, and he did it well. He did it according to, I think, the way his parents had raised him, both Erik and Naomi. I could tell because, when he used my car, he returned it better than I gave it to him: clean and with the tank full. I didn’t know he was so much into sustainable energy, so I hope it didn’t offend him if he drove the hybrid. But I certainly feel good every time I sit in the car right now, because I know he was there with Sami, his family, whenever he went to church or took the drive to Baltimore for treatment. I always told him that my prayers are with him because I believe in the power of prayer. But I suppose that there is a greater power, and that is the will of his Savior. I think he is with him right now. I tried to think of a way to describe Mark here in front of his family and his two youngsters, but I guess because church is such an important aspect of his life—I know that because he and Sami would go to church a lot, consistently, faithfully, to the First Presbyterian Church of Honolulu at Ko’olau and here in Virginia. So that told me that, between his upbringing and his faith, that everything that people talk about was a pure reflection of his upbringing and the kind of person he was. To Naomi and Erik, you have done good, and I know that he had followed your teachings, because when you were staying over, you left behind a lot of kakimochi, Hawaiian coffee. And I have to tell you, for the record, I never shared it because it was so meaningful and delightful to have eaten that stuff by myself, but I also know that that is part of aloha, that is part of being ohana. So those things I have learned from Mark. I am older than he is, but I still learned that, as a son, as a husband, as a father, as a brother, as an uncle, that how we live is the demonstration of a person’s life. I think that someone said earlier: What would Mark do? What would Mark say? I suspect that Mark, when he would wonder what he had to do, he would probably say: What would Jesus do? And I think that that would be probably an accurate statement. Mark lived his life well, and he lived his life in such a way that it is something that I wanted to be able to copy, because I always look for something that makes me a better person. He was gentle, Christlike, thoughtful, kashikoi, and at peace with himself. And I think that sense of peace is the strength that we saw every day here. The day that he came back from the hospital, he was here on the floor, and the first thing he said to me, as he said to TAMMY : How are you? He asked me how I was. He demonstrated to me that the way you are, the way you speak, the way you behave is another way of ministering to others of who you are and what you believe in. When he came down here with his friend Scott Nishimoto, they did borrow my car to visit another friend who was recuperating at the hospital from her battle wounds, TAMMY DUCKWORTH . So even though it was a short time that I had been able to know Mark, your dad, he was a wonderful example of someone that I would hope and imagine that you would be able to keep in mind and try to emulate also. There is nothing greater than children who would want to be like their parents, and I think that this is something that you might want to consider. Every day when I was a kid, my dad used to say: When you leave this house, be a mirror. I said: Be a mirror? He said: Yes, be a good reflection of who you are and where you come from so that you will always bring pride to our family. So, Matthew, Kaila, you shared your dad with us, and I hope that you get the sense that the idea of immortality is what my dad used to say: Immortality is sharing a bit of yourself with somebody else. They take that which was shared and pass it on to others, and that is an earthly immortality. But right now, he is with his own Savior, and he is waiting. And I think that our faith will sustain us and give us strength to move on and live life as he has taught us and has taught you. To the family, thank you for allowing me to be briefly part of your ohana and your friend. I will sign off from this floor to both you, Matthew and Kaila, as Uncle Mike. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. SPEIER ). b1215 Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from our beautiful State of Hawaii (Ms. GABBARD ) for giving us the opportunity to reflect on an extraordinary man. To the family, let me say, as I was sitting here and contemplating the pain and anguish and loss that you feel, I also was reflecting on the fact that many people leave this Chamber after they have served their time. They may be remembered by a moment of silence, maybe not. As painful as it is to have lost Mark and in the way that you have lost him, I hope there is some solace, some balm that will soothe you in knowing how extraordinary it is to have a person like Mark, who has served in this 
House, be so loved to the point that we would have a special ceremony in Statuary Hall and we would spend an hour reflecting on his life. It is a great reflection on his family. It is a great reflection on our country that we have so recognized such an outstanding leader. When I think of Mark, I think of a number of words to describe him. I think of grace. I think of stoic courage. I think of integrity. Now, many people have spoken about the grace with which he handled this horrific disease and the stoic courage he showed. I am going to spend a few minutes just talking about integrity. I have been working on an issue for some time here in Congress on the incidence of military sexual trauma and the fact that there is so much of it that goes on that goes unaddressed. Each year, I have brought an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act to try and take these cases out of the chain of command. I have not succeeded. I took it up last March and was certainly counting the votes, but I wasn’t counting Mark as one of those votes because my experience had been that those who have served in leadership in the military would side with the military and not be willing to take these cases out of the chain of command. You can imagine how shocked and in awe I was of him when not only did he vote for the amendment—which was a huge message to the entire membership of the committee that someone actively in the military would recognize the importance of this reform—he spoke up in favor of it. That is a man of extraordinary integrity. I will forever be grateful to him for cracking open the myth that members of the military don’t recognize the importance of dealing with that issue. Mark Takai, you live on for all of us. You are a great example for all of us as to how to lead as a Member of Congress with great dignity, with great integrity, and with great grace. Mr. HONDA. I yield back the balance of my time.
