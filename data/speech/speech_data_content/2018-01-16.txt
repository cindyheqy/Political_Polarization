Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank and recognize the leaders of the Doylestown Township community in my district for their hard work, generosity, and support for the community as Doylestown Township celebrates its bicentennial, 200 years of history and community that I am proud to be a part of. I would like to recognize the Doylestown Township Board of Supervisors: Barbara Lyons, Rick Colello, Ryan Manion, Jennifer Herring, and Ken Snyder; and the Volunteer Bicentennial Committee: Arthur Zapolski, Joe Paternostro, Ted Feldstein, Stu Abramson, David Hansen. Dr. Vail Garvin, Tina Mazaheri, Mary Lou Parry, Renu Dalal, Beth Long, Chris Nardo, and John Arnold. I would also like to recognize the community sponsors whose generosity made the celebration possible: my friend Senator Chuck McIlhinney and State Representative Marguerite Quinn, Pine Run Retirement Community Center, Covenant Bank, Delaware Valley University, Boucher & James, Bucks County Water & Sewer Authority, Gilmore & Associates, Pennoni, Pennsylvania Soup & Seafood House, Pickering, Corts & Summerson, FRANC Environmental, Doylestown Hospital, Worth & Company, Shelley Law Offices, Greenstreet, CB Cares Educational Foundation, Mazaheri Law, Monument Bank, and Doylestown Health for sponsoring the opening gala I was privileged to attend. I ask the House of Representatives to join me in saying thank you for their commitment to our community. RECOGNIZING SOUDERTON AREA HIGH SCHOOL  
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a school in my district. On November 30, 2017, Souderton Area High School was recognized as a National Banner Unified Champion School by the Special Olympics International headquarters. Through the diligence and compassion of Athletic Director Dennis Stanton and Supervisor of Special Education Megan Zweiback, the introduction of unified sports into the school has greatly enhanced the curriculum of specialneeds students and allowed them to compete with other students in interscholastic competition. One of only four schools in the Nation and the first in Pennsylvania to have been honored in this respect, I am proud of the work done at Souderton Area High School to support and enhance the education and recreational development of all students. f 
FUNDING THE CHILDREN’S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. BONAMICI ) for 5 minutes. Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I am a Member of Congress, but I am also a mom. And as a mom, I am puzzled and, frankly, dismayed because Congress has not found a bipartisan way to provide longterm funding for the Children’s Health Insurance Program. More than 9 million children and pregnant mothers, including thousands in Oregon, receive basic health care through CHIP. In the past, this popular program has always had broad bipartisan support. We must do better than the stopgap BandAid that is forcing States to rely on shortterm funding and, importantly, leaving vulnerable families with uncertainty and with distress. Recently, I met a wonderful family in Oregon that relies on CHIP for the health of their two kids. Their story pulled at my heart. This is David. David is 5, and his brother, Jacob, is 20 months old, and both children have neurological conditions. Both require longterm medical care. David battles a lifethreatening form of epilepsy that requires expensive medications as well as regular physical and occupational therapy. Their mom, Renee, fears the worst. I spoke with her and their pediatrician, and she told me that, without long term funding to support Medicaid and CHIP, she said: ‘‘David could die. It’s that simple.’’ Mr. Speaker, this is about real people, and their lives are on the line. Funding CHIP is a good investment. In 
fact, the Congressional Budget Office recently predicted that a 10year reauthorization of CHIP would actually save the Federal Government $6 billion. It turns out preventing illness not only saves lives, it saves money. There is no excuse for leaving CHIP unfunded. Working families like David and Jacob’s family need to know that they will have health care when their kids need it. David and Jacob are children whose lives are at stake, but there are millions more like them in Oregon and across the country. Mr. Speaker, David and Jacob deserve better. All of our Nation’s children deserve better. It is that simple, and we must not let them down. 
SUPPORTING THE BORNALIVE ABORTION SURVIVORS PROTECTION ACT The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. FITZPATRICK ). The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON ) for 5 minutes. Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, on Friday thousands of people from all across America will come to Washington to march in support of the dignity and equal protection of every God given human life in this great land. It is in that spirit that I rise to join my colleagues in supporting H.R. 4712, the BornAlive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. This bill ensures that, if a baby survives a failed abortion, that baby must be given the same medical care as a baby born under any circumstances. In a moral society, the strong have a responsibility to protect the weak. It is a stain on the moral fabric of our Nation that some lives are deemed less worthy than others with respect to protection. America is a city on a hill whose light shines bright for all the world to see. That light is dimmed, however, as long as the dark practice of leaving a baby to die continues. It is my hope that even those who believe in abortion can recognize that a baby who survives a botched abortion should be afforded the same protections that you and I are. This week, we celebrate not only the March for Life, we also celebrate the life of Martin Luther King, Jr. In his day, Martin Luther King, Jr., worked tirelessly, in the face of enormous adversity and personal risk to himself and his family, to help all of us as Americans live up to the highest of our American ideals: the selfevident truth that all men are created equal. Through his work, King helped our Nation better realize its charter for forming a more perfect Union. Mr. Speaker, the BornAlive Abortion Survivors Protection Act builds on King’s legacy by ensuring that the unalienable right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness are protected for everyone, especially for those whose voices have been silenced. Passing this legislation would restore some of our Nation’s light that has been lost and make our Nation a more perfect Union than it was yesterday. That, after all, is our job. In the words of the great American hero, Martin Luther King, Jr.: ‘‘It is always the right time to do the right thing.’’ Let’s do the right thing, and let’s protect these helpless little babies. RECOGNIZING SOPHIA CAMPA PETERS  
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I have the privilege of representing one of the most courageous little girls in all the world, Sophia CampaPeters. She may be a little girl, little in stature, but there is nothing small about Sophia’s heart and her courage. She has suffered, for the last 3 years, with a rare disease that has caused her to have multiple strokes, and she is now facing the biggest challenge in her journey, major brain surgery. God says: ‘‘Come to Me as little children.’’ Sophia represents the faith of a child like nobody I have encountered since I have been in this office, and she requested that I help her rally the world to pray on January 24 that, while she is having that surgery at Boston Children’s Hospital, we would encourage people and implore people to pray for her. I was delighted and honored to join her and many others in asking folks to take a knee and appeal to the Great Physician to protect her, to heal her, and to make provision for her to have a strong, healthy, and happy life for many, many years to come. What a testament to her faith in God and the power of prayer. What a testament of someone who, in the face of trial and tribulation, would choose hope, would choose to believe, would choose to dream that her best days are ahead of her. Thanks, Sophie. Thank you for your faith. Thank you for your testimony. Thank you for your courage. And most of all, thank you for teaching us that every day is an opportunity, every day is a gift from God. Sophia, we are rallying the world for you. We will pray for you, and we will appeal to Almighty God on your behalf. God bless her. God bless her family. 
b1400 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. COMER ) at 2 p.m. 
PRAYER The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: Dear God, we give You thanks for giving us another day. We ask Your special blessing upon the Members of this people’s House. They face difficult decisions in difficult times, with many forces and interests demanding their attention. In these days, give them wisdom that they might execute their responsibilities to the benefit of all Americans. Give, as well, on this day, acknowledging religious freedom in our land, confidence to all people who are concerned about the issues most pressing in our Nation at this time. May all that is done be for Your greater honor and glory. Amen. f 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8, rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the gentleman from Texas (Mr. SMITH) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. SMITH of Texas led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, the people of my hometown of Sugar Land, Texas, are amazing. Last Thursday, something terrible happened on a road I drive on every day at home. On Interstate 69, an 18 wheeler jackknifed during heavy rain. It flew off an overpass, crashing down on a small Toyota Camry. Look. That Camry is about 3 feet tall. The first miracle is that the driver, Karan Singh, is still alive. The second miracle that day is named Lori Lowery. Lori is training to be a nurse, most likely across the street at the University of Houston Sugar Land. The crash happened right in front of her. She jumped out of her car, crawled through metal and broken glass, and got Karan out. Lori Lowery shows the best in Texas and my hometown of Sugar Land, and I am proud to call her my boss in Congress. 
PUERTO RICO DESERVES BETTER (Miss GONZA´LEZCOLO´N of Puerto Rico asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Miss GONZA´LEZCOLO´N of Puerto Rico. Mr. Speaker, 4 months after Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, 40 percent of our people still lack electricity, with a system barely patched up. Of almost 80,000 homes approved to receive the temporary ‘‘blue roof,’’ only half of them have been installed. Those are only two examples. The hurricane season will be back in 5 months, and then we will be required to start all over again. The situation demands extreme urgency from all Federal agencies. What is taking so long? Where is the sense of urgency? This would never be tolerated in any State. The provisions of the Stafford Act limit us to only patching things up. The supplemental disaster appropriations bill addressed this, but it is stalled in the Senate. We expect better. We deserve better. We will work to lift ourselves up, but we need the tools to do so. We expect the Federal agencies to act urgently. f 
BENEFITS OF THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (Mrs. HANDEL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Mrs. HANDEL. Mr. Speaker, last month, the House passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Already these pro growth policies are having a positive impact. Businesses are making investments in operations and people. Thane Brooks operates a resource center for children with special needs in Alpharetta, Georgia. Because businesses can now immediately expense new equipment purchases, Thane is able to open a second facility to serve even more special needs children. Georgiabased Aflac announced that it will increase contributions to employee retirement plans. AT&T, with nearly 3,000 employees in the Sixth District, gave a $1,000 bonus to nonmanagement employees as a direct result of the tax cut bill. Overall, more than 2 million workers across the country are feeling the benefits of this law through increased wages, bonuses, and more retirement dollars. And with paychecks for nearly every American set to increase in the coming weeks, there is even more good news on the horizon for American families. 
COMMUNICATION FROM THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following communication from the Clerk of the House of Representatives: 
The United States Semiquincentennial Commission. With best wishes, I am, Sincerely, KAREN L. H AAS. f 
b1617 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. YOUNG of Iowa) at 4 o’clock and 17 minutes p.m. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4258) to promote the development of local strategies to coordinate use of assistance under sections 8 and 9 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 with public and private resources, to enable eligible families to achieve economic independence and selfsufficiency, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4258 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Family Self Sufficiency Act’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. DUFFY ) and the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. HIMES) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Wisconsin. GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Wisconsin? There was no objection. Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4258, the Family SelfSufficiency Act. This legislation will streamline a program designed to help those unable to purchase a home while reducing their dependency on welfare assistance and rental assistance provided by the government. I want to thank my colleague and friend from Missouri (Mr. CLEAVER ) for all of his bipartisan and helpful work on this legislation. It passed out of our committee 58–0, which is somewhat historic for the Financial Services Committee. Now, the Family SelfSufficiency Act, or FSS program, is focused on helping families in public housing and the housing choice voucher program. The goal is to utilize a number of services coordinated through the program to help families with individual training to increase their employability and become less dependent on assistance. These services can include basic education, childcare, transportation, education, financial literacy, mental health referrals, and homeownership counseling. While receiving services, an interestbearing escrow account is established for the family that can be used for any purpose once the family has graduated from the program. Currently, HUD operates one program for families served by the housing choice voucher program and a separate program for those families served by the public housing program. This legislation will combine those two separate FSS programs into one to streamline and reduce regulatory burdens. The bill also broadens the scope of supportive services that may be offered to these families to include attainment of a GED, education in pursuit of a postsecondary degree or certification, and—I think this is important—training in financial literacy. Lastly, H.R. 4258 opens the FSS program to families that live in privately owned properties that are subsidized by projectbased rental assistance. Mr. Speaker, 4,793 families have successfully completed the program, with 1,557 graduates exiting rental assistance, within a year and another 606 graduates that eventually went on and were able to purchase a home. So more than 10 percent of the people who graduate from the program go on to buy a home. I want to leave you with just a quick anecdote on written testimony that came to our committee from the Compass Working Capital Group. It is a story about Tanya. She graduated from the FSS program in Lynn, Massachusetts. Now, when Tanya enrolled in the FSS program, she had been receiving housing assistance for about 4 years. She was working fulltime and raising two children, but she had bigger dreams. One of those dreams was to one day own a house. At the time, Tanya believed that owning a home was, in her words, ‘‘not for families like mine,’’ a lowincome single mother who came from a family where no one has ever owned a home. So when Tanya graduated from the program, she got the assistance, got the counseling, and in the end, she was able to increase her annual income by $8,000, improve her credit score 140 points, pay down her debt, and save $3,000. She graduated from the program in 2015 and achieved her dream of becoming a homeowner, the first person in her family to do so. She said: But what makes me happiest of all is seeing my children love their new home. Thanks to the Compass FSS program, now I, too, believe that families like mine can get ahead, live better, and accomplish our big dreams and goals such as buying a home. This is a remarkable story of a program that actually works, that helps people get from public assistance into selfsufficiency and hopefully into homeownership. I think it is this kind of artful review of policy that our committee has done on a bipartisan level that brings us to reforms that can look at the successes of a program and build upon those successes and make them work for more families. Again, I want to thank my colleagues and friends across the aisle for working on this legislation and, again, bringing it out with such a bipartisan vote. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HIMES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4258, the Family SelfSufficiency Act of 2017, makes several commonsense improvements to HUD’s Family SelfSufficiency program, or FSS, which is the only asset building program at HUD to help increase economic opportunities for its lowincome households. Anecdotally, Mr. Speaker, when I was a commissioner of a housing authority many years ago, I saw this program in action. It deals with one of the challenges of what happens to a family as their incomes go up and they find it increasingly hard to invest and save because their rents typically go up. Mr. Speaker, this bill expands the scope of supportive services provided to residents to include GED training, education, and pursuit of a postsecondary degree or certification and training in financial literacy. The bill also expands the program to include families who live in privately owned properties and ensures that low 
income families can continue to participate in this program as their incomes increase. This is a particularly important improvement since under current law, once a family reaches 50 percent of area median income, they no longer are able to accrue additional savings in their escrow accounts. This bill fixes that issue. This bill is an important step in the right direction, and I hope we can continue to find ways to expand this very successful program beyond the current 72,000 households it can serve. I am glad to see that my friend from Wisconsin and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle recognize the success of this voluntary program, and I hope we can work together to find ways to improve it and to give energy to other programs which allow people to lift themselves out of lower income circumstances. Mr. Speaker, this bill was passed out of committee 58–0. I urge my colleagues to support the bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. CLEAVER ). Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, let me, first of all, state the obvious. I am rising to support H.R. 4258, the Family SelfSufficiency Act. I would like to thank Chairman DUFFY for the spirit of bipartisanship that he has demonstrated on this and on other legislation as well; and Mr. HIMES, the gentleman from Connecticut, who is managing this piece of legislation. It is also appropriate to thank the chair and the ranking member of the committee for giving their support to this piece of legislation. H.R. 4258 would make important updates to the Department of Housing and Urban Development Family Self Sufficiency program, the FSS program, which is a voluntary program that encourages residents who use housing vouchers or who live in public housing to connect with program coordinators to create selfsufficiency plans, obtain educational resources, and pursue work opportunities. This program also creates an interestbearing escrow account for participants that can be accessed upon graduation from the program. Money from this account can be used for jobrelated expenses or as savings for a home. I deviate from my written comments to say that there are a number of great stories like Tanya’s that Mr. DUFFY  shared. As a 5year resident of public housing when I was growing up, during that time my father was working on three jobs trying to save money for a house and to buy what became his first car. Our first car was an Oldsmobile Rocket 88—Rocket 88 I want emphasize—and it was the pride of our family and our community, frankly, when that happened. But it would have been infinitely easier if there had been some kind of escrow account that my father could have moved money into to save so that when he found that lot and the house that he lives in today, that would have been money right there available for him to pay down on it or pay it off. It seems like a lot of money then, but the lot was $5,000, and the money that he could have saved over that period of time could have been so significant. We managed to do it anyway. This program would help countless numbers of people who want to take advantage of the help that the Federal Government can give them with housing but at the same time work and strive toward independence. That is what I think the great value of this program is. I don’t want to repeat what has already been said, so I want to just give you a list of the organizations supporting this legislation: the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, Preservation of Affordable Housing, the National Leased Housing Association, the National Low Income Housing Coalition, Compass Working Capital, National Association of Housing Redevelopment Officials, Housing Partnership Network, the National Housing Trust, and Stewards of Affordable Housing for the Future. A similar version of this bill was introduced by Senator REEDand Senator BLUNT from my home State of Missouri over in the Senate, and I am encouraged by this bipartisanship and the bicameral process. I am also hopeful that we can continue to work, as Mr. HIMES said, on further improvements of housing resources all across the country, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. HIMES. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I want to briefly say in closing that we oftentimes find people who get stuck in a cycle of poverty. I think the goal of the program should be to help people get out of poverty and get to selfsufficiency. b1630 If you look at this program, it takes an initiative by the person in FSS to say: I am going to raise my hand; I want to take advantage of these opportunities. It is about helping them get an education. I have 8 kids, and I have a wife. For a single mom with a couple of kids who is trying to go to school or do job training or get a job, without some help on child care, that can’t work. You can’t make that happen. That is offered in this program. Again, it offers additional education, financial literacy training, and counseling on home ownership. If you have some mental health issues, you can get training in that. It is what is right about government, in the sense we don’t want people to get stuck. We don’t want people to get caught in a cycle of poverty, we want to help lift them up, and it is this kind of a program with these kinds of reforms that I think we have worked together on that accomplishes that goal: help people live the American Dream, which is get a job that allows them to eventually save enough money and buy a house. On the escrow part of this, when you get out of the program, you might have a small, little nest egg that you can use as a deposit for that home. So I think this is a great program that does the right thing. If you are a Liberal or a Conservative, no matter what side of the political spectrum you sit on, this program is making the government work for people. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. DUFFY ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4258, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
AMERICAN INNOVATION $1 COIN ACT Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 770) to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint coins in recognition of American innovation and significant innovation and pioneering efforts of individuals or groups from each of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and the United States territories, to promote the importance of innovation in the United States, the District of Columbia, and the United States territories, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 770 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘American Innovation $1 Coin Act’’. 
Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Wisconsin? There was no objection. Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 770, the American Innovation $1 Coin Act, introduced by my friend from Connecticut (Mr. HIMES). The legislation seeks to honor that which is best about America: her innovative spirit. If enacted, the legislation would authorize a program under which the Treasury Department’s United States Mint would produce a series of $1 coins celebrating the innovative capacity of the United States. By the way, it is that innovative capacity that makes us so great and competitive and allows our salaries and incomes to rise. Under the program, the front of the coins would have the standardized image symbolic of liberty, and the design on the reverse would be an image or images emblematic of one of a significant innovation, an innovator or pioneer, or a group of innovators or pioneers. Four different reverse images would be issued annually, representing innovations or innovators from each State, territory, or the District of Columbia. The order of issue would be strictly alphabetical. That means the first issue would go to the great State of Alabama. The number of coins of each design would be determined by the Treasury Secretary. While the coins technically would be circulating coins and usable in ordinary commerce, there is no real demand for circulating $1 coins at present. So the demand would strictly be determined by collector interest. The program would be produced at no cost to the taxpayer. I think that is important. Mr. HIMES made sure of that. Depending on the collector demand, it actually might produce a surplus that would then be returned to the Treasury’s General Fund. The legislation explicitly states that minting of the innovation coins would in no way interfere with the minting and issuing of the $1 coins honoring Native Americans. Those coins similarly have a standardized front design 
and a reverse design that changes regularly, honoring the great contributions that have been made to this country by Native Americans. So, Mr. Speaker, the Presidential dollar, when produced for collectors, had a demand of a little more than 5 million coins per design. That seems to indicate enough interest that would and should approve this program, as it can proceed at no cost to the taxpayer, while allowing the Mint to fully use its facilities. The language we are considering contains some minor technical amendments that will allow the coin production to begin more swiftly, which I think makes sense. I think this is a good bill, and Mr. HIMES has kind of thought through any red flags that could be risen by any Member on the floor. He has addressed those. Mr. Speaker, I support this bill and encourage my colleagues to do the same, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HIMES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Wisconsin for his support of this bill and the kind things he said about it. Mr. Speaker, the American Innovation $1 Coin Act addresses the decreasing numismatic coin sales resulting from the discontinuation of the Presidential $1 coin series. When enacted, this bill will first commission the U.S. Mint to create a yearlong introductory coin series bearing the semblance of George Washington’s signature on the first patent. The bill will then direct the Mint to release four $1 coins each year, as my friend from Wisconsin said, featuring a great American innovation from each State over the next 14 years. Coins will be issued in alphabetical order, starting with Alabama. State innovations will be chosen with input from State Governors, territory executives, the Commission of Fine Arts, and the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee. Mr. Speaker, I am particularly excited about the concept of commemorating and honoring innovation. As Mr. DUFFY has said, this is one of the core strengths of our country. We have fights across the aisle, as we should, over our economy and where this government intervenes. I think we agree that one of the key strengths of the United States is our entrepreneurial capacity and the remarkable innovations that come out of all 50 States and the territories of the United States. It is right that, in some small way, we honor those innovations and those innovators who help our economy grow, give us competitive advantage, and make us all proud to be part of the United States of America. Mr. Speaker, these coins will be sold as a product for collectors and minted to demand with oversight from the Treasury. Per U.S. Mint reports, to the point made by my friend from Wisconsin, the $1 coin costs less than 35 cents to make. As a product for collectors, the $1 coins sell for more than face value, up to $1.32 each. That is nearly a $1 profit on every coin. Proceeds from this coin will return money to the Treasury. In addition, the infrastructure producing these coins is already in place. This program will sunset once all States and territories have been honored and cannot be resumed, except by an act of Congress. This legislation has the support of members of the coin industry and their local suppliers and service providers across the States, including a number of small businesses in my district. These businesses represent scores of small businesses and thousands of jobs around the country. I believe this bill will engage the public, fill the void of a terminated coin series, help increase the Mint’s profitability, and create and sustain coinrelated jobs in both public and private sectors, all while honoring and commemorating the remarkable innovative capacity of our country. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 770, and I thank Chairman HENSARLING , Ranking Member WATERS , Chairman BARR, and Ranking Member M OORE , as well as my friend from Wisconsin, for their support and determination to get this important bill scheduled and passed. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, again, I think it is important to note that we are using the capacity of the Mint, which costs no additional money. But as Mr. HIMES pointed out, we are celebrating innovation. As a country, we continue to innovate and create in a way that no one else does in the world. It is that innovation and creation that creates more and better jobs for our society, our community, and our families. So I think it is a wonderful idea to celebrate that by way of a coin that costs the taxpayers no money but celebrates this great American trade. Mr. Speaker, I encourage all Members to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HIMES. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. DUFFY ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 770, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
EXPANDING INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES ACT Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4279) to direct the Securities and Exchange Commission to revise any rules necessary to enable closedend companies to use the securities offering and proxy rules that are available to other issuers of securities, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 4279 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Expanding Investment Opportunities Act’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. DUFFY ) and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. FOSTER ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Wisconsin.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. BISHOP ) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PASCRELL ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan. 
Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on the bill, H.R. 4318, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Michigan? There was no objection. Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be here today to speak in support of H.R. 4318, the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill Act of 2018. This bipartisan bill will provide long awaited tariff relief to our American manufacturers, who require certain inputs that are simply not made in the United States. Forcing them to pay tariffs for these inputs runs up their manufacturing costs and makes them uncompetitive compared to manufacturers in other countries. It also limits their ability to create more goodpaying jobs here at home. For companies in my home State of Michigan, the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill Act will provide nearly $27 million in cost savings, which can, instead, be used to employ more Americans, create new products, and boost the United States economy. For years, American manufacturers have been asking Congress for tariff relief to help them reduce costs, create jobs, and compete globally. Today, we can take critical steps in delivering that relief. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill Act has historically had broad bipartisan support in both Chambers of Congress as a means to bolster U.S. manufacturing and competitiveness. Right now, the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill Act has been expired for more than 5 years. I am pleased that today we are finally able to consider updating this bill. The Miscellaneous Tariff Bill Act is designed to provide relief to domestic firms by reducing or lifting tariffs on imported goods, as long as those goods are not produced here in the United States of America. It is estimated that this legislation will provide more than $1 billion in tariff relief to U.S. businesses. Many of these businesses are needlessly paying more to acquire inputs to manufactured products here in the United States. My home State of New Jersey will benefit greatly from this program, with firms projected to save more than $100 million over the course of a 3year program. As a result, these New Jersey companies will receive a competitive boost and will be able to use their resources more productively, whether by raising wages or investing in research and development. Consider ICF Mercantile, located in Fort Lee, New Jersey, which will obtain duty relief on hightenacity rayon yarn, an input for material used for naval defense systems. Unfortunately, this specialty yarn has not been produced domestically in 20 years. That means that removing the tariff here would help, not hurt, U.S. industry. New Jersey has a robust presence of chemical companies—it is our largest industry—employing directly or indirectly over 100,000 jobs. Several of those firms will receive tariff relief from numerous imported chemicals that I dare not try to pronounce. All of these folks who like their antipasti, their Italian subs, salad, or pizza with some extra heat will be pleased to enjoy tariff relief on little green pepperoncini, either packed in oil or not. The Miscellaneous Tariff Bill Act is also intended to carefully prevent domestic companies from being harmed. Under the current process, the International Trade Commission and the Department of Commerce analyzed whether products are currently or could be eminently produced in the United States. If such production or potential for production was found, the ITC recommends excluding that product. The American Manufacturing Competitiveness Act, which passed in 2016 with only two votes against it in the House, established the current process that invites U.S. firms to submit petitions that the ITC, the Department of Commerce, and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection analyze, vet, and recommend to Congress for inclusion or exclusion. I would like to thank each agency for its hard work in coordination with Congress throughout the process. Boosting the competitiveness of American manufacturers and manufacturing workers should be one of our highest priorities in Congress. The Miscellaneous Tariff Bill Act is a program that helps do that, and I want to make sure its impact is maximized. This bill covers more than 1,600 products compared to the previous MTB, which covered only half as many products. Because this is the first time that this new process has been used, I am interested in reviewing both the process and, more importantly, the results, and working together with those who have constructive suggestions for any improvements that can be made. But I also want to note that this program is not enough. We, as a Congress and as a nation, need to be doing more in looking for opportunities to enhance American competitiveness meaningfully. The global economic environment is not just tough, but it is becoming more and more challenging and hostile to our companies and our workers. b1700 I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting a bill that will provide some important relief to U.S. firms across the country. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the folks on the other side. We have worked very closely on this legislation over a number of years, and it is finally coming to fruition. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. KELLY ). Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, first of all, we need to ask ourselves, what does H.R. 4318 do, 
the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill Act? It is going to make it easier for American manufacturers to compete globally. As my friend, Mr. PASCRELL , has just said to you, for so many years, we have put ourselves at the wrong end of the way things should work. We add tariffs, we add taxes on the people who manufacture. This is a commonsense bill. In every measurable way, our country and our people are the beneficiaries of this bill. Now, through this legislation, Congress will be able to reduce or totally suspend the tariffs, which are essentially a tax. At the end of the day, by giving tariff relief to U.S. businesses, this will reduce manufacturing costs, therefore, making products more competitive for U.S. consumers. It is a win win for America’s consumers and for American workers. For decades, Congress has passed this type of legislation to boost the competitiveness of U.S. manufacturing by lowering the cost of imported goods without unnecessarily harming U.S. based companies that produce competing products. Now, let me just take, for example, a company back in Pennsylvania, Lasko Products. Mr. PASCRELL and I sat in a hearing and we listened to these folks as they talked about what makes them competitive, what takes them off the shelf where they can’t compete, and too often it was their own country that was making it difficult. Lasko is an 11 yearold company. They employ 1,000 people. Now, Mr. McCasey, who is the chief operating officer, came and talked to us. When you hear what goes on with Lasko—this is in his words, and I think this is where we have to really concentrate—Mr. McCasey says: We are in a business of pennies and can sometimes lose the sale of a fan to an overseas competitor due to a cost differential of 20 to 30 cents. So what is it that Lasko makes? It makes fans. Seventytwo percent of their fans are portable fans. Why in the world would their own government make it harder for them to compete in a global economy? It makes absolutely no sense. We have come together, both sides, in agreement that, if there is something that we can do, why wouldn’t we do it? Why wouldn’t we make it easier for our own companies to compete? Why wouldn’t we make it easier not just for us to compete, why wouldn’t we make it easier for us to win, and win in big ways? This piece of legislation is so commonsense. There is nothing in it that both sides don’t agree on. Quite frankly, and I agree with Mr. PASCRELL , this is the first step, but we have got to go even further. When we see what has happened in our country since last year, the Trump administration’s policies and the numbers that we have seen rising and escalating at such an ascent that we didn’t ever expect this to happen this quickly, when we see America winning again, we know that that means America’s workers, every man and woman, everybody in America benefits through this legislation because we make ourselves competitive on the global stage. There is no reason for America ever to take a backseat to anybody else in the world, and we do it through commonsense legislation. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and Mr. PASCRELL . It is good to be on the same team. It is good to be winning and keeping America winning as we go forward. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, for far too long, American manufacturers have been put at a disadvantage because they are forced to pay tariffs on products they need but are not made in the United States. This has increased their costs, limited their ability to create new jobs, and decreased their competitive edge. Today we have the opportunity to change that by passing the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill Act of 2018. This bipartisan bill would deliver the tariff relief our manufacturers need to strengthen their competitive edge, create new, goodpaying jobs, provide more benefits to their employees, and boost the American economy. At the same time, because relief is temporary, we continue to create an incentive for United States manufacturers to decide to make these products here at home. For years, American manufacturers have been asking for tariff relief. Today we can do our part to deliver it. I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD the following: 
ALEX DIEKMANN PEAK DESIGNATION ACT OF 2017 Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 117) to designate a mountain peak in the State of Montana as ‘‘Alex Diekmann Peak’’. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 117 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Alex Diekmann Peak Designation Act of 2017’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Montana (Mr. GIANFORTE ) and the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Ms. HANABUSA ) each will control 20 minutes. 
Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Montana? There was no objection. Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the Alex Diekmann Peak Designation Act of 2017, introduced by Senator STEVE DAINES from Montana, would designate an unnamed peak in the Lee Metcalf Wilderness in my home State of Montana the Alex Diekmann Peak. Alex Diekmann was a renowned conservationist who lived in Bozeman, Montana. He dedicated his professional life to protecting the scenic resources of more than 50 district areas in Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho and conserving more than 100,000 acres. Mr. Diekmann brought together communities, landowners, sportsmen, and the general public in his conservation efforts and contributed to the future of natural treasures, such as the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, Glacier National Park, and the CabinetYaak Ecosystem. Mr. Diekmann left a noteworthy impact on the preservation of natural wonders in and near the Madison Valley and Madison Range of Montana. This pristine area is home to majestic scenery, fishing, wildlife, and recreational opportunities that will remain conserved and accessible to the public thanks to Alex’s diligent work. Mr. Diekmann lost his heroic battle with cancer on February 1, 2016, at the age of 52. He is survived by his wife, Lisa, and their two sons, Logan and Liam. He leaves a legacy of conservation across Montana and the northern Rockies that will continue to benefit the United States for generations to come. The designation of this unnamed peak in the Lee Metcalf Wilderness in Montana will honor the life and legacy of Alex Diekmann. I thank Alex for his work on behalf of the American people and look forward to paying tribute to him by hiking Alex Diekmann Peak this coming summer with my wife and those of my children who can join us. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. HANABUSA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, S. 117 designates a peak in the Beaverhead National Forest as the Alex Diekmann Peak. Alex Diekmann was a renowned conservationist who lived in Bozeman, Montana, not far from the Beaverhead National Forest and the peak that will soon bear his name. As a senior project manager for The Trust for Public Land, Mr. Diekmann dedicated his professional life to protecting the natural and scenic resources of the northern Rockies. His conservation legacy is apparent throughout Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho, where he was directly involved in the conservation of more than 100,000 acres of public and private lands. At the age of 52, Mr. Diekmann lost a heroic battle with cancer on February 1, 2016. To honor his enduring legacy, this bill renames a peak in the Lee Metcalf Wilderness in Montana as the Alex Diekmann Peak. This is a good bill, and I urge my colleagues to support its adoption. Mr. Speaker, I would like to close by encouraging my colleagues to vote in support of the naming of Alex Diekmann Peak in S. 117. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Hawaii for her help on this, and I would also urge my colleagues to vote for the bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my support for S. 117, the Alex Diekmann Peak Designation Act. Although I didn’t work with Alex Diekmann personally, I am very familiar with the work that the Trust for Public Land has done across the West, and I have been told of all of Alex’s individual achievements in protecting important wildlife corridors, flyfishing streams, and ecosystems across Montana and the Northern Rockies. He spent the better part of two decades making the American West better, protecting landscapes within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem and securing places for our children’s children to enjoy. This legislation is a fitting memorial to Alex Diekmann’s life and legacy, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Montana (Mr. GIANFORTE ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 117. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
PERSHING COUNTY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND CONSERVATION ACT Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1107) to promote conservation, improve public land management, and provide for sensible development in Pershing County, Nevada, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 1107 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
section 202 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1712). 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Montana (Mr. GIANFORTE ) and the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Ms. HANABUSA ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Montana. 
Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Montana? There was no objection. Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1107, introduced by Congressman MARKAMODEI of Nevada, is a bipartisan bill that consolidates over 300,000 acres of checkerboard land previously identified for disposal by the Bureau of Land Management in Pershing County, Nevada. This bill conveys land for mining and other public purposes, creates a new wilderness area, and releases certain wilderness study areas, all to benefit conservation, recreation, and economic development in the county. Mr. Speaker, 85 percent of Nevada’s land is owned and operated by the Federal Government. Not only does this deprive the State final say on management decisions in its own backyard, but it also deprives the State of the tax base utilized by other States to fund roads, school districts, and police departments. Pershing County, Nevada, is no different. Seventyfive percent of the county is federally owned. This bill is a result of over a decade of negotiations between locally elected officials, miners, conservationists, sportsmen, ranchers, and residents in the county. Their hard work and commitment to bipartisanship has resulted in a bill that benefits all parties, guaranteeing that both the economic and ecological future of the county are protected. This bill, in addition to being cosponsored by all Nevada congressional Representatives, is supported by Pershing County, Friends of Nevada Wilderness, the Nevada Chapter of the Backcountry Hunters and Anglers, Coalition for Nevada’s Wildlife, and several Nevadan mining companies, including Clover Nevada, Coeur Mining, EP Minerals, Gold Acquisition Corp., and Solidus Resources. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the balance of my time. b1715 Ms. HANABUSA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1107 is a bill cosponsored by the entire Nevada delegation that will enhance both economic development opportunities and the conservation of public land in Pershing County. First, I want to mention that this bill will designate over 130,000 acres of wilderness. This is a significant conservation victory and I would like to congratulate everyone who has worked on making this a reality. In addition to the wilderness designation, this bill establishes a process to exchange or sell up to 400,000 acres of Federal land throughout Pershing County. I understand that the BLM and other interested parties have raised some concerns with the appraisal process set up in the bill. Unfortunately, we were not able to address these concerns at markup, but I hope we can continue working with our colleagues in the Senate to make any necessary changes to the bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. AMODEI ). Mr. AMODEI. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues from Montana and Hawaii for their supportiveness. Briefly, Mr. Speaker, this is what you get when people talk about issues and not cliches. This is a long time in the making, as has been previously indicated, folks from the wilderness areas, folks from economic development areas, folks from the resource extraction areas all coming together on this. But just in case there is some concern about, oh my God, potentially we are transferring the Federal estate, let’s remind people of a couple of things that are in this legislation. First of all, nothing is transferred for nothing. It talks about the appraisal process and how, if you are going to purchase the Federal estate, you are going to pay for it. Secondly, it is talking about exchanges along the TransPacific legislation on the checkerboard from 1862, which talks about the Secretary of the Interior is a full partner with the county commission in identifying those lands that are appropriate for exchange. Why is this important? This is important because if they don’t think it is a good idea to exchange, then the Secretary of the Interior can stop that process, so it doesn’t force the Secretary of the Interior to exchange land that he or she, in the future, doesn’t want to. But let’s remind ourselves of one other thing. Exchanges of checkerboard land are not just something that benefits perhaps economic development along the Interstate 80 corridor, or somebody who does a cowcalf operation somewhere. It also allows resource managers, Federal land managers, wildlife people to consolidate checkerboard lands where they need to be consolidated, to do things like preserve habitat, preserve special resource areas, whether it is for mule deer, whether it is for the endangered species potential of the sage hen, and other things like that. So it is a twoway street. So my congratulations to the folks of Pershing County and the BLM employees in the Winnemucca district. By the way, no lands are subject to this that haven’t been identified in their resource management plan, their planning document, as potentially available for either exchange or disposal. Finally, I want to remind you of this: there are 150,000 acres that can be bought out of a potential Federal estate of over 9 million acres in that county. So it is a fraction of 1 percent. And of the potential available for exchange, it sets an upper limit of 300,000, potential. The county has to ask for it, the Secretary has to agree to an exchange. So when you talk about the size of the Federal estate in Pershing County—which, by the way, is the home to the Burning Man festival, for those of you who follow that sort of stuff—it is something that is, quite frankly, not going to change the landscape, literally speaking, in terms of the ownership and the diminishment of the Federal estate. They are still the major player to the tune of—at the end of the day, 95 percent of the Federal estate is still intact. Finally, on wilderness study areas and wilderness creation areas, in this bill, you have created about 148,000 acres of new wilderness areas and you have released parts of five different wilderness study areas that are about 48,000 acres. So when you start talking about this is a good housekeeping measure, it allows Pershing County to come into the new age in terms of what they think is appropriate for their economic diversification and vitality, but also gives Federal land managers, resource folks, wildlife groups, and conservation groups, the tools to do good things in Pershing County, too. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague for his generous provision of the time. The last piece is this: the most successful public lands legislation in the country is probably the Southern Nevada Public Lands Management Act, which turns 20 this year. Much of this is patterned on that. When you talk about what happens when they sell land, money goes to education and it goes to the county, and then 85 percent of every dollar brought in goes for the benefit of those Federal lands, for those land managers in Pershing County. 
It has been working in southern Nevada for 20 years. This is a good step. I encourage bipartisan, nationwide support. Ms. HANABUSA. Mr. Speaker, I am just going to close by saying that I request that all of our colleagues vote to support H.R. 1107, Pershing County Economic Development and Conservation Act. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I would echo the sentiments of the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Ms. HANABUSA ). I urge my colleagues to vote for this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Montana (Mr. GIANFORTE ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1107, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
POARCH BAND OF CREEK INDIANS LAND REAFFIRMATION ACT Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1532) to reaffirm that certain land has been taken into trust for the benefit of the Poarch Band of Creek Indians, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1532 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Poarch Band of Creek Indians Land Reaffirmation Act’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Montana (Mr. GIANFORTE ) and the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Ms. HANABUSA ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Montana. 
Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Montana? There was no objection. Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. H.R. 1532, sponsored by the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. BYRNE ), would ratify the trust status of lands the Secretary of the Interior currently holds for the benefit of the Poarch Band of Creek Indians of Alabama. The lands are located in the State of Alabama, with the exception of 1 acre of land in the State of Florida. The Tribe’s trust lands are used for a variety of Tribal purposes, including the operation of casinos authorized under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, a health clinic, an assisted living facility, and other facilities and development serving the needs of the Tribe and the local communities. H.R. 1532 applies only to specific tracts of land taken in trust prior to a 2009 ruling by the Supreme Court, a ruling whose significance I will describe in a moment. Lands held in trust by the Secretary of the Interior have a unique political status. The lands are regulated by Tribes and the Federal Government pursuant to a variety of statutes that restrict their alienation, and protect them from taxation and from State civil and criminal jurisdiction. In addition, gaming may not be conducted by a Tribe under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 unless the casino is located on trust or reservation lands. H.R. 1532 is necessary because there is a cloud of uncertainty over the title of the Poarch Band’s existing trust lands. The Poarch Band obtained formal Federal recognition in 1984 and lands for the benefit of the Tribe were taken by the Secretary of the Interior in trust pursuant to the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, or the IRA. In a 2009 Supreme Court opinion commonly called Carcieri, the Court held that the Secretary may not use the IRA to acquire land in trust for a Tribe unless the Tribe was under Federal jurisdiction when the IRA was enacted in 1934. While the Poarch Band was not a party to the case, the effect of the Supreme Court case calls into question the lawfulness of the Secretary’s acquisition of the Tribe’s lands because the Tribe was federally recognized 50 years after the IRA. H.R. 1532 would clear up any question over the validity of the Secretary’s action to take the Tribe’s existing lands into trust. It will create a needed certainty for the Tribe to use it for a variety of uses that might otherwise be prohibited were the lands to fall under State jurisdiction. Because the bill ratifies the trust status for lands acquired by the Secretary prior to 2009, there is no concern that we are ratifying any action taken by the Secretary that might violate the IRA, as defined by the Supreme Court. There is precedent for this legislation. In 2013, Congress enacted legislation to ratify the trust status of lands for the Gun Lake Tribe in Michigan, a Tribe that was recognized in recent years, like the Poarch Band. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this measure, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. HANABUSA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the Poarch Band of Creek Indians is the only federally recognized Tribe in Alabama. The Tribe was administratively recognized by the Bureau of Indian Affairs in 1984 and, thereafter, acquired trust land in both Alabama and Florida. However, like other Tribes recognized post1924, the status of Poarch Band’s trust lands have been under legal attack due to the ramifications of the 2009 Supreme Court Carcieri decision. The Tribe currently maintains several facilities for use of its members on its trust lands, as well as owning and operating two casinos. H.R. 1532 would simply ratify and reaffirm this trust status of the Poarch Band’s lands, protecting the lands against further litigation. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support adoption of this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. BYRNE ). Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1532, the Poarch Band of Creek Indians Land Reaffirmation Act, is a commonsense, bipartisan bill that will provide much needed certainty to an Indian Tribe in my district. The Poarch Creek Indians are a valued and trusted part of our community in southwest Alabama. Their economic impact in Escambia County, Alabama, speaks for itself. From their help with funding for community projects to their business enterprises that employ thousands of Alabamians, the Poarch help make life better for so many people in our area. This legislation is necessary due to the legal uncertainty caused by the Supreme Court decision in Carcieri v. Salazar. This decision has unnecessarily created legal ambiguity about whether the Poarch Creek land is actually in trust or not. To be clear: this legislation would not have any change over the way the Poarch Band or their land are currently being treated in Alabama. In fact, this legislation simply provides legal certainty to help prevent future challenges regarding the status of the Tribe’s land. I am pleased we were able to attract bipartisan support for the legislation, including a unanimous vote out of the Natural Resources Committee last year. I also want to extend my gratitude to Chairman BISHOP , Ranking Member GRIJALVA , and the committee staff for their commitment to Indian issues and their work on this legislation. Ultimately, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this commonsense, straightforward legislation to give muchneeded legal certainty to the Poarch Band of Creek Indians. Ms. HANABUSA. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I just would like to ask all of my colleagues to support H.R. 1532, the Poarch Band of Creek Indians Land Reaffirmation Act. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. b1730 Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. GAETZ ). Mr. GAETZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Montana (Mr. GIANFORTE ) for yielding me time, and I thank the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. BYRNE ) for his leadership on this issue. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Poarch Band of Creek Indians Land Reaffirmation Act and encourage my colleagues to do the same. The Poarch Creek have been in Alabama and northwest Florida since the War of 1812, but they were only recognized federally in 1984. Soon afterward, 
the Poarch Creek obtained land in both Florida and Alabama, land that was held in trust. The Poarch Creek contribute greatly to the Florida and Alabama region. Their unique history forms a vital part of our culture, and their businesses strengthen our region’s economy and create jobs. They give back to our community from museums to scholarships to services for the elderly and students and much more. But if lands currently in trust lost their status, the Tribal economy could be shattered, businesses could close, incomes could plummet, and we would have robbed our Nation of a great part of its cultural heritage, all in the name of a confusing legal decision. This good bill reaffirms the trust status of the Poarch Creek land. It is fair, just, and important, and I encourage my colleagues to support it. Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Montana (Mr. GIANFORTE ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1532. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
AUTHORIZING COOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS BETWEEN DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AND NATIONAL PARK SERVICE Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2897) to authorize the Mayor of the District of Columbia and the Director of the National Park Service to enter into cooperative management agreements for the operation, maintenance, and management of units of the National Park System in the District of Columbia, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2897 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. AUTHORIZING COOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS BETWEEN DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AND NATIONAL PARK SERVICE FOR OPERATION, MAINTENANCE, AND MANAGEMENT OF UNITS OF THE NATIONAL PARK SYSTEM IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Montana (Mr. GIANFORTE ) and the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Ms. HANABUSA ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Montana. 
Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Montana? There was no objection. Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2897, introduced by Congresswoman ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON of the District of Columbia, authorizes the District of Columbia to establish cooperative management agreements with the National Park Service to operate, manage, and maintain National Park Service properties within the city limits. As of 2015, 21.7 percent of the District’s total surface area, over 8,000 acres in all, was owned and managed by the National Park Service. This area includes 23 distinct units of the National Park System, the National Mall, and many of the small urban green spaces spread throughout the city. A significant portion of this land is in disrepair. The District ranks second in the National Park Service’s deferred maintenance, with an estimated total deferred maintenance of approximately $1.2 billion. H.R. 2897 authorizes the District of Columbia to enter into cooperative management agreements with the National Park Service for the operation and maintenance of units around the city. This bill is a component to a major restorative initiative headed by the Mayor’s office and sponsored by local nonprofits, and conversations are already underway between the District and the National Park Service for the improvement and repair of Franklin Park. The city has set aside nearly $14 million for the restoration of the park, and local public and private partnerships will provide yearly maintenance and upkeep. Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill for both the citizens of the District and the citizens of our great country. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. HANABUSA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. H.R. 2897 authorizes the District of Columbia and the National Park Service to enter into cooperative management agreements for the operation, maintenance, and management of the National Park System units in the District of Columbia. Cooperative management agreements are effective tools used throughout the National Park System that lead to creative partnerships that enhance programming and management capacity. As we will hear from Delegate ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON , the District of Columbia and the National Park Service have worked out an agreement to update Franklin Square that will revitalize an area in an important quadrant of downtown. This bill simply provides the city with authority to execute the agreement. In addition to Franklin Square, H.R. 2897 has the potential to foster cooperation that will enhance many of the small urban parks found throughout our Nation’s capital. Mr. Speaker, this is a win/win, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON ). Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank both of my friends for their work on this bill, and I want to thank Natural Resources Committee Chairman ROBBISHOP , who is a cosponsor of this bill, for his support and leadership of this legislation, as well as Ranking Member RAU´LGRIJALVA , who has also supported our efforts. I also want to thank Oversight and Government Reform Chair TREY GOWDY and Ranking Member E LIJAH  CUMMINGS for their support and for moving this bipartisan legislation through their committee as well. So you see, we have gone through two committees, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, I am particularly pleased and grateful to Senator LISA 
MURKOWSKI , chair of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, which has jurisdiction over the bill, who has introduced the Senate companion of this bill. Our bill is noncontroversial, as you have heard, Mr. Speaker. It would only clarify that the District of Columbia has the authority to enter into cooperative management agreements, called CMAs, to maintain and invest in National Park Service properties in the city. There are many such properties, we are grateful to say, in the District of Columbia. NPS already has the authority to enter into these agreements with States, and I believe with the District of Columbia, but the better part of valor was to make sure that that was understood. Our bill would simply provide the District with the same opportunity to work collaboratively with the NPS as States and cities already do. NPS is the steward of many of the country’s most beautiful natural wonders, but they are uniquely responsible for most of the small urban parks in the District’s neighborhoods, as well. Given NPS’ limited budget and resources, we should encourage local jurisdictions to work with NPS to make sure that our national parks are properly cared for in the way this bill incentivizes. The city already has plans to enter into a CMA with the National Park Service to assume operational jurisdiction of Franklin Park. This park is located in downtown D.C., right in the center of town, but it has seen better days. The city plans to work with the Downtown Business Improvement District to transform the park to its former glory by ensuring regular maintenance and providing amenities such as food, gardens, and other services. As the city’s downtown core has grown to include more housing, businesses, and workers, the need for green space also has grown. The city’s plans for Franklin Park are a model of what can be done when local jurisdictions get creative about protecting and improving the Nation’s parks. Mr. Speaker, I hope Members are taking this bill as a model for what can be done if they have parks. Perhaps the park for this bill would not be as easily patterned. But there are many small parks that are near local businesses. Local businesses do not thrive when green space is in poor condition, so we did not find it difficult to get the business community around this park to partner with the District of Columbia to bring it up to what a park should look like in the center of the city. The National Park Service has a backlog that has been described by my friend on the other side, so we cannot expect the Park Service, even if it had the most robust funding appropriation here, to get to many of our parks very soon. What works here can work throughout the United States. My bill is, of course, a win for my city, but it is also a win for the Federal Government, and it is a win for the more than 30 million visitors who visit the District of Columbia every day because it is our Nation’s capital, and, of course, it is a win for the surrounding jurisdictions because this park is so centrally located in this region. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from Hawaii (Ms. HANABUSA ) for yielding time to me. Ms. HANABUSA. Mr. Speaker, I am closing by asking that our colleagues support this great bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I also urge adoption, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Montana (Mr. GIANFORTE ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2897. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
b1830 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. MARSHALL ) at 6 o’clock and 30 minutes p.m. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that my name be added as a cosponsor of H.R. 756, a bill introduced by Mr. Chaffetz. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Virginia? There was no objection. 
APPOINTMENT OF MEMBER TO THE JAPANUNITED STATES FRIENDSHIP COMMISSION The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair announces the Speaker’s appointment, pursuant to 22 U.S.C. 2903, and the order of the House of January 3, 2017, of the following Member on the part of the House to the JapanUnited States Friendship Commission: Mr. HILL, Arkansas 
RELIGIOUS FREEDOM DAY (Mr. HILL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today, on Religious Freedom Day, to recognize the importance of religious freedom throughout the world and to celebrate the 232nd anniversary of the passing of the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom. As a Catholic, my faith plays a significant role in every aspect of life and fosters a respect for the religious rights and freedoms of others. Fundamental American values, among which are commitments to religious freedom and human rights, will always be cornerstones of both U.S. domestic and foreign policy. Written by Thomas Jefferson, the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom is the forerunner of the First Amendment protection for religious freedom and the principle of separation of church and state. As a member of the Religious Minorities in the Middle East Caucus, I will continue to advocate for the rights of individuals to express their feelings without living in fear of violence and persecution. f 
NATIONAL MENTORING MONTH (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in honor of National Mentoring Month and in recognition of the great contributions that mentors make to young people and to communities across the country. Every young person deserves and needs a mentor, someone with experience and perspective to help them overcome challenges and navigate uncertainties. I would not be here today without the guidance that I received from my mentors, including Supreme Court Justice and former Mayor Frank Flaherty, former Mayor Joe Walsh, the late State Senator Eleanor Slater, and the late Senator Claiborne Pell. Mentorships like these can be life changing, and I applaud organizations like MENTOR Rhode Island, which pairs mentors with atrisk youth. Vulnerable young people with mentors are more likely to maintain better attendance and positive attitudes toward school, and they are 55 percent more likely to go to college than their peers. Mr. Speaker, it is with deep appreciation for my mentors and the power of mentoring that I recognize January as National Mentoring Month. 
RELIGIOUS FREEDOM DAY (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, today we celebrate 25 years of observing Religious Freedom Day. On this day, more than 200 years ago, our forefathers in the Virginia General Assembly sought to practice their respective religions freely, so they passed a State law which secured our ability to exercise our faith freely today. The context of this initial law formed the inspiration for the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Our country holds among its most fundamental freedoms the right to practice freely one’s religion and associate with others who share those same beliefs. As we know from experience, freedom is not without cost and it is not free. It must be protected and nourished, and our communities of faith, in particular, need to be safeguarded from government encroachment and intrusion. It is with this in mind, Mr. Speaker, that I will continue to work with my colleagues to defend our First Amendment and our communities of faith on Religious Freedom Day and every day. 
b1915 IT IS TIME WE SHOW OUR NATIONAL CHARACTER (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, since the Trump administration announced the end of the DACA program in September, more than 16,000 people have already lost their protection from deportation and their ability to work. Each day we fail to act to protect DREAMers, 122 more people lose those protections and the ability to contribute to their country in the same way they have for as long as they have lived here. These DREAMers teach our children, care for our loved ones, start businesses, strengthen our communities, defend our Nation, and believe that our country, their country, will see them for the Americans they are. One of our country’s proudest DREAMers, Jose Antonio Vargas, once said: 
Citizenship to me is more than a piece of paper. Citizenship is also about character. I am an American. We are just waiting for our country to recognize it. 
Jose is right. It is high time our country recognizes the DREAMers for the Americans they really are. It is time we show our national character. 
HUMAN TRAFFICKING AWARENESS MONTH (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, as we observe Human Trafficking Awareness Month, I would like to recognize organizations in my home district of Miami that are working to put an end to this modern day slavery. As a tourist destination and a gateway to the Americas, south Florida is a preferred spot for criminals to commit these types of outrageous human rights violations. But thanks to organizations like Kristi House and The Women’s Fund of MiamiDade, there is a critical campaign afoot to bring public awareness and to stop this terrible scourge. St. Thomas University has created the Human Trafficking Academy, which offers training and technical assistance to law enforcement, lawyers, and the general public. Resources like the Human Trafficking Miami Hotline, led by our esteemed MiamiDade State attorney’s office, serves victims and survivors of human trafficking by encouraging calls to 305–350–5567. We are also blessed to have devoted law enforcement officers who are committed to a zero tolerance campaign to protect victims, to prosecute and dismantle traffickers. As you can see, Mr. Speaker, south Florida is dedicated to fighting this crime. A future free of human trafficking is out there, and I urge every American to make that a reality. f 
TAKING ISSUE WITH THE COMMENTS OF THE PRESIDENT (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as an American, I certainly celebrate religious freedom and acknowledge the importance of freedom of religion and speech and the ability to have access to a free press. Sadly, I rise to take issue with the comments said by the Commander in Chief, well documented by Senator DURBIN and the Senator from South Carolina, LINDSEY GRAHAM , who delicately tried to instruct the Commander in Chief of the ugliness of his words. I will not say them on the floor, and I have not said the complete word, but over this weekend of the beloved community of Dr. Martin Luther King, everywhere I went, people were appalled. I believe that it is crucial that we pass the Dream Act and that we speak to the racism of this President through 1973, 1980, 1988, and 1989. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. MAST). Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. 
REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF MR. BILLY LEE (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life of Mr. Billy Lee, who passed away on December 21 at the age of 85. Mr. Lee owned McDonough’s, the oldest Irish pub in Savannah; and the upstairs restaurant, Billy’s Place. Mr. Lee and McDonough’s are iconic in Savannah. McDonough’s has been voted the best karaoke in town for 8 straight years and is an immensely popular watering hole for all Savannahians. Mr. Lee never met a stranger in McDonough’s and he had an extremely sharp memory for its patrons. His kindness is fondly remembered by all who frequented McDonough’s, including times when he purchased blankets for the homeless, allowed folks to use his business for charity events, and opened his building for Hurricane Irma evacuees from Florida. Mr. Lee has commented on his restaurant and bar: That’s the story of what we do here. We help people. Mr. Lee’s kind spirit will be missed in Savannah, and I hope that people will continue to learn from his example for years to come. f 
100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FIRST VOTE CAST BY A WOMAN IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 100th anniversary of the first vote cast by a woman in the State of New York. 100 years ago, the residents of Lisle, New York, and Broome County held a special election to decide if liquor could be served in the town of Lisle. This was the first vote held in the State of New York after women had just recently gained the right to vote just 2 months prior, thanks to the efforts of other famous New Yorkers who are memorialized in our historic Capitol rotunda: Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Lucretia Mott. On January 25, 1918, shortly after 6 a.m., right before the polls opened, on a cold, snowy day in the southern tier, the Ladies of Lisle lined up outside to cast their first vote. When the doors opened, a woman named Florence B. Chauncey was the first to step forward and place her ballot in the box at the Lisle Village Hall. This year, on January 5, a historic marker was unveiled at the old Lisle Village Hall to commemorate this momentous occasion. This extraordinary act will now be memorialized forever on the Main Street in Lisle. 
OUR RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IS UNDER ASSAULT (Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, it is important to point out that religious freedom is indeed a cornerstone of the founding and the fiber of the United States. What started out in the Virginia General Assembly on this date in 
1786, which grew into the First Amendment in our Constitution and other Bill of Rights, that freedom is under assault. Courts, time and again, try to strike down the ability for people to peaceably assemble, peaceably speak their religious views, whether it is on a football field after a game or even extending so much to people objecting to what they are going to do in their bakery with what kind of products they are going to put out. We have folks that seem to think that religion is some kind of a plague in this country. Yes, maybe it is an inconvenience if your neighbor worships in a way that is different from you; but that is something that we have always, in the term ‘‘tolerance,’’ worked to get along with. Indeed, this House Chamber, every day, opens with an invocation; and right above the podium here, it says: ‘‘In God we trust.’’ Are we going to trust ourselves as a nation to allow each other to worship freely? Or are we going to have an oppressive shutdown of that by outof control courts? We need to hold on to religious freedom. 
HONORING FORMER CONGRESSMAN AND CINCINNATI MAYOR TOM LUKEN (Mr. CHABOT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to honor former Congressman and Cincinnati Mayor Tom Luken, who passed away last week at the age of 92. Tom Luken was a Democratic stalwart and something of a local political legend representing the people of Cincinnati for 15 years in this body. I learned firsthand just how tough a politician he was when I ran against Tom in 1988. He won. But I also learned a great deal about Tom Luken, the man, during that race. He was a dedicated public servant who always focused on the needs of the people he represented. He was a devoted husband, father, grandfather, and greatgrandfather. As many probably know, his son Charlie was also Cincinnati mayor and also served in this body for a term. Mr. Speaker, even though we were from different political parties and disagreed on a lot of issues, I have always respected Tom for his commitment and dedication to our community and to our Nation. I hope that his wife, Shirley, and his entire family know just how much Tom Luken will be missed. 
A BETTER DEAL FOR AMERICA The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from California (Mr. GARAMENDI ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, with all the things that are happening in Washington, it is pretty easy to feel concerned and to lose faith in what it is that we are doing here. It is language, questions of racism, questions of tax policy, winners, losers. Mr. Speaker, I decided today to be optimistic, to be upbeat, and to say: Hey, there really are things that we can do if we just put our minds to it and begin to work together. Before I start these sessions on the floor, I always like to ground myself in what is it that I would like, and that I would like my colleagues, to accomplish. I always turn to Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who brought us through the Great Depression and the Great War. Etched in the marble at his memorial here in Washington, D.C., are these words: ‘‘The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much . . . .’’ I probably ought to repeat that. ‘‘The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little.’’ I always want to start with that because it grounds me as I look at the multiple opportunities we have here to do just this: add more to those who have much. For example, the tax bill that passed just before Christmas and was signed into law clearly does more for those who have much. Well over 80 percent of the $1.5 trillion—actually, far more than that—that were involved in the tax giveaway went to the superwealthy and America’s major corporations. But I said I was going to be positive and I didn’t want to drag all of us down further in that tax scam, but what I really want to talk about is what we can do to add for those who have too little. So let me start with that. My Democratic colleagues and I have been talking for the better part of 6 months now about a better deal for America, things that we can do to improve the lot of everyday Americans so we can provide enough for those who have too little. We all know that middle class America has stalled out over the last 20 years. So we set up a series of policies, programs, and legislation to improve the situation for working men and women of America, for those who clearly have too little and those who are struggling every day to meet their mortgage, keep their kids in school. So it is really about investing in America and making it in America, a series of programs and policies. I am not going to talk about all of those tonight, but I want to focus on this one: making it in America and investing in America. Before I go on to explain more about it, the rest of the program, really, is this: better jobs, better wages, and a better future. So when we talk as Democrats about a better deal, a better deal for America, we are really talking about these three fundamental things: better jobs, better wages, and, therefore, a better future for Americans. b1930 There are many different ways that this can be done. One of the principal ones is this: those of you who follow this—and I suspect there are very few of you—but if you have been following these floor sessions that I and others have been doing for the last, in this case, 6 years, we developed this little placard: ‘‘Make It In America. Manufacturing Matters.’’ It is pretty fundamental. Over the years, we have looked at the hollowing out of the great manufacturing centers of America. Some people like to say it is the Rust Belt. Well, the Rust Belt is coming back, and it can come back, roaring back, if we pay attention to the policies that create manufacturing opportunities. The President has talked about this, but, unfortunately, the policies that actually have emanated from the administration, in many cases, harm the manufacturing sectors—I am the ranking member of the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee—maritime, ocean, inland waterways, the great Mississippi, the Ohio River system, the Great Lakes of America; and, of course, the coasts; the harbors, New York Harbor; Charleston; the harbors in Florida and across the Gulf Coast; in California, the great harbors of San Diego, Los Angeles, Long Beach, and the San Francisco Bay Area; and further North, Oregon and up into Washington. These maritime opportunities are enormous. And, unfortunately, we, far too often, ignore those opportunities. And so on the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, we are trying to focus on ways in which we can actually rebuild the great American maritime industry. If you go back in the history of this Nation, back to its very earliest days, in the early policies of George Washington and Alexander Hamilton, they set out policies to encourage the maritime industry. By the way, for those of you who really want to know where the first inheritance tax came into being, it was John Adams. He actually put the inheritance tax in place to build a frigate for the U.S. Navy. So it goes way, way back. That takes me back to tax policy, and I said I wouldn’t deal with that too much, but it is hard to ignore the fact that it was a very bad tax bill for the working men and women. One of the reasons it was a bad tax bill is that we need to build our infrastructure. There is going to be a lot of talk here in the next several weeks about the President’s infrastructure plan—$1 trillion infrastructure plan. Good idea. Let’s do it. What was that movie? That famous line? ‘‘Show me the money.’’ It disappeared. It disappeared in that tax bill. Where did it go? It went to the superwealthy. Maybe they will build the infrastructure. I am sure the top 1 percent, the top 10 percent, would be 
happy to build a road if, of course, they could charge a fee to get the people who use the road to pay that fee. But that doesn’t make much sense. I will take you back to Alexander Hamilton and George Washington. They put into America’s public policy, in the very first Presidency, a road building policy, and it has, more or less, been with us over the years where the public pays for this in fees and services. But the money disappeared. It is gone. It is gone in the tax cut. It is not there. $200 billion will be discussed over the next several weeks. Where are you going to get $200 billion in this year’s budget? More than $150 billion disappeared now in the tax scam. So maybe they can find it somewhere. The military wants another $50 billion, and, of course, there are healthcare services, and there is a need for education and so forth. So here is what we can do without going into the budget bill, without trying to find new money, but, rather, to use a public policy that was first enunciated and written into law when the Arctic opened. Do you remember the North Slope of Alaska back in the 1960s, when the U.S. Government decided to allow oil drilling on the North Slope of Alaska? It was written into that law that allowed for the pipeline to be built from the North Slope down to Valdez in southern Alaska, that all of the oil that would come through that pipeline would have to be on Americanbuilt ships with American sailors. And guess what? Ships were built, mariners were hired, and oil was put on those tankers and shipped into the American ports. Later, that oil was shipped offshore to Japan. And over the years, the petroleum industry was able to whittle away at that requirement of American ships built in America with American mariners. And so today, there is no requirement that any oil developed in the United States, any natural gas developed in the United States and exported, be on American built ships. So what does it mean? It means that ships are coming into our ports to take a strategic national asset, our oil and our natural gas. It is being put on a foreignbuilt ship with foreign sailors, foreign mariners who come and go, who don’t pay taxes in the United States; ships that are not built in the United States with American steel, American made engines, and all of the electronics and pumps, and all of the other equipment, not made in America. So here is the deal. What if we decided to go back to the future? What if we decided the future ought to be like the past, and this strategic national asset be used to rebuild our shipyards, to employ our mariners, to give us in the United States the ability to build commercial ships of all sizes, and, at the same time, enhance the productivity of our shipyards as they build our U.S. Naval vessels and our Coast Guard vessels? What if we were to do that? Well, we would employ thousands of people in the shipyards; our steel companies operating, taking ore from the North, bringing it to the steel mills, manufacturing that steel for the shipyards, the engines that go into those ships— which, by the way, are maybe about a quarter of the size of this room. I mean, huge diesel engines—and all of the other pumps and all of the other equipment, what if we were to do that? Why not? What would that mean? Well, let’s see. We could make it in America, or they could continue to be built in China, Korea, India, but not in America. Here is the deal: all we need to do is to write a law. All we need to do is to go back and copy the law that was written in the 1960s that required that the oil from the North Slope of Alaska, coming down the pipeline to Valdez, be on American ships. That is all we have to do. And if we were to do that, wow, we would employ thousands of people in our shipyards. We would have thousands of men and women on those ships across the oceans delivering a strategic national asset to far places in the world, to Japan, to China, and to beyond. It is possible. Our work here is to have a better deal for America, a better deal for Americans, policies that lead to the employment of Americans, policies that help to rebuild our steel industry, that bring strength back into our shipyards so that we can provide the jobs. We are not talking about minimum wage jobs here. We are talking about jobs that are at the higher echelon of the middle wages, of middle America. We are talking about skill sets, welders, pipefitters, steamfitters. We are talking about engineers who design these ships. We are talking about marine architects. We are talking about the financing of these. We are talking about thousands upon thousands of jobs spread out across America, and all we need to do is to go back, visit the past, bring it forward into law, and make sure that a strategic national asset is used to bring jobs to America. It would be nice if 100 percent of that oil and gas were on Americanbuilt ships, but, frankly, the American shipyards don’t have the capacity to do it. Now and probably never would they have the capacity to build all of the ships that are necessary. Right now, at a facility in Texas, the Sabine Pass, a company called Cheniere Energy is shipping natural gas taken from the ground in the United States, brought to Texas, put on ships that are taking that natural gas all around the world— most of it going to Asia. That natural gas could also go to Europe, and if we were to work out a deal with the European Union and the countries in Europe, we would use that natural gas as a strategic asset to put in place in those countries of Europe that now have to depend upon gas from Russia. And let’s understand this. Russia is using their natural gas as a lever against the European Union and against the Europeans as we try to build our relationship with Europe. So how many ships are being used? Probably when that one export facility in Texas is up and operating at its full capacity, it will take over 100 LNG tankers to meet the demands of that one export facility. Now, it happens that there are five—maybe six, but certainly five—new export facilities that are being licensed around the United States: one in Maryland, not too far from Washington; another in Oregon; and others in other parts of the coastal areas of the United States. So how many ships? We don’t know for sure. But I do know this: if, over the next 10 years, we were to require that just 15 percent—well, let’s make this over the next 20 years—that just 15 percent of the expected export of LNG were to be on Americanbuilt ships, we would, in American shipyards, build at least 25 ships. And these are not small, little tugboats. We are talking about major oceangoing LNG tankers. Now, for the crude oil, if just 10 percent of the crude oil were on American built ships, by 2032, we would have 31 ships built here in America. So we are talking well over 50 ships built in the United States. To put this in context, major, deepdraft ships built in America’s shipyards over the last 3 years, the average number of ships, deep draft—these are big ships—built in American shipyards has been in the range of 10 to 12 ships. Eight of those are for the U.S. Navy; maybe three have been for the commercial fleet. So we are talking about the potential for a very significant expansion of work in American shipyards if we were to write just a couple of lines of law to require that, beginning in 2022, just 1 percent of the natural gas be on Americanbuilt ships. That would bring three ships in. And then they would ramp it up over time, increasing the percentage: 3 percent by 2026, 10 percent by 2034—that would be 16 ships—and 15 percent by 2040. So that would be 25 ships built in America carrying LNG, liquified natural gas. For crude oil, let’s start at 1 percent. That would be three ships; 4 percent by 2026, 12 ships; 8 percent by 2029, 24 ships; and 10 percent by 2032, and that would be 31 ships. This is the art of the possible. What does it mean for America? It means good middle class jobs. I will give you another example. This is a locomotive, an electric locomotive built in Sacramento. Some 70 of these locomotives were built for the railroads for Amtrak here in the East on the Eastern corridor. It took probably more than 1,000 jobs in Sacramento, California, to build these locomotives. One hundred percent American made. b1945 How did that happen? Do you remember back in the Great Recession in 2009, Congress—Democrats, without Republican support—put in place the stimulus bill, the American Recovery and 
Reinvestment Act? Some $800 million were set aside to provide locomotives for the East Coast, for the Eastern corridor. Most companies said: We don’t build locomotives anymore. So General Electric and GM just waved off the possibility. But in Sacramento, there was this German company called Siemens that was building light railcars, transit cars and the like, at a newly established plant in Sacramento, California. They looked at it and said: $800 million, 100 percent American made. We are a German company, but we are operating in America. Do you want 100 percent Americanmade locomotives, the wheels, the electrical engines, the electrical motors, all of the electronics? That German company said: Bring it on. $800 million, they signed the contract, and they produced 70, 100 percent Americanmade locomotives. So what is the point? The point is, maybe 1,000, maybe a little less, middle class jobs in Sacramento, California, and you can bet that steel wasn’t made in California. It came from the Midwest. You can bet that those wheels were made outside of California. The electric motors came in from the East and the Midwest. So this opportunity was spread out all across America. It is exactly the same if we were to require that our liquified natural gas, a strategic American asset, were exported on American built ships, and the same for the oil that comes from the Bakken up in the North and the Middle American States. All of that is the art of the possible. So we are all about doing this. We are all about making it in America. I will take a couple of seconds, and I am going to give you one more example. For those of us in northern California and anybody who wants to tour San Francisco and the San Francisco Bay Area, you will see a fabulous new bridge spanning the bay from Oakland to San Francisco. It is a beautiful bridge. However, it was a bridge that was built with Chinese steel. It was supposed to be 10 percent cheaper, so they went for the cheap, but they wound up with the crud. They wound up with steel that had weld problems and that had quality problems. It ultimately wound up to be way, way over the budget, and 3,000 jobs and a brand new, hightech, most advanced steel manufacturing plant perhaps in the world was built in China. No jobs in America, no new steel mill in America, but there was in China. That is what happens when you buy foreign. I guess New Yorkers were a little smarter than my California colleagues. So in New York, they wanted to build a new bridge called the Tappan Zee Bridge. They said: We are going to make it with American steel. It costs $3.9 billion, under budget, and there were 7,728 American jobs. It makes a difference. Public policy makes a difference. If you want jobs in America, then you set about to give Americans a better deal. Public policy and laws, that is our work. We are your Representatives. We ought to be representing you, not the Chinese steel mills. We ought to be representing you, not the shipbuilders in Japan or Korea. We should be representing you, the American people, the people who are working in the shipyards of America. The children of today’s shipbuilders need an opportunity to continue the work of their fathers and their grandfathers in America’s great shipyards. I will tell you this: our public safety, the security of America, depends upon the U.S. Navy. The U.S. Navy depends upon shipyards for their ships. The more commercial ships we build in the shipyards, the more competition there will be to build naval ships. So here it is, a better deal. This is what we Democrats are offering. We are offering a better deal. We are going to focus directly on better jobs. Tonight, we have talked about American manufacturing. We talked about making it in America. We talked about making ships in America once again. We are talking about highpaid, middle class jobs in American manufacturing, whether it is the shipyard or whether it is where these great engines are manufactured, wherever it may be in the United States. So better jobs, better wages from these highquality jobs, and, therefore, a better future for America. So here, while we spend all of our time wondering what the next tweet will be from our President, I want us also to think about the art of the possible, about legislation that provides Americans with a better deal. We will talk more about this in future days, but, right now, I want us all to think about what we can do for America so that we will have a better deal for the working men and women of America. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
