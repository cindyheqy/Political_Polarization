Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank the community of El Campo, Texas. Recently, while surveying crop damage from Hurricane Harvey in and around El Campo, two members of my staff and one USDA staffer were involved in a serious car accident. They were immediately transported to El Campo Memorial Hospital, where they received exemplary care and were later discharged. As the stories from the day later unfolded, I was struck by the outpouring of kindness and generosity of the many farmers, ranchers, and community members of El Campo. This is a town and a community that is still recovering in the wake of Hurricane Harvey—a community that has suffered tremendous losses over the past month. Yet, without a second thought, area farmers and ranchers lined up in the hospital waiting room offering spare bedrooms, meals, and transportation for my staff. These were producers who, in some cases, had never met my team, but who felt compelled to lend a hand to those in need. America is hurting right now. Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria have wreaked havoc in States and cities across our Nation; and the good citizens of Las Vegas are dealing with another disaster of a different making. Nevertheless, folks are hurting there as well. We need look no further than the compassion of those bighearted farmers, ranchers, and first responders of El Campo, Texas, to understand America’s strength and resolve. They make Texas strong. They make America strong. Together, we will get through all of our challenges. May God continue to bless Texas, and may God bless the United States of America. 
RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess until 2 p.m. today. Accordingly (at 12 o’clock and 2 minutes p.m.), the House stood in recess. b1400 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. ROEof Tennessee) at 2 p.m. 
PRAYER The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: Almighty God, we give You thanks for giving us another day. We pray for the gift of wisdom to all with great responsibility in this people’s House for the leadership of our Nation. Lord, once again, our Nation reels in grief and horror after yet another mass shooting on our soil. We ask Your blessing upon us all, but most especially on those who mourn the loss of their loved ones. Have mercy on all Your children who died. The debates will, once again, ensue. Speed us to the day when the wisdom of Solomon might inspire our congressional Members beyond the limitations of sound bites and platitudes before more and more American citizens are deprived of their lives. Lord, the suffering of our world is all around us. Stimulate our hearts and minds so that everything we may do this day would be for Your greater honor and glory. Amen. 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. 
WILSON ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. WILSON of South Carolina led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
SOUTH CAROLINA GUARD EFFORTS IN PUERTO RICO (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, our thoughts and prayers are with the families impacted by the massacre in Las Vegas. We are blessed with courageous law enforcement. I am extremely grateful to the South Carolina National Guard for sending nearly 150 engineer soldiers to assist Puerto Rico in relief efforts after Hurricane Maria. This was a devastating storm for the people of Puerto Rico, and they have been in our thoughts and prayers each and every day. These dedicated soldiers are part of a multiState engineer task force with North Carolina, Louisiana, and New York Army National Guards. They will be assisting in clearing roads, debris, and working to reach areas that have been deemed unreachable due to the storm. They will also work on restoring infrastructure. As a veteran of the South Carolina Army National Guard and the father of three sons who have served in the Guard, I am grateful that our State is able to assist the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico in their time of need. On my visits to San Juan, I have been very impressed by its dynamic citizens. I am very appreciative of the leadership of South Carolina Adjutant General Robert Livingston, the experienced South Carolina Army National Guard members, as well as the leadership of Governor Henry McMaster. In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forgot September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. 
ALL THINGS HAVE THEIR TIME (Mr. AL GREEN of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, our Nation is in mourning. Many hearts are bleeding. Mr. Speaker, there is much suffering. Lives have been lost in a senseless and needless manner in Las Vegas. Mr. Speaker, there is a right time for all things. This is a time for our Nation to mourn and for hearts to heal. Mr. Speaker, I announce that impeachment is postponed. Let us mourn, and let us heal. 
COMMUNICATION FROM THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following communication from the Clerk of the House of Representatives: OFFICE OF THE CLERK , HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , Washington, DC, September 29, 2017. Hon. PAULD. R YAN, The Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR MR. SPEAKER : Pursuant to the permission granted in Clause 2(h) of Rule II of the Rules of the U.S. House of Representatives, the Clerk received the following message from the Secretary of the Senate on September 29, 2017, at 9:53 a.m.: That the Senate passed S. 770. That the Senate passed without amendment H.R. 2519. With best wishes, I am, Sincerely, KAREN L. H AAS. f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. MCEACHIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2582 authorizes the Bureau of Land Management to process the State of Utah’s land claims without amending existing planning documents. The Utah State Enabling Act of 1894 authorized the State of Utah to select certain lands to support schools and other public purposes. Approximately 2,000 acres of authorized grants are unfilled. In 1998, the State started the application to acquire 440 acres of land in Utah County, Utah, to support Utah State University. BLM eventually rejected the application because the lands are identified for disposal by exchange, which only allows BLM to convey the land under certain conditions. This bill allows the agency to process these specific claims without updating the underlying planning documents, something that would take a significant amount of time and money. BLM testified in support of this legislation but requested an amendment to clarify that the lands will be used for Utah State University and the addition of a legislative map. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentlewoman from Utah (Mrs. LOVE), the State of Utah, and the Republican Committee staff for working with us to address these concerns. Thanks to their consideration, we were able to amend this bill in markup to address these concerns. There are many fights over public lands in this country, but this does not have to be one of them. Mr. Speaker, I support the bill and urge its adoption, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Utah (Mrs. LOVE). Mrs. LOVE. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues from both sides of the aisle for supporting this legislation. More than 120 years ago, the Utah Enabling Act, which enabled my State—now the greatest State in the country—to be admitted into the Union, was approved. This granted Utah the right to select acreage to support various public institutions, including public schools and universities. Now, 123 years later, much of the acreage made available for State selection remains outstanding. The BLM’s Pony Express Resource Management Plan governs management practices for public lands in Utah’s Tooele, Utah, and Salt Lake Counties. It has identified thousands of acres within the plan’s area as available for disposal. The State can presently obtain these lands via land exchange. However, the resource management plan does not explicitly state that these lands can be obtained using the unfulfilled land credits granted by the Utah Enabling Act. b1730 My bill, the Confirming State Land Grants for Education Act, would simply amend the Pony Express RMP to allow the State of Utah to use outstanding land grant credits to obtain lands within the limited area of RMP that already has been identified available for disposal. This solution would satisfy both the State and Federal Government and help to keep the promises made to the State of Utah for more than 120 years. More importantly, it would ultimately raise funds for the benefit of Utah students by allowing Utah’s School and Institutional Trust Lands Administration, SITLA, to manage these lands for the benefit of students. As Utah finds more ways to fund public schools and public education, this bill helps provide muchneeded resources. Notably, the passage of H.R. 2582 would not convey any land on its own. Existing conveyance processes would still apply. Additionally, my bill does not dictate land use policies once the land is conveyed. As a former mayor, I respect the State and local officials and processes, and I certainly have no desire to supersede them. My bill is merely meant to facilitate the process that enables conveyance through the use of available selection credits. It was voted out of committee by unanimous consent, and I urge this body to show similar support today. Mr. MCEACHIN. Mr. Speaker, I would just remind the gentlewoman from Utah that the only reason that she can suggest that Utah is the greatest State in the Nation is because Virginia is a Commonwealth. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, being from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2582, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
COMMUNITY RECLAMATION PARTNERSHIPS ACT Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2937) to amend the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 to authorize partnerships between States and nongovernmental entities for the purpose of reclaiming and restoring land and water resources adversely affected by coal mining activities before August 3, 1977, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2937 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Community Reclamation Partnerships Act’’. 
Except as otherwise specifically provided, whenever in this Act an amendment is expressed in terms of an amendment to a provision, the reference shall be considered to be made to a provision of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (30 U.S.C. 1201 et seq.). 
SEC. 3. STATE MEMORANDA OF UNDERSTANDING FOR CERTAIN REMEDIATION. 
(a) M EMORANDA AUTHORIZED .—Section 405 (30 U.S.C. 1235) is amended by inserting after subsection (l) the following: ‘‘(m) STATE MEMORANDA OF UNDER STANDING FOR REMEDIATION OF MINEDRAINAGE.— ‘‘(1) IN GENERAL .—A State with a State program approved under subsection (d) may enter into a memorandum of understanding with relevant Federal or State agencies (or both) to remediate mine drainage on abandoned mine land and water impacted by abandoned mines within the State.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON ) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. MCEACHIN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 
legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Pennsylvania? There was no objection. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I thank leadership for allowing H.R. 2937 to come to the floor. This legislation, introduced by my friend from Illinois (Mr. LAHOOD), will help address the challenge of abandoned coal mines present in many affected communities across the Nation. The Community Reclamation Partnerships Act enables States to partner with Good Samaritan entities to reclaim abandoned mine sites and facilitate acid mine drainage cleanup. H.R. 2937 creates more opportunities to address this challenge. Mr. Speaker, representing the Pennsylvania Fifth Congressional District, just to note, my congressional district has more abandoned mine sites than any congressional district in the country, so I am very grateful for the leadership that Mr. LAHOODhas shown in bringing H.R. 2937 forward. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this measure, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCEACHIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2937, introduced by Representative LAHOOD, is a step forward for communities looking to address abandoned coal mines in their backyards by partnering with Good Samaritans seeking to help. The Commonwealth of Virginia, my home State, estimates that it will need over $400 million to clean up all of its remaining abandoned coal mines and, while this bill is no substitute for a longterm reauthorization of the Abandoned Mine Land fund, every little bit helps. Each project funded by a Good Samaritan through this bill will help one more community make their economy stronger and their environment healthier. A hearing on a discussion draft of this bill brought a number of problematic issues to light, but I greatly appreciate the willingness of the bill’s sponsor and the majority staff of the Natural Resources Committee to reach across the aisle and work with us on a bipartisan agreement that was able to achieve unanimous consent in the Natural Resources Committee. I thank the sponsor for his diligent and collaborative work on this bill, and I ask my colleagues to support H.R. 2937. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LAHOOD). Mr. LAHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman THOMPSON and the ranking member for helping to bring this bill, in a bipartisan way, to the floor. I appreciate your support on H.R. 2937. This legislation will help address the complex legal and fundingrelated challenges for abandoned mine lands across the Nation. The Community Reclamation Partnerships Act amends the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 to enable States to partner with nongovernmental entities to reclaim abandoned mine sites and facilitate acid mine drainage cleanup across the country. Nongovernmental entities, like Trout Unlimited, have recognized the need for reclamation in coal communities and are willing to contribute their resources and expertise to address the problem. Unfortunately, liability and regulatory concerns have discouraged them from participating and partnering with the States on reclamation projects. This legislation enables nongovernmental entities’ participation in State reclamation programs by minimizing undeserved liability and codifying proven practices established by the State reclamation agencies. This legislation also addresses a frequent problem that States experience in addressing water pollution at abandoned mine land sites. States must choose between risking noncompliance under the Clean Water Act or foregoing acid mine drainage abatement projects altogether. Some States, like Pennsylvania, have successfully addressed this problem by establishing their own guidelines for the treatment of water pollution at abandoned mine land sites. These Statespecific strategies have resulted in successful water treatment projects and a significant reduction in acid mine drainage in several States. We want to replicate that across the country with this legislation. Currently, State reclamation activities have been funded solely by fees levied on the coal industry over the past four decades. These fees have resulted in reclamation of approximately $4 billion of abandoned mine land liabilities. However, according to the Department of the Interior, the estimated remediation costs exceeds $10 billion across the country. The outstanding abandoned mine land liabilities in Illinois, my home State, is $156 million; and in my district, the 18th Congressional District, it is $17 million. The cost of reclaiming these sites will continue to strain State resources in the coming decades, and the conditions of these sites will only worsen over time. In short, this bill empowers State and local community leaders who want to assist in abandoned mine cleanup efforts so that future development can occur in these areas. No group should be punished for wanting to help out their local community in a responsible way. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2937 brings more resources to bear on this considerable challenge, and I urge adoption of this bipartisan measure. Mr. MCEACHIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I would just ask my colleagues to support this piece of legislation. I am very appreciative to the author of this bill for his leadership. Having a congressional district that has significant presence of abandoned mine lands, I know that the authorities and the protections he is seeking here will be good for all, for the communities, for the environment, and for the economy. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2937. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

(6) WAIVER OF COST RECOVERY .—The Sec retary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture may waive the recovery of costs for processing recreation special use permit applications and renewals, on a categorical or casebycase basis as appropriate, if the Secretary determines that— (A) such costs would impose a significant economic burden on any small business or category of small businesses; (B) such cost recovery could threaten the ability of an applicant or permittee to provide, in a particular area, a particular outdoor recreational activity that is consistent with the public interest and with applicable resource management plans; or (C) prevailing economic conditions are unfavorable, such as during economic recessions, or when drought, fire, or other natural disasters have depressed economic activity in the area of operation. 
SEC. 11. EXTENSION OF FOREST SERVICE RECREATION PRIORITY USE PERMITS. 
Where the holder of a special use permit for outfitting and guiding that authorizes priority use has submitted a request for renewal of such permit in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, the Secretary of Agriculture shall have the authority to grant the holder one or more extensions of the existing permit for additional items not to exceed 5 years in the aggregate, as necessary to allow the Secretary to complete the renewal process and to avoid the interruption of services under such permit. Before granting an extension under this section, the Secretary shall take all reasonable and appropriate steps to complete the renewal process before the expiration of the special use permit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. LAMALFA ) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. MCEACHIN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. 
Mr. L AMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am indeed proud to present my bill today, H.R. 289, the Guides and Outfitters Act of 2017, also known as the GO Act. I would like to thank the Natural Resources Committee for its overwhelming support of this bill, which happened on June 27 of this year. Mr. Speaker, I expect that nearly every Member of this body has fond memories of being on our public lands, whether it be fishing as a kid or with your kids, hunting with friends, hiking, on a horse, or camping with the family. Outdoor activities generate not just memorable moments and a love and respect for the great outdoors but also important, considerable economic activity, which is especially important for our rural areas of northern California, where my district is, and all across our Nation. The Outdoor Recreation Association estimates that recreational activity in the United States contributes nearly $900 billion to our GDP annually, supporting about 7.6 million jobs. Unfortunately, public access to public lands is too often hindered by costly and complex permit requirements that vary from agency to agency, sometimes even crossing from agency to agency what the requirements are to seek a permit. The GO Act enhances and protects access to our public lands by streamlining Federal agencies’ special recreation permit process, moving the permit process online, and providing joint permits for activities across a combination of National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, and Forest Service land. In rural America, where rural economies often depend on annual outdoor events—some events, this might be their only event of the year, a big part of their local economy. We have that in northern California in some areas. The GO Act provides greater assurance that such activities on public lands will continue into the future. This bill also authorizes agencies to use categorical exclusions to grant annual events a streamlined review, ensuring such events don’t need expensive and duplicative studies year after year. Really, there is no need to reinvent the wheel each year for an existing permitted activity. Getting more American families and groups and clubs outdoors can only be accomplished by building a permit process that doesn’t deter outdoor enthusiasts from enjoying public lands but, indeed, makes them feel welcome and encouraged to enjoy these lands that belong to all of us. The idea behind this bipartisan bill is simple: getting more Americans outside, on their lands, for less cost, less 
money, less headache of permits, less red tape; that is really what this is about. There is no need for some of the process that people have to go through to get a permit when it is especially an alreadyknown activity with very minimal or no impact. b1745 Mr. Speaker, let’s make recreating in our public lands an open and simple experience. Once again, I urge swift passage of this bill, H.R. 289, the Guides and Outfitters Act, and I reserve the balance of my time. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON NATURAL RESOURCES , Washington, DC, July 10, 2017. Hon. K. MICHAEL CONAWAY , Chairman, Committee on Agriculture, Washington, DC. DEARMR. CHAIRMAN : On June 27, 2017, the Committee on Natural Resources ordered reported as amended H.R. 289, the Guides and Outfitters Act, by voice vote. The bill was referred primarily to the Committee on Natural Resources, with an additional referral to the Committee on Agriculture. I ask that you allow the Committee on Agriculture to be discharged from further consideration of the bill so that it may be scheduled by the Majority Leader. This discharge in no way affects your jurisdiction over the subject matter of the bill, and it will not serve as precedent for future referrals. In addition, should a conference on the bill be necessary, I would support your request to have the Committee on Agriculture represented on the conference committee. Finally, I would be pleased to include this letter and any response in the bill report filed by the Committee on Natural Resources to memorialize our understanding. Thank you for your consideration of my request and for the extraordinary cooperation shown by you and your staff over matters of shared jurisdiction. I look forward to further opportunities to work with you this Congress. Sincerely, ROBBISHOP . Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE , Washington, DC, July 10, 2017. Hon. ROBBISHOP , Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources, Washington, DC. DEARMR. CHAIRMAN : Thank you for the opportunity to review H.R. 289, the Guides and Outfitters Act. As you are aware, the bill was primarily referred to the Committee on Natural Resources, while the Agriculture Committee received an additional referral. I recognize and appreciate your desire to bring this legislation before the House in an expeditious manner and, accordingly, I agree to discharge H.R. 289 from further consideration by the Committee on Agriculture. I do so with the understanding that by discharging the bill, the Committee on Agriculture does not waive any future jurisdictional claim on this or similar matters. Further, the Committee on Agriculture reserves the right to seek the appointment of conferees, if it should become necessary. I ask that you insert a copy of our exchange of letters into the Congressional Record during consideration of this measure on the House floor. Thank you for your courtesy in this matter and I look forward to continued cooperation between our respective committees. Sincerely, K. MICHAEL CONAWAY , Chairman. Mr. M CEACHIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, this bill is an earnest effort to improve the availability of recreation permits on Federal lands. Public lands support the thriving outdoor recreation economy, and many small businesses partner with the Federal Government to provide a range of visitor services. The stated purpose of the bill is to reduce permitting time and administrative hurdles faced by permit applications. We are open to the idea of approving the permit process to ensure timely and transparent access to public lands for recreation activities and other special events. However, we are concerned that some of the methods used by the bill could lead to more problems than they solve. For example, section 2 creates a categorical exclusion for permits related to activities that have been previously considered through the National Environmental Policy Act process. Categorical exclusions are reserved for types of activities that are determined to have limited environmental impacts. They are most commonly developed through a rulemaking process which provides for public comment and provides the agency with the flexibility to determine when they are appropriate. The Forest Service already stresses the use of existing categorical exclusions for special recreation permits and does what it can with available resources to speed up permit processing times. It is unclear why this section is necessary or appropriate. If current categorical exclusions are insufficient, Congress should encourage a rulemaking process to address the inadequacies. While we have some concerns, this bill is a good first step, and we would hope our concerns can be addressed in the Senate. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the input from my colleague from Virginia, and we certainly want to have this be a process that works well. By delineating some of the categorical exclusions, we just seek to make it more usable, more userfriendly in that sense. So I thank you for the support on that. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK ), my neighbor. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 289, the Guides and Outfitters—or GO—Act, offered by my Natural Resources Committee colleague and my California neighbor, Congressman DOUG LAMALFA . For many years, we have seen increasingly severe restrictions on the public’s use of the public’s land. One of the most galling aspects of this exclusionary policy is the use of exorbitant fees to prevent many group events and small business services that have often been the economic mainstay of small mountain communities like those in my district in the Sierra Nevada. This abusive practice was made possible by the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement—or FLREA—Act in 2004. It unleashed a flood of complex rules, regulations, and court decisions that have gradually increased the cost of permit administration for the Forest Service and for the Bureau of Land Management, which these agencies, in turn, have used as an excuse to raise fees on the public to costprohibitive levels. For example, the California Endurance Riders Association have been using the El Dorado National Forest for many years. In 2009, when they sought a simple 5year, 10event permit to continue doing exactly what they had been doing without incident for decades, the Forest Service demanded $11,000 in fees. Well, they paid those fees. But the El Dorado National Forest management, nonetheless, pulled the approved permit and halted the process on utterly specious grounds. It then demanded an additional $17,000 fee, causing the Endurance Riders Association to cancel what had been a longterm civic tradition that had been a boon to the local economy. In 2010, this outrage was repeated after the group spent $5,800 for the Fool’s Gold endurance run that had been an ongoing event for more than 40 years. Hardest hit are guides and outfitters, the folks who make it possible for visitors to fully enjoy our national lands. They are the small businesses that provide specialized knowledge, skills, and equipment that new visitors just don’t possess. Both the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management have used FLREA to require these small businesses to pay for permit processing and environmental analyses that require more than 50 hours. These fees, along with complex planning requirements, have virtually shut down so many legitimate and traditional public events and uses. Efforts to encourage the agencies to modify and streamline the process have failed, even when those efforts were supported by agency policy. The GO Act is a longoverdue relief of these practices. It amends FLREA to streamline the recreation permitting process and allow for increased public access to recreational opportunities on the Federal lands. The GO Act was crafted in consultation with a wide variety of recreation groups throughout the country, and it aims to reduce the cost and complexity of these permits. Mr. Speaker, I commend and personally thank Congressman L AMALFA for listening to his constituents, the people of the Sierra Nevada, and to the thousands of recreation service providers across the country who have been begging Congress to make these changes. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure. 
Mr. M CEACHIN. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers to speak to this issue, so I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the input by my colleague, Mr. MCCLINTOCK , as well, who has lived this in some of those same Sierra counties we are talking about, and other areas in the West. So we, again, are very encouraged by the bipartisan support, the strong support coming out of committee, and that H.R. 289, the Guides and Outfitters Act, is something that will open the gateway to more enjoyment of our public lands without the constraints, such as exorbitant, extraneous fees and permits that really don’t yield any additional care for the environment or care for the area with people that are already good stewards. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. LAMALFA ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 289, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess until approximately 6:30 p.m. today. Accordingly (at 5 o’clock and 51 minutes p.m.), the House stood in recess. 
b1830 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. POEof Texas) at 6 o’clock and 30 minutes p.m. 
REPORT ON RESOLUTION PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 36, PAINCAPABLE UNBORN CHILD PROTECTION ACT Ms. CHENEY, from the Committee on Rules, submitted a privileged report (Rept. No. 115–338) on the resolution (H. Res. 548) providing for consideration of the bill (H.R. 36) to amend title 18, United States Code, to protect paincapable unborn children, and for other purposes, which was referred to the House Calendar and ordered to be printed. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained. Had I been present, I would have voted ‘‘Yea’’ on rollcall No. 544. 
MOMENT OF SILENCE IN MEMORY OF THE VICTIMS OF THE ATTACK IN LAS VEGAS The SPEAKER. The Chair would ask all present to rise for the purpose of a moment of silence. The Chair asks that the House now observe a moment of silence in memory of the victims of the attack in Las Vegas. 
SAINTGAUDENS NATIONAL HISTORICAL PARK REDESIGNATION ACT The SPEAKER. Without objection, 5 minute voting will continue. There was no objection. The SPEAKER. The unfinished business is the vote on the motion to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 965) to redesignate the SaintGaudens National Historic Site as the ‘‘Saint Gaudens National Historical Park’’, and for other purposes, as amended, on which the yeas and nays were ordered. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, as amended. This is a 5minute vote.

Had I been present, I would have voted ‘‘yea’’ on rollcall vote 544 and ‘‘yea’’ on rollcall vote 545. 
RECOGNIZING THE 125TH ANNIVERSARY OF UNALAM (Mr. FASO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. FASO. Mr. Speaker, my colleagues, today I rise to recognize Unalam, a familyrun lumber manufacturing business in Otsego County, New York, which will celebrate its 125th anniversary this year on October 4. Unalam is owned by the Van Cott family, which has established a multigenerational reputation of supporting our upstate farmers and small businesses with quality lumber products and innovations. Unalam’s journey began in 1892, when J.W. Van Cott began selling lumber in Unadilla, New York. Since then, each generation has left its mark on the family’s business. Unalam has become a renowned firm for its expert production of glulam, or laminated timber barn rafters. Today, Unalam is headed by J.W. Van Cott’s greatgreatgrandson, Craig Van Cott, and his children, Zoe Vandermeulen and Leif Van Cott. I thank and congratulate the Van Cott family as well as the past and present employees of Unalam as they celebrate this incredible milestone. 
ADDRESSING GUN VIOLENCE (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, last night we witnessed another unspeakable act of gun violence that took too many innocent lives. Today my heart breaks once again for those victims of the Las Vegas shooting and for the families whose 
lives have been irrevocably changed by this terrible tragedy. Each of them is in my prayers today. Mr. Speaker, prayers alone are not enough. We cannot, in good conscience, sit idly by as innocent people continue to die. Mr. Speaker, there are reasonable steps that we can take to make our communities safer, things like limiting highcapacity magazines and banning assault weapons—weapons, by the way, that are weapons of war and have no business being on the streets in the first place. Mr. Speaker, we have a solemn responsibility as Members of Congress to ensure that our communities are safe. Let us honor the victims of the Las Vegas shooting by doing something to prevent such tragedies from happening in the future. 
MASSACRE IN LAS VEGAS (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, as the band played the latest country western song, gunfire erupted from the 32nd floor window across the street. Twenty minutes later, when the shots stopped and the smoke cleared, 59 people were murdered and over 520 were wounded. The SWAT team quickly found the hiding place of the evil villain, and as they approached, the outlaw shot himself. Thus, he avoided a date with the hangman. Justice occurred. The casualties would have been much worse but for quick action by members of the crowd. People, including former military and offduty police officers, helped hide and cover others while endangering their own lives. The first responders, police, doctors, emergency medical technicians quickly tended to the wounded. These unnamed quick responders, both civilian and law enforcement, and medical, without regard to their own life, saved others. The band had stopped playing music, but the cries of the wounded and the tears of the mourning continue, Mr. Speaker. We must have prayers for Las Vegas, and God bless them one and all. And that is just the way it is. 
OBJECTING TO POLICY OF COLLECTING SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNT INFORMATION OF NATURALIZED CITIZENS (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, my thoughts and prayers also go to the victims of the Las Vegas shooting. Mr. Speaker, I rise to address another subject that, unfortunately, came up last week. Mr. Speaker, as one of ten naturalized United States citizens in Congress, I rise today to express strong objections to the Department of Homeland Security’s new policy to collect the social media account information of naturalized citizens. In accordance with this new rule, the DHS will include social media alongside basic information, such as biometrics, Social Security numbers, and contact information in naturalization records. This is unprecedented. There is no evidence that tracking social media accounts of naturalized citizens will in any way make the United States more secure. Rather than target naturalized citizens, the President should work with Congress to reform our immigration system and ensure that all Americans, natural born or naturalized, are able to work, study, and pursue the American Dream. f 
RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF SHAW CARTER (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life of Mr. Shaw Carter, who passed away on August 9, 2017, at the age of 24. Shaw was a rare individual who touched the hearts of many people in his life. He was a recent graduate of Young Harris College in north Georgia, and was a graduate assistant at the University of Georgia, where he was working on his master’s degree in public administration. Born with a heart defect, he underwent three open heart surgeries before his third birthday and had a heart transplant before his 21st birthday. Through the obstacles with his illnesses, he preserved and selflessly volunteered his time to uplift other kids who had other severe medical issues. For example, he volunteered over 200 hours for Mended Hearts at Northeast Georgia Medical Center. When he was awarded the Young Harris Spirit Award, he was described as the ‘‘indefatigable Shaw Carter.’’ There is no better way to describe him. He will truly be missed. 
WE MUST CONFRONT DOMESTIC TERRORISM (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, with the humblest of hearts, I cannot imagine the fear and the horror of those who heard those violent sounds late last night in Las Vegas, nor the horror of family members who had to wonder where their loved ones were or are now calling numbers to discern what happened. One of my closest relatives was in Las Vegas, and I can only imagine what they went through, as I had the great fear myself, not knowing where and what. I think the American people expect us to mourn and to honor them and to have a moment of silence, but I believe that the American people demand, and should, and those families who are now mourning, that we should be sensible. Mr. Speaker, we should not ever put on the floor of the House the deregulation of silencers. Can you imagine how many more would have died if the perpetrator who had ten guns had a silencer? We have to confront domestic terrorism. We can’t run away from it. We have to confront automatic weapons no matter what, where, and how. My prayers are with the families, but I think they demand, Mr. Speaker, action from this Congress. f 
RECOGNIZING NATIONAL DISABILITY EMPLOYMENT AWARENESS MONTH (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, October is National Disability Employment Awareness Month, and it is a time when we celebrate the numerous contributions and skills of American workers with disabilities. Many Americans with disabilities struggle to find employment opportunities despite the wealth of skills they have to offer. In 2016, only 27.7 percent of workingage Americans with disabilities were employed. More employers should recognize the fresh perspectives and skills that these men and women can add to an organization. Workers with developmental disabilities tend to be reliable, dedicated, and loyal employees with a positive attitude and a strong work ethic. Right here on Capitol Hill, my office participates in the Congressional Internship Program for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities. This program is designed to give students with varying intellectual disabilities an opportunity to gain congressional work experience, and it has been rewarding for everyone involved. Mr. Speaker, hiring an individual who has a disability can have a profound impact on their life. They experience the independence, economic self sufficiency, pride, and community that come with a job. These individuals promote workforce diversity and can truly enhance the workplace for the better. 
WITH GUN RIGHTS COMES RESPONSIBILITIES (Ms. JAYAPAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, my heart goes out to the victims and the families impacted by the horrific shooting in Las Vegas. Gun violence is a public health crisis that has claimed thousands of innocent lives, and we 
must do everything we can to address it. Mr. Speaker, the American people are tired of being outraged, of sending thoughts and prayers, of seeing men, women, and children die because the gun lobby puts profit over people. That is not what our Founders intended by the right to bear arms. With rights come responsibilities: the responsibility to stop gun sales loopholes, to enact protections that make sure our kids and those with severe mental illnesses don’t have access to guns, to address funding for mental health, and to oppose any efforts to make it easier to purchase silencers. Mr. Speaker, 87 percent of gunowners and 74 percent of NRA members support those commonsense solutions, like criminal background checks. I have a plea for gunowners across this country: urge the NRA to represent your views; show them that you mean business by speaking out or even terminating your NRA membership; show them that you care about your fellow Americans. Act now. Enough is enough. 
b1915 CANCER LINK CELEBRATES 30 YEARS (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the 30th anniversary of Cancer Link, an amazing volunteer organization dedicated to finding a cure for breast cancer and assisting those in south Florida whose lives have been impacted by this disease. Cancer Link was founded in 1987 by a small group of 10 Miami women who wanted to spread awareness about breast cancer after suffering the devastating loss of a friend. In the years since, this wonderful organization has grown into an impactful volunteer group that has supported essential breast cancer research at the Sylvester Cancer Center in Miami, Florida. The volunteers at Cancer Link have also helped provide essential community healthcare programs that ensure that healthcare for breast cancer treatment is accessible to every woman in our community. Congratulations again to all who have been a part of Cancer Link throughout the years, and thank you for 30 years of service to our community. 
CONGRESS NEEDS TO MAKE IT HARDER FOR DANGEROUS PEOPLE TO ACQUIRE ASSAULT WEAPONS (Ms. SA´NCHEZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. SA´NCHEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with great sorrow and anger. Last night, more than 58 people were tragically murdered and over 500 wounded in a senseless act of violence in Las Vegas, Nevada. The murderer was found to have 20 guns, including at least one automatic rifle. No person should be allowed to possess a weapon that makes indiscriminately killing human beings easier. It just baffles me that some of my colleagues don’t agree with that basic premise. Not only do they not agree with sensible gun control measures like background checks and no fly, no buy, they won’t even allow public research dollars to be used to research gun control and gun violence. Until Congress acts to make it harder for dangerous people to acquire these types of weapons, tragedies like this will continue to happen. How many more people have to die? How much more blood must be shed before Congress decides to act? Moments of silence and sympathy and prayers from Members of this body are not enough anymore. The time has come to act. We must act now. f 
OCTOBER IS BREAST CANCER AWARENESS MONTH (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Breast Cancer Awareness Month and all who have been affected by this terrible disease. Each October we take time to raise awareness about the threat breast cancer poses to women and men throughout the country and the world. Studies show that one in eight women across the Nation will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime and that more than 249,000 people in the United States are diagnosed each year. Roughly 1 percent of those are men. This month, it is not only imperative that we reflect upon all who are affected by breast cancer, but that we also take action to fight against it. Today I would like to recognize a courageous constituent, friend, and cancer survivor, Karen Newton. Earlier this year, I played in the Congressional Women’s Softball Game in honor of Karen’s triumph over breast cancer. Karen is a vibrant testament to the fact that strides we make in medicine are helping cancer patients and their loved ones, though I don’t think she is a very good driver. Whether it is wearing pink to raise awareness or offering support to a brave person who is fighting this disease, in October, let’s all join together to fight to end breast cancer. 
CONGRESS MUST PROVIDE RELIEF TO PUERTO RICO (Ms. BARRAGA´N asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. BARRAGA´N. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because American citizens are suffering in Puerto Rico. Twelve days after Hurricane Maria made landfall, more than half of the island’s residents are still without running water. Lowincome communities have been hit especially hard. They are trying to survive through unsafe and unsanitary conditions, where the basics of life can be impossible to find. After an earthquake struck Haiti in 2010, I was proud to see that America deployed every available resource the very next day at the crack of dawn to help out. But I wonder why the same response wasn’t deployed to help Americans in Puerto Rico. I call on the administration and Congress to ensure that Puerto Rico receives the emergency aid it needs now so we don’t lose more American lives to the storm. Congress must also provide real relief and aid to our brothers and sisters there. The situation in Puerto Rico is dire, and our fellow Americans are counting on us to act now. f 
SUPPORTING THE PAINCAPABLE UNBORN CHILD PROTECTION ACT (Mr. WALBERG asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I, along with all of our American citizens, recoil today at the senseless and evil mayhem and killing that went on in Las Vegas. We pray for the families of those whose lives were lost, as well as those who are injured and suffering right now. I, along with, I am sure, many Americans, recoil at senseless abuse of innocent animals that we love and we enjoy. But I wonder how many of us also recoil at the senseless abuse and murder of innocent babies in the womb. I stand here today to support the PainCapable Unborn Child Protection Act, H.R. 36. I support it because it is backed by science. It protects the unborn from suffering. It saves innocent lives. It promotes American values, values that made this country great, that understand the sanctity of life and the beauty of our creator’s evidence in this world today in human beings. I ask my colleagues to join with me and many others this week as we support H.R. 36, and we say to our creator and our God: Thank you for innocent life itself, and may it be preserved and protected. 
WE HAVE GOT TO DO SOMETHING TO STOP MASS SHOOTINGS IN AMERICA (Mr. ENGEL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, when will it end? When will the carnage end? How 
many more times are we going to have to turn on our televisions or our phones or get a text message to talk about some other mass shooting in America? We have got to do something to stop this now. There is no reason that someone like the killer should have automatic weapons or semiautomatic weapons. I believe people have legitimate reasons to have guns, but not legitimate reasons to have automatic weapons to mow down so many innocent people. And it will happen again and again and again, because we refuse to do anything to have sensible gun control in this country. My heart goes out to the families, but thoughts and prayers are not enough. A moment of silence in the House is not enough. We need to do something now to have sensible gun control laws; otherwise, these words ring hollow. This country is hurting, and guns are doing it, guns in the hands of wrong people. Again, guns for hunters, guns to keep people safe, I am not opposed to that, but I certainly am opposed to automatic weapons. Nobody needs automatic weapons. They are weapons of war, and they should not be in the hands of anybody who is unstable. 
CONGRATULATING HARLEY DREW ON HIS RETIREMENT (Mr. ALLEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my friend, the beloved Augusta radio host Harley Drew, on his recent retirement. He is one of the most successful and longest tenured radio personalities in the history of Georgia broadcasting. Harley was born at Fort Gordon, Georgia, and has always called Waynesboro, Georgia, home. He became interested in radio and electronics at the age of nine, and got a parttime job at WBRO in Waynesboro at the age of 14, where he worked full time after graduating from high school. Harley moved to Augusta in 1962 to help put WFNL on the air. I can remember in my high school days listening to ‘‘Handsome Harley Drew’’ on WBBQ, as he was known for playing the alltime best oldies. He is also a past recipient of Augusta’s Best Radio Personality award from Augusta Magazine, was given the Louis Harris Award by the West Augusta Rotary, and has received numerous State and national awards for programming excellence. Harley was a founding board member of the Georgia Radio Hall of Fame and also served as its vice president. In honor of his career achievements, he was inducted into the Georgia Radio Hall of Fame in 2011. Harley anchored Augusta’s morning news on WGAC until his retirement last Friday, September 29, 2017. Harley, congratulations on a remarkable career. f 
GIVE BLOOD TO HONOR THOSE AFFECTED IN LAS VEGAS (Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I don’t need to add any more adjectives or an official statement about what happened in Las Vegas last night. It has been said: horrific. What I would like to add is that we see examples of people pulling together to help each other that isn’t reported very much. In this horrific thing, giving thanks to the SWAT team who was able to put down that shooter without making it even worse, the emergency personnel, people helping each other get out of the way, hop over a fence, whatever it took, and the people who are so highly impacted in the hospitals around Las Vegas right now making heroic efforts, trying to keep up with the flow there, these are things we should dwell on. Pray for those who are gone, who are injured, who are on life support right now. Console those who are around them. And an action item we can all do wherever you are: give blood. I do, six gallon club—not to brag, but it is important. I ask all of you, if you have never thought of it before, because only a couple percent of Americans do, think about it now, and go do it. It doesn’t hurt: just a little pinprick here to test your blood, and just a little needle right here to take that allimportant pint. Just the other day, our friend STEVE  SCALISE , it is a miracle he was here on this floor. It was a miracle he got off that ballfield, because he had 18 pints, units of blood waiting for him there, a miracle he was able to even walk out of that emergency room. Give blood. It makes a big difference. 
PROTECTING THE UNBORN The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. GARRETT ). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. FRANKS ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow the House of Representatives will vote on the PainCapable Unborn Child Protection Act, and before that occurs, Mr. Speaker, I wanted to come to the floor tonight and just remind all of us that the United States of America is, indeed, a unique nation that is premised on the foundation that we are all created equal and that each of us is endowed by our creator with the unalienable right to live. But 2 years ago, Mr. Speaker, numerous video recordings were released that incontrovertibly documented corporate officers and employees of Planned Parenthood casually discussing their rampant practice of harvesting and selling the little body parts from many of the hundreds of thousands of innocent babies they are guilty of killing in their abortion clinics across this Nation every year. b1930 Now, these videos irrefutably reveal officers of Planned Parenthood haggling over the price of these little organs and body parts and casually describing ways of killing these little babies, often using much more painful methods, like partialbirth abortion, to make sure that the saleable organs of these little babies remained undamaged. One of these videos described an incident where one of Planned Parenthood’s employees calls one of the younger employees over to witness something that was ‘‘kind of cool;’’ that one of those baby’s hearts was still beating. The older employee said: ‘‘Okay. This is really a good fetus, and it looks like we can procure a lot from it. We are going to procure a brain.’’ Then, using scissors, together the two employees, starting at the baby’s chin, cut upward through the center of this child’s face and then pulled out the baby’s little brain and placed it in a container where it could later be sold. Mr. Speaker, I find it so crushingly sad that the only time this little baby was ever held by anyone in his very short life was by those who cut his face open to take his brain. Have we forgotten that, not so long ago, authorities entered the clinic of Dr. Kermit Gosnell, and there they found a torture chamber for little babies that defies, within the constraints of the English language, any description. The grand jury, at that time, reported: ‘‘Dr. Kermit Gosnell had a simple solution for unwanted babies. He killed them. He didn’t call it that. He called it ensuring fetal demise. The way he ensured fetal demise was by sticking scissors in the back of the baby’s neck and cutting the spinal cord. He called it snipping. Over the years, there were hundreds of snippings.’’ Ashley Baldwin, one of Dr. Gosnell’s employees, said she saw babies breathing, and she described one as 2 feet long, that no longer had eyes or a mouth, but were, in her words, making like, this ‘‘screeching noise.’’ And she said it ‘‘sounded like a little alien.’’ For God’s sake, Mr. Speaker, this can’t be who we truly are. The fact is that more than 18,000 lateterm, pain capable, unborn children were torturously killed, without anesthesia, in America in just the last year. Many of them cried and screamed as they died, but because it was amniotic fluid going over the vocal cords, we couldn’t hear them. It is the worst human rights atrocity in the United States of America. 
Now, I know that many of those on this floor and the American media will hold to the standard line and try to cloak all of this in the name of freedom of choice; but I would beg them, Mr. Speaker, to open their hearts and ask themselves what is so liberating about brutally and painfully dismembering living, helpless little human babies. In spite of all the political noise, protecting these little, helpless, paincapable, unborn children and their mothers is not a Republican issue, and it is not a Democrat issue. It is a basic test of our basic humanity and who we are as a human family. Mr. Speaker, the sands of time should blow over this Capitol dome before we ever give Planned Parenthood one more dime of taxpayer money. And in the name of humanity, Democrat Senators should not be allowed to filibuster the PainCapable Unborn Child Protection Act in the Senate because passing it would prevent the vast majority of these ongoing evil acts of torture against helpless, little, paincapable human babies that these videos have now shown so clearly to the entire world. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. SMITH), one of the greatest prolife champions in the history of the United States and a precious friend. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for yielding, for his passion, for his courage, and for authoring the PainCapable Unborn Child Protection Act, and for doing so so informed. TRENT  FRANKS has been an incredible defender of life, and I want to thank him for his leadership on this extraordinarily important human rights piece of legislation. Mr. Speaker, overwhelming majorities of Americans, some 60 to 64 percent, according to the pollsters, support legal protection for paincapable unborn children. Today, we know that unborn babies not only die but suffer excruciating pain during dismemberment abortions, a cruelty that rips arms and legs off of helpless children. A former abortionist, Dr. Anthony Levatino, testified before Congress, before TRENT FRANKS ’ committee. Here is a man who has performed 1,200 abortions, over 100 lateterm abortions up to 24 weeks; and he said, and I quote in part: ‘‘Imagine if you can that you are a prochoice obstetrician/gynecologist like I was.’’ Using a sopher 13 clamp with rows of ridges or teeth, ‘‘grasp anything you can’’ inside the womb. ‘‘Once you’ve grasped something inside, squeeze on the clamp to set the jaws and pull hard, really hard. You feel something let go and out pops a fully formed leg about 6 inches long. Reach in again’’—he goes on—‘‘and grasp anything you can and out pops an arm.’’ He noted that a ‘‘second trimester D&E abortion is a blind procedure.’’ So he says: ‘‘Reach in again and again and again with that clamp and tear out the spine, intestines, heart, and lungs.’’ Mr. Speaker, even swing vote Justice Anthony Kennedy, in his dissent in the Stenberg v. Carhart decision, said about dismemberment abortions: ‘‘The fetus, in many cases, dies just as a human adult or child would: It bleeds to death as it is torn limb from limb. The fetus can be alive at the beginning of the dismemberment process and can survive for a time while its limbs are being torn off.’’ Mr. Speaker, even if pain wasn’t present, dismembering a child is violence against children, and it is inhumane. But these babies actually suffer in this process. Dr. Robert White, professor of neurosurgery at Case Western Reserve, has said an unborn child at 20 weeks’ gestation ‘‘is fully capable of experiencing pain . . . without question, abortion is a dreadfully painful experience. . . .’’ Dr. Anand wrote, and he is an expert on pain: ‘‘The human fetus possesses the ability to experience pain from 20 weeks’ gestation. . . .’’ He points out that it is even worse for an unborn child at that time period because ‘‘the highest density of pain receptors per square inch of skin in human development occurs in utero from 20 to 30 weeks’ gestation. Thus, a fetus at 20 to 32 weeks’ gestation would experience a much more intense pain than older infants or children or adults.’’ We have known this for some time, Mr. Speaker. In 2006, I authored the Unborn Child Pain Awareness Act that garnered 250 votes in favor—including 40 Democrats—to 162 against. I remember thinking on that day of the vote: How can anyone refuse to make child pain information part of an informed consent? Congressman TRENT FRANKS has authored four—count them, four—extraordinarily important human rights bills over the years to actually protect paincapable babies in Federal law from the violence of abortion, including the PainCapable Unborn Child Protection Act that passed the House in 2013 and again in 2015. Tragically, President Obama vowed to veto this child protection legislation, and the Senate failed to pass it. However, this year, we have a President who said, and he put out a Statement of Administration Policy: You present this legislation to me, and I will sign it. Finally, not only will babies be protected by TRENT FRANKS ’ law at 5 months, and the pain suffered by these babies will be averted, but H.R. 36 requires that a late abortion, permitted under very limited circumstances, provide ‘‘the best opportunity for the unborn child to survive’’ and that ‘‘a second physician trained in neonatal resuscitation’’ be ‘‘present and prepared to provide care to the child’’ to the same degree as the BornAlive Infants Protection Act of 2002 prescribed. Following the care required to be rendered, the bornalive child shall immediately be transported and admitted to a hospital. Sixteen States have passed legislation that resembles this important legislation that we will have before us on this House floor. My good friend and colleague talked about Dr. Gosnell. Four years ago, Dr. Gosnell was convicted of murder, conspiracy to kill, and involuntary manslaughter, and sentenced to life imprisonment. Even though the news of Gosnell’s child slaughter was largely suppressed by the mainstream media, many of my colleagues may remember that Gosnell operated a large Philadelphia abortion clinic where women died and countless babies were dismembered, all gruesome procedures causing excruciating pain to the victim. This is a humane bill, a major human rights bill, and, again, I want to thank my great friend and colleague for his leadership. It is extraordinary. Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. HARTZLER ). Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, my dear friend and colleague, Mr. TRENT FRANKS , who is certainly a champion of our time in standing up for life, for our national defense, and has a heart so big that comes through in everything he does. And certainly, tonight, I think we see the gentleman’s heart for unborn children, certainly at the beginning of 6 months of age, who deserve to live. The gentleman’s bill, the PainCapable Unborn Child Protection Act, also known as Micah’s Law, will do that, and I urge all of my colleagues to support it tomorrow. But tonight, Mr. Speaker, I want to share with you a heartwarming story that puts a face to what we are talking about. It is one thing to say 20 weeks old, a baby, unborn baby, but it is another thing to look at the picture of Micah Pickering—and his picture is up there, as well as up front. Micah Pickering was born at 20 weeks’ gestation. He was born at the age of which we are talking about that you are trying to say we should not allow for abortions at this stage because they can live, and Micah is a living example of that. You know, I want to share a little bit about what his mother shared about his story, with Micah, her son. His mother’s name is Danielle, and she recalled that when Micah was born, he cried twice immediately, and that was music to her ears and contrary to the worst case scenarios for which Micah’s parents were bracing. This is what Danielle talked about during those first few moments. She said: ‘‘The second I was able to meet Micah changed my life. He was so small. I didn’t know what to expect. Would he look normal? Could I bond with this baby? Those questions were a mess in my head as I was wheeled into his room 2 hours after his birth. The sight I saw was a perfectly formed 
baby.’’ At 20 weeks, at the beginning of 6 months, she says he was a perfectly formed baby. ‘‘Lots of tubes and monitors all set up to be an artificial womb to this baby born too soon. My husband and I stood there just staring at this beautiful little boy who we were told we couldn’t hold, as the skin was so sensitive it would hurt him. We were told we could press lightly on the skin, so we each put our hand near him. ‘‘He’’—the baby, Micah—‘‘reached up and held our fingers. This was the strongest grasp I would ever feel. I never knew how strong a baby was until that moment. He had a powerful grip on our hands and now’’—has a powerful grip on—‘‘our hearts.’’ This little miracle baby spent 4 months in intensive care. He underwent heart surgery 2 weeks after birth, weighing a little over a pound. He was on a ventilator for a while. He was on morphine to ease the pain, and this was the size of the diaper that he wore. b1945 Isn’t that incredible? But he wore a diaper that size, and this little preemie, when he was born, he was the size of an M&M package. It is hard to believe that a baby could be that small and live, but that is about the size of a baby at this age, 20 weeks old, the beginning of 6 months, and he lived. His name is Micah. Now he is a healthy, energetic kindergarten student. Micah’s story is beautiful. It is a miracle. And we thank God for Micah’s fighting spirit, for his parents’ unwavering love for their son, and for the team of doctors, nurses, surgeons, and medical professionals who tended to Micah during those first few months. But the point about Micah is he puts a face on this that, from the moment of conception to the birth of a child, the growth and development of the baby is miraculous. With advances in medical science, we can better understand what is happening at each stage of development. When these little babies are just 4 weeks old, the basics of their nervous system are developed. By 8 weeks after fertilization, the unborn child reacts to touch. After 20 weeks, and that is the age of the gentleman’s bill, the unborn child reacts to stimuli that would be recognized as painful if applied to an adult human, for example, by recoiling. We know that by the 20th week, the beginning of the sixth month, unborn babies, children the same age as Micah when he was born, respond to painful stimuli by flinching and jerking, just like you and I would if we were burned or hurt in some way. Micah’s parents were told that they could not hold their little son, that it would be too painful for the newborn. But babies at this stage are actually hyperresponsive to pain since the neurological features that inhibit or regulate pain sensations do not develop until much later in pregnancy. Certainly, these babies should not undergo this pain and, certainly, not have to have their life snuffed out through abortion. When a mother and her unborn baby undergo a surgical procedure, doctors give fetal pain medication, or fetal anesthesia to the baby so that he or she does not feel the procedure. This is common practice. It is common sense. The legislation before the House tomorrow will ensure that unborn children are not subjected to the excruciating pain of being euthanized in the womb. And this is where I wish the story could end, that all children be given a fighting chance like Micah. But that is not the case for too many children whose lives are taken from them before they can take their first breath. Lateterm abortion procedures, abortions performed on babies 20 weeks and later in pregnancies, are graphic, detestable, and, tragically, allowed in this country. In a dissent opinion that Representative SMITH just shared, and I want to share it again, Justice Kennedy offered the insight into this grizzly practice. He said: ‘‘The fetus, in many cases, dies just as a human adult or born child would: it bleeds to death as it is torn limb from limb.’’ Aborted, unborn babies endure unspeakable pain in the most horrific manner possible. Knowing that innocent 20week babies acutely experience pain and endure inhuman dismemberment or poisoning should be enough to pierce each of our hearts and prick our sensibilities. Micah’s Law, the legislation that would protect the lives of unborn children halfway through pregnancy because of their ability to feel pain, is our call to action. In closing, Mr. Speaker, I would like to leave you with the words of Micah’s mom as she watched her tiny infant grow into the child he is today, and it speaks to the potential of every one of these children that we hope from now on will have a chance to live like Micah. She said: ‘‘He still had his eyes fused shut. You could see his chest vibrate from the ventilators. It was heartbreaking. Here was a boy who we would see get to take his first sneeze, his first smile. We would get to see the hiccups from the outside. We would watch his eyes slowly unfuse. We would watch his hair grow in and we would watch his body develop. It was indescribably the most joyful time of our life.’’ So as we anticipate tomorrow’s historic vote, I ask my colleagues to lend their support for Micah and thousands of children just like him who want to live, who want to experience life, and who have so much to give. Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. JOHNSON .) I am very grateful that you are here tonight, sir. Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressmen FRANKS , SMITH, HARTZLER , KING, and all of the others, all of my colleagues who have spent so many years working for the sanctity of every human life in this Chamber. For nearly 20 years, I have been working to defend the sanctity of every human life in the courts, and that brings us here today. You and I have talked about this many times that it is our Nation’s birth certificate, the Declaration of Independence, which states so succinctly what has been known as the American creed. And in that creed, as articulated in the second paragraph of the Declaration—we know the language well—‘‘We hold these truths to be selfevident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.’’ The reason the Founders recognized that fundamental freedom, the right to life, and recognized it first is because it is so essential to who we are as human beings. The reason the Founders recognized that and sought to put it first is because they understood, they acknowledged, that we are made in the image of a Holy God. We are made in the image of that creator who gave us those rights. And because of that, every single human life has inestimable dignity and value. And are values not related in any way to our socioeconomic status, the color of our skin, where we went to school, what we make for a living, what we can contribute to society, our talents, how goodlooking we are—totally irrelevant. Our value is inherent because it is given to us by our creator. So tomorrow, because of your hard work, we have a landmark opportunity with the PainCapable Unborn Child Protection Act. I am proud to stand in support of that bill and to assist as a cosponsor and to encourage all of our colleagues to support this important legislation. Why do we do this? Because, as has been mentioned, at 20 weeks’ gestation, a baby is developed enough to live and grow outside the womb, and at 20 weeks, a baby can feel pain. Yet, in the United States, we remain one of only seven nations on the planet—including North Korea and China, I might add— that allows abortions after 20 weeks. It is a practice that kills thousands of innocent babies each year, as we know. A law that allows someone to end the life of an unborn baby when that child can live outside the womb and feel the pain inflicted by this violent procedure is simply unconscionable. These procedures can be fatal not only for the child, by the way, but for the mother, as well, because abortion performed later in the pregnancy puts the mother at greater risk. We have to pass this bill to ensure that America leads in the fight to protect the most vulnerable among us. All life is precious, and this bill protects the life of the mother and that of the unborn child. 
For those reasons, I urge my colleagues to stand with us in support of this important legislation and to join us in the efforts to defend the defenseless. Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, I so sincerely thank the gentleman. I yield to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. KING), my precious friend. Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arizona for yielding to me, and I appreciate the years that we have sat elbow to elbow on the Judiciary Committee and on the Constitution and Civil Justice Subcommittee and have done the battle for life. What I am reflecting here, tonight, is the sequence of prolife leaders that I have had the privilege to walk these floors and halls with. When TRENT FRANKS and I arrived at this Congress, Henry Hyde had the lead, and he did so many glorious things to lay the foundation for life now. CHRIS SMITH was there at his side the full time that I was here, and then Joe Pitts. I want to remember Joe Pitts, as well, and TRENT FRANKS . So I put those four gentlemen in a category of the leaders in this movement here on the floor of the House of Representatives. I remain counting those moments precious that I have to serve and work on this cause with each of you. This bill that we will bring to the floor tomorrow on a rules vote and a final passage vote will pass this floor of the House of Representatives—I have every confidence that it will—and it will be messaged over to the Senate. There is a lot of work that has been put into this, the 16 States that have passed the legislation that is similar to H.R. 36, PainCapable Unborn Child Protection Act. I just add that, when Mr. JOHNSON  mentioned the seven countries that allow for an elective abortion after 20 weeks, of course, the United States; the other six—he mentioned a couple of them—North Korea, China, which will impose forceable abortions on mothers, that cruel and heinous activity, Vietnam, Singapore, Netherlands, and Canada. I think Canada might have been affected with the United States along the way. The Netherlands is one of the more liberal countries in the world. And this list is not a list that I want the United States of America on. I want us out. I want to be able to send this message that a baby who has a chance at survival at 20 weeks of development from conception, that at 20 weeks, that precious little baby that VICKY HARTZLER so well described in her presentation here, 65 percent of premature babies born in the range of 22 to 26 weeks will survive—65 percent. We all know one or two of those little babies who are walking around. I ran into a friend after church a couple of weeks ago at the grocery store who I hadn’t seen in several years, and I asked him how his son was doing. And I am not going to use names here on purpose. I asked him how his son was doing. He said: Oh, he is doing fine. He is 30 years old now. He has got a great job out there. He has got a family. I have got grandchildren. All things were wonderful. He knew why I asked him, because we were doing a job that he was on back then when that little premature boy was born 21 or 22 weeks old. When he came back from 2 weeks of sitting next to that child where he could come back home again and go to work because he now had a good chance that that little boy would be able to survive, I said: We will spend all kinds of money, won’t we? We will do anything. We will go to any length to keep a child alive who is born premature. A child that is born at 20 weeks, 21 weeks, 22, 23, 24, 26 weeks, there is no expense that we will spare ourselves from because that life, we know, is so precious. Well, the life in the womb is as precious as the life out of the womb, and the pain that that child feels at 20 weeks, 22 weeks, 24 weeks. But this little boy—he remembered what I said to him that day. I said: You are doing everything to save this little child’s life, but when you go into the polls and vote, you are going to vote on the other side of that issue like you always have. And he called me a name that day, kind of like the President did some of the NFL players, but he remembered exactly what I had said to him 30some years ago. And he said: You know, you really straightened me out that day— because I gave him my remarks on that. Now, that is a change in heart and a change in minds. America has undergone a change in heart and a change in minds. In fact, I stepped into a member of my staff’s office here just last Friday, and the frame of the ultrasound of his firstborn is there, and it has been there for 9 years beside his desk. That little child, that little child they first bonded with him by looking at the ultrasound. That little child, by the way, is my godson. So each one of these lives are so utterly precious, and we are not going to stop. We are going to defend every life we can. We are going to protect every life we can. We are going to do the right thing that we can for the babies that we can save. Meanwhile, this goes on the conscience of America when we fall short. But we are going to fall short tomorrow. We are going to succeed. We are going to find a way to move this legislation and others through the House and through the Senate to a President’s desk who will sign that legislation. When we contemplate the litigation that is bound to take place—because there are people that are dug in deeply on promoting and defending abortion— we are going to have a new Supreme Court. One more appointment to that Court and we will get this past them, and a number of other pieces of legislation as well. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arizona for his attention, his years of work on this very precious cause, and all of the rest who have done so much to step up and defend these lives. I am looking forward to tomorrow. There should be a great shout of joy coming off the floor of the House of Representatives. Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. BIGGS), my very good friend. Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I express my gratitude and thanks to my colleague and good friend, TRENT FRANKS , for yielding and for his leadership and tireless work on behalf of the unborn. Congressman FRANKS ’ fight to save each and every life is one that we should all be championing, and I am proud and pleased to be standing by his side today. I am grateful that I have had the opportunity to fight for the unborn in venues around the world at various multilateral institutions standing on behalf of the unborn. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a proud cosponsor in support of H.R. 36, the PainCapable Unborn Child Protection Act. If signed into law, this legislation will prohibit abortions starting at 20 weeks, almost 5 months, in all 50 States. The proabortion lobby will tell you to disregard the rights of unborn children, but science shows that they are just as human as you and I. In fact, emerging science has proven that babies feel pain inside the womb as early as 20 weeks old. In cases of fetal surgeries occurring after the 20week mark, anesthesia is regularly administered to the fetus to protect against fetal pain. Doctors have also experienced babies born prematurely at or near 20 weeks who experience pain in the same way that a full term baby or an adult would. It is inhumane to subject these innocent beings to that gruesome practice of abortion, knowing full well that they will feel every painful moment. b2000 Mr. Speaker, I think about my own children and how excited my wife and I were throughout her pregnancies. Even without today’s developed science, we knew that our children were special, that they were alive, that they were helpless, and that we had the responsibility for their safety and wellbeing in the womb. We never would have intentionally caused pain or harm to any of our unborn children. But by allowing this practice to continue, we are not only torturing these helpless babies who will be dismembered limb by limb, we are also ending their lives. They will never realize their Godgiven potential on this Earth. They will never be mothers, wives, husbands, and fathers. They will never be siblings. They will never be able to fulfill the measure of their creation. Their last memory will be filled with great agony and distress. 
Mr. Speaker, there is nothing that we do in Congress that will have efficacy if we choose to fail to protect the most innocent among us. If, at the very least, we cannot defend those who feel pain, then we are unworthy to lead this Nation. We have a great responsibility and charge to protect these children, and we will not fail them. Please vote ‘‘yes’’ tomorrow. Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his remarks. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. JENKINS ), and I thank him for coming to the floor tonight. Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arizona and all those who have spoken, obviously, so emotionally and so passionately about protecting the unborn. Mr. Speaker, I am a proud cosponsor of H.R. 36. I am a strong believer in the sanctity of life. I believe each and every person, born and unborn, is a child of God. Our children are our future and a gift to all of us, and respecting the right to life is one of the strongest values we hold as Americans. That is why I come to the floor today to urge my colleagues to support the PainCapable Unborn Child Protection Act, which would stop lateterm abortions. Studies have shown that unborn children can feel pain in the womb 20 weeks after pregnancy, an agonizing fact with disturbing indications that we know that this is a gruesome act against the unborn. As a proud father of three, we know, when those babies come into this world, that their cries are cries of joy; it is a cry of life. That is what we are protecting. No child of God should be subjected to the torturous pain that comes as a result of a lateterm abortion. Mr. Speaker, it is clear that my constituents sent me to Washington to promote a culture and respect for life. They know as well as I do that it is vital for us to fight for those who have no voice and cannot be heard. This bill shows the world that America will stand up to protect the most vulnerable amongst us. I strongly urge my colleagues to support the passage of the PainCapable Unborn Child Protection Act. Let this Congress and the vote of each and every Member be known as the one who stood up for life by speaking out against the horrors of abortion. Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his remarks. It is now my honor to yield to the honorable gentlewoman from South Dakota (Mrs. NOEM). Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his leadership on this piece of legislation, which will, quite literally, save lives. I am so grateful that we are having this debate on the House floor at this point. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 36, the PainCapable Unborn Child Protection Act. I believe that every life, including an unborn baby’s life, has dignity and value. But more than 40 years ago, the Supreme Court handed down a decision in direct contradiction to those principles. In the decades since, I have joined with many families and my colleagues in the House and many across the Nation fighting to undo the damage that has been done. We have got a long way to go in this country, but the passage of H.R. 36 would be a step in the right direction. A strong and growing body of medical research provides evidence that pain receptors develop in unborn babies at no later than 20 weeks. Medical professionals have testified about seeing babies that age recoil from painful stimuli. Others have been able to measure increases in stress hormones when babies inside the womb are subjected to pain. If fetal surgery is performed, that baby is given anesthesia in many cases to shield them from the pain of surgery. Yet our Nation’s laws allow for these babies to endure the pain of a lifeending abortion. It is absolutely heartbreaking. My husband and I knew that our lives had completely changed the minute that we heard our oldest daughter’s heartbeat. I will never forget that moment. I hope that she knows how proud we are of the generous and compassionate person that she has grown up to become. She has grown up quickly, and I love to think back about those days when she was still a little girl and when she wasn’t much taller than I. We read a lot back then. We read books. We read the Bible. One of her favorite books was Dr. Seuss’ book, ‘‘Horton Hears a Who!’’ which says: ‘‘A person is a person no matter how small.’’ Each time we read that line, I thought back to those first moments when I heard her muffled heartbeats and thought about Kassidy and thought about ‘‘a person is a person no matter how small.’’ I had that blessed moment three different times with my three different children, and I pray every day that each and every baby’s heartbeat would be heard by parents who understand the gift that that life is from our God who loves them dearly. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to defend the smallest among us this week and pass H.R. 36, the PainCapable Unborn Child Protection Act. I thank the gentleman for his leadership. Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, I sincerely thank the gentlewoman for her remarks. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. N ORMAN ). Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my colleague from Arizona’s bill, the PainCapable Unborn Child Protection Act, as well as the rights of the unborn. As a father of 4 children and a grandfather to 15 grandchildren, I strongly believe that life begins at conception. I wholeheartedly feel that nothing is more precious or beautiful than a life. I will do everything in my power to continue to advocate for those who cannot advocate for themselves. Since the passage of Roe v. Wade in 1973, nearly 60 million abortions have been performed. Mr. Speaker, this is a moral atrocity. I am a proud cosponsor of H.R. 36, which would make it illegal to attempt or to perform an abortion if an unborn child is 20 weeks or older with exceptions. Science has proven that babies are capable of feeling pain at the start of the third trimester. It is imperative that we protect the lives of the unborn. Our Nation was built upon the idea of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We guarantee that every American citizen has a right to pursue absolute happiness. Our Constitution guarantees that every American has the right to liberty and justice. Should we, as Americans, not guarantee that every American has a right to life as well? Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill and the protection of the sanctity of life for all Americans. Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman very sincerely for his remarks. I am glad he came this way here recently. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BABIN). Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my very good friend, TRENT FRANKS , for yielding to me and for providing the leadership in the prolife movement. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 36, the PainCapable Unborn Child Protection Act. As a proud father of 5 and a grandfather of 13, I firmly believe that the value of an unborn life cannot be understated. H.R. 36 takes a crucial step to ensure that we protect thousands of innocent lives every year. Scientific evidence clearly demonstrates that unborn babies feel pain by at least 20 weeks of age. By 20 weeks, an unborn baby is so developed that he or she can hear and respond to sounds. Ending these lives through abortion is both cruel and inhumane. There is no excuse. Our Nation must do better. We should not be one of only seven countries—including North Korea, Vietnam, and China—to have elective, ondemand abortion after 20 weeks of development. This is an abuse of the basic human rights, and it is unacceptable in the eyes of God and by any standard of human morality. As Members of Congress, it is our duty and our moral obligation to pass H.R. 36 so that we may protect those who are the most defenseless. Mr. Speaker, our Declaration of Independence guarantees all Americans enjoy the unalienable right of life, and that includes the unborn. Thanks to incredible advances in modern medicine, babies born at 20, 21, 
and 22 weeks of age are able to survive. Our medical community strives to save and protect these premature babies, yet, in an inconsistent fashion, current policy permits aborting a child at that exact same stage of development. Mr. Speaker, the sanctity of every human life must be protected. This bill affirms the humanity of the unborn while curbing the inhumanity of abortion. God knows that it is time that we hold abortionists who perform these lateterm abortions accountable for their abhorrent actions. Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, I thank my very good friend from Texas very much for speaking on the floor tonight. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. BANKS ). Mr. BANKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I thank my distinguished colleague for yielding. I, too, rise today in strong support of H.R. 36, the PainCapable Unborn Child Protection Act. This bill would prohibit any elective abortion attempt of an unborn child who is 20 weeks or older, the age at which research shows children are able to feel pain. I think it is worth noting that this landmark legislation is projected to save between 12,000 and 18,000 lives each year. These are individuals who will become fathers, mothers, technological innovators, servicemembers, and hardworking contributors to our great Nation. Ten years ago, studies began to emerge proving that an unborn child is able to feel pain as early as 20 weeks postfertilization. So as our Nation’s understanding of fetal pain has become more advanced, protections for pain capable unborn children have been signed into law in 20 States, including my home State of Indiana. But that is not enough. Despite claims from many proabortion groups, lateterm abortion is neither safe or, unfortunately, rare. As recently as 2014, it was estimated that 430 abortion facilities in the United States were willing to perform abortions on unborn children 20 weeks or older. This sort of lateterm abortion—at the point when the child can actually feel the procedure—will continue to happen without a Federal prohibition. Sixty percent of women, 56 percent of Independents, and 46 percent of Democrats support this sort of legislation. It has broad public support. Let’s ensure that all 50 States have protections for vulnerable paincapable unborn children. I have advocated for these protections my entire career, from the State house in Indiana to here in the United States Congress. That is why today I express my strong support for the passage of H.R. 36, the PainCapable Unborn Child Protection Act, introduced by my distinguished colleague, Congressman TRENT  FRANKS of Arizona. I urge my colleagues tomorrow as well to support this important legislation. Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman BANKS very much for his remarks. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the distinguished gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. ROTHFUS ). Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, preborn babies feel pain. The medical field has found clear evidence that preborn babies have the capacity to feel intense pain at 20 weeks. b2015 That is what this legislation is about. When a child’s body is gruesomely dismembered, they feel pain. When the abortion doctor attempts to use a ‘‘less crunchy technique’’—as we learned in last year’s abhorrent videos about Planned Parenthood, which was their words—to procure more intact body parts, they feel pain. Mr. Speaker, I shudder to think of the millions of lives taken from this world in such a gruesome and violent manner. Equally disturbing is the thought of how much pain has been endured by millions of preborn babies whose lives have been cut short since Roe v. Wade. We must do more to promote a culture of life in this country. We must do more to lessen a culture of violence. That is why I rise today in strong support of the PainCapable Unborn Child Protection Act. By acknowledging that babies feel the pain of abortion at 20 weeks, this legislation affirms the inherent humanity of the most innocent—unborn babies—in our country. To add to that, this legislation also includes protections for babies that survive an attempted abortion. It ensures that children who do survive and are able to continue to live outside the womb are given the immediate medical attention they deserve so that they have a chance to live. With growing developments in the medical field, children are able to survive outside the womb at earlier points in pregnancy. Such was the case for Micah Pickering, for whom this legislation is name for. Micah was born at 20 weeks’ gestation and is now a healthy 5yearold. The Congressional Budget Office recently reported that approximately 2,750 lives per year will be saved through this bill. That is 2,750 girls and boys; daughters and sons; brothers and sisters; and not medical waste, like opponents of this legislation would like you to believe. The United States is only one of seven countries, including North Korea and China, that allow abortion after 20 weeks. Are we really that kind of Nation? Does our Constitution not grant all Americans the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, no matter how small or seemingly insignificant they are? Mr. Speaker, this is commonsense legislation. I urge every single Member of this body to take a deep look inside themselves and ask if they support not only inflicting pain on unborn babies, but also denying these innocent babies their constitutional right to life. I thank my colleague, the gentleman from Arizona, for his leadership on this important issue. If you want to stand for a culture of life, vote for this bill. If you want to take a stand against a culture of violence, vote for this bill. I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation. Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I simply say that sometimes I think we kind of get caught up in things and we grow used to something that otherwise would horrify us. Before the sun set this evening, we saw 3,000 unborn little Americans die a tragic and lonely death. That is in the land of the free and the home of the brave. Mr. Speaker, each time that took place, not only did a nameless little baby die a lonely and tragic death, but the mother was never the same again. All the gifts that that child might have brought to this world are now lost forever. So, Mr. Speaker, I pray that somehow in this debate we would put aside which people are right and ask: What is the right thing for America? The very creed of this country is the notion that all of us have the Imago Dei, or the image of God, stamped on our souls. If that is true, Mr. Speaker, then there is a far greater question here than we can ever imagine. Mr. Speaker, I think if we ask ourselves the truest and deepest question, then perhaps we will begin to see the winds of change begin to blow in this country. That is very simply without all of the rationalization, without all of the gotchas and the whatifs and the avoiding of the subject, and if we just ask ourselves one basic question: Does abortion kill a little baby? If it does not, Mr. Speaker, then I sincerely am one that can get up out of this Chamber and never speak of it again. But if abortion really does kill a little human child, then those of us standing here in the seat of freedom, the greatest Nation in the history of the world, also stand here in the midst of the greatest human genocide in the history of the human family. Mr. Speaker, that is not what we are called to do in this world, as the greatest Nation that ever had the chance to exist on this Earth. Mr. Speaker, I hope that, as we debate the bill tomorrow, we can put aside anything but the truth and just examine in our own hearts who we really are. If we do that, I believe we will pass the PainCapable Unborn Child Protection Act on October 3, 2017. By the grace of God, it will go over to the Senate and they will find a way to bring this bill to the floor and send it to President Trump, who I have every conviction will sign the bill, and for which I am very grateful. Mr. Speaker, God bless America, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my friend and colleague 
TRENT FRANKS for his hard work on this important issue. I rise today in support of the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. Children are gifts from God—before and after they are born. They are tiny humans with endless potential and complete innocence. This bill would stop the practice of ending these precious lives after 20 weeks of pregnancy, except in cases of rape or incest or necessity to save the mother’s life. Similar laws have been passed in about 16 states, and this Chamber passed similar legislation in 2015. The United States is 1 of only 7 countries that does not ban abortions of these 20weekyearold unborn babies. Science indicates that, at about this age, these children have the physical structures needed to feel pain. We do not want anyone to have an unwanted pregnancy, but we want mothers to know that abortion is not their only option. And we want these children protected from pain and harm. Mr. Speaker, it is time to protect our Nation’s most innocent from inhumane suffering and premature death. 
CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS: GOVERNMENT’S RESPONSE IN NATURAL DISASTERS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Ms. PLASKETT ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. 
Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands? There was no objection. Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, it is my great honor to rise today to anchor this CBC Special Order hour. Today, Monday, October 2, members of the Congressional Black Caucus will be speaking on the floor about the devastating impact of natural disasters, particularly hurricanes, and the critical role of the Federal Government’s response. In the wake of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and now Maria, the Federal Government has already deployed assets to affected regions, from HHS public health resources, the Coast Guard, the Urban Search and Rescue Task Force, to Corps of Engineers floodfighting projects. In the coming weeks and months, additional resources will help shelter displaced Americans and get businesses back on their feet. Congress must also ensure that the Federal response to these disasters is just and equitable, and that communities of color are not directly or indirectly harmed by recovery efforts. During this time, we will hear from other members of the Congressional Black Caucus and its friends to discuss this issue. For the next 60 minutes, we have a chance to speak directly to the American people on issues of great importance to the Congressional Black Caucus, Congress, the constituents we represent, and all Americans. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PAYNE ), from the city of Newark. Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands, Congresswoman PLASKETT , for hosting tonight’s Special Order hour on the Federal Government’s response to natural disasters. I believe that Ms. PLASKETT and the experience that she has had in her homeland can open our eyes to the devastation that has taken place in the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico as well. It is unthinkable what these American citizens have been through over the last several weeks and will continue to suffer for months into the future. Before I begin, I have a message for the families and the friends of the 58 innocent people whose lives were taken and the more than 500 who were injured in Las Vegas overnight: The country’s compassion and thoughts go out to you. Our hearts break with yours. For those injured, know that the American people are praying for your recovery. To the first responders who put their lives on the line daily: Thank you. What went down in Las Vegas last night was an act of terrorism. There is no other name for it. A deranged man with a small arsenal of firearms in a hotel room shot into a crowd of people at a concert. For an hour and 12 minutes, people watched the chaos unfold. All the moments of silence in the world won’t change what happened last night in Las Vegas, last year in Orlando, the year before in Charleston, and the list goes on. Moments of silence used to be for showing honor or respect. There is nothing honorable about keeping silent and doing nothing to prevent gun violence. There is nothing respectful about rejecting every single reasonable gun bill proposed in the past decade. What kind of Nation are we when we sacrifice human lives on the altar of the gun lobby? The time to act was yesterday. The Federal Government has a moral duty to protect the welfare of American citizens before tragedy strikes. Yet, when the news moves from one disaster to another, we often suffer a sort of amnesia. We don’t seem to remember or learn from our mistakes. We forget to fix the problems our citizens call us about every single day, and the problems inevitably repeat themselves. One issue we seem to have repeated amnesia about is the high cost our constituents face when evacuating disaster areas, particularly after hurricanes. We read reports that, due to reduced capacity and high demand, flights are full or tickets are prohibitively expensive. Even if the airlines capped flight prices, like they did last week, Federal taxes and fees can increase the price of an evacuation by 20 percent. Recently, this hit home for me. One of my district staffers had family stuck in Puerto Rico. Because Hurricane Maria knocked out power and the telephone lines, my staffer had no way of knowing whether her loved ones were alive or dead. Many constituents have contacted our offices to let us know the difficulty they were having in trying to find out whether their loved ones were safe or not and how we could help. She tried to get in touch with her family for 8 long days before hearing that they were okay. Then, when my staffer tried to book a flight for her family to get out of Puerto Rico, the only tickets available were for first class. First class. That is over $700 on a flight full of disaster evacuees. My D.C. staff did a little digging. Here is what they learned. The American people rely on the goodwill of the airlines to cap the prices of flights from disaster areas. The airlines decide when to start the cap and when to end it. b2030 The airlines decide whether to keep selling first class tickets, and the Federal Government never stops charging taxes on flights from disaster areas. American citizens deserve better, Mr. Speaker. That is why, starting this week, I will be introducing a series of bills to ease the financial burden Americans face when escaping natural disasters. The humanitarian flight fairness package will do four things. First, it will allow the Secretary of Transportation to declare an aviation humanitarian crisis at specific airports covered by a Presidential declaration of emergency. Second, it will allow the Secretary of Transportation to mandate that airlines charge no more than the median fair price of all seats sold on that route in the prior calendar year. Third, the package would require the FAA to waive the $5.60 passenger facility charge during an aviation humanitarian crisis. And fourth, the package would require the FAA to waive the U.S. international transportation tax, which is $18 on a flight from Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. American citizens, Mr. Speaker. Too often Congress reacts to crisis. It is time for us to be proactive. It is time for us to legislate before another disaster strikes. The humanitarian flight fairness package is a commonsense solution to a problem that directly affects our constituents. Mr. Speaker, I always try to deal in common sense. As a matter of fact, I have a constituent back at home who constantly reminds me of how shallow I am, so I can do nothing but rely on common sense based on this constituent’s feelings about me. 
I want to thank the congresswoman again for hosting this Special Order hour, and I look forward to continue working with her as she addresses the issues faced by Americans affected by natural disasters, whether it is on the mainland or in the territories. They all are American citizens. When it benefits this Nation to have Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands be a part of the United States, it does not hesitate. But when these American citizens are in trouble, they deserve the same rights that every American citizen benefits from in this great Nation—and it is great, and we want to continue to make sure that it remains great. I continue to make the point, Mr. Speaker, that these are American citizens we are talking about. This is not foreign aid. This is not mutual aid. This is aiding American citizens in trouble, in disaster, in peril, no insulin for diabetics, no dialysis for kidney patients in two or three weeks. That is a death sentence, Mr. Speaker, and we cannot allow it to continue. Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. PAYNE , my colleague, for those sentiments and that support to the people of the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico and to all the people of the Caribbean region. I am grateful for his empathy, for his support, the support of his constituents, as well as all the Members who have reached out to the Virgin Islands in these last several weeks. The islands have been struck by something that is nothing less than cataclysmic in many respects, particularly in a time of year when we are preparing for what is right now our only viable and large industry, the tourism industry. We have lost that for this year. We have lost that on all of the islands, all of the regions at this time. I know that so many of you have seen and expressed—so many Members on both sides of the aisle have come up to me and said, or texted or called and said, that they are there for me, and I am going to hold them to that. I am going to hold them to that because what we are facing in the Virgin Islands, I feel guilty right now—and I told my staff—being here, having air conditioning, sitting in a room. I feel guilty because I know what the children of the Virgin Islands are going through right now. There is no air conditioning. There is no light on the islands right now. Many of the people, many of the communities are in utter darkness, and as the heat rises with the amount of moisture that is in the air, we know that there will be health hazards that are about to happen in terms of mosquitoes, with dengue, chikungunya, and all other kinds of diseases that are going to be occurring. Mr. PAYNE. Will the gentlewoman yield? Ms. PLASKETT. I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey. Mr. PAYNE. Let me just say in terms of your guilt. It is not a guilt. It should not be guilt. It is an obligation for you to be here in the people’s House to represent your constituents here, to be their voice. That is why they sent you here to Washington. So do not be guilty about doing the job you have been sent to do. Ms. PLASKETT. I know that that is why I am here because I need to be their voice, because they are voiceless right now. If you look on national media, you hear about what is happening in Puerto Rico, and, Lord knows, I feel for our fellow islanders, our brothers and sisters over there, but very rarely do you hear about what is happening in the Virgin Islands. On September 6, Hurricane Irma, one of the most powerful Atlantic storms this century, destroyed the islands of St. John and St. Thomas, the islands that are part of the district that I represent. Three weeks later, the island of St. Croix was devastated by Maria, a second Category 5 hurricane ripping through the U.S. Virgin Islands in less than a month. Both Hurricanes Irma and Maria have wreaked havoc in the U.S. territories of the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and other Caribbean nations. We forget that there are other places in the Caribbean that have also been struck, St. Martin and Sint Maarten, Barbuda, Anguilla, our very close neighbors, the British Virgin Islands, Tortola, Anegada, Virgin Gorda, Jost Van Dyke, places that Americans love to go to, to vacation, to enjoy themselves, not thinking about the lives of the people that are there or not there anymore. We know that right now the island of Barbuda is without an inhabitant, without an inhabitant in centuries. There is no one on Barbuda after the hurricane. Turks and Caicos, Guadeloupe, Montserrat, one that also strikes me is Dominica. Dominica was not hit by the first Hurricane Irma, and that little island nation reached out to the U.S. Virgin Islands, reached out to Puerto Rico and said: We don’t have much, but we are going to give you the money that we have. We, as a government, will give you 200,000. We will bring relief. We will bring whatever we can. And 2 weeks later, Hurricane Maria struck them and has devastated that island. Their Prime Minister went to the United Nations a week ago and begged, begged the support of the free world, begged the support of the members of the United Nations to support them. Although the full extent of the two hurricanes’ impact has yet to be assessed, it is clear that, in the Caribbean, the damage from these storms appears to be unparalleled. President Trump issued major disaster declaration for the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. Dozens of deaths and hundreds of injuries have been reported alongside widespread infrastructure damage all throughout the Caribbean. I received a text just this morning from members of my family who are still looking for loved ones on the island of St. Croix. That is why, in the days and months ahead, we must continue to work together to ensure that the individuals and families impacted by these devastating storms receive all the aid they need. The catastrophic destruction caused by Hurricanes Irma and Maria demands massive amounts of aid to address the overwhelming needs of the countless victims who now face the daunting task of rebuilding their lives. FEMA has been on the ground in the Virgin Islands even before Irma hit the islands of St. John and St. Thomas. There are now more than 12,600 Federal staff engaged in response and recovery operations from Hurricanes Maria and Irma in the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, representing nearly three dozen departments and agencies. Storms of this magnitude require the full attention and support of the entire Nation. The people of the Virgin Islands have lost their homes and possessions. Businesses have been lost alongside hospitals, schools, utility systems, and other vital infrastructure. To give you an example, after Irma, Roy Schneider Medical Center, the only hospital on the island of St. Thomas, was partially destroyed, its roof ripped off, its walls caved in, windows blown out. Patients needed to be evacuated to the island of St. Croix and to San Juan to be at Juan Luis Hospital on St. Croix and additional hospitals on San Juan, as well as the veterans facility there. Of course, people were thinking that St. Croix, after Irma, would be the base. As people on St. Thomas and St. John were reeling from the devastation of Irma, post offices were gone, schools annihilated, mud slides began after additional rains, people in Coral Bay on St. John felt lost, isolated, trapped. Many people had days, almost weeks before they could get out and be in the rest of the public population. When Maria came, Maria struck what we thought would be our base camp, the island of St. Croix, and as luck would have it, the only functional hospital left in the Virgin Islands, the hospital of Juan Luis was breached by Hurricane Maria and has now been condemned by the Army Corps of Engineers. What facility will Virgin Islanders use? Will we continue to be in tents manned by the brave men and women of our military who have come down to support us? Will we operate from an operating room, an emergency room in a box, what they have given us thus far? That can’t be. We have one functioning operating room that is being held together by the good graces and MacGyvering of the men and women of Juan Luis Hospital right now. Should that be for American citizens? I went on distribution lines. I went to grocery stores where people were waiting for hours. I am telling you hours— 3 hours to get gas; 3, 4 hours, the entire time of a curfew, to go on a distribution line to get a couple of packs of 
water and some MREs for a family, standing out in the hot Caribbean sun. People were sharing umbrellas, sharing water, singing with each other trying to keep their spirits up. I met a man who had his veteran’s cap on, Vietnam vet, people who are members of The American Legion and asking me: ‘‘I fought for this country; I am an American citizen; do they think about us? I have not seen us on the news. My family tells me that we are not on the news,’’ because, of course, his TV is not working, because almost all of the Virgin Islands is in darkness. b2045 We have been able, through the valiant effort of our water and power authority and the linemen and others who are out there, to bring power to critical structures; to our government house; to the main blocks in Christiansted; to parts of Charlotte Amalie, the capital of the Virgin Islands; to the airport so that relief planes can come in and out. That is who is in light right now. But for so many others and children right now, it is darkness for them. The couple of hours that they have outside of the curfew are to be making the rounds to get ice, to keep insulin refrigerated in their homes, to keep milk for children and formula for babies cold before it goes bad. That is the daily struggle now of Virgin Islanders, American citizens, veterans, people who pledge their allegiance to this flag, people who are proud to say that they are American citizens. As we saw on the mainland in the United States following Hurricanes Katrina, Sandy, and, most recently, Harvey, Americans need to come together again with compassion and care. I have heard commitment from the President and my colleagues in Congress to the U.S. territories receiving the support they need. Moving forward, I am hopeful, but vigilant, and I will make sure that they keep to their promise and their commitment that President Trump and this Congress delivers on the promises to support their fellow Americans in the Caribbean region. This is a plea by me on behalf of my people to keep us in your thoughts, prayers, and support in the coming months and years. May our collective attention span endure enough through the constant new cycle so that we can come together to move beyond relief to healing and prosperity. This is an opportunity. I keep trying to tell our young people on the islands who are in despair, who have low morale, that this is an opportunity for us to leapfrog technology, to create the kind of Virgin Islands, for the Virgin Islands to be the beacon in the Caribbean region, the beacon of what American might can do when it does what it is supposed to do. It is this Congress’ constitutional responsibility to the territories. The benign neglect that this Congress has gotten away with for the last 100 years needs to stop right now. They need to stop wagging their finger and telling Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands that they have not done what they are supposed to do when this Congress knows that they are not doing the right thing by those territories. Our formulas are different. The money that we receive is different. We get the short shrift on every bill that comes on this floor. Yet, still, you expect us to stretch that out like the poor stepchild that you think we are to make do and keep quiet. But it is going to stop right now. We cannot be quiet anymore, because not only are we hungry, 30 percent of the children of the Virgin Islands live in poverty, but now we are blind as well. There is no cell reception in most of the areas of the Virgin Islands. While I was down there last week, my staff and I roamed the islands with our cell phones, sitting in bypasses, sitting in areas with others, trying to get a signal to plead with the National Security Council, plead with FEMA, and others to do the right thing by the Virgin Islands. Given the enormity of the challenges ahead, the Virgin Islands will require the coordinated and sustained financial commitment of the United States. For this reason, I ask that Members of Congress fully support inclusion of funding in forthcoming disaster supplemental packages that will aid in shortterm as well as longterm relief, recovery, and reconstruction of the Virgin Islands. The international community, including the United States, has an obligation to work with affected governments to restore infrastructure, provide critical relief, and help recovery and build back our islands. We must act quickly to save lives, ensure that those in the Virgin Islands are back on the road to swift recovery. Listen, I know we are hearing that FEMA is on the ground, that supplies are there, and that things are moving along. I must admit, FEMA is on the ground. I see the supplies in the cartons, in the containers on our ports, and I hear the discussions at daily briefings that go on at our local emergency management system to how they are working hand in hand with FEMA. I believe that the Army Corps and the Department of Defense and FEMA are there and they want to lend a hand. But something is not working, whether it is in the local government, a dysfunction there, or dysfunction in communications, or dysfunction at the highest levels of the Federal Government. Because when I go to neighborhoods like Whim, when I go to Tutu High Rise, when I go to Coral Bay, when I go to Hannah’s Rest, when I go to Frederiksted and talk with people and they tell me they haven’t had water in a week, something is wrong, and something needs to be done by this Congress that has the responsibility for the Virgin Islands. How can a child in the United States say that they don’t have water? How can a child in the United States say that water is streaming over them because many of the roofs in many of these areas are completely gone? So what I wanted to do was to walk the Members of Congress and you, Mr. Speaker, through the destruction that I have seen with my eyes in the Virgin Islands. What you see right here is a home. This is a private homeowner’s home completely gone. It looks like a construction site. It looks as if they are trying to start building when, in fact, this was someone’s home before. Additionally, this is another home that now looks like a construction site that people are living in. People can no longer be here. They have abandoned— they have had to leave this home. I have additional things that I would like to show you. This is a line right now of people to fill up some containers with gas so that they can keep generators going for a couple of hours a day so that their children can read, so that they can wash themselves, so they can find out what is going on in the outside world. People can listen to a radio to find out what is not being said about them by others. Here is another home in the Virgin Islands. This is the kind of destruction that took place on the islands that I represent, the islands that are my home. This is all of St. John. Our transportation system between the islands has been completely obliterated. This is a ferry that was used between St. Thomas and St. John to bring goods, to bring people between those islands. The islands of St. John, Cruz Bay, Chocolate Hole, and Coral Bay now feel cut off, left out, because the ferry system has been down for many weeks. Look at this. This is what is happening in the Virgin Islands right now. This is the main street in Christiansted. If you look over here, this is the government house, and this is what our roads look like after the hurricane. You can see that this roof is actually a part of the roof over here that has completely been sheared off by Hurricane Maria and strewn across the street. Lines are down and poles are down. This is a commercial business on the island of St. Croix, a business that will take months, if not a year, at least, to recover if FEMA moves quickly on supporting a small business loan so that they can have the support that they need to be able to do that. These are the things that you don’t see on the news that the people of the Virgin Islands are dealing with right now. What is our greatest asset—and has been for some years after our oil refinery was closed, after this Congress in 2004 changed the rules for the American JOBS Act that took away many of our knowledgebased businesses, our financial services sector—is we have had to rely on tourism. And this is a hotel room in one of our major hotels. This is what the destruction of the hurricanes look like in the 
Virgin Islands right now. This is a hotel room that will not be available for the coming months for the people of the Virgin Islands to be able to sustain themselves with employment. What I am showing you now was, at one point, two homes, two homeowners’ families. You can see the two houses look literally as if a hurricane just came across them and smashed them with a fist from the top. You can barely make out what was once in these homes. These homes no longer exist. These people have no homes. There is no temporary shelter designation right now. People are living in shelters in some of the few schools that are still intact, which means: Where are our children going to go to school? Many of our schools have also been destroyed. What will happen to the children of the Virgin Islands? What will happen to us all? Here is what some of the roads look like when we talk about the utility system and the need—or why we are in the dark in the Virgin Islands right now. This is a major road. Can you imagine having this next to your house? Can you imagine this amount of transponders, transformers, in front of your home? This is why most of the Virgin Islands are in the dark right now. This is what is happening on these islands. This is someone’s home. This is our industry. This is tourism right now in the Virgin Islands. This is a hotel room in one of our major resorts. Places known over the world—Caneel Bay on St. John—are gone, are obliterated, will be no more for 2 or 3 years. What are the people of the Virgin Islands supposed to do? Are we asking for much? We are asking for support. We fight in your wars. We begged when we became part of the United States to be part of the draft because we want to take on the responsibility of American citizenship. But under the Constitution, it is this Congress, Mr. Speaker, which has responsibility for the territories: Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Marianas. And I have to tell you that it has been a poor job that you have been doing of that responsibility thus far. We get the short shrift in Federal funding in formulas. Let’s not talk about the Affordable Care Act. We don’t even have an exchange to have been upset that we lost an exchange. That was never given to us. The Virgin Islands, with 30 percent of the children living in poverty, still don’t get the disproportionate share for hospitals that the rest of the United States get. Why? I can’t get a straight answer about why we shouldn’t have it, but we don’t. Neither do the smaller island territories. This is what we are left with. And we are asking you for your support. I am asking you for their support. I am begging for support for the people that I represent, because many Virgin Islanders are not going to beg you for support. That is not in them, that is not who they are. The biggest phrase that people have right now when I go around the islands after Irma and after Maria—both Category 5 when they struck the U.S. Virgin Islands—and I ask people, ‘‘How did you make out?’’— that is now our new greeting for one another: ‘‘So good to see you. How did you make out?’’ And people’s response is continually: ‘‘Thank God I have life. I am blessed I have life.’’ And when you have to press them to ask them, ‘‘What happened to your home,’’ then they will just shake their head, ‘‘It is no more. My home is no more. But thank God I have life. I am good. We are good.’’ That is the kind of people who are the people of the Virgin Islands. So they are not going to beg this Congress for support. I am going to beg for them, because you haven’t been doing it out of your own volition or what you know is right to do. You haven’t done it thus far. What is happening in Puerto Rico is happening in the Virgin Islands right now. As the sole representative here in Congress representing the Virgin Islands, I will continue the work that I have been doing in support of the islands’ overall recovery efforts, including facilitating generators and security for local grocery stores, businesses so Virgin Islanders can get fresh food and goods, working with local shipping companies to clear the ports and bring commerce and relief packages to the islands, coordinating with housing support for the Red Cross and local shelters, as well as rebuilding efforts of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Additionally, I will continue to update my residents and businesses around the ongoing efforts to make sure that the U.S. Virgin Islands continue to receive the attention and support they need during these difficult times. b2100 While the devastation of this hurricane season has been felt in many parts of our country, it is imperative that we make sure our Virgin Islands continue to be remembered and supported as we begin the long and arduous process of our recovery. We are hopeful. Virgin Islands’ motto is ‘‘United in Pride and Hope.’’ That is who we are. I want to thank the Virgin Islanders who are living in the mainland because they, through their efforts, have bridged the gap. Our office gets calls continually from Virgin Islands associations in places like Houston, Atlanta, New York, Tampa, Orlando, Miami, good Virgin Islanders like Tim Duncan, who, through his own efforts, brought planeloads of support to the people of the Virgin Islands because we want to take care ourselves. We don’t want to ask for your support. But it is your responsibility, Mr. Speaker, it is the responsibility of this Congress to ensure that that is done. I think back on, as a child, hearing stories about Casper Holstein. Many of you may not know the name, but many of you may know him from gangster movies, discussions about New York at the turn of the 20th century. He was a Virgin Islander who created something that everybody calls the numbers system in New York. After a hurricane and a tsunami in the Virgin Islands, he, of his own pocket, reached in, commissioned a ship, and sent that ship filled with goods for his fellow Virgin Islanders back home. That is what is happening now because we can’t always count on the Federal Government to do what is right by us. We have to count on ourselves. But I am going to make sure, and I will fight continually with those colleagues on either side of the aisle, whomever is willing to, to support the people of the Virgin Islands, to ensure that their efforts are not in vain. Let me give you a statistic when I talk about veterans and us willing to fight. In the last five conflicts, Virgin Islanders have paid the ultimate price, have greater casualties, three times the national average per capita. We send our sons and daughters on the regular to fight our wars. That is not a duty that we shirk from. Are you shirking from your duty to us, of your responsibility to us? I understand, as I have said, FEMA is on the ground, but there are children who are not getting water. There are old people who are eating MREs that others have brought back to them. Is that what should be happening? Not everybody can get to a distribution center. Not everybody can carry packs of water on their shoulders, on their heads, on their back a mile, whatever it is, to get back to their home because, as crazy as it sounds in this day and age, not everybody owns a car, not everybody can do that. So this Congress has got to figure out a way. I know that Ranking Member CUMMINGS and I issued a request on September 29 for my good friend—and he is my friend, TREY GOWDY , chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee—to express our extremely grave concerns about the dire status of recovery efforts in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, requesting that the committee hold an emergency hearing this week with officials from the Department of Defense, Homeland Security, Health and Human Services, as well as from the White House. The committee this week, I know, has no hearings, no business meeting, no activity scheduled for the entire week, and this issue is in desperate need of rapid and robust oversight. Millions of American citizens residing in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands are facing massive calamities, widespread disease and death, and we need to help them now. Lieutenant General Russel Honore, who commanded Joint Task Force 
Katrina, recently warned the administration’s response to this humanitarian crisis is replaying a scene from Katrina. Admiral Paul Zukunft, the Coast Guard Commandant, warned this week that the victims feel betrayed, they feel isolated, and they are probably getting a sense of betrayal of ‘‘where is the cavalry?’’ Everybody else is seeing what other individuals in Puerto Rico have said and their concern for what is happening. Now, I want my colleagues to know, I am not necessarily saying that it is the Federal Government’s fault. If it is the fault of local government, then shame on them and let’s expose that for what it is, because all I am concerned about is the welfare of the people of the Virgin Islands, not protecting local government, not protecting bureaucracy, whether it be at the Federal level or at the local level. Let’s have this hearing. Let’s get that information out. The fact that there is no functioning hospital in the Virgin Islands should scare the heck out of us. I was in the hospital at Juan Luis on Wednesday and watched doctors and others creating lists of people, how to get them off the island, how to get our disproportionate amount of dialysis patients off the island, how they were going to deal with those who have shunts, heart disease patients in the coming weeks with one makeshift operating room that they were working out of. How were they going to do that? How were they going to operate out of a tent that the Army was setting up when we still have a month and a half of hurricane season in the Virgin Islands, in the Caribbean? We are not going to be able to continually ship people off the island, fix them up, triage them, and get them off. Our labor and delivery: What if there is a child with special needs when they are born? What about neonatal services, if that is needed, for a child that is born during this time? God help us. And if you don’t act, God help you in this time of need of your fellow Americans. I want to thank those Members who have reached out to me and who have expressed their desire to support and help us. Thank you. I am calling on you now for that help to make sure that the people of the Virgin Islands do not continually feel forgotten. I want to thank House Democratic Leader NANCY PELOSI , who recently issued a statement calling for the swift and immediate financial commitment to help rebuild the Virgin Islands. I want to thank my Republican colleague, JENNIFFER GONZA´LEZCOLO´Nof Puerto Rico. She and I have been continually texting. I remember texting with her through Maria as she and her brother were holding the door of their home in Puerto Rico, trying to ensure that Maria did not get in that house. Thank you for your support. Thank you for your sisterhood as we both go through this, and how ever you need me, I am there for you. Republicans must join Democrats; Democrats must join Republicans in Congress to address the needs of the communities in crisis by swiftly passing a robust relief package that provides assistance not only today, but throughout the long road to recovery. This is our chance in the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico to show American might, to show American technology, to show American strength. President Trump, you have complained about the other islands not wanting to support us when we go to the United Nations or the Organization of American States against places like Venezuela or Cuba or China. Show that they can vote with us because Americans do what they are supposed to do for the islands that they have responsibility over. How are they going to trust us if we can’t even take care of what belongs to us? Our fellow Americans in the Virgin Islands deserve to know that their government will be there for them without question or hesitation. I want to thank the country of Denmark, our previous owner. Many of you know that the Virgin Islands have had seven flags that have been flown over those islands. We are a very valuable place. We are geographically situated in the mouth of the Caribbean Basin to support the United States. That was why we were purchased in 1970. But we have maintained close ties with Denmark, and I want to thank the Ambassador and the Prime Minister, who reached out and said that they wanted to support the territory and submitted the request of the Danish Government to our own U.S. Government to bring their own additional emergency management agency to the Virgin Islands in support of ongoing efforts in areas such as healthcare, water purification systems, and experts, command control support, logistics for clearing, and security support. Thank you for your continued commitment to us. Let that not be the only commitment that we have. I know that the Federal Government, the executive branch, is doing its part. Let this Congress do its part. Let this Congress show, in this time of crisis, that it can rise above partisanship and support the islands of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Let those 3.6 million Americans living in those territories—more than many States in this country—know that they have the full support of this Congress, of the American people, that they are not just a sound bite, that they are not just a rum and Coke and a pina colada when you decide that you want to get away from where you live, that we mean more than that to you, that we are, indeed, full citizens in this American experience, in this democracy. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season was among one of the most active hurricane seasons on record. Four major hurricanes—Harvey, Irma, Jose, and Maria—left terrible devastation in their wakes as the United States and its surrounding neighbors were hit with historically catastrophic storms. As we know far too well, these storms caused billions of dollars in damage across Texas, Louisiana, Georgia, Florida, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and other areas in the region. Much like Hurricane Katrina, the effects of this devastation will be felt for decades. The frequency and intensity of these storms continue to be an ongoing issue for our country, and it is a problem that is only further exacerbated by global warming. Warmer oceans and extra heat in the atmosphere caused by climate change provide even more fuel for weather systems. Studies are already demonstrating that storms are intensifying significantly faster today than they did 25 years ago. Additional water vapor in the atmosphere is also leading to extreme precipitation. In fact, Hurricane Harvey brought more than 50 inches of rainfall to the Texas Gulf Coast, representing the greatest accumulation of rainfall ever recovered in the contiguous United States from a single tropical storm. As the costs of natural disasters continue to increase, we need to be cognizant of the impact of these costs on communities all across the United States—particularly communities of color or other areas where our most vulnerable populations reside. Federal disaster response needs to be fair and equitable across the board. Communities of color suffer greatly from natural disasters as many are left without housing or jobs to return to after the storm. Low income individuals and minorities suffer even greater when these events occur, making a strong and equitable federal response that much more important. Mr. Speaker, we need to be looking at what we can do as Americans to support our fellow citizens and the steps that we can take to build more resilient infrastructure in the wake of such devastating natural disasters. Each and every American shares in the responsibility to face these natural disasters together as one nation, and we cannot afford to ignore entire segments of the population in the wake of these disasters. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus in drawing attention to this year’s catastrophic hurricane season that has severely impacted the Texas, Florida, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico this Hurricane Season. The biggest challenge for residents of the 18th Congressional District is accessing the assistance that is available to them. From getting rooms in hotels for those displaced by flood waters to finding Disaster Assistance Centers that are accessible—when so many cars were damaged by Hurricane Harvey flood waters. This past Saturday, I joined with representatives from FEMA to provide critical information to Houstonians attempting to recover from the catastrophe of Hurricane Harvey. Many of them are still waiting for home inspections and need answers regarding the appeals process and how best to utilize Home Inspection Teams. 
I am calling on FEMA to create a new app to provide homeowners with instant status updates on the inspection process,’’ said Congresswoman Jackson Lee. ‘‘This app should speed up the process of scheduling FEMA inspectors for a home visit if your home has not been inspected in more than 10 days. This will help the many who are struggling to get their lives back in order. This week, FEMA announced the creation of a new housing program under the Direct Housing Assistance Program, which allows FEMA disaster relief funding to go to individual homeowners or to local governments to provide housing. To be considered for this program, people must first register with FEMA at www.DisasterAssistance.gov. Local government immediate disaster assistance housing options are as follows: 1. MultiFamily Lease and Repair: Direct assistance to repair or improve existing multifamily housing such as apartments in order to provide more housing for survivors. Properties must be three or more units, with each unit providing complete living facilities for cooking, eating, and sanitation. Hotels, motels, and extended stay hotels are not eligible at this time. 2. Direct Leasing: Direct Leasing: Enables local governments to lease a property that typically would not be available to the public, such as corporate lodging. Local government enters into the lease agreement on behalf of individuals or households. Various types of housing properties may be eligible. Manufactured Housing Options (Mobile Homes and Recreational Vehicles): Direct housing places manufactured housing units on private land or commercial pads. Local permitting may apply. There are conditions to receiving housing assistance, but no assistance will be available if an application to FEMA is not made. It is problematic for constituents from the 18th Congressional District, when I know that 81,950 FEMA applicants have been rejected. I know that tens of thousands are still displaced with over a 1 million cars having been destroyed by flood water it is difficult to get to the Disaster Recovery Centers. I continue to work to get more Disaster Recovery Centers opened before the October 24, 2017 deadline to make sure that FEMA resources are as accessible as possible. We know that site for housing must be suitable. There will be Hauling and installation included only for those people who have applied for FEMA assistance and have be approved to receive assistance. An inspection of the site to determine suitability will be scheduled. Partial Repair and Essential Power for Sheltering (PREPS): PREPS provides minor repairs to homes in locations with limited housing options. For eligible properties that have incurred limited damage displacing individuals from their homes. PREPS provides basic, emergency home repairs—not to include finish work. 3. Direct Assistance for Limited Home Repair: Program provides partial repairs to homes with significant damages. Program can include partial repairs to a damaged home where alternative housing is not available or is not costeffective. FEMA will determine eligibility for permanent housing construction on a casebycase basis. All other forms of housing assistance must be exhausted before the program can be considered. Some Hurricane Harvey survivors are getting an extension to stay temporarily in hotels while they look for an alternative place to live. October 14 is the new checkout date for the Transitional Sheltering Assistance (TSA) program, which pays for shortterm hotel stays. All applicants for FEMA recovery assistance have the right to appeal if they are dissatisfied with FEMA’s determination letter. All appeals must be in writing and explain the reasons why FEMA’s decision may not be correct. The appeal should include any documentation that FEMA requests or that supports your claim. Appeals can be submitted via computer by opening a Disaster Assistance Center (DAC) account at www.disasterassistance.gov. In addition to all of the needs of family are the needs of small businesses who are going to be instrumental in rebuilding our communities. I will soon introduce a bill to provide grants of up to $100 thousand to qualified small business owners to help them with Hurricane Recovery. I thank my Colleagues of the Congressional Black Caucus for joining in this Special Order and I look forward to our efforts to meet the needs of people who are impacted by this hurricane Season. I would also like to include in the RECORD  an article from Vox regarding climate change: 
[From vox.com, Sept. 28, 2017] ONE OF THE CLEAREST SIGNS OF CLIMATE  CHANGE IN HURRICANES MARIA, IRMA, AND HARVEY WAS THE RAIN Warmer temperatures are increasing the energy and moisture available to hurricanes. The intensity of Hurricane Maria, which made landfall on Puerto Rico as a Category 4 storm on September 20, was part of why it was so devastating to the island and its weak infrastructure, leaving Puerto Ricans in a humanitarian crisis. But this year’s intense Atlantic storm season had another element tying its biggest events together: a monstrous, and sometimes deadly, amount of rain. Images of the flooded metropolises of Houston, Jacksonville, and San Juan with overtopped dams, billowing sewage, and flooded homes show that torrential rain can be one of the most devastating consequences of hurricanes, especially in urban areas where concrete makes it harder for water to drain and where people can drown. Scientists say the extreme rainfall events that feed these floods are on the rise for many parts of the world, and this year’s hurricanes fit that trend. In particular, rising temperatures in the ocean and the air alongside booming construction in vulnerable areas are fueling the increased risk from massive deluges. Of the seven hurricanes this year so far, Harvey, Irma, and Maria stand out not just for the amount of rain they dropped, but for how fast they dished it out. 
CAN DUMP SO MUCH RAIN  Downpours go hand in hand with hurricanes, since the cyclones are powered by evaporating and condensing moisture. Warm ocean waters provide the fuel for hurricanes, and warm air causes the water to evaporate. This moistureladen air then precipitates as rainfall during a hurricane, dissipating the heat energy from the water. ‘‘Tropical cyclones are very, very good at converging a whole lot of heat in one place at one time,’’ said Kossin. Air can hold about 7 percent more water for every degree Celsius increase in temperature, Kossin explained. That means warmer air and warmer water could lead to larger, more intense hurricanes, which in turn lead to more rainfall. (The SaffirSimpson scale only accounts for windspeed, but precipitation is closely linked to a storm’s intensity.) Scientists are studying these links to understand how future storms will respond to these conditions. ‘‘Hurricanes live and die by the amount of rainfall they make out of moisture,’’ said George Huffman, a research meteorologist at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. But where that water lands depends on the speed and the course of the storm, and not all areas are equally vulnerable. ‘‘We know that in particular that [the regions around] Houston, Louisiana, and Florida are prone to some of the most extreme precipitation events in the United States,’’ said Sarah Kapnick, a researcher at NOAA’s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory. ‘‘We do see signs of precipitation extremes increasing in these regions.’’ It’s challenging to make direct comparisons between extreme rainfall events since their weather systems (e.g., hurricanes, thunderstorms) behave differently, so scientists draw on several benchmarks depending on the situation. These include the peak rate of rainfall, total volume of rain, the threeday average rainfall, and the maximum depth of rainfall. And all of these are separate from flooding, which is governed by local geography and how people use land, in addition to the rates and total amounts of rain. ‘‘There is a difference between a 100–year rain event versus a 100–year flood event,’’ Kossin pointed out. HARVEY WAS ABLE TO DUMP AN EXTRAOR DINARY QUANTITY OF RAIN BECAUSE OF HOW  
IT HELD STILL OVER HOUSTON  Hurricane Harvey hovered over the Gulf Coast in late August and dumped 33 trillion gallons of water on US soil, according to some estimates, and is now the wettest storm in US history. ‘‘When a storm stalls, that has more to do with the larger scale flow fields it’s sitting in,’’ said Kossin. ‘‘That was just very, very bad luck.’’ The total volume of rain is easier to calculate when a storm remains over a fixed area, but it much harder to suss out when hurricanes remain mobile and dump water over a wide swath of land and ocean. NASA’s satellite measurements reported rainfall rates from Harvey as high as 5.8 inches per hour (meteorologists define ‘‘heavy rain’’ as greater than 0.3 inches per hour), while the National Weather Service showed that a groundbased rain gauge in Nederland, Texas, reported 60.58 inches of rainfall, a new record. Meteorologists still have to vet this number, but if confirmed, it would best the previous record—52 inches in Hawaii from Hurricane Hiki in 1950—by 8 inches. The US Geological Survey reports that flooding causes an average of $6 billion in damages and 140 fatalities each year. And this year was not an average year, with Harvey alone costing upward of $180 billion and killing more than 75. The waters from flooding can linger for days, causing injuries, spreading disease, and hampering relief efforts. The majority of Harvey’s victims drowned after the storm, while others were delayed from lifesaving care. In one case, a woman died from a flesh eating bacterial infection after falling into the festering Harvey floodwater in her house. 
IRMA ’S PEAK RAIN WAS OVER CUBA  Hurricane Irma, meanwhile, set a record for its sustained intensity. ‘‘Irma was a complete standout: 185 mph and stayed there for a day and half,’’ Kossin said. ‘‘These storms do not stay there that long.’’ This intensity was matched with a firehose of rain, dumping water at 10.8 inches an hour, reaching depths of 20 inches in Cuba and 15.8 inches in Florida. The downpour led to flooding from 23 rivers and creeks in Central and North Florida, forcing highways to close. The state reported at least seven deaths from drowning. In Cuba, Irma’s storm surge overtopped the Havana seawall, while unrelenting rain turned the capital’s streets into rivers, killing at least 10 people . 
THEN REGAINED STRENGTH  With tropical force winds reaching 230 miles from its center, Hurricane Maria completely engulfed Puerto Rico as it bisected the 100mile wide island, picking up steam again one it was clear. Satellite measurements already show that it poured as much as 6.44 inches of rain per hour and has left Puerto Rico shrouded in darkness. The Cordillera Central mountain range that forms the spine of the island of Puerto Rico acted as a juicer for Hurricane Maria, Huffman explained. Perhaps the worst blow from Maria was the 150 mph winds that knocked down 80 percent of the island’s power transmission lines and 85 percent of its cellphone towers, leaving people in the dark and struggling to contact each other. But the flooding from rainfall has been a hazard too, including threatening to breach Guajataca Dam in the Western part of the island, forcing hundreds to evacuate. At least 18 fatalities have been reported in Puerto Rico so far, including two police officers who drowned. 
EMERGING  No single weather event—even an extreme one—can be ‘‘caused’’ by climate change, as Vox’s David Roberts has explained in detail. And when talking about hurricanes, researchers are quite hesitant to even estimate how much climate change is to blame. Huffman said he’s not yet sure if this storm season is ‘‘unprecedented’’ in its ferocity. However, rising average temperatures are definitely an important element of huge storms like Harvey, Irma, and Maria. Warmer temperatures are driving sea level rise, which is increasing risks from the storm surges that often herald hurricanes. Increasing heat is also warming up the ocean, and hotter air holds onto more moisture, increasing the available energy for hurricanes. And independent of cyclones, extreme rainfall events are on the rise. Kapnick noted that even individual rain storms can be overwhelming, like storm that drenched Baton Rouge last year with 31.39 inches of rain and three times the volume of water of Hurricane Katrina throughout Louisiana in 2005. As the chart below shows, the amount of rain from a onceinevery30years rainstorm like the one that immersed Baton Rouge has gone up due to warming: ‘‘In this region where we have known precipitation extremes, we have been able to detect an increase in precipitation extremes due to a warming climate,’’ Kapnick said. And scientists are getting better at figuring out when the torrential downpours are coming. ‘‘If you pay attention, we’ve had a really remarkable series of forecasts,’’ said Huffman. ‘‘For Irma, we knew four to five days in advance that there would be a sharp right turn. Twenty years ago, you wouldn’t have dreamed of doing that.’’ ‘‘Everything we see is consistent with what we expect climate change to do,’’ Kossin said. INSTRUMENTS SOMETIMES CAN ’T STAND UP TO  
MEASURE  Huffman explained that researchers aim to combine different instruments to get a robust handle on rainfall. ‘‘The gold standard is rain gauges because they physically collect the rain,’’ said Huffman. The next option is groundbased radar, which covers a wider swath of the weather than rain gauges, but less directly measures rain. But take a look at what happened to a weather radar station in Puerto Rico: This illustrates part of the challenge of attaching numbers to extreme weather events. Many of the systems used to track them are also vulnerable to them, leaving only indirect figures and estimates. What’s more, both rain gauges and ground based radar have limited ranges, leaving vast stretches of ocean where hurricanes spend most of their existence unmeasured. And when a hurricane does make landfall, gales can knock them down. ‘‘We don’t really have anything on the surface [of the ocean] to tell us the details,’’ said Huffman. ‘‘When the chips are really down, sometimes satellites are the only choice.’’ That means the full accounting for the rainfall from Harvey, Irma, and Maria could take months to deliver as meteorologists piece together their models with the measurements they have. However, scientists are eagerly waiting for the dust to settle so they can confirm their suspicions about the recordbreaking storms this year. The American Geophysical Union added a lastminute session for researchers to present their findings on Harvey and Irma at their December meeting. ‘‘There’s going to be a tremendous amount of research coming out in the next few months,’’ Kapnick said. f 
the line gave you some help. There was a great teacher somewhere in your life. Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive.’’ Later in that speech, President Obama said, ‘‘So if you have a business, you didn’t build that,’’ someone did it for you. And he was roundly excoriated, but at some level he acknowledged the sacrifice of so many that compels me to stand here today to ask that when the national anthem of the United States of America is played, that you demonstrate some semblance of gratitude for the sacrifice that has been given by untold millions before you that allows you the prerogative not to stand. And so should you choose not to stand, I support that right. I believe that right is fundamental to what makes us Americans, but I implore you to learn the history of our Nation that allows you the right not to stand, for, to be certain, there are places in the world, North Korea, where choosing not to stand when the anthem is played might lead to a horrible demise. Gilbert Chesterton once said: ‘‘One sees great things from the valley; only small things from the peak.’’ And the French political philosopher Alexis de Tocqueville said: ‘‘The greatness of America lies not in her being more enlightened than any other Nation, but rather in her ability to repair her faults.’’ And so when a slaveowner named Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, he talked about how all people were created equal, despite his inherent flaw or flaws, and when the preamble to the Constitution was hammered out, the Founders suggested that we should strive not to be a perfect union but a more perfect union by acknowledging that, in fact, where there are humans in charge, we will never achieve perfection. Tonight, I ask your indulgence, if you tuned in at home completely by accident, for a moment to learn about how lucky we are, regardless of the circumstance of our birth, compared to our peers across the globe, to have the opportunity to live in this, the greatest Nation in the history of mankind, and how standing for an anthem that honors an imperfect nation that continually strives for perfection is not only the right thing to do, it is the only thing to do if you understand the scope of the sacrifice of those who came before us. Imperfect people like Thomas Jefferson gave us near perfect documents. And so tonight, as my vehicle to discuss why we should stand for our anthem, I will choose the district that I am honored to have the opportunity to serve, Virginia’s Fifth District. I will say, in all humility, that while I am ordinary, the district is great; that the Fifth District of Virginia is, in my humble opinion, without hyperbole, the greatest congressional district in the country. And I will give you ten reasons why I hope the next time the anthem is played you will stand and think with reverence upon those who made sacrifices that gave us the opportunity to live in the greatest land humanity has ever seen. In 1743, born in the Fifth District of Virginia was this very man, Thomas Jefferson. An imperfect man who had a thirst for knowledge and said, ‘‘I cannot live without books,’’ and continually sought to understand what might be perfected as it related to government amongst men, and in the Declaration created a document which was the first message that a fledging nation held out to the world to say: This is who we are. And he said, in that document, that all people were created equal; a concept that this Nation did not arrive at in reality by virtue of slavery and things like the failure to grant women suffrage for some 150 years, nearly, later. However, a charge to work towards a more perfect union, that was contained in the document, the Constitution, overseen by James Madison also of the Fifth District of Virginia. And so while we were imperfect, we were given the greatest and most noble of goals, and that is to strive to be more perfect. So the vision of Jefferson outlined in the Declaration and expanded upon James Madison in the Constitution, and later articulated in this town, Washington, D.C., by Dr. King when he said that we should judge individuals based not on the color of their skin but on the content of their character, it was borne in the hearts and minds of imperfect people from the Fifth District of Virginia who gave us near perfect documents. In 1819, another of Mr. Jefferson’s visions came to fruition with the foundation of the University of Virginia, a leading public research university and the source of incredible scholarship on things like human rights and individual liberty and natural law and the freedoms that individuals are bestowed by virtue of the Nation in which we live, again, in the Fifth District of Virginia. Fast forward to 1865, the end of the bloodiest era in our Nation’s history internally, a conflict as we moved towards a more perfect union, in which if you count disease and dysentery and starvation, along with combat deaths, over a million Americans gave their lives as we worked to become a more perfect union. And we know but a small fraction of a percentage of those people’s names. And we know that Abraham Lincoln took a bullet by someone who was not willing to accept that progress meant acknowledging that Jefferson’s words were true, as they were later manifest by Dr. King, once again, 53 years ago in August in this city. Fast forward to 1933 and the 21st Amendment repealing prohibition, Franklin County, Virginia, dubbed the wettest county in America. And as we watched as jobs left the Fifth District of Virginia and opportunity seemingly left with them, we saw a wellspring of opportunity and economic development in the form, ironically, of wineries and distilleries and breweries. So when Burlington and Broyhill and Bassett and Lane and Dan River Mills left, distilleries and breweries and wineries crept in. It started in Franklin County, Virginia. Fast forward to 1944, Bedford, Virginia, June 6. The Allied invasion at Normandy, Dday. The Town of Bedford lost more of her sons per capita than any other town in the United States— 19 in one day, more than decimating an entire graduating class and removing the best and brightest from that small Virginia locality. Notably, three other young men from Bedford died later in the Normandy campaign, bringing the total Bedford KIA during Normandy to 22. And ironically, these men died serving in the BlueGray 29th Infantry Division, so named because it honored the fact that it brought soldiers from both sides of the MasonDixon line together to fight and bleed and die to free foreign women and men whom they had never met. Fast forward to 1951, Prince Edward County, Virginia, the hamlet of Farmville. Barbara Johns, a high school student, had an uncle who was a scholar, who discussed with her and her family over the dinner table the ideas expanded upon by Jefferson and the Declaration, and suggested that, indeed, all people were created equal. And this manifests itself through Barbara Johns in action. This teenage girl looked at the school that she attended, the Moton High School, and looked across the county to the allWhite new high school and understood that if all people were, indeed, created equal, as her uncle had suggested as was written by Jefferson, then it was unfair that court cases like Plessy v. Ferguson that any law that said that separate but equal was anything close to a possible theoretical reality must be struck down. Now, I have passed by other residents of the Fifth District of Virginia. Patrick Henry, for example. John Marshall, for example. But back to Henry. Henry stood before the American Revolution and said: ‘‘I know not what course others may take; but as for me, give me liberty or give me death.’’ And from the back of the room someone shouted: Treason. And Patrick Henry responded, ‘‘If this be treason, make the most of it,’’ acknowledging that to do something great that he believed in he might need to die. Barbara Johns did that very same thing on April 23, 1951, when she led a walkout of Moton High School demanding an end to separate but equal segregation in Virginia, thus sparking the civil rights movement in Virginia that also can look to its forbearers and see Booker T. Washington, a civil rights leader amongst the last generation of 
AfricanAmerican leaders born into slavery. His vision began to culminate when Johns led the student walkout in Prince Edward County that led to desegregation at the very risk of her life. Now, I like to liken Johns to Patrick Henry, both of whom are heroes of mine, as two people who were willing to stand up and do what they thought was right regardless of the fact that it, quite literally, might cost them their lives. They might die. But I tell people when I speak to them, the difference between Patrick Henry and Barbara Johns is Patrick Henry was a 37year old attorney trained to speak in front of people, and Barbara Johns was a teenage girl, and this happened in America as we worked to become a more perfect union. Fast forward to Pittsylvania County, where Deborah Coles, another hero of mine, was born one of eight children to a tobacco sharecropper. Growing up in a Virginia where racism was far too evident and common, Deborah Coles bucked the odds, learned a work ethic from her mother and father, became the first in her family to attend college, attending Virginia State University, and later going on into public education where she was and is an educator and an administrator in the small town where I went to high school and where she had undoubtedly touched the lives of innumerable thousands of students over the decades— finding ways to say yes, finding means to encourage thought, finding ways to stimulate young minds. And she did this despite the ridiculous challenges faced by her forbearers, and she did it here as we worked to become a more perfect union in America. Fast forward to the 21st century. Servicemembers, not unlike their brethren from Bedford who fell on June 6 at Dday, just a handful of the sacrifice from the Fifth District of VA, 1– 435th of our Nation. Humayun Khan, a graduate of the aforementioned University of Virginia, who, at risk to himself, moved his soldiers away and sought to determine whether or not a vehicle approaching the point where he was working was a threat, and ultimately, in protecting those with whom he served, gave his life wearing the uniform of a nation to which his parents had immigrated. b2130 Sergeant Andrew Crabtree, a Special Forces soldier who served multiple tours defending America in the global war on terror and recently passed to the next life from a cancer deemed to have been servicerelated. And Seaman Dakota Rigsby, the son of working class folks from Fluvanna County, Virginia, in the Fifth District, who tragically perished while wearing the uniform of this Nation, defending that which is worth defending, aboard the USS Fitzgerald. Then, moving to today, and reason number 10, although, to be fair, Booker T. Washington, Patrick Henry, and John Marshall could make this 13 if I counted them separately, and that is the families of Pastor Hassan and Abdumawla, Christians from the Republic of Sudan, who, after about 9 months of work on our part and about 18 months of imprisonment on the part of the two gentlemen I named, have now moved to Buckingham County, Virginia, where they have an opportunity to experience a land where they are free to stand or sit when the anthem is played, where they are free to worship or not worship as they feel compelled, and where no dream is too big. I would wager that, having lived in a foreign land and not having been amongst those 1 in 25 or 26, roughly, fortunate enough to have been born here in this imperfect land perpetually seeking to be a more perfect Union, I would wager that, when our national anthem is played, these newest residents of Virginia’s Fifth Congressional District will choose to stand. I hope, when you think of the sacrifices made by millions who came before us, that you will, too. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
RECOGNIZING THE RESILIENCE OF FLORIDIANS AND FIRST RESPONDERS AFTER HURRICANE IRMA The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida (Mr. RUTHER FORD ) until the hour of 10 p.m. Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend the resilience of my fellow Floridians, to thank our men and women in uniform, including our State and local first responders, and to recognize our State and local leaders for the tremendous aid and direction they gave to all of our fellow Floridians during their response to Hurricane Irma. We normally think of men and women in uniform as those who defend our country abroad, but they also deserve our recognition and thanks for their service on the homefront as well. The Florida Army National Guard, the United States Coast Guard, the Navy, and many others aided our State before, during, and after the storm. In fact, I witnessed National Guard units from various States working together with the Florida National Guard to rescue citizens of northeast Florida. Mr. Speaker, the United States Coast Guard did an incredible job carrying out hundreds of rescues, and I commend U.S. Coast Guard Commandant Zukunft, Captain Wiemers of Port Jacksonville, and all of their men and women who risked their lives to save others during and after the storm. I also want to recognize all of the first responders, police, and firefighters who responded quickly and saved so many lives. As an example, the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office, in 1 day, rescued more than 350 of our citizens. I also want to commend Governor Rick Scott and our State agencies for the advanced planning that they did leading up to Hurricane Irma and the recovery efforts that are still going on. In northeast Florida, we experienced, historic flooding, levels not seen since 1846. That is the year after Florida became a State. In St. Johns County, small businesses were flooded and homes literally toppled over into the ocean. Many more still threaten to fall into the ocean, undermined by severe beach erosion. In Nassau County, here, a week after the storm, areas of the county were still not accessible due to heavy flooding, and shelters were still open. But throughout all of this, Mr. Speaker, I spoke with many local volunteers who had damage to their own homes but were out helping rescue other families. I even spoke with a retired coastguardsman who traveled to Nassau County from Virginia to serve with the Red Cross. Mr. Speaker, the Florida delegation in this House is now unified to ensure that Floridians receive the Federal support they need to recover from this horrible natural disaster, Hurricane Irma. I especially want to recognize Senator MARCO RUBIO and Florida Representatives ALLAWSON , NEAL DUNN, TEDYOHO, RONDESANTIS , STEPHANIE  MURPHY , VALDEMINGS , and D ARREN  SOTOfor coming to see, firsthand, the damage to our First Coast community. I also want to thank the congressional leaders from around the country for coming to northeast Florida. Speaker PAUL RYAN, Appropriations Chairman RODNEY FRELINGHUYSEN , and Chairman JOHN CARTER all personally toured our damaged communities, leaving us with a promise to do all they can to assist in Florida’s recovery. I thank them for the support, and I am grateful for their work to quickly provide emergency aid to help hurting Floridians. We are all also heartbroken that, now, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands are enduring incredibly devastating damage from Hurricane Maria. We believe it is important that we share resources with our neighboring islands. As you know, Mr. Speaker, the Port of Jacksonville is ground zero for getting shipments of needed goods to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. In fact, the American Maritime Partnership and the entire U.S. maritime industry are, in fact, first responders in times of emergency like Irma and Maria when they strike Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. I am proud of what the American maritime industry has accomplished. They have been working tirelessly around the clock to get goods to those who are in need. Almost immediately, there were 10,000 containers delivered; 35,000 pounds of cargo, were delivered by TOTE and Crowley of Jacksonville. 
And as we know, distribution has been the challenge. Our prayers go out to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, and we are prepared to stand by them as they face the daunting task of rebuilding their communities. We will continue to work together with our State, local, and Federal officials to ensure that Florida, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands can recover and build even stronger than before. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
