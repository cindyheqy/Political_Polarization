Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask the House of Representatives to join me in recognizing the achievements of Marcella Barnes, the CEO and founder of Pink Hardhat Construction, LLC. Ms. Barnes, who was raised in New York, began her career immediately after she grad-uated from high school and went on to attend college in California. Once she moved to Cali-fornia, she had a dream to enlist in the military and make a difference in people’s lives. Upon enlisting, she was then stationed in Maryland, which is also where she opened her first busi-ness, Pink Hardhat Construction, LLC. How-ever, once her construction business started to gain traction, Ms. Barnes also noticed a need for providing housing to homeless vet-erans. As a veteran herself, she recognized and understood the challenges that homeless veterans face in obtaining quality, affordable housing. Ms. Barnes decided to do something about it and opened another business, Our Pink Doors, LLC, which provides shelter for homeless veterans. On July 9, 2017, she held a ribbon-cutting ceremony for the grand open-ing of her first veterans’ home. Ms. Barnes is also a member of the Na-tional Congress of Black Women and the Maryland Minority Contractors Association. Therefore, I ask the House of Representa-tives to join me in recognizing Marcella Barnes for her work.

INTRODUCTION OF THE SAFE COMMUNITIES ACT OF 2017 
HON. EARL BLUMENAUER 
OF OREGON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 18, 2017 Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, more than 10 years ago, following Hurricane Katrina, then-Rep. Curt Weldon and I introduced the bipartisan Safe Communities Act. Today, with wildfires burning in my state and Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Jose´ravaging the South-east, the ability to prepare for, withstand, and quickly recover from disasters is an essential component of livable communities. That’s why I am reintroducing the Safe Communities Act, which will give state and local governments the tools to help them plan for and reduce the impact of these events. Federal investments in natural disasters should include prevention and mitigation as well as response and recovery. In fact, invest-ment in prevention can save money in the long-term. Research by an independent group of experts in 2005 found that every dollar in-vested in actions to reduce disaster losses saves the nation about $4 in future costs. We all agree that by planning for the future com-munities can help prevent damage and save money, but rarely do we do it. The Safe Communities Act will create a new grant program to support state, local and re-gional planning activities aimed at reducing threats posed by natural and human-caused disasters. Grant-eligible projects under this program include comprehensive risk assess-ments and inventories of critical infrastructure, land-use planning for natural hazards and ter-rorism security, updates to building codes and development of new urban design techniques for risk-reduction. The bill will also create a re-search program to investigate the best prac-tices in comprehensive land use and commu-nity planning aimed at reducing threats posed by natural hazards and acts of tenor. The number of people who live in harm’s way is expanding dramatically, and more prop-erties and more lives are at risk from both nat-ural and human-caused disasters. The associ-ated increases in rising disaster recovery costs impact us all. I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure communities have the resources they need to help prepare for future natural disasters. f 
WISHING A HAPPY 100TH BIRTH-DAY TO MS. PEARL GENEVIEVE MOORE 
HON. DAVID G. REICHERT 
OF WASHINGTON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 18, 2017 Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise to con-gratulate Ms. Pearl Genevieve Moore of Pres-ton, WA on her 100th birthday today. Pearl was born in Washington State on September 18, 1917 to parents Hulda and Olaf Carlson, who immigrated to Preston, Washington from Varmland, Sweden. Pearl graduated from Broadway High School in 1935. In 1941, Pearl married the love of her life, Mr. Marshall Moore. They were married for 56 beautiful years. Pearl credits her wonderful life to God’s grace, her ancestors, and a busy social life. She is actively involved in her church commu-nity and many have been blessed by her hos-pitality and care over the years. Pearl also loves to garden and enjoys eating lots of vegetables, peanuts, and chocolate. Through her big heart and dedication to her community, Pearl has continued to make Preston a better place throughout her lifetime. I join with her family, friends, and the Eighth District in congratulating her on this special occasion and wishing her a wonderful birth-day. 16TH DISTRICT CONGRESSIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AWARDS HON. VERN BUCHANAN 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 18, 2017 Mr. BUCHANAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Fire and Rescue and EMS per-sonnel who have provided distinguished serv-ice to the people of Florida’s 16th Congres-sional District. As first responders, fire departments and emergency medical service teams are sum-moned on short notice to serve their respec-tive communities. Oftentimes, they arrive at scenes of great adversity and trauma, to which they reliably bring strength and composure. These brave men and women spend hundreds of hours in training so that they are prepared when they get ‘‘the call.’’ In 2012, I established the 16th District Con-gressional Fire and Rescue and EMS Awards to honor officers, departments, and units for outstanding achievement. On behalf of the people of Florida’s 16th District, it is my privilege to congratulate the following winners, who were selected this year by an independent committee comprised of a cross section of current and retired Fire and Rescue personnel living in the district: Manatee County Community Paramedicine Program was chosen to receive the Congres-sional Unit Citation Award; Training Officer Christopher Stark of the Hillsborough County Fire Rescue was chosen to receive the Congressional Dedication and Professionalism Award; Chief Dennis Jones of the Hillsborough County Fire Rescue was chosen to receive the Congressional Career Service Award; and Division Chief-Fire Marshal Tammy Zurla was chosen to receive the Congressional Dedication and Professionalism Award.

CONGRATULATING THE MISSOURI ASSOCIATION OF STUDENT FI-NANCIAL AID PERSONNEL 
HON. BLAINE LUETKEMEYER 
OF MISSOURI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 18, 2017 Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Missouri Association of Student Financial Aid Personnel (MASFAP) on their 50th Anniversary on November 7, 2017. The Missouri Association of Student Fi-nancial Aid was founded on April 3, 1967, starting with a steering committee of only five members. Today, MASFAP has grown to 83 schools and over 790 members. This anniver-sary will provide an opportunity to recognize their continued partnerships and highlight the need for affordable post-secondary education.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE1238 September 18, 2017 
Since its founding, the MASFAP has and continues to be a dynamic association dedi-cated to serving and advocating for practi-tioners, users, and providers of student finan-cial aid programs. Many students depend on financial aid programs to assist them through their post-secondary education, providing many students with the means to continue their education. Missouri is home to many in-stitutions of post-secondary education that serve students from Missouri and abroad. Ob-taining a higher education opens doors for stu-dents, develops their individual skills and knowledge, and makes them invaluable re-sources to our communities, state, and nation. MASFAP is ready and willing to assist stu-dents who need help or information. The fi-nancial aid programs provided to students as-sist with tuition, fees, housing, food, books and supplies, transportation and personal ex-penses. Additionally, millions of dollars in grants, scholarships, and student loans allow students to continue pursuing their profes-sional goals. Every day, student financial aid administra-tors throughout Missouri do their best to assist students in identifying the resources and op-tions they have regarding the cost of their education. These administrators work at re-moving barriers so students can be successful in choosing the appropriate assistance pro-gram. The dedication these administrators show to the students and their future is appre-ciated. I ask you to join me in recognizing the Mis-souri Association of Student Financial Aid Per-sonnel on their 50th Anniversary Celebration.

HONORING MARY ‘‘EDITH’’ LOCKARD 
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 18, 2017 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, communities thrive when hard work, dedication, and sac-rifice are set by the example of its residents. In Yonkers, no one has set that example bet-ter than Mary ‘‘Edith’’ Lockard. Edith was born in Yonkers in 1924 to An-drew and Mary Lena Deloatch. She was the youngest of 6 and the only girl. After grad-uating from Yonkers High School, Edith earned her Associates Degree in Early Child-hood Development from Pace University. Edith has been the life-blood of Messiah Baptist Church for over 76 years. In April of 1940 she was baptized on Easter Sunday at the church, and has remained an active mem-ber serving the parish in any capacity needed. Following high school, Edith focused on raising her family with her husband, Wilfred Lockard. She got involved volunteering in the Yonkers school district and eventually served as the Vice President of the Parents Teachers Association (PTA). She also served at the South Yonkers Youth Council, an organization dedicated to fostering growth and develop-ment for the youth in the community through after school care and activities. They also held summer day camps which exposed the youth to cultural and sporting events, positive role models, and educational opportunities. After her beloved husband Wilfred passed away, Edith began volunteering at St. John’s Hospital. She faithfully served in the mailroom on Thursdays from 1995 to 2001. In 1995 she also became a member of the Nepperhan Senior Center—Senior Group No. 15—located on Warburton Avenue. For over a decade, Edith has faithfully worked for the Yonkers Parks and Recreation. For as active as Edith is in the community, her true passion has always been her family. She is the proud mother of her four children: Juanita, Tyrone, Lindsay, and Lila, she has eight grandchildren, seven great grand-children, and, remarkably, 9 great-great grand-children. Edith’s commitment to helping others has been an inspiration to those in her community and beyond. I want to congratulate Edith for all of her hard, selfless work, and I want to wish her a very happy 93rd birthday on Sep-tember 9, 2017. f 
BERT HACK 
HON. MIMI WALTERS 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 18, 2017 Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. Mr. Speaker, on March 24, 1999, Laguna Woods, California officially became Orange County’s 32nd city. A great deal has changed in the last 18 years, but Laguna Woods Councilman Bert Hack has remained a constant in our commu-nity. Since taking office in 1999, Bert served as Mayor five times and sat on numerous boards throughout Southern California. Bert’s deep knowledge of local history and passion for service to others has made him a beloved fixture in Laguna Woods. Bert’s presence on the City Council will surely be missed, but he will undoubtedly con-tinue to serve as an inspiration for all who fol-low in his footsteps. I wish Bert well in retirement, and thank him for his many years of service to Laguna Woods and Orange County.

HONORING SADIE M. MACCHIA 
HON. LEE M. ZELDIN 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 18, 2017 Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Sadie Macchia, who celebrated her 100th bitihday on July 6th, Born on July 6, 1917, in the Bronx, New York, Sadie came into this world with a re-markably low birth weight, and was the sur-viving child of a set of twins, the other of whom was born prematurely and sadly passed away shortly afterward. Sadie was so small that her mother used a shoebox as a cradle, and could not even properly wear a bonnet. With such a low birthweight, her chances for survival seemed slim. Yet, with incredible strength, this miracle baby pulled through in-fancy and is still here with us today, 100 years later. As an adult, Sadie spent many years work-ing as a seamstress in the Bronx while living in her own apartment above her brother, Dominick, and his wife, Angelina. In those days, Sadie was renowned for her hospitality and insatiable laughter, always happy to have friends and family over to share a meal, remi-nisce over old photos, or simply spend time with those dearest to her. A kind and gen-erous soul, she is truly loved by all who know her. To commemorate her 100th birthday, two of her brothers, Guy and Nick, threw her a birth-day party where she was able to celebrate with her extended fmnily. The look on her face to see so many loved ones gathered together to celebrate her birthday was said to be that of pure joy. This miracle baby fought all the odds and is now one of America’s great centennials. It is a privilege to honor Sadie Macchia, who has brought joy and laughter into the hearts of so many others. f

In particular, I congratulate Mr. Robin Mui for his public service. His accomplishments and contributions to the Asian community I represent is immeasurable. Mr. Mui has been instrumental in increasing awareness and dia-logue about issues and concerns that impact Asian American communities. Through their leadership, the Moy Family Association has championed numerous community causes and relief efforts for families impacted by tragedy. This includes raising millions of dollars for the American Red Cross during Hurricane Katrina and for the families of slain NYPD Officers Wenjian Liu and Officer Rafael RaInos in 2014. As a nation, we must embrace the diverse cultures and organizations that have worked to advance the needs of all citizens and have helped to define what it means to be Amer-ican. I ask my colleagues to join me today in congratulating the Moy’s Family Association U.S.A. National Convention on this special oc-casion. I commend their public service and shared goal of enriching the lives of the con-stituents of my district. My best wishes for a successful event.

REMARKS BY STEPHEN W. CAMP 
HON. JOHN B. LARSON 
OF CONNECTICUT  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 18, 2017 Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to include in the R
ECORD remarks made by the Reverend Stephen W. Camp at the Be the Light Interfaith Candle Lighting Vigil at Congregation Beth Israel in West Hartford, CT on August 23, 2017. 
THEREVEREND STEPHEN W. C AMP, M.D IV., S
ENIOR PASTOR , F AITH CONGREGATIONAL  C
HURCH OF HARTFORD , CT ‘‘The prophetic voice Maya Angelou once said, ‘I’ve learned that people will forget what you have said; people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.’ America was sent a message recently, a message that America rarely feels as deeply. As America watched the unfolding story cen-tered in the little sleepy college town in Vir-ginia. it was forced to feel, the kind of feel-ing that one never forgets. It was reminis-cent of Selma and ‘‘Bloody Sunday.’’ It brought to mind Birmingham with the dog and fire hoses; it reminded America of the open hostility and defiance of a George Wal-lace. As America watched in recent days, some were stirred by the memory of ances-tors and family members being marched into ovens, reminded of some of the worst inhu-manity that our world has produced. The genie, we thought, was back in the tightly dosed bottle, the monster was locked away in its cage, but here it was again raring it ugly head, saying, ‘‘I’m not dead yet! Amer-ica felt pain once again. For some I’m sure, it simply felt like a scab had been ripped off an old wound. Still others may have thought these days were be-hind us, a past just-as-soon forgotten. But lest we forget, lest we ignore for even a mo-ment—this pain rooted in forced Indian res-ervations and the buying and selling of human beings, lest we forget, it will surely surface and seek to cause havoc and pain until it is faced and fixed. The events of late teach all of us, as if any had doubt; that America is not healed yet. The work is not done. It seems just yesterday that Jewish cemeteries were vandalized, or just the other day that terrorist bombed a mosque or burned churches in the south. Were they just isolated incidents? No, but somehow they connected us and called us to feel, to be awake, to be alert—to mobilize for good. And here we are again. Charlottesville conjured up old feelings. Many who marched in Charlottesville that day, as we watched, most of us glued to the television, as they boldly marched, unhooded this time, khaki wearing white men, with their contorted angry faces, and carrying tiki torches, trying it seemed to desperately symbolize their power, their might, but only succeeding to pull back the scab and memory of historic oppression, failing to offer even a flickering of light, and of peace. We watched with sadness while they shouted hateful words and embodied a most detestable part of the American mosaic, frankly, only mak-ing many of us remember and feel the acute sickness that is still a part of America. For those who marched with counter intent, with ‘‘never again’’ etched upon their hearts, with ‘‘non-violent direct action’’ embedded in their spirit, many of them young people who have gotten the lessons that many of us who are older have tried to teach. So many coun-teracted and confronted, they stood tall and whether we liked it or not, they stood their ground and they gave us hope that one day the pain would give way to promise. We can take heart, because through them we knew that ‘‘we shall indeed, overcome.’’ But dearly, we have not yet reached that Promised Land. We have not yet fully em-braced the place that Dr. King and Rabbi Hershel who marched arm in arm tried to show and to teach us. We haven’t yet felt how Malcom who epitomized both the hope and the worry of the movement for justice, worry that integrity in the movement would be comprised given the times they were in, yet united with a yearning to taste real free-dom for all. All of them understood that jus-tice had a cost attached to it. However, we still haven’t learned yet, how to include all the voices, sit with all the pain, open and feel all of the diverse ways we are together, but there is hope shining through, maybe given the Boston event, that we will get there. The beloved community will one day be! Think of the blueprint that was left to us, the light that was given and passed to us, as they each in their own ways, gave their lives to pass on to us, a real hope for a better tomorrow. What I guess Charlottesville has chal-lenged me to do, is to keep singing songs of justice, keep speaking words of peace. The challenge is to sing a new song in this often strange land, this place where America is still striving to form a more perfect union, this place where free speech should always be celebrated, must always be protected, but never allowed by any to be abused. We are called to sing together the words of peace, the words of hope, sing so as to feel that hope and that peace until it is never forgot-ten, until it is so deeply felt that no one is left behind without voice or value. So we come together again, gathered by the many ways God gathers us, we come to-gether to sing even when we may not feel like singing, sing even though the words may not always be dear to us or the language un-derstood by everyone is not plain. We come together to share words of peace, even when it seems the world is bent upon acts of vio-lent expression. We come together knowing that love trumps hate, that without love and hope we perish, so we hope, we believe and work for a better day. Maya Angelou was right, people will never forget—when it is felt. It is our work, to help each other feel the presence of peace. It’s our work to care for one another, to bind up those who are broken, to repair the world and make the world a just place for all. This is our work to feel, not the hate that some would have us feel, but to offer a binding, sustaining and enduring feeling that builds community and opens hearts to know and feel that another world is possible. It is there, don’t you feel it, can’t you see it? It is there, just over the horizon. Let’s go there together! Thank you.’’ f PERSONAL EXPLANATION

DESIGNATION OF MAPLE VALLEY, WASHINGTON AS A PURPLE HEART CITY 
HON. DAVID G. REICHERT 
OF WASHINGTON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 18, 2017 Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize the City of Maple Valley, in light of its designation as a Purple Heart City. The City of Maple Valley will be the first in Wash-ington’s Eighth Congressional District to be-come a Purple Heart, as well as the third city in the State of Washington. Additionally, the designation falls on the anniversary of 9/11, an event that will forever be seen in our hearts as a symbol of strength, hope, and freedom. The Purple Heart is awarded to wounded members of the armed forces of the United States as a combat decoration for their com-mitment to our great country. As you visit the City of Maple Valley, you will find a road sign explaining the Purple Heart significance, which reminds all those visiting, of the sacrifice made for a just and free civilization. Further-more, I would like to also thank the Boy Scout Troop 711 for building the display case for the plaques and other Purple Heart memorabilia, for the public to observe, learn and enjoy. I thank the City of Maple Valley for its dedi-cation to our armed forces who’ve risked their lives for ours. The City will not only be known as a beautiful place for wilderness, recreation and to raise a family; but one as an allegiance to our public servants.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Gouverneur Health and its dedi-cated professional staff and volunteers for the critical work they are doing for patients and families in New York City. Gouverneur Health is a Medicare and Med-icaid certified center. It is one of the largest in-stitutions in Lower Manhattan, and the largest freestanding ambulatory care center in New York State. Gouverneur Health has taken care of the ever-changing population of the Lower East Side for more than a century. Gouverneur’s dedicated and professional staff removes bar-riers caused by language, culture and income, enabling patients to make informed decisions vital to their physical, mental and social well- being. With Gouverneur’s help, our neighbors re-ceive important disease prevention information and screenings to ensure a healthy future for children and hard-working families. These im-portant services have grown and evolved over the past century, proving that the hospital is responsive to the needs of the community. As they celebrate 132 years of tremendous work, I am confident that NYC Health + Hos-pitals Gouverneur will continue to build on its history of service and find many more years of success.

HONORING ANGELO R. MARTINELLI 
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 18, 2017 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my friend and former colleague in gov-ernment, Angelo R. Martinelli, who has done so much to strengthen and promote the Yon-kers community and beyond. Though known as a Yonkers staple, Angelo was actually born in the Bronx and grew up in Mt. Vernon. After graduating from high school, he enlisted in the United States Army and was honorably discharged in 1946 with the rank of Sergeant. Upon returning home, Angelo worked in the family business, The Yonkers Daily Times, and in 1948 he bought the Gazette Press, the oldest printing firm in Westchester County. In 1973, Angelo was elected Mayor of the City of Yonkers. He served from 1974 to 1979 and again from 1982 to 1987, making him the longest-tenured mayor of Yonkers. During his career, Angelo held a number of other offices and positions in national and state organiza-tions, which earned him a reputation as an ef-fective and forceful advocate for municipal government interests, especially in the areas of senior-citizen and anti-crime programs. In addition, Angelo has served on the Board of Directors of the Yonkers Police Athletic League since 1991 and as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Yonkers Chamber of Commerce for 22 years. In 1976, he was one of the founding members of the Untermyer Performing Arts Council. He previously served on the Board of St. Joseph’s Medical Center and was Chairman of the Advisory Board of St. Patrick’s Home for the Aged and Infirm. He was also the President of the Queen’s Daugh-ters Day Care Center, and, in January 1984, Mercy College conferred upon him an Hon-orary Doctorate of Humane Letters. Angelo has always been a passionate man when it comes to public service, but his great-est passion and love always belonged to his family. He was married to his beloved late wife, Carol, for 65 years. Together their family grew to include their six sons, five daughters- in-law, twelve grandchildren, and seven great- grandchildren. In 2016, Angelo once again demonstrated his commitment and love for the City of Yonkers, by donating the funds to re-store the Temple of Love at the historic Untermyer Gardens in memory of his late wife, Carol. The donation served as a beautiful trib-ute to both his city and the amazing woman he loved. It is truly an honor to have a friend like An-gelo, just as it is an honor for me to recognize him here today. I thank Angelo for his years of service to our community. Yonkers is surely a better place for all he has done on its be-half. f 
DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018 
SPEECH OF  
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, September 12, 2017 
The House in Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union had under consideration the bill (H.R. 3354) making ap-propriations for the Department of the Inte-rior, environment, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2018, and for other purposes: 
Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of my amendment numbered 86 to Division C of H.R. 3354 printed in House Report 115–297 to direct the National Institute of Standards and Technology to establish standards for ac-ceptable levels of pyrrhotite in concrete aggre-gate, and to continue providing technical as-sistance to those interested in pyrrhotite de-tection, prevention, and mitigation tools. Pyrrhotite is a rare natural mineral that has been found in higher than normal concentra-tions in stone aggregate used in concrete poured for residential foundations in northern Connecticut and Massachusetts. Over time, pyrrhotite oxidizes, expanding within the foun-dation and causing the foundation wall to bow and crack. Severe cracking weakens the foun-dation to the point of collapse over a period of 10–15 years, and potentially thousands of homeowners in the region could see their homes collapse. By establishing standards for pyrrhotite con-tent, NIST could prevent a similar problem from occurring in residential buildings in other areas. In addition, providing technical assist-ance to those already affected by this problem will help establish best practices for mitigation of pyrrhotite-related damage. I look forward to continuing to work with the Appropriations Committee and the agency on this important issue, and I urge the adoption of my amend-ment. f

Throughout the years, Barbara and Kari have been deeply involved in our community and it comes as no surprise they have each been named by the Kern County Fair as 2017 Per-son of the Year. Every year, the Kern County Fair attracts families from all over the Central Valley to par-take in the unique festivities ranging from the Great American Duck Race to the highly-com-petitive 4–H livestock showcases. However, we also take time to acknowledge and pay tribute to individuals who have improved our community with the Person of the Year award. While Barbara and Kari may be known for their leadership roles with the world’s largest carrot operation through their family-owned farm, Grimmway Enterprises, Inc., they have each played an integral part in the betterment of our community. Notably, in 1998, Grimmway Enterprises created a college scholarship program for the children of their employees that has provided access to higher education through more than 300 college scholarships. Through their philanthropic endeavors, Bar-bara and Kari have been instrumental in help-ing students in rural regions of the Central Valley prepare for college, while also working to address the increasing prevalence of child-hood diabetes and obesity through various programs and outreach efforts. Barbara founded and currently serves as the CEO of the Grimm Family Education Foundation and has worked tirelessly to estab-lish rural charter schools throughout Kern County to ensure students have access to a world-class education. In August 2011, the Foundation opened the Grimmway Academy in Arvin, California, enrolling more than 280 students Kindergarten through third grade. Today, the Academy has two campuses, one in Arvin and the other in Shafter, with total en-rollment surpassing 1,200 students for the 2017–2018 school year. Additionally, the Foundation recently opened the Buena Vista Edible Schoolyard, dedicated to exposing stu-dents to the many facets of agricultural and environmental stewardship in the region. Kari is widely known for her insight and con-tributions to a number of civically-minded groups, including the Board of Directors for the Junior League of Bakersfield and the Board of Regents at Concordia University, Irvine. Similarly, Barbara has dedicated her time serving on various boards, such as the Lori Brock Children’s Museum, St. John’s Lu-theran Church, the California State University

We look forward to wit-nessing their continued efforts that touch the hearts of so many.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF CRAIG ANDERSON 
HON. JARED HUFFMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 18, 2017 Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Craig Anderson and his 20 years of active stewardship as the Executive Director of LandPaths, a non-profit organiza-tion in Sonoma County that has become a na-tional innovator in land conservation practices under his leadership. Craig Anderson’s career has consistently engaged his dual passions of land conserva-tion and community engagement. Beginning in 1985, Mr. Anderson worked at the Yosemite Institute where he taught field science courses to high school students. Four years later he became the Director of Outdoor Classroom Programs for the Ojai Valley School, leading students on wilderness trips that exposed some of them to land use and natural history curriculum for the first time. During that same period, Mr. Anderson took his knowledge from the classroom and applied it in the field, when he became the site manager for the McCloud River Preserve. As the site manager he oversaw all activities taking places across the 2,200 acre preserve on a daily basis. All of these experiences prepared Mr. Anderson for his next role as the Executive Director of Land Paths, a position he took on in 1997, and con-tinues to hold to this day. As the Executive Director of Land Paths, Mr. Anderson has grown the organization from a single staff member working out of his apart-ment to a staff of 15. Pushing the organiza-tion’s mission of connecting people to nature, Mr. Anderson successfully spearheaded the agency’s efforts to create nature preserves with public access. LandPaths has created five such preserves throughout Sonoma Coun-ty as a result of his leadership to date. In addi-tion to these efforts, Mr. Anderson led the de-velopment of the award winning Bayer-Farm Park & Community Garden, which has now been held up as a model for expanding green spaces in urban areas. Because of his fore-sight in developing local preserves and com-munity gardens, LandPaths has also been able to create student and community stew-ardship programs that use these properties to ensure the public’s commitment to environ-mental conservation and land use practices. Beyond the local impact of Mr. Anderson’s leadership, he has also been recognized on a national level for his innovative practices and stewardship programs. Mr. Speaker, please join me in expressing deep appreciation for Craig Anderson’s ex-traordinary leadership in the field of land use, conservation and stewardship, by extending to him congratulations on his two decades of service. f 
SUPPORTING THE LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION 
HON. DAVID G. REICHERT 
OF WASHINGTON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 18, 2017 Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in sup-port of the Legal Services Corporation and its important work across the country in facili-tating civil legal aid for those in need. Civil legal aid is one of the most effective strategies for helping victims of domestic vio-lence and that is why our federal government must make a strong investment in the Legal Services Corporation (LSC), which administers federal funding for civil legal aid. From my over 33 years in law enforcement, I know all too well that unlike people who commit crimes, victims do not always have the same opportunity for an attorney. For a low-in-come individual in need of help with a civil legal issue, paying expensive legal fees for an attorney is not an option. And for people who are in abusive relationships, the thought of navigating the legal system alone can often be what keeps them from leaving their abuser. Research shows that providing an attorney can reduce the number of domestic violence victims by as much as 21 percent. A 2015 study out of King County, WA, where I was the Sheriff, found that when survivors received legal representation they were 85 percent more likely to have child visitation rights de-nied to the abusive parent, 77 percent more likely to have restrictions placed on the abu-sive parent’s child visitation, and 47 percent more likely to have treatment ordered for the abusive parent. Our great nation was founded on the prin-ciple of justice for all, not just for those who can afford it. When low-income families and survivors of domestic violence are forced to face the justice system on their own, it is a failure of our society. As the appropriations process moves forward, I urge you to support and strengthen funding for the Legal Services Corporation.

RECOGNIZING MARK GOTTO 
HON. MIKE COFFMAN 
OF COLORADO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 18, 2017 Mr. COFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my appreciation to Mark Gotto, Cen-tennial City Council Member for District 3 Mark Gotto, for his many years of hard work and dedication to the City of Centennial. Council Member Gotto’s leadership and vision has, amongst other accomplishments, contributed to the City of Centennial’s reputation as one of the best in Colorado. Council Member Gotto has consistently and effectively guided the City of Centennial to-wards a more business-friendly atmosphere that increases growth and the quality of life. He has continually provided his guidance and leadership as the City Council Liaison to a va-riety of different boards and committees, such as the Centennial Budget Committee, the Southgate Water and Sanitation District, and the Arapahoe Library District Board of Trust-ees. Outside of his service on the Centennial City Council, Council Member Gotto has also dedicated his time making our community and the State of Colorado a better place. He con-tinues to volunteer at the Children’s Hospital of Colorado on the Anschutz Medical Campus and ensures that the Centennial City Council does not pass any resolution that would nega-tively affect the aging population in his city. Mr. Speaker, City Council Member Mark Gotto represents the very best the State of Colorado and our nation has to offer in public service. I offer my sincere appreciation for his unyielding dedication to public service, and I wish him the very best of luck as he leaves the Centennial City Council and moves on to future endeavors. f 
HONORING THE 50TH ANNIVER-SARY OF THE SMITHSONIAN’S ANACOSTIA COMMUNITY MU-SEUM 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 18, 2017 Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask the House of Representatives to join me in honoring the 50th Anniversary of the Smithsonian’s Anacostia Community Museum. The Anacostia Community Museum, which opened in 1967, has been a staple of the Dis-trict of Columbia community. Not only has the museum served as a major cultural institution, including in highlighting the important contribu-tions made by African Americans to D.C. and the nation, but it has also served as a pillar of educational enrichment and achievement through its Museum Academy Program. In ad-dition, the museum’s Citizen Scientist Program brings high school students and Smithsonian educators, as well as scientists, together to engage in environmental stewardship and learn more about science, technology, engi-neering and mathematics initiatives. The museum also continues to be a domi-nant force in terms of community engagement, creating a hands-on children’s room and a youth advisory council. Additionally, the mu-seum works on a number of events and projects that focus on community restoration within Anacostia. For example, the museum recently hosted a community forum with the National Park Service to illustrate the impor-tance of volunteering within one’s community and also partnered with WTTG Fox 5 to allow visitors to participate in an urban gardening project. Aside from its community engagement and restoration, the Anacostia Community Museum showcases various exhibits that focus on the different issues that impact urban commu-nities, both in D.C. and nationwide. Specifi-cally, the museum works with D.C. residents, artists, community activists, scholars, local offi-cials and other outside organizations to cul-tivate carefully crafted exhibits that challenge

museum visitors to think critically and enhance their museum experience. Therefore, I ask the House of Representa-tives to join me in honoring the Anacostia Community Museum, an institution that con-tinues to remain at the forefront of addressing social and political issues that affect individ-uals in D.C. and the nation, as it celebrates its 50th Anniversary.

CELEBRATING THE 50TH ANNIVER-SARY OF JONATHAN WILLIAMS PLAZA 
HON. NYDIA M. VELA´ZQUEZ 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 18, 2017 Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of Jonathan Williams Plaza, a New York City Public Hous-ing Authority (NYCHA) development located in my district in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. This complex is home to more than 1,340 resi-dents. Built at the height of the Civil Rights movement, and three decades after the New Deal and the 1934 Federal Housing Act, Wil-liams Plaza’s towering buildings have long symbolized innovation and hope. Williams Plaza has provided a sound foun-dation and pathway to self-sufficiency for thou-sands of its residents. The stability it provides families is what helped launch the educational achievement and careers of former public housing residents like U.S. Supreme Court Sonia Sotomayor. Williams Plaza provides meaningful support and services for its residents. Under NYCHA’s Family Partnerships initiative, residents are able to connect to critical resources that help support family stability and tenancy. It offers job training opportunities, on-site afterschool partnership and accessible childcare in addi-tion to NYCHA’s city-wide network of social services. On this special 50th year celebration, I also would like to recognize the Jonathan Williams Plaza Tenant Association for their vol-unteerism. The community service they pro-vide improves the quality of life for their neigh-bors and surrounding community. They are a valuable asset to NYCHA and the resident stakeholders. I also want to recognize Mr. Juan Bello, Housing Manager and his team for their unwavering dedication to residents. I sa-lute the following: Mr. Joel Gross—Tenant Association Presi-dent Ben Zion Weiss—Vice-President Abraham Frankel—Treasurer Joanne Sanchez—Corresponding Secretary Joel Schwartz—Secretary Louise Sanon—Sergeant At Arms Housing Manager—Mr. Juan Bello Superintendent—Marian Polowcyk Housing Assistant—Nina Dinkevich Maintenance Staffer—Efrain Quintana Caretaker—Andrew Adams Resident Volunteer—Abraham Frankel Resident Volunteer—Pedro Roman HONORING MAJOR GENERAL GREGORY S. CHAMPAGNE HON. BLAINE LUETKEMEYER 
OF MISSOURI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 18, 2017 Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the retirement of Major General Gregory S. Champagne who will retire from the United States Air Force and the Missouri Air National Guard on November 1, 2017 with 36 years of dedicated service. Since his com-missioning, Major General Champagne has spent his career as a Missouri Air National Guardsman and currently serves as the Air National Guard Advisor to the Commander, Air Force Global Strike Command at the Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana where training, equipping, and maintenance for all United States intercontinental ballistic missile and bomber forces are conducted. The Air Force Global Strike Command provides stra-tegic deterrence, global strike, and combat support and houses the nation’s inventory of Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles, B–1, B–2, and B–52 bomber aircraft under its nine wings. In 1981, Major General Champagne re-ceived his commission through the Academy of Military Science. He has served on numer-ous assignments such as wing staff assign-ments, logistics and flying operations and has flown in combat missions in Operations Pro-vide Comfort and Southern Watch. Further-more, he commanded the 207th Air Expedi-tionary Group at Tallil Air Base, in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Prior to his current post, Major General Champagne was Com-mander, 131st Bomb Wing, Missouri Air Na-tional Guard, and Whiteman Air Force Base. At Whiteman, he oversaw the National Guard’s only B–2 unit that provides nearly 1,100 combat-ready Airmen for both state and federal missions. Throughout his many years of service, Major General Champagne has received nu-merous awards and decorations including: Le-gion of Merit with oak leaf cluster, Bronze Star Medal, Meritorious Service Medal with two oak leaf clusters, Air Force Commendation Medal, Army Commendation Medal, Air Force Achievement Medal, Joint Meritorious Unit Award, Air Force Outstanding Unit Award with oak leaf cluster, Combat Readiness Medal with two silver oak leaf clusters and two bronze oak leaf clusters, National Defense Service Medal with bronze star, Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal with bronze star, and Iraq Campaign Medal with bronze star. Major General Champagne intends to spend precious moments with his wife, Cheri Cham-pagne and his sons, 1st Lieutenant Clayton Champagne and wife, Cara, and Captain Tyler Champagne and wife, Kris and his grandson Nicolas. I ask you to join me in recognizing this dis-tinguished public servant, Major General Greg-ory S. Champagne on his retirement after 36 years of dedicated service to our nation. This retirement is well deserved.
