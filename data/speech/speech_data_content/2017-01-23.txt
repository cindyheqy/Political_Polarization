Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, there is no better sign of a healthy economy than a healthy real estate market. We know this in this country from bitter experience since the real estate and financial collapse of 2008. In my State in Connecticut, we are barely at a place now where home sales and home equity has even come in a positive direction and climbing back towards what existed back in 2008 when the collapse occurred. Listening to the President’s speech on Friday where he very powerfully talked about the forgotten American, middle class individuals and working people who really felt that they were left behind in terms of the work that happens in this city, he clearly touched a nerve that propelled him to the White House. As I said, it was probably the most powerful part of his message that he delivered on Friday. I mention that because it was astonishing that within an hour after taking the oath, President Trump signed an executive order rolling back a rate reduction for mortgage insurance for homeowners. What that means is that for many homeowners—particularly firsttime home buyers—they need to have mortgage insurance in order to qualify for a mortgage. That ensures that if there is a default, that the mortgage will be paid off. It derisks the loan so that, again, particularly people who are firsttime home buyers can actually buy a house. The Federal Housing Administration, FHA, runs this mortgage insurance program. Again, there was a rate reduction that was slated to go into effect on January 27, from 0.85 percent down to 0.6 percent. President Trump canceled that reduction. So what does that mean? The National Association of Realtors, which is hardly a partisan group, has, in the wake of that order, released numbers that about 750,000 to 800,000 homeowners are going to be adversely affected by losing those savings that are just going to go to the government, by the way. Those mortgage premiums basically are paid into the government. And right now there is a surplus in that account, which is why the rate reduction was slated to go into effect. There is no reason for the government to be overcharging for mortgage insurance, given the healthy balance that exists in that mortgage insurance account. They also calculate that 30,000 to 40,000 home buyers will not buy a home in 2017 because of that order that was issued on Friday. Again, these are people who—$500 to $1,000, which is going to come out of their pocket in terms of higher payments because of this executive order—are basically going to be priced out of buying a home. The home builders, the realtors, the people who are closest to the market and clearly are not partisan—I mean, I know a lot of these guys in my district, and they are staunch Republicans in many cases—are dumbfounded at the fact that that order, of all things, within the first hours of the new administration, would be a priority for, again, the new Trump administration. We have work to do in terms of getting this economy turned around, but if you look at home ownership, home construction, buying a house, having a healthy real estate market, that is absolutely the sweet spot of trying to succeed in this country. We do not need to be overcharging Americans for mortgage insurance, which, again, is the gateway for home ownership, particularly at that lower end of the market. Because every time someone buys a house for $200,000 or $250,000 in Connecticut, which is towards the lower end, or even lower in other parts of the country, that frees up existing homeowners either to buy up or to retire or get a condo. When those people are locked out—which raising these mortgage insurance premiums are going to effectively do—we are just stifling the real estate market from recovering. That is a bad start in terms of an administration that says it is about growing America’s economy. I will pledge to my constituents that I am going to do everything I can to reverse that unwise order and help the folks who are out there doing the hard work of selling houses, building houses, hiring people, to accomplish their goal because when they succeed, America succeeds. f 
RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess until 2 p.m. today. Accordingly (at 12 o’clock and 11 minutes p.m.), the House stood in recess. 
b1400 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. WOMACK ) at 2 p.m. 
PRAYER The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: Thank You, God, for giving us another day. This prayer is authored by a high school class at St. Anne Episcopal in West Chester, Ohio. Dear God, we ask You to bless our country during this time of leadership transition. We ask that You guide the people of this land, and all nations, to honor one another, serve the common good, and promote the dignity and freedom of every person. We pray that everyone who rules this country might pursue peace and justice. We pray for wisdom, humility, and mercy to be in the hearts of our leaders as they make decisions for the welfare of all people. We ask that You allow our world’s leaders, and those who have the burden of any power or authority, to execute their actions for the justice of the world and in harmony with Your word. Please help to guide the President as he takes on his role. Ease his mind so that he is able to do his job. Help him to keep in mind the thoughts of others, to have a listening heart and an open mind, and to remember that he is a representative of all people of this country. Help him to do the will of what is best for the Nation. We pray to You, O God, for the world’s security, safety, and tranquility. Please let there be a guiding light to peace for all people and an end to all war and violence. In Your name, we pray. Amen. 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the gentleman from Florida (Mr. BILIRAKIS ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
PRAY FOR VICTIMS OF STORM IN GEORGIA (Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I have the great privilege of representing a beautiful part of this country. Many of you have seen it on the news lately. Cook County is ground zero for the storms that hit this past weekend. We have seven deaths in Cook County, two in Berrien, two in Brooks, four in Dougherty—outside of my district—and we have four lives lost in Mississippi as well. As I speak to you, the Georgia Forestry Commission is searching for five who are unaccounted for with cadaver dogs. I would ask that you pray for the families who have lost so much, and I would ask that we also pray that they find those who are unaccounted for. Mr. Speaker, I want to say one thank you as well to the first responders, the volunteers, those from other counties who have provided mutual aid, and the churches who have opened their doors to take care of those who have lost their homes. Thank you. And I also want to thank Governor Deal and President Trump, both of whom were available yesterday to offer their support and pledge to help our communities rebuild. 
WOMEN’S HEALTH ATTACKS (Ms. FRANKEL of Florida asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. Speaker, the age of coat hanger medicine has returned. It may be a new year, a new Congress, a new administration, but Republicans are taking us back to a dangerous past, one where women were maimed and killed by backalley abortions. Today, our new President signed an executive order restricting safe abortions for women around the world. And tomorrow, Republicans will vote to block American women from access to full reproductive care. Our government is about to enter our bedrooms and take the lives and liberty of our women and our families. With every breath, we must fight back. 
CONSTITUENT EXPERIENCES WITH OBAMACARE (Mr. BUCSHON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Speaker, last week, I met with a group of my constituents to discuss their experiences with the Affordable Care Act. Here is what I heard: My deductible went from $2,500 to $6,000, so it wasn’t even worth it. The first year wasn’t too bad until I found out I needed a knee replacement, said a constituent who found out her surgery wouldn’t be covered because her physician was excluded from her plan’s network. A professor who saw his hours cut after passage of ObamaCare and lost his insurance because it didn’t comply with the law’s mandates said: I had to get a second job and sometimes a third job, and it made it very difficult. A local small business owner saw premiums on his group plan increase by as much as $2,500 a month for family coverage and $975 a month for single employee coverage. There were skyrocketing premiums, unaffordable deductibles, restricted access to physicians, and loss of coverage. Mr. Speaker, these are real stories from real people in my district who want relief from the Affordable Care Act. We are working to save patients from this disastrous law and to build a better healthcare system that lowers costs, expands access, and empowers patients. f 
MORTGAGE INSURANCE HURTS HOMEOWNERS (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I was really disappointed that, on his first day in office, President Trump took action through executive order to make it more difficult for hardworking families to own a home. With this executive order that the President signed, again, on day one, he canceled a scheduled FHA directive that would have saved American homeowners hundreds of dollars a year. Under President Obama, millions of Americans were set to receive hundreds of dollars in reduction in those fees, saving on their mortgage payments, saving on their monthly payment. Under this executive order, not only will Americans with mortgages pay more than they would have, but it will also prevent many Americans from being able to own a home. In fact, according to the National Association of Realtors, 40,000 American families who could have purchased a home will not have access to that part of the American Dream because of this executive order by President Trump. This has a real impact. Rather than obsessing about the size of crowds at inaugurations, we ought to focus on this. This is real news. FLOOD INSURANCE INTEGRITY ACT (Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss important legislation I will soon be introducing in this Congress, the Flood Insurance Integrity Act. Flooding and flood insurance are major issues for Florida and my district. Our community along the coast is prone to experiencing hurricanes and tropical storms on a regular basis. Flood insurance is a must where we live. But right now, the National Flood Insurance Program bases its flood insurance rates on maps that can be 50 years or older. Many are completely out of date and often inaccurate. It is also one of the reasons that NFIP is over $23 billion in debt. The Flood Insurance Integrity Act will require an open and transparent annual review of flood maps. It sounds good. Americans who need flood insurance should be able to trust that their flood insurance premiums accurately reflect their flood risk. It is the least we can do. So that is why this bill seeks to do that. f 
MOURNING THE LOSS OF DETECTIVE JERRY WALKER (Mr. BURGESS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the memory of Detective Jerry Walker of Little Elm, Texas. Detective Walker was lost in the line of duty last week when he responded to an emergency call that involved an active shooter. This great loss has cast a shadow of sadness over our closeknit community. This is the first time in the city’s history that we have lost an officer in the line of duty. Detective Walker was a dedicated member of our police force and community. He was a husband, a father, a mentor, and a friend to many. I had the privilege of meeting Detective Walker when he was on duty at one of my townhall meetings in the summer of 2014. His dedication to protecting the residents of Little Elm was evident in all that he did. Dallas Cowboys’ wide receiver Cole Beasley sums up this loss precisely saying: ‘‘We lost a good one.’’ Our town of Little Elm continues to mourn the loss of one of our heroes. His service to our community will not be forgotten. I extend my deepest sympathy to Detective Walker’s family and will continue to keep them in my prayers. 
EXCESSES OF MILITARY INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX (Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, Bret Baier of Fox News has a new book called, ‘‘Three Days in January.’’ It is primarily about President Eisenhower’s warnings against the excesses of the militaryindustrial complex. Today, we have a militaryindustrial security complex that is more about money than it is about any realistic threat. I think President Eisenhower would be shocked at how far we have traveled down the road against which he warned us. Our new President has spoken out against the excessive, exorbitant cost of some of our newest military equipment and weapons systems. The only way we will ever bring these costs under control is if we stop the revolving door at the Pentagon, where the defense contractors hire all of the retired admirals and generals. President Eisenhower once said: Heaven help us if we ever have a President who doesn’t know as much about the military as he did. We need more leaders who have the guts to say ‘‘no’’ to the excessive spending by the militaryindustrial complex. 
SCHOOL CHOICE WEEK 2017 (Mr. ALLEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, at the heart of our American values is the belief that each of us, no matter our circumstance, can pursue our own success through hard work. That is how a small town boy like me wound up a businessman in Augusta and now a Member of Congress. The value of education cannot be underestimated on the path to achieve the American Dream. That is why I proudly support school choice. Support for school choice is growing. Evidence shows that 70 percent of Americans are in favor. A great success story is in Dublin, Georgia, located in my district. Parents can choose an elementary school with learning tracks based on a student’s individual needs and interest. And those tracks continue through their childhood education. I am very proud to say that Dublin High School has a 96.3 percent graduation rate. God created every child to be unique, each with special gifts and ideas that only he or she may have. Families should have the opportunity to select a K–12 education and environment that is best suited for their children. 
EL DORADO FURNITURE 50TH ANNIVERSARY (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise today to recognize El Dorado Furniture, a familyowned business in my congressional district celebrating its 50th anniversary. El Dorado was founded by Manuel Capo and his two sons Luis and Carlos within a year of arriving to the United States after fleeing Cuba due to the rise of the evil Castro regime. They deemed it only appropriate to name their store El Dorado named after the small boat upon which they sailed to freedom to our lovely country. Today, there are 14 locations throughout Florida, and it is recognized as the largest Hispanicowned furniture retail business in the country. Not only does this company provide hundreds of jobs, but it also partners with numerous organizations in order to give back to the community and to those in need. I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating El Dorado Furniture’s 50th anniversary, and congratulate the Capo family, and wish them all the best and continued success in the years ahead. f 
b1415 MEMBERS URGED TO JOIN GERMANAMERICAN CAUCUS (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise to highlight the good work of the Congressional GermanAmerican Caucus and to urge new Members of the House to consider joining. I am cochairman of the caucus with Representative BILL KEATING from Massachusetts. The caucus seeks to highlight the friendship and the alliance between the United States and Germany. We do so through an Oktoberfest networking event and through our support of programs like the CongressBundestag Youth Exchange internship program. The caucus also discusses timely topics, such as trade, security, and foreign affairs, and how they relate to our German counterparts. Mr. Speaker, German heritage has become widespread in America. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Germans are the largest single ethnic group in the United States. Frederick Muhlenberg, a German immigrant and Lutheran pastor from Pennsylvania, whose family also founded Muhlenberg College, was the first Speaker of this House following the signing of the new Constitution. Our caucus has nearly 100 members in the House, and I urge all of those who are interested in joining to do so today. IN RECOGNITION OF WILEY WASDEN, JR. (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Mr. Wiley Anderson Wasden, Jr., from Savannah, Georgia, who passed away on January 18, 2017, just a few days shy of his 80th birthday. Born in Millen, Georgia, to his parents, Wiley Senior and Katherine, Mr. Wasden moved to Savannah after graduating from high school in 1953. He then began studies at the University of Georgia, where he joined the Phi Delta Theta Fraternity and ignited his interest in government. Throughout his life, Mr. Wasden continued this interest in government and used it to make the State of Georgia a better place to live, eventually serving as chairman of the Georgia State Republican Party and as a Georgia State senator. Outside of government, Mr. Wasden worked hard for his community. He was a wellrespected local Realtor in Savannah while he also served as chairman of the board for Savannah Country Day School. I am proud today to recognize Mr. Wasden’s outstanding life and the positive impact he made on the State of Georgia. He will certainly be missed. f 
RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess until approximately 3:30 p.m. today. Accordingly (at 2 o’clock and 16 minutes p.m.), the House stood in recess. 
b1529 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee) at 3 o’clock and 29 minutes p.m. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 511) to provide for consideration of the extension under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of nonapplication of NoLoad Mode energy efficiency standards to certain security 
or life safety alarms or surveillance systems, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 511 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Power And Security Systems (PASS) Act’’. 
SEC. 2. EXTENSION OF NONAPPLICATION OF NO LOAD MODE ENERGY EFFICIENCY STANDARD TO CERTAIN SECURITY OR LIFE SAFETY ALARM OR SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS. 
(a) Section 325(u)(3)(D)(ii) of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6295(u)(3)(D)(ii)) is amended— (1) by striking ‘‘2015’’ each place it appears and inserting ‘‘2021’’; and (2) by striking ‘‘2017’’ and inserting ‘‘2023’’. (b) Section 325(u)(3)(E) of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6295(u)(3)(E)) is amended— (1) in clause (ii), by striking ‘‘July 1, 2017,’’ and inserting ‘‘the effective date of the amendment under subparagraph (D)(ii)’’; and (2) by adding at the end the following: ‘‘(iv) TREATMENT IN RULE .—In the rule under subparagraph (D)(ii) and subsequent amendments the Secretary may treat some or all external power supplies designed to be connected to a security or life safety alarm or surveillance system as a separate product class or may extend the nonapplication under clause (ii).’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. UPTON ) and the gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. DEGETTE ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan. 
Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous materials in the RECORD on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Michigan? There was no objection. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 511. I would note that this is our colleague Mr. WELCH ’s bill that moved through the regular process through the Committee on Energy and Commerce last year. It received extensive bipartisan support. I am again glad to move this bill today. External power supplies, EPS, are used with a wide variety of devices, and we have learned from experience that the Federal energy efficiency standards for them are not compatible with some of these applications. In particular, we need an exemption from these rules for security and life safety alarms and surveillance systems. This bill, H.R. 511, the Power And Security Systems (PASS) Act, provides a targeted exemption that allows these critical systems to stay on the market. Devices like home security alarms or fire detection systems need to be on 24/ 7, but the 2007 energy law requiring energy efficiency standards for external power supplies did not allow for this. Subsequent legislation created an exemption for external power supplies used with these alwayson devices. This exemption will end on July 1 of this year. This bill extends that exemption until 2023. The result of the bill would be that these important security systems will continue to be available, preserving the jobs of those who make them and certainly the safety of those who use them. As with H.R. 518, the other external power supply bill that we are addressing today, these provisions enjoyed strong bipartisan and bicameral support when they were added to last year’s energy bill. They also passed under suspension last year. I urge my colleagues to once again vote ‘‘yes’’ on this measure. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 511, the Power And Security Systems, or PASS, Act. As Chairman UPTON said, this bill will provide an important technical exemption for certain security and life safety products from energy efficiency standards set forth in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. As Mr. UPTON said, a provision in the law increased the energy efficiency requirements for battery chargers and external power supplies, something which this side of the aisle very strongly supported. However, the provision also mistakenly included security and life safety products and required that they be manufactured with a standby mode despite being products that are inherently always on. Without providing this correction, the security industry will need to spend millions of dollars to comply with an energy standard that will yield no energy savings and could cost jobs, which, of course, was never the original intent of the law. I am pleased that my colleagues Representatives WELCH and B ROOKS have reintroduced the bill, which the House passed last year but the Senate failed to move before the end of the last Congress. This is a commonsense and consensus fix to a simple problem. The language was developed by both industry and efficiency advocates, with technical assistance from the Department of Energy. It should come as no surprise that this bill enjoys broad support from the security industry and energy efficiency advocates. I urge all of my colleagues to support it. I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. WELCH ). Mr. WELCH. I thank my colleagues for their support, the former chairman of the committee and now chair of the Subcommittee on Energy. He is a very important person over there, and there are no words I could convey that would meet the reputation of Mr. UPTON . I thank him and Ms. DEGETTE very much. They have said a lot of the specific content of this bill. This is a situation where Congress passed a good law. There was a provision in it that needed to be corrected, and, lo and behold, Congress is correcting that provision. It is about these security devices that obviously can’t operate on nopower mode. They have got to be on. When the bad guys come in, we have got to be watching. That is really what this is all about. It is a combination of the bipartisan commitment that we have had to energy efficiency, especially last year. I do give Mr. UPTON a lot of credit for this. We have had a lot of debates in this Congress about climate change, about the science, and aside from—we don’t need to get into that—to embrace as we have in a bipartisan way, there are enormous benefits to efficiency every single place we can find it. This efficiency bill originally was applying to all these devices to put them in noload mode. That was cutting down on use of electricity. It was cutting down on carbon emissions. It was saving people money. But the noload obviously couldn’t apply to security devices. Last year, Mr. POMPEO , when he was a Congressman, supported this, and now that he is going to be our leader in the CIA, he knows you have got to keep that watching device on when the bad guys are lurking around. We are back this year. One of our first bills to be passed and hopefully signed by the President is the extension of the correction that we made sometime ago. I am delighted to be here with my colleagues in support of this legislation, getting this House of Representatives off to a constructive start. Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I urge passage of the bill. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I just again urge my colleagues to support this good bipartisan bill. I appreciate the kind words always by Mr. WELCH . I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 511, the ‘‘Power and Security Systems Act of 2017, which will revise energy conservation standards for devices operating in standby mode. In the early 1970s, I recall, as many of my colleagues do, the impact to our nation’s economy when OPEC nations withheld oil from the United States causing one of the greatest peacetime energy shortages in United States history. One of the remedial steps taken by the Carter Administration was the promulgation of regulations that required large appliances and equipment that used electricity to default to a power down mode when not in use. Today, we take for granted that machines power down when not in use, but this one change in energy policy over the last 4o years has saved taxpayers, which includes businesses and private homes, billions of dollars in energy costs. 
This was only one policy solution that was used to reduce our nation’s dependence on foreign oil so that energy could go to vital services like fuel for electricity generation, gasoline, heating fuels, and diesel oil. H.R. 511, the bill before us would extend energy conservation to digital technology that can operate in standby mode. Most digital device technology manufactures already provide sleep mode on their devices to assist their users in conserving power on cellphones, smartphones, MP3 players, e book readers, as well as desktop and laptop computers. Today, 68 percent of U.S. adults own a smartphone, up from 35 percent in 2011, and tablet computer ownership has edged up to 45 percent among adults, according to newly released survey data from the Pew Research Center. Considering not just smartphones, but all types of mobile phones, Pew notes that cellphones continue to top of the list. Roughly nineinten American adults or 92 percent own a mobile phone of some kind. Although these mobile devices are ubiquitous today, the share of adults who own one has risen substantially since 2004. Smartphone ownership is nearing the saturation point with some groups: 1. 86 percent of those ages 18–29; 2. 83 percent of those ages 30–49; and 3. 87 percent of those living in households earning $75,000 and up annually own smartphones. These facts highlight the importance of energy conservation for mobile communication users. The battery life for these devices is limited and without power they are of no use to the user. This bill will help users remain connected as long as possible because the energy consumption on their cellphones and other digital devices will be minimized when they are not in use. Energy conservation will also assist consumers during times when power outages may occur due to weather or other electricity disruption. The longer power life for cellphones will benefit consumers by reducing the amount of electricity needed to recharge their personal devices. This bill will also benefit businesses that often have many computers that when in use can consume electricity if left on after business hours—especially over weekends. For these reasons, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 511. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. UPTON ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 511. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
FAIR RATEPAYER ACCOUNTABILITY, TRANSPARENCY, AND EFFICIENCY STANDARDS ACT Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 587) to amend the Federal Power Act to provide that any inaction by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that allows a rate change to go into effect shall be treated as an order by the Commission for purposes of rehearing and court review. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 587 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Fair Ratepayer Accountability, Transparency, and Efficiency Standards Act’’ or the ‘‘Fair RATES Act’’. 
Subsection (d) of section 205 of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 824d(d)) is amended by adding at the end the following: ‘‘Any absence of action by the Commission that allows a change to take effect under this section, including the Commission allowing the sixty days’ notice herein provided to expire without Commission action, shall be treated as an order issued by the Commission accepting such change for purposes of section 313.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. UPTON ) and the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. KENNEDY ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan. 
Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous materials in the RECORD on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Michigan? There was no objection. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, as I complimented Mr. WELCH , I want to thank Mr. K ENNEDY  for his leadership on this bill. I would note that we passed this bill through regular order again in the last Congress, passed with bipartisan support. It is appropriate that we bring it up early this year. Again, this is another bipartisan bill. We must allow the public to have administrative process relief in those cases where FERC does not actually issue an order, and this legislation will do just that. I urge passage of the bill. The Federal Power Act sets forth processes to set rates for electricity, including opportunities for the public to protest a rate change filed with FERC. New rates take effect if FERC approves them or if FERC fails to issue an order approving or denying the filed rate within 60 days. The failure to approve or deny a rate may result from agency delay or, in some limited cases, from a vote that results in a deadlocked Commission, for example, a 2–2 vote. In such cases, the rates become effective by operation of law, even when these rates were not approved by a majority of Commissioners. The Federal Power Act, of course, provides administrative redress for members of the public to protest Commission rate decisions. However, if these rates become effective by operation of law, for example, that 2–2 deadlock, the administrative processes are not available to the public because FERC did not actually issue an order for the public to protest. The public literally gets shut out. I don’t want to speak for the gentleman from Massachusetts, but I think some of his constituents recently experienced this firsthand. As a result of that and of the hard work by Mr. KENNEDY and of his staff and certainly of the committee staff on both sides of the aisle, the legislation was drafted. We considered it in committee during the 114th Congress, where it passed on a voice vote. We have it on the floor today. I urge all Members to support this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank you for allowing me to discuss the Fair RATES Act, H.R. 587, and for bringing it to the floor today for a vote. I also want to thank the subcommittee chairman, Mr. UPTON , his staff, and, of course, during his tenure as chairman of the full committee, his staff, along with the staff of Mr. PALLONE and the chairman and ranking member of the subcommittees. We have worked on this legislation for now several years. It did pass unanimously, as Chairman UPTON indicated, on a bipartisan passage last year. I am grateful for his acknowledgment of that effort between our teams and that it is on the floor so early in this Congress. Because many of my colleagues have heard me speak about this at length and patiently listened as I dove too far into the weeds about forward capacity auctions, I am hoping to keep this part short and am happy to answer any questions that anyone may have. As the chairman alluded to, New England holds an energy capacity auction to ensure that we have sufficient energy supply to meet consumer demand. Mr. Speaker, 3 years ago, during an auction where there was a shortfall, those capacity payments tripled, skyrocketing from about $1 billion to $3 billion. That rate increase hasn’t even reached our constituents yet, but this June, a significant portion of their bills will triple due to that auction. When the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission reviewed that rate increase, they were down to four Commissioners, and they deadlocked 2–2. One Democratic Commissioner and one Republican Commissioner raised concerns about whether those rates were just and reasonable for consumers. Because of the deadlock, those rates took effect by operation of law without any action from FERC. With no official decision from the agency, there was no 
decision to appeal, leaving my constituents completely voiceless. Mr. Speaker, in 2 weeks, our region will hold that same annual auction, once again determining rates that will be passed along to families and businesses in my district 3 years down the road. Once again, FERC is understaffed, without a full complement of Commissioners to consider the new rate filings. Although the situation may sound complex and unique to New England, there is not a corner of this country that is immune from the unpredictability of American energy markets and the resulting burden our consumers and businesses are forced to bear as a result. That is why I urge my colleagues to pass this bill and enact a simple fix to a very complex problem. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER ), a new member of the committee but an old hand in Congress. b1545 Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 587, the Fair RATES Act. This bill would amend the Federal Power Act so that those who are adversely affected by inaction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on utility rate changes will have the right to a rehearing. Under current law, a court challenge to a FERC order may only be brought about petitioning the Commission for a rehearing. But if the panel is deadlocked and no order is issued by FERC on a utility rate increase, affected parties cannot bring an action because there was no final order. Meanwhile, the utility rate increase moves forward without the ability of affected parties to be heard. Under the Fair RATES Act, FERC’s inaction on a utility’s notice of a rate increase within 60 days will be treated as an order accepting the change. Affected parties will then be able to petition for a rehearing on the utility rate change. This bill will ensure that consumers and other affected parties are able to have their concerns heard by Federal regulators. The Fair RATES Act will hold Federal regulators accountable to ensure utility rate increases are reasonable by increasing transparency in the process. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comment. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. DEGETTE ). Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I want to echo my support for this important piece of legislation. This bill was passed last year on a bipartisan basis on a voice vote, in fact, but it was never taken up in the other body. This is becoming kind of a theme today. But, as Mr. KENNEDY pointed out, if we can’t move this through Congress in the next few weeks, families and small businesses may be left with electric bills that they cannot afford. So what we are really doing today is we are cleaning up some of the leftover important legislation from the last Congress that really needs to pass. Mr. UPTON and I worked hard, along with Mr. KENNEDY and Mr. W ELCH and many other Members, on the 21st Century Cures bill last Congress. It was one of the last bills we passed on a bipartisan basis. I am happy that the Energy and Commerce Committee is getting a running start today in passing some of our key bipartisan legislation from last Congress, and I am hoping that this will be a bellwether for the rest of this Congress that we will continue in the grand tradition of the Energy and Commerce Committee. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation. And I hope that the Senate will work quickly so that we can send this important bill to the President’s desk and we can stop those unanticipated rate increases. Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I will stand on the remarks I have already made, and I urge quick passage of the legislation. I, again, want to extend my gratitude and thanks to Chairman UPTON and his team for all of their work, both last Congress and this one. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I would just like to reference the kind remarks by my friend, the gentlewoman from Colorado. This is the start of the next Congress. We are certainly looking forward to governing in a bipartisan way. That is what our committee has done for hundreds of bills in the last number of years. I look forward to that continued partnership. I know Chairman WALDEN on the full committee looks forward to doing that as well. This is just the first step, literally one of the first days, obviously, in the new Trump administration, but we look forward to working with the Senate to get this bill to the new administration and get it signed into law, showing, again, the bipartisan support. I want to compliment my friend, my colleague from Massachusetts (Mr. KENNEDY ), for his good work on this. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 587, the ‘‘Fair Ratepayer Accountability, Transparency, and Efficiency Standards Act’’ (Fair RATES Act), which amends the Federal Power Act to permit administrative and judicial review of any rate change filed by a public utility that takes effect without the approval of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). The need for this change became evident in the wake of a New England Forward Capacity Market Auction in 2014, which occurred at a time when FERC only had 4 Commissioners. When the New England Forward Capacity Market Auction issue was addressed by FERC, the Commissioners split evenly over the question of whether the auction results were just and reasonable. Since FERC did not disapprove the auction results, wholesale electricity prices in New England increased dramatically; and So, while rates went up, none of the affected parties could challenge the decision or resulting rate increase, and, therefore, no rehearing or judicial review was possible. H.R. 587 provides those who want to challenge similar rulings or nondecisions by FERC the ability to challenge the decision administratively or in the courts. The bill ensures that stakeholders have recourse when a nondecision by FERC has very real consequences for consumers, producers and others. This bill would also improve the process by which FERC votes are reconsidered. I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 587. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. UPTON ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 587. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
ADVANCED NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2017 Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 590) to foster civilian research and development of advanced nuclear energy technologies and enhance the licensing and commercial deployment of such technologies. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 590 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Advanced Nuclear Technology Development Act of 2017’’. 
Congress finds the following: (1) Nuclear energy generates approximately 20 percent of the total electricity and approximately 60 percent of the carbonfree electricity of the United States. (2) Nuclear power plants operate consistently at a 90 percent capacity factor, and provide consumers and businesses with reliable and affordable electricity. (3) Nuclear power plants generate billions of dollars in national economic activity through nationwide procurements and provide thousands of Americans with high paying jobs contributing substantially to the local economies in communities where they operate. (4) The United States commercial nuclear industry must continue to lead the international civilian nuclear marketplace, because it is one of our most powerful national security tools, guaranteeing the safe, secure, and exclusively peaceful use of nuclear energy. 
(5) Maintaining the Nation’s nuclear fleet of commercial light water reactors and expanding the use of new advanced reactor designs would support continued production of reliable baseload electricity and maintain United States global leadership in nuclear power. (6) Nuclear fusion technology also has the potential to generate electricity with significantly increased safety performance and no radioactive waste. (7) The development of advanced reactor designs would benefit from a performance based, riskinformed, efficient, and costeffective regulatory framework with defined milestones and the opportunity for applicants to demonstrate progress through Nuclear Regulatory Commission approval. 
In this Act: (1) ADVANCED NUCLEAR REACTOR .—The term ‘‘advanced nuclear reactor’’ means— (A) a nuclear fission reactor with significant improvements over the most recent generation of nuclear fission reactors, which may include inherent safety features, lower waste yields, greater fuel utilization, superior reliability, resistance to proliferation, and increased thermal efficiency; or (B) a nuclear fusion reactor. (2) DEPARTMENT .—The term ‘‘Department’’ means the Department of Energy. (3) LICENSING .—The term ‘‘licensing’’ means NRC activities related to reviewing applications for licenses, permits, and design certifications, and requests for any other regulatory approval for nuclear reactors within the responsibilities of the NRC under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. (4) NATIONAL LABORATORY .—The term ‘‘National Laboratory’’ has the meaning given that term in section 2 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. 15801). (5) NRC.—The term ‘‘NRC’’ means the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. (6) SECRETARY .—The term ‘‘Secretary’’ means the Secretary of Energy. 
The NRC and the Department shall enter into the a memorandum of understanding regarding the following topics: (1) TECHNICAL EXPERTISE .—Ensuring that the Department has sufficient technical expertise to support the civilian nuclear industry’s timely research, development, demonstration, and commercial application of safe, innovative advanced reactor technology and the NRC has sufficient technical expertise to support the evaluation of applications for licenses, permits, and design certifications, and other requests for regulatory approval for advanced reactors. (2) MODELING AND SIMULATION .—The use of computers and software codes to calculate the behavior and performance of advanced reactors based on mathematical models of their physical behavior. (3) FACILITIES .—Ensuring that the Department maintains and develops the facilities to enable the civilian nuclear industry’s timely research, development, demonstration, and commercial application of safe, innovative reactor technology and ensuring that the NRC has access to such facilities, as needed. 
(a) P LANREQUIRED .—Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the NRC shall transmit to Congress a plan for developing an efficient, riskinformed, technologyneutral framework for advanced reactor licensing. The plan shall evaluate the following subjects, consistent with the NRC’s role in protecting public health and safety and common defense and security: (1) The unique aspects of advanced reactor licensing and any associated legal, regulatory, and policy issues the NRC will need to address to develop a framework for licensing advanced reactors. (2) Options for licensing advanced reactors under existing NRC regulations in title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations, a proposed new regulatory framework, or a combination of these approaches. (3) Options to expedite and streamline the licensing of advanced reactors, including opportunities to minimize the time from application submittal to final NRC licensing decision and minimize the delays that may result from any necessary amendments or supplements to applications. (4) Options to expand the incorporation of consensusbased codes and standards into the advanced reactor regulatory framework to minimize time to completion and provide flexibility in implementation. (5) Options to make the advanced reactor licensing framework more predictable. This evaluation should consider opportunities to improve the process by which application review milestones are established and maintained. (6) Options to allow applicants to use phased review processes under which the NRC issues approvals that do not require the NRC to rereview previously approved information. This evaluation shall consider the NRC’s ability to review and conditionally approve partial applications, early design information, and submittals that contain design criteria and processes to be used to develop information to support a later phase of the design review. (7) The extent to which NRC action or modification of policy is needed to implement any part of the plan required by this subsection. (8) The role of licensing advanced reactors within NRC longterm strategic resource planning, staffing, and funding levels. (9) Options to provide costsharing financial structures for license applicants in a phased licensing process. (b) COORDINATION AND STAKEHOLDER INPUT  REQUIRED .—In developing the plan required by subsection (a), the NRC shall seek input from the Department, the nuclear industry, and other public stakeholders. (c) COST AND SCHEDULE ESTIMATE .—The plan required by subsection (a) shall include proposed cost estimates, budgets, and specific milestones for implementing the advanced reactor regulatory framework by September 30, 2019. (d) DESIGN CERTIFICATION STATUS .—In the NRC’s first budget request after the acceptance of any design certification application for an advanced nuclear reactor, and annually thereafter, the NRC shall provide the status of performance metrics and milestone schedules. The budget request shall include a plan to correct or recover from any milestone schedule delays, including delays because of NRC’s inability to commit resources for its review of the design certification applications. 
Section 6101(c)(2)(A) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 2214(c)(2)(A)) is amended— (1) by striking ‘‘and’’ at the end of clause (iii); (2) by striking the period at the end of clause (iv) and inserting ‘‘; and’’; and (3) by adding at the end the following: ‘‘(v) for fiscal years ending before October 1, 2020, amounts appropriated to the Commission for activities related to the development of regulatory infrastructure for advanced nuclear reactor technologies.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. UPTON ) and the gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. DEGETTE ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan. 
Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous materials in the RECORD on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Michigan? There was no objection. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 590, the Advanced Nuclear Technology Development Act of 2017. This is a bipartisan bill. It passed in the last Congress as well. It was cosponsored and led by Congressmen LATTA and M CNERNEY . And it will help American innovators and entrepreneurs develop and license advanced nuclear technologies. The U.S. will require reliable, baseload, and affordable energy in decades to come, and nuclear power has to remain an integral part of our electricity generation portfolio. Unfortunately, an outdated and rigid regulatory regime will stifle new nuclear technology development. This bill will help modernize the regulatory framework for the 21st century to be adaptive, technology inclusive, and certainly predictable. Advanced nuclear technologies may provide breakthroughs in safety and efficiency over the existing fleet of nuclear power plants. Absent the proper regulatory framework, our nuclear scientists and industry will look to other parts of the world to construct game changing nuclear technologies. So the U.S. has to remain a global leader to create and maintain highlypaying and highlyskilled jobs right here at home. This bill is a step towards ensuring that the NRC has the necessary expertise and the resources to be able to review and license new technologies and reactor designs, while appropriately collaborating with the Department of Energy’s nuclear energy research programs and the private sector. With the Federal Government, national labs, universities, and private industry all working together towards a common goal, the future of nuclear industry energy is certainly bright. In the last Congress, as I mentioned at the beginning, this legislation passed unanimously out of the Energy and Commerce Committee and passed the House by a voice vote. I am pleased to support this legislation again, as part of our efforts to address burdensome regs that stifle economic growth and new technologies. I urge all of my colleagues to support it. I reserve the balance of my time. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE , SPACE , AND TECHNOLOGY , Washington, DC, January 23, 2017. Hon. GREGWALDEN , Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN : I am writing concerning H.R. 590, the ‘‘Advanced Nuclear Technology Development Act of 2017,’’ which was introduced on January 20, 2017. H.R. 590 contains provisions within the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology’s Rule X jurisdiction. In order to expedite this bill for floor consideration, the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology will forego action on the bill. This is being done on the basis of our mutual understanding that doing so will in no way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology with respect to the appointment of conferees, or to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject matters contained in the bill or similar legislation. I would appreciate your response to this letter confirming this understanding, and would request that you include a copy of this letter and your response in the Congressional Record during the floor consideration of this bill. Thank you in advance for your cooperation. Sincerely, LAMAR SMITH, Chairman. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND COMMERCE , Washington, DC, January 23, 2017. Hon. LAMAR SMITH, Chairman, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, Washington, DC. DEARCHAIRMAN SMITH: Thank you for your letter concerning H.R. 590, Advanced Nuclear Technology Development Act of 2017. As you noted, H.R. 590 contains provisions within the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology’s Rule X jurisdiction. I appreciate your willingness to forego action on the bill in order to expedite this bill for floor consideration. I agree that doing so will in no way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology with respect to the appointment of conferees, or to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject matters contained in the bill or similar legislation. I will place a copy of your letter and this response into the Congressional Record during the Floor consideration of this bill. Sincerely, GREGWALDEN , Chairman. 
Ms. D EGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 590, the Advanced Nuclear Technology Development Act of 2017, introduced by Representatives LATTA  and MCNERNEY . This bill would enhance coordination between the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Department of Energy by requiring them to enter into a memorandum of understanding on issues related to advanced nuclear reactor technology. This is a worthy goal, as the chairman said, and is a commonsense way for the Federal Government to support the advanced nuclear power industry. Advanced nuclear technologies have the potential to generate power more safely and with less nuclear waste, which is why I believe the Federal Government should be supporting advancements in nuclear technology. The bill also requires NRC to develop an advanced reactor regulatory framework to evaluate options to expedite advanced reactor licensing and to make it more predictable. NRC would have 1 year from the date of enactment to submit this plan to Congress. In developing the plan, NRC must also seek input from interested stakeholders, which I believe to be a crucial part of this process. Nuclear energy must play a continued role in our country’s clean energy future to enable us to reach our goals set forth in the Paris climate agreement. I believe the Advanced Nuclear Technology Development Act will enable the Federal Government to more efficiently evaluate and support these promising nuclear technologies, which can put us on a path towards greater reductions in carbon emissions. I commend both Representatives LATTA and M CNERNEY for introducing this important legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. Speaker, I don’t believe we have any further speakers on this, so I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER ). Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 590, the Advanced Nuclear Technology Development Act of 2017. This bill would require the Department of Energy and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to work together to further the development of advanced nuclear technology. By directing the Department of Energy and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to enter into a memorandum of understanding, this bill will reduce bureaucratic barriers to advanced nuclear technology research and development. Growing a closer partnership between the Department of Energy and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission will help to chart an energy independence path for our Nation as we seek new possibilities and alternatives to power our way to a better future. Energy independence is critical to both our national security and to the continued growth of our economy. There has been a considerable amount of research and development that has gone into nuclear energy, and it accounts for 60 percent of the clean energy produced in the United States. This legislation will knock down those walls to innovation and will provide an opportunity to develop advanced reactor designs that could be vital to our energy infrastructure. I applaud my good friend, Mr. LATTA , for his leadership on this issue, and the Energy and Commerce Committee for their work on this bill. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to again support this legislating on a bipartisan basis, and I thank all of my colleagues for speaking in support of it. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. UPTON ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 590. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
EPS IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2017 Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 518) to amend the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to exclude power supply circuits, drivers, and devices designed to be connected to, and power, lightemitting diodes or organic light emitting diodes providing illumination from energy conservation standards for external power supplies, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 518 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘EPS Improvement Act of 2017’’. 
SEC. 2. APPLICATION OF ENERGY CONSERVATION STANDARDS TO CERTAIN EXTERNAL POWER SUPPLIES. 
(a) D EFINITION OF EXTERNAL POWER SUPPLY.—Section 321(36)(A) of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6291(36)(A)) is amended— (1) by striking the subparagraph designation and all that follows through ‘‘The term’’ and inserting the following: ‘‘(A) EXTERNAL POWER SUPPLY .— ‘‘(i) IN GENERAL .—The term’’; and (2) by adding at the end the following: ‘‘(ii) EXCLUSION .—The term ‘external power supply’ does not include a power supply circuit, driver, or device that is designed exclusively to be connected to, and power— ‘‘(I) lightemitting diodes providing illumination; ‘‘(II) organic lightemitting diodes providing illumination; or ‘‘(III) ceiling fans using direct current motors.’’. (b) STANDARDS FOR LIGHTING POWER SUPPLYCIRCUITS .— (1) DEFINITION .—Section 340(2)(B) of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6311(2)(B)) is amended by striking clause (v) and inserting the following: ‘‘(v) electric lights and lighting power supply circuits;’’. (2) ENERGY CONSERVATION STANDARD FOR  
CERTAIN EQUIPMENT .—Section 342 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6313) is amended by adding at the end the following: ‘‘(g) LIGHTING POWER SUPPLY CIRCUITS .—If the Secretary, acting pursuant to section 341(b), includes as covered equipment solid state lighting power supply circuits, drivers, or devices described in section 321(36)(A)(ii), the Secretary may prescribe under this part, not earlier than 1 year after the date on which a test procedure has been prescribed, an energy conservation standard for such equipment.’’. 
(c) T ECHNICAL CORRECTIONS .— (1) Section 321(6)(B) of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6291(6)(B)) is amended by striking ‘‘(19)’’ and inserting ‘‘(20)’’. (2) Section 324 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6294) is amended by striking ‘‘(19)’’ each place it appears in each of subsections (a)(3), (b)(1)(B), (b)(3), and (b)(5) and inserting ‘‘(20)’’. (3) Section 325(l) of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6295(l)) is amended by striking ‘‘paragraph (19)’’ each place it appears and inserting ‘‘paragraph (20)’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. UPTON ) and the gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. DEGETTE ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan. 
Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous materials in the RECORD on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Michigan? There was no objection. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise certainly in support of H.R. 518. Regulations are based on the state of technology at the time that they are developed and may have the unintended consequences of hindering new advances in products. Such has been the case with the Department of Energy’s efficiency standards for external power suppliers, EPS. As the regs on the books now stand, it is not legally possible to make certain types of light emitting diode—LED—devices, as well as some kinds of ceiling fans. So this bill, H.R. 518, the EPS Improvement Act, provides a carefully tailored solution to the problem. And I want to thank two Members, Republican and Democrat, Mr. GUTHRIE and Ms. DEGETTE , for their good work on behalf of both the manufacturers, as well as the users, of these products. The bill carves out an exception for these devices while giving DOE the option of setting separate efficiency standards that are more suited to them. This bill has been thoroughly vetted—yes, it has. It was included in last year’s energy package. And although that bill didn’t make it to the finish line for unrelated reasons, language virtually identical to that in H.R. 518 enjoyed very strong bipartisan and certain bicameral support. b1600 In addition, the bill passed the House on suspension last year as well, but failed to make it on the Senate calendar. For the sake of the manufacturing jobs that are associated with these products as well as the consumers and small businesses that rely on them, I would urge all of my colleagues to support and vote for H.R. 518. I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today to urge the passage of H.R. 518, the EPS Improvement Act. Last session of Congress, I cosponsored this bill with our former colleague Congresswoman Ellmers, and this year, Representatives GUTHRIE , MATSUI , and D ENT are joining me in this effort to strengthen the standards used to keep LED lighting safe and efficient. By ensuring that our country’s energy conservation standards are up to date with the latest developments in hightech lighting, we can remove obstacles to innovation without sacrificing safety. And as we heard from the chairman, if there has ever been a bill in Congress that was vetted, it was this one. We have been working on this bill for some years now, and, frankly, what it is doing is it is truly addressing unintended consequences that happened due to the Energy Policy Act of 2005. That act defined external power supplies in a way that just simply did not anticipate the rapid growth and use of LED and OLED light sources during the decade that followed. Now, these lights are really energy efficient. They are up to 80 percent more efficient than traditional lights like fluorescent and incandescent lights, and 90 percent of the energy in LEDs is committed to illumination, while only 5 percent is heat; so it is no wonder they have become so popular in the last 10 years. Unfortunately, in the 2005 act, the standards did not allow for these types of lighting as their use continues to constitute an evergrowing share of our energy consumption. What this bill does is it clarifies the definition of ‘‘external power supplies’’ and it amends the conditions under which the Energy Department can undertake a rulemaking process in the future. The bill will facilitate the continued growth of LED lighting, and it will help lower energy prices for businesses and households both in my home State of Colorado and across America. Clean energy truly is the future. It can be safe, efficient, and affordable for all when it is properly regulated, and that is exactly what this legislation does. I urge everybody to support this act, and I hope that the Senate will pass it this year. We are getting a good, early start. Mr. Speaker, I have no one else to speak on this bill, so I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers on this side of the aisle either. I would urge my colleagues on both sides to again vote for this bill. Let’s hope that the Senate can get it on their plate and get it to the President for him to sign into law. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. UPTON ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R., 518. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION PROCESS REFORM ACT OF 2017 Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 290) to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to provide for greater transparency and efficiency in the procedures followed by the Federal Communications Commission, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 290 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Federal Communications Commission Process Reform Act of 2017’’.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. BLACKBURN ) and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. MICHAEL F. D OYLE ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Tennessee. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous materials into the RECORD on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Tennessee? There was no objection. Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am pleased to support H.R. 290, a bill to reform the FCC, sponsored by the chair of the full Committee on Energy and Commerce. Mr. Speaker, this bill has a unique history. It has been passed out of the House not once or twice, but four times already in the last three Congresses. The last three times this bill has come to the floor, it has passed on suspension with full bipartisan support. That support speaks to the deep necessity for fundamental reform of the Federal Communications Commission. As Members of Congress, we hear from constituents whose applications at the FCC are left to languish unresolved while consumers and businesses let opportunities slip by because they haven’t received approval yet from a Federal Government agency. It is even worse when the FCC, under its public interest mandate, decides to put its 
thumb on the scale in favor of one technology sector or another, often without providing reasonable evidence that its intervention is necessary and appropriate. While I have faith that Chairman Pai will bring about real reform at the FCC, without legislative changes, I am afraid that this type of juryrigged rulemaking will return under a future administration. That is why I have supported this bill each time it has made its way through our committee and each time it has come to the House floor. I believe that strong process can restore the agency’s integrity and rein it back in the interest of the stakeholders and the society that it should serve. The bill requires the FCC to conduct a notice and comment rulemaking in order to adopt clear rules to guide its own process. By giving the FCC flexibility when setting procedures and deadlines, we are not hamstringing the agency; rather, we are providing them with goals to meet and allowing them to determine the best way to meet those goals. We are asking the FCC to consider and adopt rules for itself that would provide clear deadlines on starting and stopping comments, clear deadlines for resolving petitions filed by the public, clear notice of status to those affected by petitions and rules, and clear schedules of statistical reports. The bill also requires the FCC to consider publication of Commission documents to be considered at an open meeting and to consider whether cost benefit analysis just might improve their rulemakings. This legislation also changes the existing Sunshine Act to allow for greater collaboration between Commissioners. There was fine bipartisan work that went into these bills, and I thank my Democratic colleagues for working with us to improve the agency. This country is blessed with the most creative and competitive technology industry in the world. The agency charged with overseeing this robust and dynamic sector should be open and transparent and foster continued growth, and I believe this bill will help in achieving that goal. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 290, and I yield myself as much time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, this bill was the same bill that passed the House last Congress and is the result of lengthy negotiations in the Subcommittee on Communications and Technology to come to a bipartisan agreement that all can support. This agreement requires the FCC to make certain procedural rule changes and requires an inquiry into other process changes. The bill includes the FCC Collaboration Act, a bill that allows for more than two FCC Commissioners to discuss official business as long as certain safeguards are in place. This bill should help the Commissioners reach consensus more quickly. The bill also includes important provisions offered by Democrats last Congress, such as Representative CLARKE ’s provision to require that the FCC provide quarterly reports on pending decisions to ensure accountability and timely responses, Representative MATSUI’s provision that required the FCC to coordinate with the Small Business Administration to improve small business participation in FCC proceedings, and Representative LOEBSACK ’s provision that requires the FCC Chairman to publicly post the agency’s internal policies and procedures for greater transparency. The addition of these Democratic ideas make this a better bill. The bill also requires the FCC to post, in its entirety, any item adopted by the Commission within 24 hours of filing of final dissenting statements, a compromise that was reached by Congressman MCNERNEY and Congresswoman Ellmers last Congress. FCC process reform has been an issue in our subcommittee going back several years. I hope this compromise bill is something all Members can support. Mr. Speaker, I see no other speakers on my side of the aisle, so I yield back the balance of my time. Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, at this time I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN ), the author of the legislation and the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle on the Energy and Commerce Committee and our new chair of the Subcommittee on Communications and Technology, Mrs. BLACKBURN , and the new ranking member on the committee, Mr. DOYLE . I believe by the end of today, Mr. Speaker, the House Energy and Commerce Committee will have produced close to 20 pieces of legislation already this Congress for consideration by the House, and I think all of them have been bipartisan. That is the kind of work this great committee is known for and we hope to continue to do. I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. I think we agreed that the FCC was in need of process reform. This is the people’s business that they are conducting. It needs to be done in an open and transparent and predictable way so that all of those involved in the public’s business can see what is happening. The Federal Communications Commission regulates an incredibly dynamic and innovative sector of the American economy. The communications technology sector directly impacts the lives of consumers in meaningful ways. Consumers are able to map their ways to new places, find information and enriching content, and reach their loved ones who might live in the most remote places, literally, of the globe. Communications technology also enables other industries to reach their audiences in new and lifechanging ways: health care, finance, manufacturing, agriculture. All of these industries are leveraging communications technologies in ways to better serve the American consumer. It is essential that we do as much as we can to protect and promote innovation in this sector of the economy. We can’t afford to allow this fundamental sector of the economy to languish or fail under outdated regulations or faulty regulatory processes. That is why Committee on Energy and Commerce has focused on improving the processes at the FCC, so that it operates in an effective and transparent manner. This bill represents the fourth time, as you have heard, that we have brought a measure to this House floor that seeks to improve the way the FCC conducts its business. Last Congress, as chairman of the Subcommittee on Communications and Technology, process reform was a priority and it still is. I am committed to continuing the reform effort by supporting this legislation once again. Over the years, we have worked closely across the aisle to formulate a bipartisan compromise piece of legislation that addresses many of the concerns that we all share. Whether it is creating certainty for regulated industries by requiring shot clocks and deadlines, protecting consumers by prohibiting data dumps at the eleventh hour, or empowering all Commissioners by creating a tool for bipartisan majority to bring an item up for a vote at the FCC, this legislation is intended to improve the way the FCC does its business all across the board. One of the concerns we heard from some on the committee during the consideration of this legislation was that an overly proscriptive piece of legislation could hamstring the agency. Well, I think we have structured this legislation to fully address that legitimate concern by allowing the agency, itself, to determine the specifics of the overarching principles that we set forth. We give them that flexibility. We just want them to do the job. For example, the bill requires that all Commissioners have adequate time to review decision documents before having to vote. However, we allow the agency to determine what the adequate amount of time is through a rulemaking process that will generate input from the industries, the consumers, the stakeholders; and, ultimately, that should result in a Commission decision that reflects the way that the agency can best function. b1615 I think it is important to note that we are still extremely committed to these important reforms, even though we have seen a change in administrations and will see a new chairman. 
Process reform is not about political ideology or partisan rancor, rather, it is about ensuring that government continues to work for the people. I am hopeful that this legislation will reach the President’s desk and result in a better, more efficient, more transparent Federal Communications Commission, the kind of regulator that the most innovative and dynamic sector in the world deserves. Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss H.R. 290, the FCC Process Reform Act of 2017. I’m particularly proud of a bipartisan provision I first authored in the 112th Congress that I’m pleased is included in this legislation today. This provision would modify current FCC rules to allow three or more Commissioners to hold nonpublic collaborative discussions, as long as no agency action is taken. Today, under the FCC’s ‘‘Sunshine Rule,’’ three Commissioners or more are prohibited from talking to each other outside of an official public meeting. The FCC oversees industries representing approximately onesixth of the American economy. It must be able to collaborate freely and deliberate on our nation’s most pressing communications issues, from enhancing universal service and public safety, to making more spectrum available for mobile broadband. As Congress looks at ways to help modernize the FCC, this bipartisan, commonsense provision will help to promote greater discussion among the five FCC Commissioners and ensure they can benefit from each other’s expertise and experience. Through greater collaboration, the FCC will be better positioned to respond to a fastpaced and rapidly growing telecommunications industry in the 21st century. I thank Chairman WALDEN for including this provision in the bill the House has passed today. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. BLACKBURN ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 290. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
ANTISPOOFING ACT OF 2017 Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 423) to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to expand and clarify the prohibition on provision of misleading or inaccurate caller identification information, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows:

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. BLACKBURN ) and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. MICHAEL F. D OYLE ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Tennessee. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous material in the RECORD on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Tennessee? There was no objection. Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 423, the Anti Spoofing Act of 2017. Today we are considering a very worthy piece of legislation, which has been introduced in each of the last two Congresses by Vice Chairman BARTON , Vice Chairman LANCE , and Representative M ENG. All of them have put a lot of hard work into this bill, and I thank each of them for their dedication in pursuing a muchneeded update to the Truth In Caller ID Act. Spoofing is the act of altering the number that will appear on the receiving end of the caller ID. It is a trick that has been around for more than a decade. Spoofing provides a false identity to bad actors and criminals who seek to harass and defraud our hardworking taxpayers, oftentimes through various scams. Sometimes the scams are elaborate, and other times they are simple. But these schemes are all petty; and once carried out, they are criminal. Spoofing lets the bad guys disguise their identity and will often pose as official entities, such as credit card companies, hospitals, and government agencies to target their unsuspecting victims. These crooks regularly target seniors and use intimidation tactics to extract personal and financial information. The FCC has the authority to levy penalties and criminal fines against individuals that use fake caller ID information for the purpose of defrauding or harming another. However, current law only covers traditional voice calls. While this was considered a good fix when it was enacted in 2009, the Truth in Caller ID Act no longer sufficiently protects consumers. New communication methods and an evolving consumer trend towards text messaging have left the law with significant holes for the fraudsters to fly through and avoid prosecution. H.R. 423 would extend and clarify provisions of the Truth in Caller ID Act to include text messages and Voice over Internet Protocol services and would also apply the penalties to violators outside of the United States. The bill would also seek to make it more challenging for those using fake caller ID information. In the past, you needed to have advanced skills and expensive equipment in order to spoof. Nowadays, it isn’t hard. All someone needs to have is a smartphone and access to any of the various apps on the market that can instantly generate a fake caller ID. This is another classic case where technology has outpaced the laws that govern it. We will never be able to legislate ahead of technology advancement, nor should we try to do so. But when we find areas where legislation can help shield our consumers and hold the bad guys accountable, it is incumbent on us to act. I believe that the legislation we are considering today is a good next step in our pursuit of stronger protection for our consumers. This bill will not prevent spoofing and it will not make our constituents invincible from the related scams and harassment, but what this bill does is important. By updating the law to more accurately reflect today’s environment, we will be equipped to hold violators subject to the penalty of law. I urge all of my colleagues to support the bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 423, the AntiSpoofing Act, introduced by Representative MENG as well as Representative BARTON of Texas and Representative LANCE of New Jersey. Consumers should feel safe knowing that the caller ID information they see when they answer the phone is accurate. Unfortunately, fraudsters use misleading caller ID numbers every day to trick consumers into handing over sensitive information. Americans, from young people to senior citizens, are misled by crooks using a fake caller identification into thinking they are being connected to a trusted institution. This practice known as spoofing contributes to the millions of identity theft cases in our country each year and so many other forms of fraud. Under the law today, it is already illegal for scammers to use fake caller ID information for regular voice calls. This legislation expands that band to text messages and to calls coming in from overseas. That just makes sense. It is a bipartisan bill. It passed last Congress on a vote of 382–5. I urge my colleagues to stand up for consumers and strengthen spoofing protection. It is time for us to pass the AntiSpoofing Act. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD the committee report for this legislation from the last Congress. 
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION  Spoofing is a practice in which a phone number shown on a phone or caller identification device is deliberately falsified, often to portray an official entity such as a government agency or credit card company, typically with malicious intent. Spoofing is a commonly used tool for a number of illegal practices, including phishing for personal information and swatting—calling in a fictitious crime in progress in order to generate a police response. The original Truth in Caller ID Act of 2009 prohibits spoofing voice caller identification. However, as communications methods and consumer habits continue to evolve, so too do the attempts by third parties to fraudulently gain personal information for criminal use. Many Americans are now relying on text messaging to stay connected, and this method of communication has become a target for spoofing in much the same way voice calls have been. H.R. 423 extends the provisions of the Truth in Caller ID Act to include text messaging as well as Voice over Internet Protocol services. The legislation, introduced by Rep. Barton, Rep. Lance, and Rep. Meng, also addresses the growth of services that allow users to knowingly transmit misleading or inaccurate caller identification information by adding a definition of ‘‘spoofing service’’ to the Truth in Caller ID Act. In amending H.R. 423, the Committee significantly changed the definitions of ‘‘text message’’ and ‘‘text messaging service.’’ The changes are designed to exclude from these definitions those online messaging services that use traditional telephone numbers for the purpose of identifying a user’s account, just as other online services may use an email address or username for a similar purpose. The excluded services do not use telephone numbers to interconnect with the public switched telephone network or enable communication with individuals who do not subscribe to the same messaging service. The Committee intends the Commission to devise its rules using the meanings set forth in the legislation. ‘‘Short message service’’ and ‘‘multimedia message service’’ should be narrowly interpreted consistent with current industry standards (see, e.g., ETSI, Technical Specification, 3GPP TS 23.040 version 12.2.0 Release 12, ETSI TS 123 040 v12.2.0 (Oct. 2014), available at www.etsi.org). The Committee takes notice of the fact that the language set forth in the version of H.R. 423, as ordered reported, is identical to the text relating to the same subject contained in S. 253, the Communications Act Update Act of 2016, as passed by the U.S. House of Representatives, on September 27, 2016. The House passed S. 253, as amended, by unanimous consent. The foregoing discussion should therefore serve as an explanation of that bill’s provisions for purposes of legislative history. 
LEGISLATION  Section 1. Short title This section provides that the Act may be cited as the ‘‘AntiSpoofing Act of 2017’’. Section 2. Spoofing prevention 
This section amends the Communications Act to expand the Truth in Caller Act to include text messaging services, as well as communications from outside of the United States. This section defines the terms ‘‘text message,’’ ‘‘text messaging service,’’ and ‘‘voice service.’’ This section also requires the Commission, in coordination with the Federal Trade Commission, to develop consumer education materials regarding caller ID scams and technologies that can help consumers protect themselves against fraudulent activity. This section also requires a Government Accountability Office report on the actions taken by the Federal Communications Commission and FTC to combat caller ID fraud. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER ), a new member of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 423, the AntiSpoofing Act of 2017, because it addresses the issue of call spoofing and the impact that these deceitful callers are having on Americans. Every day, millions of Americans are hit with calls using a fraudulent caller ID profile and with impersonators on the other end of the line. These con artists are able to disguise their real number in an effort to convince unsuspecting victims that they are a representative from a government agency, financial company, healthcare system, or other organizations that may request information to contact someone. An example of a common call is someone saying they are calling from the IRS and are asking for personal information over the phone. This has got to stop. Representatives MENG, BARTON , and LANCE have again introduced this legislation to prevent these criminals from further victimizing hardworking Americans. We have a real opportunity to combat this growing tactic and protect those in our communities who are the most vulnerable. I applaud the Energy and Commerce Committee for their continued effort to protect Americans from criminal behavior and in updating such important policy measures. Last Congress, this legislation passed the House with an overwhelming vote of 382–5 in support. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 423 because we have an opportunity to fix a growing problem in our country and to cut down on fraud. Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. MENG), the primary sponsor of the AntiSpoofing Act. Ms. MENG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in strong support of my bill, H.R. 423, the AntiSpoofing Act of 2017. I am honored to have authored this bill with Congressman BARTON and Congressman LANCE once again, and I thank Amy Murphy and Ryan Farrell of their respective staffs for working so closely with mine. I also thank the COMET Civic Association from my district for first bringing this problem to my attention. This legislation seeks to combat spoofing, which is when phone call recipients are tricked into answering the phone due to inaccurate caller ID information. Criminals have used this technique to scam thousands of Americans and steal millions of dollars. Recent spoofing attempts have included scam artists pretending to be sheriff’s offices, hospitals, and even the IRS. The bill before us this afternoon expands spoofing protections to calls that originate outside of the country as well as text messages. It is often stated that a measure of a society is how it treats its most vulnerable. Almost every day, I receive new reports of spoofing that harm the most vulnerable in my district, including immigrants, seniors, veterans, and those in need of help from law enforcement. That is why this legislation is endorsed by senior citizens, law enforcement, and consumer protection groups. The AntiSpoofing Act of 2017 is a bipartisan bill. It passed the House in both the 113th and 114th Congresses under suspension of the rules, and it is my sincere hope that this bill will continue to be noncontroversial and that we will do everything in our power to combat telephone scams against our constituents. In closing, I thank Representatives BLACKBURN and D OYLE for their support this afternoon, as well as Energy and Commerce Chairman WALDEN and Ranking Member PALLONE . Without their support, this legislation would not be on the floor. I urge the Senate to quickly take up this legislation. I urge all of my colleagues in this Chamber to support it once again. Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I do not have any other speakers. I yield back the balance of my time. Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LANCE ). Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill, H.R. 423, the AntiSpoofing Act. I am a proud sponsor of this with Congresswoman MENG and Congressman BARTON , and I commend them for their leadership on this issue. Caller ID spoofing occurs when a scammer calls and attempts to disguise his or her identity by manipulating the recipient caller’s caller ID display. The scammer may be posing as an IRS agent, a police officer, or a representative from another governmental agency. After tricking people in picking up the line, the criminal then attempts to entice the other person to giving up personal information. To date, hundreds of thousands, perhaps even millions, have been defrauded, including veterans, immigrants, and senior citizens. In Somerset County, New Jersey, a county which I represent here in the House, scammers cloned the telephone number of the county sheriff’s office and impersonated the sheriff’s staff in an effort to steal residents’ personal information. This problem has gotten out of control. Millions of Americans continue to get ripped off by con artists and scammers who perpetuate this despicable crime. Since Congress passed the Truth in Caller ID Act in 2009, new technologies have enabled these criminals to scam consumers with increased ease and efficiency. This legislation is one step forward to ensure that governmental policies keep up with these criminals. This disgraceful practice must end, and this consumer protection legislation goes a long way toward accomplishing that critical goal. The bill has been passed through the House twice before, as Congresswoman MENGhas just said. And after collaboration with our colleagues in the Senate, we now have secured enough support to see that this commonsense consumer protection legislation will advance. I hope it advances in the 115th Congress as quickly as possible and I hope it reaches our new President’s desk as quickly as possible. b1630 Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 423, the ‘‘AntiSpoofing Act of 2017,’’ which amends the Communications Act of 1934, to make it unlawful to cause a caller identification service to knowingly transmit inaccurate caller identification information with the intent to: defraud, cause harm, or wrongfully obtain anything of value. Spoofing is a practice in which a phone number shown on a phone or caller identification device deliberately is falsified. Spoofing is a commonly used tool for a number of illegal practices, including ‘‘phishing’’ for personal information and ‘‘swatting’’—calling in a fictitious crime in progress in order to generateapolice response. The Truth in Caller ID Act of 2009 prohibits spoofing of voice caller identification information; however, as communications methods and consumer habits continue to evolve, so do the attempts by third parties to gain personal information for criminal use. Many Americans now rely on text messaging to stay connected. According to CTIA, in 2015, Americans sent over 156 billion text messages per month. H.R. 423, the AntiSpoofing Act, will extend the provisions of the Truth in Caller ID Act to include text messaging and text messaging services. The legislation adds a definition of ‘‘spoofing service’’ to the statute, addressing the growth of services that allows a user to knowingly transmit misleading or inaccurate caller identification information. In addition, it extends the prohibitions to any person or service placing an international call to a recipient within the United States. Additionally, H.R. 423 will revise the definitions of ‘‘caller identification information’’ and 
‘‘caller identification service’’ to include text messages sent using a text messaging service. It defines ‘‘text message’’ as realtime messages consisting of text, images, sounds, or other information transmitted from or received by a device identified by a telephone number. It also includes in the definition both, real time and twoway voice or video communications, addressing the emerging law enforcement issue of ‘‘swatting’’ by which people can purposefully misdirect valuable, police efforts and resources. This bill takes the right approach targeting behavior, while protecting innovations that are important to the digital economy. As the Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, I understand the vital need to safeguard against caller identification spoofing. For example, women’s abuse shelters and law enforcement officers working undercover have a need to protect their clients’ identities. This bill seeks to target those who have the intent to cause harm or commit a crime. I support this legislation because it protects the consumer from criminal behavior, while protecting our fundamental right to privacy. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. BLACKBURN ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 423. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
SECURING ACCESS TO NETWORKS IN DISASTERS ACT Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 588) to direct the Federal Communications Commission to conduct a study on network resiliency during times of emergency, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 588 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Securing Access to Networks in Disasters Act’’. 
Not later than 36 months after the date of enactment of this Act, the Commission shall submit to Congress, and make publically available on the Commission’s website, a study on the public safety benefits and technical feasibility and cost of— (1) making telecommunications service providerowned WiFi access points, and other communications technologies operating on unlicensed spectrum, available to the general public for access to 9–1–1 services, without requiring any login credentials, during times of emergency when mobile service is unavailable; (2) the provision by nontelecommunications service providerowned WiFi access points of public access to 9–1–1 services during times of emergency when mobile service is unavailable; and (3) other alternative means of providing the public with access to 9–1–1 services during times of emergency when mobile service is unavailable. SEC. 3. ACCESS TO ESSENTIAL SERVICE PROVIDERS DURING FEDERALLY DECLARED EMERGENCIES. 
Section 427(a)(1)(A) of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5189e(a)(1)(A)) is amended by striking ‘‘telecommunications service’’ and inserting ‘‘wireline or mobile telephone service, Internet access service, radio or television broadcasting, cable service, or direct broadcast satellite service’’. 
As used in this Act— (1) the term ‘‘Commission’’ means the Federal Communications Commission; (2) the term ‘‘mobile service’’ means commercial mobile service (as defined in section 332 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 332)) or commercial mobile data service (as defined in section 6001 of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 (47 U.S.C. 1401)); (3) the term ‘‘WiFi access point’’ means wireless Internet access using the standard designated as 802.11 or any variant thereof; and (4) the term ‘‘times of emergency’’ means either an emergency as defined in section 102 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5122), or an emergency as declared by the governor of a State or territory of the United States. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS) and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. MICHAEL F. D OYLE ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 588. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Illinois? There was no objection. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 588 includes a provision to facilitate the repair of communications infrastructure in the wake of a disaster. We know how critical communications can be following a disaster for first responders and everyone that is impacted. I commend the bill’s sponsor for pursuing this legislation, and I thank the Energy and Commerce Committee for working with the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee on this language. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. BLACKBURN ) be permitted to control the remainder of the time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Illinois? There was no objection. Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 588, the Securing Access to Networks in Disasters Act, or the SANDy Act, introduced by Ranking Member FRANK  PALLONE . This bill is all about making sure that the communication networks that so many Americans rely on are as resilient as they can be. Disaster is going to strike and networks are going to go down. The purpose of this bill is to ensure that when those networks go down, the network operators have the resources they need to get things back online as quickly as possible. The bill also requires the FCC to conduct a study on the future of network resiliency, and how new and existing technologies can be used during our times of need to communicate with loved ones or call for help. This is a commonsense piece of legislation that passed 389–2 in the last Congress, and I urge all Members to support it. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. When disaster strikes, there is a lot of hard work to be done, and every second counts. First responders go into action for those that need help. Relief organizations and volunteers rush in to begin the process of cleaning up. Utilities and service providers must be on the ground repairing damaged infrastructure. All of these missioncritical tasks require a functioning communications network. People turn to the network for potentially lifesaving information and rely on its functionality to reach emergency services. We are here today to consider this bill. Representative PALLONE —I want to give some credit to him—has been a champion of following the eyeopening effects of Superstorm Sandy. He has worked tirelessly on this legislation since October 2012. In total, the Sandy storm resulted in roughly $74 billion in damages in the U.S. alone. Sometimes we forget the magnitude of that storm. Damage to power and communications infrastructure, it knocked out about 25 percent of the cell sites in its path. In some of the hardesthit counties, 50 percent of those sites were down. When the networks go down, public safety communications and emergency response services are threatened. In order for the networks to get back up and running, telecommunications providers need access to critical resources and permission to enter the disaster area. 
The chaos immediately following a major disaster makes it challenging to obtain resources and entry to the affected area. What we saw after Sandy were communication providers being turned away from the disaster area and denied resources because they were not considered essential to the recovery effort. This bill seeks to change that. In the wake of Sandy, and as a result of repair workers being barred from the recovery effort, communication networks remained offline for hours and, in some cases, days longer than need be. This left those who were still vulnerable in the disaster area without critical information and no means to call for help. There are numerous entities that are essential for the rescue and recovery phase following a disaster. The affected area needs power. Water is critical. The bill would clarify that communications networks are also an essential service. Whether it be wireline, mobile telephone, Internet, radio or television, communication services play a key role in facilitating recovery. In some cases it can be the difference between life and death. By defining these types of providers as essential, telecommunication companies will be granted the access and resources needed to get their networks back online. The bill would also require the FCC to conduct a study on the feasibility and benefits of making WiFi access points available to the general public to access 911 services during times of emergency. I would also like to recognize that the original version of this bill included a number of wireless provisions designed to increase preparedness. These provisions were removed, however, because the five largest wireless carriers voluntarily adopted these provisions. H.R. 588, in its current form, combined with the voluntary framework established by the wireless carriers, leaves us with a strong, bipartisan bill that will improve the resiliency of our Nation’s communications infrastructure to avoid a recurrence of the widespread and extended service outages, as experienced in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy. I thank our colleagues from the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure for working with us on this bill, and I urge the support of my colleagues for the legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE ), the primary sponsor of the bill, a friend and colleague, and the ranking member of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I would like to start today by congratulating him on taking the reins of the Subcommittee on Communications and Technology. That subcommittee is a critical part of the Energy and Commerce Committee and serves an important role for Congress as a whole. Congresswoman ESHOO left big shoes to fill, but I am confident that, with Ranking Member DOYLE and his longtime expertise in this area, the subcommittee is in capable hands. I also thank our colleague from Tennessee, who is now the chairwoman of the subcommittee. The gentlewoman basically summarized what I was going to say about this bill, so I will try not to be too repetitive. But I do want to ask support for my bill, H.R. 588, the Securing Access to Networks in Disasters Act, or SANDy Act. Superstorm Sandy had a traumatic effect on my district back in New Jersey, and we saw firsthand how critical communication networks can be damaged during emergencies. Broadcast and cable networks provide crucial information that helps us stay out of harm’s way, and phone and Internet access makes sure we can call for help and keep track of our loved ones. Unfortunately, when Sandy ripped through the Northeast, many of these networks went down when we needed them most. Across the region, nearly 1 in 4 cell towers were knocked out. But in some of the hardesthit areas of New Jersey, as many as half of the towers were actually down. Many of them stayed down for weeks. That is why I have spent the past several years figuring out what went right and what went wrong. Initially, I worked with the Nation’s largest wireless carriers and the Federal Communications Commission to put together a voluntary resiliency framework. That framework, as Mrs. BLACKBURN mentioned, makes sure that if one cell network goes down, like AT&T did during Sandy in my district, its customers can access another network, like Verizon, that was still operational. Everyone, I think, should be able to call for help as long as any signal is available. Mr. Speaker, the voluntary resiliency framework will save lives during major emergencies in the future, and I would like to thank the wireless carriers and the FCC for working with me to craft that comprehensive agreement. Having these networks operational can mean the difference between life and death during an event like Superstorm Sandy. The other major problem during Sandy was the inability of communications services to repair their equipment. The SANDy Act will recognize the critical role that wireline and mobile telephone, Internet, radio, and TV broadcast, cable and satellite services play during emergencies. For example, ‘‘The RAT,’’ which is a radio station at the Jersey Shore, switched from music to 24hour news coverage right after Sandy, and that helped people to access vital services in the days after the storm. These providers will receive, pursuant to the SANDy Act, priority access to otherwise restricted areas during emergencies like other utilities to help them repair and maintain their communications equipment during disasters. The SANDy Act will begin a process to provide 911 services over WiFi hotspots during emergencies. Mr. Speaker, this is truly a commonsense, bipartisan bill. It passed the House last Congress on a vote of 389–2. I urge all Members to support the bill. I understand the bill has been scheduled for a markup in the Senate tomorrow. So, hopefully, once they do their work, we can get this bill to the President and signed into law. Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers, so I yield back the balance of my time. Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, again, I thank Mr. PALLONE for his diligence in solving this problem not only for his constituents there in New Jersey after Superstorm Sandy, but many of my family were down in south Mississippi and we know what happened in Katrina with those in the Gulf region around New Orleans and over in south Mississippi and the loss of communications that were there. This week we are seeing it in Mr. CARTER ’s district in Georgia, again, the impact that a storm has when people cannot reach their loved ones and when they cannot get in contact to let people know the services that they needed or the injury that they are experiencing. So we are fortunate to be able to bring this bill forward. We extend our condolences and concerns to Mr. CARTER for what is going on in his district. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER ) to speak on the bill. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 588, the Securing Access to Networks in Disasters Act because it will help to strengthen and reinforce our networks during times of emergency. Representing the entire coast of Georgia, I am no stranger at what a working network means for the coordination of rescue and recovery efforts. Hurricane Matthew made landfall and had a significant impact on multiple States along the Southeastern seaboard, including Georgia. I personally toured many of the hardesthit areas in my district and I have seen devastation that natural disasters, such as hurricanes, can inflict on areas such as ours. Of course, just this past weekend, Mr. Speaker, we witnessed tornadoes in south Georgia, tornadoes that brought about tremendous devastation and the loss of life. However, our first responders and emergency specialists are there to heed the call and assist in helping people who are most in need. Ranking Member PALLONE ’s legislation would direct the Federal Communications Commission to conduct a 
study on network resiliency during times of emergency and distress. Under this bill, the study done by the FCC would be made publicly available on their Web site and would include public safety benefits and the costs of implementing new alternatives that will aid in contacting and coordinating emergency services during those difficult times. I urge my friends and colleagues to support this legislation because I have seen firsthand not only what disasters can do to an area, but the importance of our emergency services in having the networks and communication means to coordinate relief. Strengthening our network resiliency is a benefit to everyone across our great country. b1645 Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 588, ‘‘Securing Access to Networks in Disaster Act’’, which requires the Federal Communications Commission to submit to Congress and publish on the FCC website a study on the: public safety benefits, technical feasibility, and cost of providing the public with access to 9–1–1 services during times of emergency when mobile service is unavailable. As a senior member of the Homeland Security Committee, I am well aware of the importance of telephone service during disasters. The Securing Access to Networks in Disasters (SANDy) Act seeks to ensure the resiliency of the nation’s communications networks during emergencies. Acquiring cellphone service during a massive natural or manmade disaster is often difficult, if not impossible, and this is why this piece of legislation is so essential. During the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks that destroyed the World Trade Center in New York City, cellphone service was severely disrupted, forcing many callers to repeatedly dial to get through to 9–1–1 emergency services. On that day, some of the most tragic, heart wrenching calls came from those trapped in the Twin Towers. It is not only during terrorist attacks that cellphone services are severely disrupted, but also natural disasters such as Hurricane Katrina, which claimed the lives of over 1,800 people. The SANDy Act would ensure that during an emergency, consumers’ cell phones work on other carriers’ networks if a consumer’s own network goes down. H.R. 588 would give priority to calls to 9–1– 1 services and emergency alerts. It also would increase coordination between wireless carriers, utilities, and public safety officials by creating a directory of the contact information for relevant disaster response officials. The bill would require the FCC to report to Congress regarding whether additional outage data should be provided in times of emergency. In addition, the bill requires the FCC to report to Congress on the viability of providing 9–1–1 services over WiFi hotspots during emergencies. H.R. 588 would be of immense benefit to the 18th Congressional District and the greater Houston area. On April 17–18, 2016, Houston experienced a historic flood event that claimed the lives of eight people; damaged over 1,150 households; disrupted hundreds of businesses; closed community centers, schools, and places of worship due to flood waters. On April 25, President Obama granted the request for federal Individual Assistance for Harris County residences and business owners who were affected by severe weather and flooding. Unfortunately, that was not the end of the story of flooding in Houston for 2016—in early June another record setting rainfall led to catastrophic flooding throughout the Houston area. I am grateful to President Obama and the great work of those at the Department of Homeland Security who worked tirelessly to help people after both 2016 flood events. I spoke on the House Floor several times about the floods and the suffering caused by the waters that came through our communities—damaging homes, our schools, places of business, and our places of worship. The flooding problems in the Houston area are frequent, widespread, and severe, with projects to reduce flood risks in place that are valued at several billion dollars In 2015, the Houston and surrounding area experienced widespread historic flooding. The importance of being able to contact emergency responders in the case of natural disasters is critical in order to save the lives of those directly affected by such events. The SANDy Act would provide telecommunication access to victims of natural and man made disasters. The SANDy Act amends the Stafford Act to ensure that all communications providers: 1. Have the ability to access relevant disaster stricken areas during emergencies to restore service; and 2. Are included in the universal credentialing program for essential service providers The SANDy Act would recognize the critical role that all communications providers—broadcasters, cable, and telecommunications— serve in emergencies, but most notably, the bill would ensure consumers have access to wireless service even if their cellphone service provider’s wireless network goes down. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 588, the ‘‘Securing Access to Networks in Disaster Act.’’ The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. RODNEYDAVIS) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 588. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
AMATEUR RADIO PARITY ACT OF 2017 Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 555) to direct the Federal Communications Commission to amend its rules so as to prohibit the application to amateur stations of certain private land use restrictions, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 555 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Amateur Radio Parity Act of 2017’’. 
Congress finds the following: (1) More than 730,000 radio amateurs in the United States are licensed by the Federal Communications Commission in the amateur radio services. (2) Amateur radio, at no cost to taxpayers, provides a fertile ground for technical self training in modern telecommunications, electronics technology, and emergency communications techniques and protocols. (3) There is a strong Federal interest in the effective performance of amateur stations established at the residences of licensees. Such stations have been shown to be frequently and increasingly precluded by unreasonable private land use restrictions, including restrictive covenants. (4) Federal Communications Commission regulations have for three decades prohibited the application to stations in the amateur service of State and local regulations that preclude or fail to reasonably accommodate amateur service communications, or that do not constitute the minimum practicable regulation to accomplish a legitimate State or local purpose. Commission policy has been and is to require States and localities to permit erection of a station antenna structure at heights and dimensions sufficient to accommodate amateur service communications. (5) The Commission has sought guidance and direction from Congress with respect to the application of the Commission’s limited preemption policy regarding amateur service communications to private land use restrictions, including restrictive covenants. (6) There are aesthetic and common property considerations that are uniquely applicable to private land use regulations and the community associations obligated to enforce covenants, conditions, and restrictions in deedrestricted communities. These considerations are dissimilar to those applicable to State law and local ordinances regulating the same residential amateur radio facilities. (7) In recognition of these considerations, a separate Federal policy than exists at section 97.15(b) of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, is warranted concerning amateur service communications in deedrestricted communities. (8) Community associations should fairly administer private land use regulations in the interest of their communities, while nevertheless permitting the installation and maintenance of effective outdoor amateur radio antennas. There exist antenna designs and installations that can be consistent with the aesthetics and physical characteristics of land and structures in community associations while accommodating communications in the amateur radio services. 
SEC. 3. APPLICATION OF PRIVATE LAND USE RESTRICTIONS TO AMATEUR STATIONS. 
(a) A MENDMENT OF FCC R ULES .—Not later than 120 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Federal Communications Commission shall amend section 97.15 of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, by adding a new paragraph that prohibits the application to amateur stations of any private land use 
restriction, including a restrictive covenant, that— (1) on its face or as applied, precludes communications in an amateur radio service; (2) fails to permit a licensee in an amateur radio service to install and maintain an effective outdoor antenna on property under the exclusive use or control of the licensee; or (3) does not constitute the minimum practicable restriction on such communications to accomplish the lawful purposes of a community association seeking to enforce such restriction. (b) ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS .—In amending its rules as required by subsection (a), the Commission shall— (1) require any licensee in an amateur radio service to notify and obtain prior approval from a community association concerning installation of an outdoor antenna; (2) permit a community association to prohibit installation of any antenna or antenna support structure by a licensee in an amateur radio service on common property not under the exclusive use or control of the licensee; and (3) subject to the standards specified in paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (a), permit a community association to establish reasonable written rules concerning height, location, size, and aesthetic impact of, and installation requirements for, outdoor antennas and support structures for the purpose of conducting communications in the amateur radio services. 
SEC. 4. AFFIRMATION OF LIMITED PREEMPTION OF STATE AND LOCAL LAND USE REGULATION. 
The Federal Communications Commission may not change section 97.15(b) of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, which shall remain applicable to State and local land use regulation of amateur service communications. 
In this Act: (1) COMMUNITY ASSOCIATION .—The term ‘‘community association’’ means any non profit mandatory membership organization composed of owners of real estate described in a declaration of covenants or created pursuant to a covenant or other applicable law with respect to which a person, by virtue of the person’s ownership of or interest in a unit or parcel, is obligated to pay for a share of real estate taxes, insurance premiums, maintenance, improvement, services, or other expenses related to common elements, other units, or any other real estate other than the unit or parcel described in the declaration. (2) TERMS DEFINED IN REGULATIONS .—The terms ‘‘amateur radio services’’, ‘‘amateur service’’, and ‘‘amateur station’’ have the meanings given such terms in section 97.3 of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LANCE ) and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (MICHAEL F. DOYLE ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey. 
Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous materials in the RECORD on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New Jersey? There was no objection. Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, amateur radio, also known as ham radio, is a fun hobby for enthusiasts who use it to communicate with people around the world while teaching themselves the basics of communications technology. But more importantly, amateur radio operators utilize their skills to provide essential communication services to first responders when the conventional networks go down in times of emergency. In order to be eligible to operate an amateur radio station, individuals must obtain a license from the FCC and comply with the FCC’s rules. One such requirement is that individuals must own and install the equipment needed to operate a station. This includes a transceiver, transmission lines, and an antenna. Currently, there are more than 730,000 amateur radio operators licensed in the United States, including a number of active clubs in New Jersey, the State I represent in the House. Because communications equipment provides a societal benefit and is a critical part of our Nation’s infrastructure, the FCC prohibits land use restrictions imposed by governments or homeowners’ associations on certain communications equipment. However, these protections do not extend to amateur radio equipment. Roughly 90 percent of new housing in the United States is subject to deed restrictions, homeowners’ associations, and other land use limitations. This is increasingly making the installation of amateur radio equipment more challenging. Amateur radio operators have a history and tradition of being ready, willing, and able to lend their services during times of emergencies at no cost to taxpayers. Due to the nature and structure of amateur radio, hams are able to link communications between first responders using their own networks and equipment. The only necessity for amateur radio stations, however, is some form of outdoor antenna. For this group of unsung heroes with a long tradition of public service when it is needed most, Congress should help deter barriers to their operation. H.R. 555 would extend the FCC protections over limitations on communications equipment to include amateur radio equipment. Now, while I have described the critical role that amateur radio plays during times of disaster, I also understand the concerns shared by homeowners’ associations that this bill will expose their neighborhoods to big towers and antennas. This bill recognizes that there needs to be a balance between the right of homeowners and their associations with the rights of amateur radio operators. That is why Mr. KINZINGER ’s bill passed without objection twice last Congress and enjoys the support of both the amateur radio community and the Community Associations Institute. I congratulate our distinguished colleague from Illinois on working with both sides on this critical issue. Mr. Speaker, there was much discussion and hard work that went into this bill in order to strike the right balance between the rights of the amateur radio community and the concerns of homeowners’ associations. Both sides were willing to compromise, and we are considering a good bill today because of that compromise. I hope all of our colleagues will support this bipartisan piece of legislation that I believe is critical to the safety of the American Nation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 555, the Amateur Radio Parity Act. This is a bill that passed the House last Congress by voice vote after careful negotiations in the Subcommittee on Communications and Technology. Amateur radio operators provide essential services in times of emergencies, and they shouldn’t be prohibited from building their facilities. H.R. 555 will provide for new rules that will help these operators navigate homeowner association restrictions when they are attempting to build their stations. The bill strikes the right balance to ensure that homeowner associations can impose reasonable regulations for amateur radio towers, but it would also make sure that amateur radio enthusiasts can continue to operate. Again, this measure passed the House by voice vote last Congress, and I encourage Members to support it today. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. KINZINGER ), who is the sponsor of the bill. Mr. KINZINGER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for yielding. I also want to thank Chairman WALDEN and Congressman COURTNEY for working with me to introduce this legislation and bring it to the floor for debate today. Additionally, I appreciate the willingness of the associations impacted by this legislation, both the CAI and the ARRL, for working with our offices last Congress in order to come to an agreement on where this legislation needs to be in order to move forward in a bipartisan and a positive manner. The legislation before us today is the same legislative text as H.R. 1301, which was able to gather over 100 bipartisan cosponsors and passed the House by voice vote in the 114th Congress. The intent of this legislation is to remedy current law which prohibits the use of any antenna for amateur radio operators in certain areas with no consideration for the emergency ramifications that come about as a result. For some, this is merely a nuisance, but for others—those who use 
their amateur radio licenses for emergency communications—a dangerous situation has been established by limiting the ability of hams to create effective communications for those in need. For example, during times of emergency service, such as following a hurricane or a tornado, amateur radio operators are able to use their skills and equipment to create a network of communications that are utilized by first responders when other wired or wireless networks are taken down or are otherwise unavailable. This is a vital and lifesaving function. Additionally, there are numerous hams that take their certifications even further by purchasing expensive equipment and going through extensive training to become part of MARS, the Military Auxiliary Radio System. I have personally used this system as a pilot in the military. What is amazing about MARS is that it gives our military members the ability to communicate both domestically and abroad when other systems are not available or are simply not able to establish communications the way that these hams are able to do. MARS members are able to accomplish this not only due to their extensive training and knowledge, but due to their commitment to this program. MARS members must not only have access to expensive highfrequency radio equipment, but they must also file monthly reports and participate in a minimum of 12 hours of radio activity each quarter in order to stay in compliance with the requirements of this program. This is a great service provided by these individuals, and it is my hope that we can get even more amateur radio operators involved in the future with the passage of this bill. Again, the purpose of this bipartisan legislation is to change current regulations hampering the ability of amateur radio operators to effectively communicate in certain areas, while respecting and maintaining the rights of local communities in which many of these hams reside. It is my hope that by passing this bipartisan legislation early in this session of Congress, that we will be able to get this legislation through the Senate and to the President’s desk in short order. Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this bill, and I thank all my friends who helped work with me on this. Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. COURTNEY ), in spite of the fact that the gentleman is a New England Patriots fan who showed no mercy to my Pittsburgh Steelers last night, to show there are no hard feelings. Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. DOYLE for his generous yielding of time and the great work he does representing the great city of Pittsburgh, which has had many Super Bowl rings in the past and will again in the future no doubt. Mr. Speaker, again, I rise in support of this measure. As Mr. KINZINGER indicated, this is the third try that we have pushed this bill on a bipartisan basis, and hopefully the third time will be the charm. It was introduced only 10 days ago, and the fact that, again, we are moving so quickly hopefully is going to send an encouraging signal that the Senate can really move forward and finish this very, I think, important and useful piece of legislation. There are about 737,000 ham radio operators that have been licensed by the Federal Communications Commission across the country. As has been said, they provide a great backup for emergency services around the country. Again, in Connecticut, where we did get hit with Hurricanes Sandy and Irene in backtoback years, the harm that was done to the wireless communications system as well as just the regular radio system really put the spotlight on the fact that ham radio operators were critical in terms of keeping police, fire, and small communities and State services in uptodate, realtime communication regarding both weather conditions as well as public safety conditions. So the work that they perform is not just kind of a hobby; it really has great value to the country. What I think this bill tries to address is that, in 1985, the FCC issued an order and ruling basically describing ham radio as critical to the Nation’s information and communication infrastructure, and that reasonable accommodation should be made in terms of public entities like zoning boards and land use bodies. It did not extend, however, to private land use restrictions. Since the 1980s, there probably hasn’t been a deed signed in the country that hasn’t had land use restrictions, and this bill really tries to, I think, adjust to that reality with the compromise language that has been put forward so that condominium associations and, again, neighborhood developments have to reasonably make sure that this network is going to be able to function. The good news is that the technology has moved forward so well that the antenna intrusion really is not what it used to be, that the equipment that they have is quite remarkable to see how strong their signals are and the reception is with, again, just really almost tiny antenna technology. So, again, this legislation I think really updates the FCC’s promotion of ham radio. Communities that are going to end up depending on it because of natural disaster and other emergency situations I think will benefit strongly. So again, I congratulate all the members of the Energy and Commerce Committee. I thank Mr. DOYLE again for generously yielding his time to me. Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. NEWHOUSE ). Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise to add my voice of strong support for the Amateur Radio Parity Act of 2017. This important measure will affirm individual freedom and property rights and ensure every ham radio operator has the opportunity to enjoy their pastime regardless of the community in which they live. H.R. 555 guarantees that all amateur radio operators living in deedrestricted communities have the right to construct and operate an effective outdoor antenna without burdensome restrictions being imposed by their respective homeowners’ association. Under the bill, HOAs would be required to allow ham radio use with the least practicable restrictions to preserve their aesthetic interests. b1700 Across central Washington, many of my constituents are avid ham radio operators. I believe we should be encouraging this advocation, which also serves as a useful tool for emergency communications and preparedness. I was proud to cosponsor this legislation in the 114th Congress, and I commend the work of Chairman KINZINGER , Chairman WALDEN , and Mr. L ANCE to bring this bill forward again. I look forward to supporting this bill on the House floor later today, and remain hopeful that, in this new Congress, we can advance the Amateur Radio Parity Act to the President’s desk, where it can be signed into law. Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LANCE ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 555. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
IMPROVING RURAL CALL QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ACT OF 2017 Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 460) to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to ensure the integrity of voice communications and to prevent unjust or unreasonable discrimination among areas of the United States in the delivery of such communications. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 460 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Improving Rural Call Quality and Reliability Act of 2017’’. 
Part II of title II of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 251 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following: 
‘‘(a) R EGISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE BY INTERMEDIATE PROVIDERS .—An intermediate provider that offers or holds itself out as offering the capability to transmit covered voice communications from one destination to another and that charges any rate to any other entity (including an affiliated entity) for the transmission shall— ‘‘(1) register with the Commission; and ‘‘(2) comply with the service quality standards for such transmission to be established by the Commission under subsection (c)(1)(B). ‘‘(b) REQUIRED USE OF REGISTERED INTER MEDIATE PROVIDERS .—A covered provider may not use an intermediate provider to transmit covered voice communications unless such intermediate provider is registered under subsection (a)(1). ‘‘(c) COMMISSION RULES .— ‘‘(1) IN GENERAL .— ‘‘(A) REGISTRY .—Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this section, the Commission shall promulgate rules to establish a registry to record registrations under subsection (a)(1). ‘‘(B) SERVICE QUALITY STANDARDS .—Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this section, the Commission shall promulgate rules to establish service quality standards for the transmission of covered voice communications by intermediate providers. ‘‘(2) REQUIREMENTS .—In promulgating the rules required by paragraph (1), the Commission shall— ‘‘(A) ensure the integrity of the transmission of covered voice communications to all customers in the United States; and ‘‘(B) prevent unjust or unreasonable discrimination among areas of the United States in the delivery of covered voice communications. ‘‘(d) PUBLIC AVAILABILITY OF REGISTRY .— The Commission shall make the registry established under subsection (c)(1)(A) publicly available on the website of the Commission. ‘‘(e) SCOPE OF APPLICATION .—The requirements of this section shall apply regardless of the format by which any communication or service is provided, the protocol or format by which the transmission of such communication or service is achieved, or the regulatory classification of such communication or service. ‘‘(f) RULE OF CONSTRUCTION .—Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect the regulatory classification of any communication or service. ‘‘(g) EFFECT ON OTHER LAWS.—Nothing in this section shall be construed to preempt or expand the authority of a State public utility commission or other relevant State agency to collect data, or investigate and enforce State law and regulations, regarding the completion of intrastate voice communications, regardless of the format by which any communication or service is provided, the protocol or format by which the transmission of such communication or service is achieved, or the regulatory classification of such communication or service. ‘‘(h) EXCEPTION .—The requirement under subsection (a)(2) to comply with the service quality standards established under subsection (c)(1)(B) shall not apply to a covered provider that— ‘‘(1) on or before the date that is 1 year after the date of enactment of this section, has certified as a Safe Harbor provider under section 64.2107(a) of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor regulation; and ‘‘(2) continues to meet the requirements under such section 64.2107(a). ‘‘(i) DEFINITIONS .—In this section: ‘‘(1) COVERED PROVIDER .—The term ‘covered provider’ has the meaning given the term in section 64.2101 of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor thereto. ‘‘(2) COVERED VOICE COMMUNICATION .—The term ‘covered voice communication’ means a voice communication (including any related signaling information) that is generated— ‘‘(A) from the placement of a call from a connection using a North American Numbering Plan resource or a call placed to a connection using such a numbering resource; and ‘‘(B) through any service provided by a covered provider. ‘‘(3) INTERMEDIATE PROVIDER .—The term ‘intermediate provider’ means any entity that— ‘‘(A) enters into a business arrangement with a covered provider or other intermediate provider for the specific purpose of carrying, routing, or transmitting voice traffic that is generated from the placement of a call placed— ‘‘(i) from an end user connection using a North American Numbering Plan resource; or ‘‘(ii) to an end user connection using such a numbering resource; and ‘‘(B) does not itself, either directly or in conjunction with an affiliate, serve as a covered provider in the context of originating or terminating a given call.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LANCE ) and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. MICHAEL F. D OYLE ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey. 
Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous materials in the RECORD on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New Jersey? There was no objection. Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 460, the Improving Rural Call Quality and Reliability Act, a bill that earned unanimous support in the last Congress. Consumers expect to be able to pick up the telephone and be connected with businesses, friends, and loved ones across the country. In today’s connected world, that should not be a tall request. Unfortunately, for many constituents across the country, particularly in rural areas, call quality and reliability are just not up to par compared to their urban counterparts. This is due, partly, because of the call routing process where long distance and wireless providers use so called least cost routers. These inexpensive thirdparty intermediate providers try to complete calls for the lowest possible price, without taking measures to ensure the call actually goes through. I am sure that most of us have experienced the annoyance of at least one failed or dropped call. You make a call to someone and it rings over and over again but no one, not even the voicemail, picks up. Or, maybe you place a call, only to hear a prerecorded message telling you that the number you dialed is not in service, even though you know you have the right number. Even in cases where you are able to connect, the sound might be distorted or delayed. For many constituents, this is more than just an annoyance. These missed connections have significant consequences. Folks rely on the networks for more than just staying in touch with loved ones. Our constituents count on reliable networks to run their businesses and receive messages from our community institutions. A failed call can mean a lost sale for a small rural business. Another failed call might mean that a message from your child’s school or your medical provider goes undelivered. These are real and harmful impacts. This bill will address this situation through commonsense improvements. For the most part, consumers are unaware of these intermediate providers, which has allowed them to be held unaccountable. H.R. 460 takes measured steps to bring these intermediate providers out from the shadows and into the light so that we can hold them accountable to the consuming public. First, the bill requires intermediate providers to register with the FCC, and it prohibits carriers from using any nonregistered provider. The bill also requires the FCC to establish a database and publish the list of registered providers on its Web site. Finally, the bill requires the FCC to establish quality standards for these intermediate providers, which will raise the bar for all of the providers who provide call routing services. These straightforward measures are another step in our effort, on a bipartisan basis, to mitigate call completion and quality issues for the consuming public. This bill will build upon the work the FCC has done in recent years. Our constituents in rural areas face significant challenges compared to their urban counterparts, but subpar call quality should not be one of them. By raising the bar, which this bill does, we will hold the bad actors to higher standards and allow consumers to benefit from the improved integrity of our networks. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I also rise to support H.R. 460, Improving Rural Call Quality and Reliability Act, the bipartisan bill introduced by Representative DAVID YOUNG and cosponsored by a number of 
other Members, including Representatives WELCH and L OEBSACK from the Energy and Commerce Committee. We deal with a lot of hightech and complicated issues on the Energy and Commerce Committee, but this bill aims to address the most basic function for a telephone system: making sure all Americans’ phone calls go through. Many people take our modern communications tools for granted, but, in rural America, even the basic function of connecting a call is sometimes difficult. Consumers have been reporting to the FCC that calls in rural areas result in false busy signals, calls not arriving, or long pauses after dialing a number. This isn’t just an important problem for rural Americans but also for people in all of our districts who want to reach loved ones across the country and can’t. This state of affairs is simply not acceptable. We need reliable telephone service to keep us connected. Problems with call completion are often related to intermediate providers—the middlemen hired to route calls. This bill requires intermediate providers to register with the FCC and comply with service quality standards. These commonsense steps should make it easier to figure out when providers are cutting corners or not doing their jobs. Ultimately, the bill puts consumers first by helping to make sure that we can stay connected to one another. H.R. 460 is a bipartisan bill that passed on suspension last Congress, and I urge my colleagues to support it today. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to reclaim the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New Jersey? There was no objection. Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. YOUNG ), the distinguished sponsor of the legislation. Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 460, the bipartisan Improving Rural Call Quality and Reliability Act, legislation I introduced with my colleague from Vermont, Congressman WELCH . This bill helps fix the significant problems rural Iowans and other rural Americans face from dropped and poor quality calls. Reliable communication is critical for our constituents to live their lives, for our businesses to succeed, and for our communities to thrive. Yet, in rural States and areas across America, phone calls are not getting through or the connection and quality are poor. Telephone companies often rely on intermediate providers, who are paid to route calls from larger networks to local service providers. Much of the time, this is to mixed results. There simply is no excuse for these intermediate providers to not fulfill their contracts and leave our rural constituents with unreliable communication service. Dropped, looped, or poor quality calls hurt rural America’s quality of life, impacting our small businesses, farmers, consumers, and our families who are in need of emergency assistance and public services. It also gives unfair blame to our essential local service providers when they are not the problem, they are the solution. A family in rural America should not be disadvantaged because of where they live. Iowa businesses should have the same communication access to conduct daily businesses as those in urban areas. Improving rural call completion rates and quality are important to ensuring the survival of small towns and granting Americans the choice to live and thrive in whatever community is best for them and their family, rural, urban, or anywhere in between. Our bill will help address this problem by requiring providers to register with the FCC in order to meet quality standards and ensure reliable phone service in rural areas. It also prohibits providers from using intermediary routing services not registered with the FCC. I want to personally thank Chairman BLACKBURN and Ranking Member P ALLONE for their attention to this important issue, as well as my partner in this, Congressman WELCH , for the opportunity to get this bill passed. This bill did pass the House in the 114th Congress, and I am hopeful we can get the partnership we need from the Senate to get this to the finish line. Rural Americans deserve it. Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. WELCH ), a distinguished colleague on the Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. WELCH. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. YOUNG for being a great partner in the presentation of this bill. Many of us worked together on rural telecommunications issues, from getting broadband to all Vermonters and folks in rural parts of your districts to improving our wireless infrastructure to ensuring we have adequate choice and competition in cable markets. That is because it is our desire, and mine especially, to ensure that rural America has comparable telecom services to urban and suburban America, just as the 1996 Telecommunications Act requires. Making that happen requires constant effort and focus. We often focus on rural broadband accessibility and affordability so that the next generation of technological innovation does not skip rural America and leave it behind. The promise of innovation, like the Internet of things, should not be earmarked just for urban and suburban America, which is why it is backwards and unfortunate that we are still talking about finding ways to ensure that traditional landline telephone calls can be completed without interruption on a consistent basis, but that is exactly what this bill that I worked on with Representative YOUNG  is getting at. Our bill would require the FCC, the Federal Communications Commission, to establish rules that require third party providers—or least cost routers, as they are called, which is the problem in the call chain—to register their companies, for the first time, with the FCC and, therefore, have to comply with FCC service quality regulations, just like other companies. This legislation would make it easier for the FCC to hold accountable third party providers. The FCC will finally know who they are and make them comply with those quality standards. This is really important in rural areas because we have got companies that do business with urban America. In Vermont, Dakin Farm had rural call completion problems during their busiest times in 2012. That was the Thanksgiving to Christmas holiday period. It really hurt their bottom line. It put them at a competitive disadvantage. When people call in and the call is dropped, they think it is bad service from Dakin Farm or the company that they are calling, when it is not. Those folks have to then deal with the reputational harm that is caused. It is important in rural school districts like Camels Hump in Vermont that rely on these calls when there is a snowstorm or ice storm—and there is one coming tonight—to check whether, in fact, they have got to get their kids to school or not. So it is a big deal when they need it. I appreciate, by the way, the work that Representative YOUNG has done on this. I look forward to this bill passing both Chambers and being signed into law so we can, hopefully, make rural call completion issues a thing of the past. b1715 Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 460, the ‘‘Improving Rural Call Quality and Reliability Act of 2017’’, which amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require voice communications that charge users to register with the FCC, and comply with service quality standards to be established by the FCC. The bill, should it become law, prohibits longdistance providers from using an internet provider to transmit voice communications and signals unless the intermediate provider is registered. H.R. 460 would require the FCC to: 1. Ensure the integrity of voice communications to all customers in the United States, 2. Prevent unjust or unreasonable discrimination across areas of the United States in the delivery of voice communications; and 
3. Make a registry of intermediate providers publicly available on the FCC website. H.R. 460, the Improving Rural Call Quality and Reliability Act of 2016, would seek to ensure that calls to Americans living in the rural areas of our country actually make it through to the intended receiver. Making sure a call goes through, regardless of where it is being made, is fundamental to our communications system. H.R. 460 would require the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to establish basic quality standards for providers that transmit voice calls to consumers, among other things. The Senate Commerce Committee adopted an amendment in the nature of a substitute (AINS) that made the following changes: 1. Extends deadlines for service quality standards for intermediate providers from 180 days to one year, 2. Exempts intermediate providers that have been certified as a safe harbor provider; and 3. Amends the definition of intermediate provider. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 460, the ‘‘Improving Rural Call Quality and Reliability Act of 2017.’’ The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LANCE ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 460. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LANCE ) and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. MICHAEL F. D OYLE ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey. GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous materials in the RECORD on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New Jersey? There was no objection. Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. SCALISE), the distinguished majority whip of the House. Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for yielding and for managing the time here. I bring forward this FCC Consolidated Reporting Act because this is a bill that focuses on streamlining government. It focuses on really establishing and identifying areas where we need to improve competition in the telecommunications marketplace and make recommendations to Congress that can help us make better policy for the country. At the same time, we are eliminating a lot of unnecessary reports that are currently burdening not only the people who are out there creating jobs but also the FCC by having eight different reports that are required annually to be filed and to be evaluated by the FCC at disparate times throughout the year, to consolidate all that into one report, one report that focuses on the entire telecommunications marketplace on a biennial basis. That report would come in at the end of the 2year period so that each new Congress would be presented with very relevant and much more timely information that would help each Congress evaluate if changes and reforms need to be made to the law. What laws am I talking about, Mr. Speaker? I am talking about in the current marketplace some of these various disparate reports where you might have throughout the year a requirement where a report has to look just at the satellite industry or a report looks just at the cable industry or a report looks just at the landline industry. Mr. Speaker, as we know, all of these industries now compete against each other, and whether you are getting your telecommunications data at home, through a cable, through fiber, through satellite, on your mobile device, it is all ultimately the same content that people are consuming, and all of these companies are competing against each other. It is not like in the old days where you just had telephone lines and the telephone companies would compete against each other, and then cable companies would compete against each other. Now it is a consolidated marketplace, and it is time that we get all these disparate reports that are outdated and bring them all into one place. When you look at what this means, they say time is money, and so when all of these reports are required by Federal law, where all of these different entities have to put together reports and a lot of times create documents, paperwork that is unnecessary, that is outdated, that doesn’t really reflect what is happening in the marketplace, that is time that they can better spend creating jobs, Mr. Speaker. It is time they can better spend reinvesting so that we can have better broadband as consumers, families across the country that use all of this great telecommunications infrastructure. Let’s focus more on competing and creating a better marketplace. Something else this bill does is get rid of some outdated laws, Mr. Speaker. Do you know there is still a requirement in Federal law, that we get rid of in this bill, that there is a requirement every year that there has to be a telegraph report that studies competition in the telegraph industry. Mr. Speaker, this might have been useful back in 1934 when Congress mandated it. You can go back to the 1830s when Samuel Morse invented the telegraph, but we don’t really need to be spending time and legal requirements that there be a report filed annually on competition in the telegraph industry. We get rid of that in this bill. So often we hear from people around the country, when Congress is contemplating new laws, when are they going to get rid of some of the old laws that are unnecessary on the books? We actually do that in this bill. This has bipartisan support. It is a commonsense piece of legislation that actually streamlines government and focuses on helping increase competition for families across this country. I urge adoption of this piece of legislation. Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 599, the FCC Consolidated Reporting Act. This bill passed the House last Congress with unanimous support after careful negotiations that resulted in a bipartisan agreement. The FCC oversees a wide range of industries that drive economic growth in the Nation. These industries connect businesses to markets large and small, but, most importantly, they deliver innovative new products and services to consumers. Democrats and Republicans agree that the FCC needs to collect good data to inform the public about these dynamic markets. Good data is important for Congress to have as well so that we can make good policy decisions and conduct oversight of the FCC. At the same time, we have worked to ensure this effort to promote efficiency does not undermine important existing FCC obligations and authorities. Again, this bill is one I think that all Members can support. I urge its passage today. 
Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers on my side, so I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, this bill is an important step toward modernizing the Federal Communications Commission. The FCC has served Americans since 1934, and over the past more than 80 years, this agency has been responsible for overseeing the evolving telecommunications sector, with collecting information and analyzing the state of competition, and the impact of these changes on consumers. As society has moved from one technology to the next, the FCC has been asked to keep up with the changing technologies, and Congress has directed the Commission with reviewing data and reporting on everything from the telegraph, as Mr. SCALISE has indicated, and the AM radio to online video distributions like Hulu and Netflix. This bill will eliminate reports that are no longer necessary and waste time and resources on issues that are no longer critical to consumers. The bill also recognizes that technology continues to progress and consumers are no longer served by separate voice, data, or video networks. Rather, providers are leveraging the same IP network to provide multiple services over the same network. Providers that were solely video providers now offer voice and data. Companies that thought of themselves as telephone providers are also offering video and broadband services. The game has changed, and we believe that the FCC should change its reporting to reflect the new reality. This bill consolidates multiple annual or biennial reports that require the agency to evaluate competition in different sectors. We will no longer require a separate mobile wireless or a separate video competition report. Rather, the bill requires the Commission to evaluate the state of competition across multiple tech industries in a single biennial report on competition in the communications marketplace. Our policymakers should be looking at the world as it is, not the world that once existed. I thank the majority whip for his leadership in sponsoring this bill. He has always shown a keen interest in modernizing the communications marketplace, and I welcome his continued engagement over the 115th Congress, where he serves with such distinction as our whip. I also thank the gentlewoman from California (Ms. ESHOO ), the former ranking member, for her work in ensuring that this bill is bipartisan in nature and is successful. I certainly thank Mr. DOYLE for his leadership as well. I urge my colleagues to vote for this bill. I look forward to more bipartisan work on this and other issues in this Congress. I am hopeful that this bill will reach our new President’s desk as soon as possible. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LANCE ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 599. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
KARI’S LAW ACT OF 2017 Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 582) to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to require multiline telephone systems to have a configuration that permits users to directly initiate a call to 9–11 without dialing any additional digit, code, prefix, or post fix, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 582 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Kari’s Law Act of 2017’’. 
SEC. 2. CONFIGURATION OF MULTILINE TELEPHONE SYSTEMS FOR DIRECT DIALING OF 9–1–1. 
(a) I NGENERAL .—Title VII of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following: 
‘‘SEC. 721. CONFIGURATION OF MULTILINE TELEPHONE SYSTEMS FOR DIRECT DIALING OF 9–1–1.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LANCE ) and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. MICHAEL F. D OYLE ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey. 
Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous materials in the RECORD on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New Jersey? There was no objection. Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. At our subcommittee hearing last April, we heard the very moving testimony of Mr. Hank Hunt. Hank told us the story of how his daughter Kari was brutally murdered in a Texas motel bathroom in December 2013. As emotional as his story was, Hank continued with the gut wrenching details of how Kari’s daughter frantically tried and failed to reach first responders. The little girl had done as she was always taught, dial 911 for help. Tragically, as it turns out, that was her mistake. Due to the configuration of the phone installed in the motel room, she needed to dial 9 before dialing an outside number. Time after time she tried, but the call never went through. The first responders who could have attempted to save Kari’s life were not reached in time. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this commonsense bill that has the ability to save lives. Unfortunately, it 
cost the life of Kari Hunt before the call for action was recognized. Multiline telephone systems, like the one in that Texas motel room, are everywhere. Many businesses, including hotels, offices, and schools, use MLTS at their facilities across the country. They serve a very practical purpose and make connecting to other onsite users much easier. Unfortunately, many of these phones do not preset with the ability directly to dial 911. It may be routine for someone who works in an office to know to dial 9 before dialing out, but would the instinct seem so natural during an emergency? Incidentally, I have telephones in offices here and in several district locations in New Jersey, and in some of those offices you dial 9 and in some you don’t. Moreover, our children should not have to be taught that sometimes they need to dial an extra number. 911 should mean 911. Those three numbers are one of the earliest things many parents teach their children. Kari’s Law would require multiline telephone systems to be configured with the ability directly to dial 911 without any additional prefix. b1730 The law would also require that multiline phone systems be configured to notify a central location within the system’s facility when someone initiates a call to 911. This provision will help ensure first responders have the information needed to better locate and assist the caller. There are some businesses, including a number of hotel chains, who have shown initiative and applied these changes in their facilities already. I commend them, but there is more work to be done. These simple fixes should be adopted and implemented nationwide. When dialing to reach emergency responders, it needs to go through, period. I thank Hank Hunt, Kari’s father, who has been a tireless advocate for this legislation. He has brought this important issue to our attention. Kari’s Law passed without objection twice last Congress, and I urge all of my colleagues to support Representative GOHMERT ’s bill once again. Representative GOHMERT has certainly taken the lead on this across the United States. He is an angel of mercy in this regard. I hope this legislation becomes law this year and will be signed into law by our new President because I think it is critical for the safety of the American people. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. 
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATTON  MultiLine Telephone Systems (MLTS) serve multiple telephone users at a single site, often an office building, hotel, university campus, or similar location. One common feature of MLTS is the configuration that permits shorter dialing sequences within the system by requiring a user to dial a digit or prefix to reach a number outside of the system—that is, dial ‘‘9’’ before reaching an outside line. Thus, on some MLTS a user may have to dial the prefix when attempting to make an emergency call. In December 2013, Kari Hunt was killed by her estranged husband in a motel room in Texas. Her daughter repeatedly attempted to dial 9–1–1 from the motel room, but was unable to reach emergency responders because the motel’s MLTS required users to dial ‘‘9’’ to reach an outside line. Kari’s Law seeks to ensure that this situation does not result in confusion in the heat of an emergency, preventing others from accessing essential emergency services from an MLTS phone. While many hotels and office buildings have begun to make this change to their systems, this bill would make it a universal requirement. H.R. 582 requires that all MLTS have a default configuration that allows users to directly dial 9–1–1, without the need for any additional digit or prefix, from any phone with dialing facilities. In addition, the system must also be configured to notify a designated central point of contact when someone initiates a call to 9–1–1 using the system. By notifying a central point of contact, emergency responders are better able to access, locate, and assist a caller who initiates a 9–1–1 call within the MLTS. SECTION BYSECTION ANALYSIS OF THE  
LEGISLATION  Section 1. Short title Section 1 provides that the Act may be cited as the ‘‘Kari’s Law Act of 2017.’’ Section 2. Configuration of multiline telephone systems for direct dialing of 9–1–1 Section 2(a) adds a new Section 721 to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended. New Section 721(a) requires that any person manufacturing, selling, importing, or leasing multiline telephone systems only do so if the system is preconfigured in a way that a user may directly initiate a call to 9– 1–1 without dialing any additional digits or prefixes. This section applies to any system that is sold, leased, offered, or imported for use in the United States after the effective date. This includes systems that have call control located outside of the U.S., but have terminals or end points in the U.S. While systems are required to be preconfigured with the default dialing pattern described in this section, it does not preclude the inclusion of additional optional dialing patterns to reach 9–1–1 (e.g. (9)9–1–1). However, if the system is configured with these additional dialing patterns, they must be in addition to the default pattern. New Section 721(b) requires that any person who installs, operates, or manages a MLTS only do so if the system is configured such that a user may directly initiate a call to 9–1–1 without any additional digit or prefix. This section also applies to systems installed, managed, or operated for use in the United States. New Section 721(c) requires that systems be configured to provide a notification to either a central location at the facility where the system is located, or to a contact person or organization regardless of location. This section is intended to assist first responders in their emergency response by providing access and information needed to locate the caller. This can be particularly important in large buildings like hotels, hospitals, and schools, where onsite personnel are uniquely suited to provide information about the building and its occupants. This provision requires the system to designate a central point of contact, but allows the MLTS owner or operator some flexibility in determining the most appropriate contact, whether in the building or otherwise. This subsection only applies to systems where the configuration is achievable without an improvement to the hardware or software of the system. The Committee intends this provision to include upgrades to the core systems of a MLTS, but not the addition of additional extensions or lines. The Committee also intends this provision to apply to substantial upgrades to the software, particularly those requiring a significant purchase. Minor software upgrades that are easily achieved or are made to improve the security of the system would not be considered an ‘‘improvement’’ for the purposes of this section. The legislation seeks to balance the need for an onsite notification with the goal of not placing an undue burden on MLTS owners or operators. New Section 721(d) clarifies that this legislation does not alter the authority of state or local agencies with jurisdiction over emergency communications, as long as that authority isn’t exercised in a manner inconsistent with this legislation. New Section 721(e) allows for enforcement under Title V of the Communications Act, but only to the extent that the section allows for the imposition of a fine. New Section 721(f) defines multiline telephone system by crossreferencing the definition in Section 6502 of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012. Section 2(b) sets an effective date for the changes at two years after the date of enactment of the Act. 
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in general support of H.R. 582. The primary sponsor is Representative GOHMERT . This is a bill that passed the House last Congress by voice vote. I agree that we must do all we can to make sure that consumers using multiline telephone systems can directly dial 911 without having to dial additional digits first. These are in many large office buildings and hotels. Many of these systems require consumers to dial an extra 9 before they get a dial tone. You have to hit 9 before you get your dial tone to get an outside line. Most of us know that, but too many people do not realize that this applies to 911. If you don’t dial 9 first, you can’t reach the emergency services. Such a requirement led to a tragedy in Texas several years ago. Kari Dunn was killed while her 9yearold daughter tried to call for help. She did what she was taught to do in an emergency. She dialed 911. But because the system she was using required her to dial a 9 first, she only heard silence on the other end of the line. Building on the Herculean effort of Kari Dunn’s family, we are one step closer to fixing this problem once and for all. H.R. 582 is an important step to making our systems work better in an emergency. But for all the good this bill does, it still leaves work to be done. Specifically, these multiline systems still often fail to deliver accurate location information to first responders. That means that if somebody called 911 from this very building, for instance, precious minutes would tick by as emergency personnel struggle to figure out where the call came from in this 
enormous complex. That delay could be the difference between life and death. We have to correct this problem, too, because making sure the call goes through is only helpful if the public safety officials can find the caller. Democrats tried to include such a provision in the version of this bill from last Congress, and at that time we received a commitment from Chairman WALDEN to work together on a separate bill to address this concern. We were not able to solve this problem in the last Congress, and we expect that commitment will carry over to this Congress. I urge Members to support H.R. 582. Mr. Speaker, we have no other speakers on this side, so I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the distinguished gentleman from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT ), the sponsor of this legislation. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I am very grateful to Mr. LANCE for his great leadership on this issue. And I appreciate the comments of my friend across the aisle, Mr. DOYLE . This did pass by voice vote. One can’t help but wonder: How many times has this played out that we don’t know about? How many times has there been a child that tried to dial 911? How many times has a panicked adult dialed 911 not knowing? And I was in a hotel the other day where you had to dial 7 to get out. How many times has somebody been killed trying to dial 911? We don’t know. There is no way to know. But we do know that this is the right thing to do. And the only reason this came forward is after the tragic loss of Kari. Her death occurred over several minutes. Normally in a town like Marshall, especially in a town like that, the police are going to be there within a minute or two when something goes on this long. It was a beating; it was a stabbing; her daughter was trying to dial. After Kari had left this world, her daughter was sitting in Hank Hunt’s lap. She was crying saying: I did all I could. I kept dialing 911 and it wouldn’t go through. Hank was torn up about it and got to investigating. That is when this was brought to light. When Hank brought it to my attention, we got to investigating. And we do have limits here in Congress. We are not supposed to go meddling, according to the 10th Amendment, in State and local affairs; but this is a matter of interstate communications. This is a matter for the Congress. This goes across State lines constantly. It is in the public domain across the country. If we don’t do it when it involves interstate commerce, then nobody else has the authority to go across State lines. I also thank the FCC Commissioner Pai, who I understand will soon be the chairman, for all his efforts because he truly participated. We found out that there is really no cost. If we pass this law such as it is, then the companies that produce these phones would just set the default position so that when someone dials 911, it goes straight to an emergency operator without having to dial a prefix, whether it is 7, 9, 3, whatever. So there is no cost in that. It is just telling them how to do the default. What about existing lines? And then we found from people that have installed these multiphone lines that, actually, if somebody calls and says, ‘‘Hey, we need to get our phone system reset so you can dial 911 and it goes straight through,’’ everyone that we have talked to that was in that business said, ‘‘Oh, we will come make that switch for free.’’ So we knew we had a bill here, we had a law—it goes across party lines, it goes across bicameral lines—we had an opportunity to pass a bill. I am grateful to Senator KLOBUCHAR  in the Senate and all the bipartisan support there. As my friend, Mr. DOYLE , pointed out, there is another push. Let’s identify exactly where someone is within that multiline system. That will cost money. There are some that have said: Look, if there is somebody that is making a secret call, they don’t want the bad guys figuring out where the call is coming from. So there are other issues involved here, but we have a bill that will save lives and it is agreeable across the aisle. It passed this manner in the past Congress. It will pass this way again today. So I urge not only our friends here in the House, but also my friends in the Senate, please pass this bill that we all agree on, save lives, and then let’s have a full and thorough debate on the part that will cost money. We have some mom and pop hotels that say: If you make us buy a new phone system, the one we have won’t be able to identify which room is making the call. You make us add to that, we are already in trouble. We are barely getting by. Please don’t add more costs to what we are struggling to pay as it is. Let’s have that debate in a separate bill. Go in and pass this noncontroversial one for Kari’s sake and for the sake of all of those that would come into the same situation. Let’s just pass this bill. Kari, as her father and her daughters have said, will then not have died for nothing. Her loss of life will save lives in the future. Again, I thank my friend, Mr. LANCE . What a great American, the way he pursues matters of conscience. I appreciate again my friend across the aisle, Mr. DOYLE . I urge passage of this bill now, today. Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, we have no further speakers. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 582, the Kari’s Law Act of 2017, which amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require multiline telephone systems to have a configuration that permits users to directly initiate a call 9–1–1 without dialing any additional digit, code, prefix, or postfix. As a senior member of the House Committees on Homeland Security and Judiciary, I am well aware of the importance of 9–1–1 services and some of the challenges of E–9– 1–1 to ensure that those seeking emergency assistance receive the help they need. H.R. 582 would create parity for landline ‘‘9– 1–1 services’’ and smartphone E–9–1–1 services’’ so that emergency assistance request from either is treated the same. The bill requires that those engaged in the manufacturing, importation, sale, and lease of telecommunication service or devices preconfigured technology to dial 9–1–1. The goal of H.R. 582 is to ensure that all emergency calls regardless of the source are routed properly to emergency services. Kari’s Law is not intended to alter the authority of State commissions or other State or local agencies with jurisdiction over emergency communications. The establishment of the Kari’s Law Act acknowledges the importance of the configuration of multiline telephones systems for direct dialing for 9–1–1. Over the past two decades, the personal communications of Americans have changed. The Wireless Association reported that the penetration of cellular devices surpassed 100 percent in 2012, and as of the latest 2014 report, penetration is now at 110 percent. According to the Pew Research Center, 68 percent of U.S. adults have a smartphone, up from 35 percent in 2011, and tablet computer ownership has edged up to 45 percent among adults, according to newly released survey data from the Pew Research Center. Smartphone ownership is nearing the saturation point with some groups: 86 percent of those ages 18 through 29 have a smartphone, as do 83 percent of those ages 30 through 49 and 87 percent of those living in households earning $75,000 and up annually. With so many mobile devices deployed the majority of calls to 911 emergency public safety answering points (PSAP) originate from them. U.S. emergency dispatch agencies report that wireless callers are responsible for at least 80 percent of their emergency call volume. For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to Support H.R. 582, Kari’s Law Act of 2017. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LANCE ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 582. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess until approximately 6:30 p.m. today. 
Accordingly (at 5 o’clock and 41 minutes p.m.), the House stood in recess. 
b1830 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia) at 6 o’clock and 30 minutes p.m. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, I come before this body tonight with my colleagues from Mississippi and Georgia to offer our prayers for those whose lives were lost, whose homes were destroyed, and whose neighborhoods were 
shattered during this weekend’s tornadoes across the Southeast. We also extend our deepest gratitude to our first responders, local law enforcement, and emergency personnel for their quick, courageous, and compassionate response in the aftermath of the storm. Finally, I also want to say thank you to the citizens of Mississippi who rushed toward the sites of devastation. Their generosity, bravery, and willingness to help their neighbors gives me hope that our community will rebuild again and be stronger than ever. We will get through this difficult time together, confident in our ability to persevere through any trial, with neighbor helping neighbor, as we begin the difficult work of rebuilding our community following this terrible natural disaster. Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. BISHOP ). Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, in my hometown of Albany, Georgia, four of my neighbors lost their lives due to the tornadoes and storms that tore through our city. Many more in both Albany and the larger region had their homes destroyed and their lives upended. For the second time this month, our region has confronted the worst that Mother Nature had to offer. However, I am confident that, with the grace of God, we will continue to see the best in human nature as we come together as a community to support each other during these very, very trying times. I ask that the Members of this House, the Senate, and the administration join my colleagues from Mississippi and Georgia to ensure that all of those impacted by these disasters are provided the necessary resources to recover and to rebuild their lives as soon as possible. In this moment, though it is but a small gesture, given the magnitude of the disaster, I ask that the House observe a moment of silence to recognize and remember the victims of the storms and tornadoes that struck the Southeast region of our Nation. 
KARI’S LAW ACT OF 2017 The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. CARTER of Georgia). Without objection, 5minute voting will continue. There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The unfinished business is the vote on the motion to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 582) to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to require multi line telephone systems to have a configuration that permits users to directly initiate a call to 9–11 without dialing any additional digit, code, prefix, or postfix, and for other purposes, on which the yeas and nays were ordered. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LANCE ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, due to bad weather that did not allow for me to arrive in Washington, DC, in time, I was unavoidably detained. Had I been in attendance, I would have voted ‘‘yes’’ on: H.R. 423—AntiSpoofing Act of 2017. H.R. 582—Kari’s Law Act of 2017. 
REPORT ON RESOLUTION PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 7, NO TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ABORTION AND ABORTION INSURANCE FULL DISCLOSURE ACT OF 2017 Ms. CHENEY, from the Committee on Rules, submitted a privileged report (Rept. No. 115–5) on the resolution (H. Res. 55) providing for consideration of the bill (H.R. 7) to prohibit taxpayer funded abortions, which was referred to the House Calendar and ordered to be printed. 
A POSITIVE MESSAGE FROM PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, Friday marked a positive new era for American families, as Donald J. Trump was sworn in as the 45th President of the United States, with MIKE PENCE serving as the 48th Vice President. President Donald Trump and Vice President PENCE will work alongside Speaker PAULRYANto create jobs, replace ObamaCare with a patientcentered alternative, and promote a national defense so that American families can be protected, policies that were clearly outlined in his inaugural address. In an oped published in Forbes, President Trump’s speech was described as ‘‘revolutionary.’’ The article went on to detail how ‘‘he has defined a new role for the government, for the public, for patriotism, for America first.’’ President Trump confirmed: ‘‘This is your day, your celebration . . . What matters is that your country is ruled by you, the people.’’ In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. The hateful protesters who assaulted my inaugural guests from New Jersey with water balloons will fail again, as President Trump with Speaker RYAN prevail creating jobs. 
THE WOMEN’S MARCH WAS DEMOCRACY IN ACTION (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, 7,000 in Rhode Island, over 500,000 in Washington, and millions across the country, the Women’s March was democracy in action this past Saturday, and it filled me with hope, hope for a better future and hope that we can withstand whatever challenges lie ahead as a nation. The scene in Rhode Island was incredible, replicated around the world. I joined millions who gathered and marched to remind us that women’s rights are human rights and to support inclusion and equality for all—immigrants, the LGBT community, people of color, people with disabilities, and people of differing faiths and backgrounds. This is the diversity that makes us stronger as a nation, and this is the diversity that President Trump must now represent in a way that is befitting of the honor and dignity of his office. Together, Mr. Speaker, we must hold him accountable to protect opportunity for all Americans, not just a select few, because it is by working together, treating people with dignity and respect that we move America forward. A rising tide lifts all boats, Mr. Speaker. I believe that the rising tide of engagement and passion that we saw on Saturday will lift all Americans. f 
ANOTHER BETRAYAL OF ISRAEL BY THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Friday morning, as the 45th President was about to be sworn in, Obama administration officials packed up their desks and prepared to ride off into the sunset, but not before quietly slipping in a lastminute surprise snub to Israel on their way out of town by shipping off $221 million to the Palestinian Authority. Mr. Speaker, this move is sadly not surprising, but wildly inappropriately insulting. The final days of the Obama White House were filled with unapologetic, downright hostility to our friend Israel. Just last month the United States betrayed our friends by allowing the U.N. Security Council to vote attacking Israel. Now in the shadow of that vote, in a last act of defiance, the old group sent millions of dollars to fill the coffers of Israel’s enemy. Thankfully, there is a new man in charge in Washington. President Trump has pledged to support Israel, not betray them. He says he will move the United States Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a move I support if the Israelis support that. Israel is our greatest friend and should never question where we stand. The Trump White House seems to understand that. Good riddance to those who did not understand it. And that is just the way it is. 
PEELING BACK THE MANY LAYERS OF THE ACA (Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Trump administration’s recently announced action of peeling back the many layers of the Affordable Care Act. For millions of hardworking Americans who have carried the burden of this law, relief is finally on the way. President Trump’s first order of business was to issue an executive order to begin reversing the damages of the Affordable Care Act and start to minimize costs for consumers. Under the ACA, premiums have skyrocketed while access to health care has dwindled for many Americans, including many of whom reside in my own California’s First District. The American people have spoken. They want this disastrous law repealed. Grand claims of 20 to 30 million newly covered are obscured by the fact that over 6 million would rather pay the penalty because they can’t afford the Affordable Care Act. The quick action taken by President Trump will aid our efforts in Congress to both repeal and replace the ACA with something better. The American people have suffered through the nightmare that is ACA. Luckily, they won’t have to do so for much longer. f 
IF PRESIDENT TRUMP WERE A DEMOCRAT (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, just think what the media would be saying about President Trump if he were a Democrat: 
He has tremendous energy. He campaigned for 18 months, puts in 15hour days, and has the stamina of a bull elephant like Teddy Roosevelt. He is courageous, even fearless. Given the amount of hate directed his way, no doubt he constantly receives death threats. But that doesn’t curtail his public appearances or seem to worry him in the least. He has conviction. He practices what he preaches. He doesn’t waffle or waver. And he is obviously not deterred by media criticism. He is a great father. Anytime his son or daughter calls, he picks up the phone. He includes them in his activities. Clearly, he has a strong relationship with his children. He is off to a fast start. His Cabinet consists of smart, experienced, and successful individuals. He already has taken steps to keep jobs in America, put unnecessary regulations on hold, and improve health care. Consumer confidence is at a 16year high. 
No, the national liberal media won’t print that or air it or post it. Better to get your news directly from the President. In fact, it might be the only way to get the unvarnished truth. 
b1915 NO AMERICAN TAXPAYER DOLLARS TO FUND ABORTIONS (Mr. BERGMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act. The premise of this bill is clear: American taxpayer dollars will not be used to fund abortion in this country. 
I stand here today as a husband, father, grandfather, and, most importantly, as someone who cherishes the Godgiven right to life. In a country founded on life and liberty, the act of abortion should not be condoned, and it certainly should not be subsidized. It is fitting that the House consider this legislation this week as we prepare for millions of people to come to Washington, D.C., for the annual March for Life rally where they will give a voice to the unborn. We must work together to move the prolife message and pro life policies forward to protect those who cannot yet speak for themselves. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 7, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, and stand up for the principles of life and liberty. 
AMERICA IS A COUNTRY FOR ALL PEOPLE (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, having worked for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and been engaged with many of the foot soldiers that studied under Dr. Martin Luther King, I love and cherish nonviolent protests and the rights for people to petition. I hold up a beautiful and powerful statement by way of a picture, powerful together, as thousands marched across the Nation, upwards of 1 million and maybe even more. I am particularly proud of those in Houston, Texas, and particularly ‘‘Across Texas, marchers ‘just can’t be silent anymore.’’’ Congratulations to those who marched safely, securely, and nonviolently. Congratulations to the Houston organizers. Yes, it is your right to fight against the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, the ignoring of the funding of access to women’s health care. It is your right to fight for educational opportunity. It is your right to recognize that we have rights as women, but we have rights as Americans; and it is your right to seek a nation that will be representative of all of the people, no matter where they come from, what their religious background is, what regions they live for. It is beyond the wonderful Midwest that the Nation needs to be represented. It is in the far corners of the east and the north, yes, down in Houston, Texas, far to the west. We cannot isolate and say we won with few votes from this region. America is a country for all people, and I look forward to this Congress and this White House representing all of us. 
APPOINTMENT OF INDIVIDUALS TO GOVERNING BOARD OF THE OFFICE OF CONGRESSIONAL ETHICS The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana). The Chair announces the Speaker’s appointment, pursuant to section 4(c) of House Resolution 5, 115th Congress, and the order of the House of January 3, 2017, of the following individuals to serve as the Governing Board of the Office of Congressional Ethics: Nominated by the Speaker after consultation with the minority leader: Mr. Richard Norman ‘‘Doc’’ Hastings, Washington, Chairman Mr. James M. Eagen, III, Colorado Ms. Allison R. Hayward, Virginia Ms. Judy Biggert, Illinois, alternate Nominated by the minority leader after consultation with the Speaker: Mr. David Skaggs, Colorado, Co Chairman Brigadier General (retired) Belinda Pinckney, Virginia Ms. Karan English, Arizona Mr. Mike Barnes, Maryland, alternate f 
FIXING OUR NATION’S HEALTH CARE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. SESSIONS ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, tonight, what I would like to do is engage the American people on several subjects. I will be speaking for quite a bit of time tonight on the health care issue facing America. Mr. Speaker, before I get there, I yield to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. FORTENBERRY ), a very dear friend of mine. 
Mr. FORTENBERRY. Mr. Speaker, first, let me thank the chairman for yielding, but, more importantly, for his extraordinarily hard work as chairman of the Rules Committee. I don’t think a lot of people are aware just how critical his job is in shepherding and guiding order in our institution here. So I am grateful for his hard work, most grateful for his friendship, and very grateful for his leadership. I thank him so much for the time. Mr. Speaker, when Presidents give their inaugural addresses, we are very accustomed to lofty narratives, to visionary ideals, and to sweeping language. But last Friday, President Trump spoke very differently. The only sweeping thing in the President’s speech was his reference to the windswept plains of Nebraska. Of course, when I heard that, I perked up. President Trump’s speech was a striking and direct call for a new, healthy nationalism. He spoke to the people, about the people, and for the people. A certain awkwardness marked the beginning of his speech, not only because of the initial confrontational style from the outset, but it also began to rain as the President started, creating a bit of an uncomfortable moment. But then the rain suddenly stopped and his speech gained momentum. He discussed, in hard terms, some of the stark realities we are facing and how they might be resolved for our country. Mr. Speaker, we all know this, that defining problems is an easy task, but finding solutions is much harder. While President Trump’s speech lacked specifics in that regard, nonetheless, there was extraordinary power in the attempt to articulate an America that has been lost to globalized supplyside elitism, an America that has been lost to drugs and crime, and an America that has systems that no longer seem to serve all persons. It just seems that no matter how hard individuals work, they just can’t get ahead. Mr. Speaker, our President’s speech was an authoritative call for a new national unity, particularly for those forgotten. The idea that America can do better, that we must do better, and that we will do better for everyone was clearly conveyed by President Trump. I recognize the tone of this speech will not have universal appeal. It was to the point, direct, and firm. It was not a delicate, textured speech. But the President was clear when he declared: ‘‘The American carnage stops right here and stops right now.’’ Mr. Speaker, we are witnessing a renewed and important and essential focus on reviving America’s economy. The multinational corporations of this world are on notice: they cannot play both sides of the balance sheet, being for us and against us at the same time, and the benefits of exchange will have to be fair for all. Frankly, I believe this creates possibilities, possibilities for authentic relationships with peoples around the world rather than a transactional one. If this objective can be achieved, it will be constructive indeed. A healthy American nationalism will lead to properly ordered international engagement—for our benefit and the benefit of others. Mr. Speaker, when the President spoke before the entirety of our government, he also spoke before the House of Representatives. The President’s authoritative style, communicating the desire to devolve power from Washington as well as Wall Street, interestingly repositions Congress to its appropriate role in governing society through the power of the people. Mr. Speaker, it is statistically shown that the majority of Americans believe that it is the job of Congress to do whatever the President says. This is not true. Congress is an independent, coequal branch of government that makes the law, which is interpreted by the judiciary and enforced by the President. But across Democratic and across Republican executive administrations more and more power has been taken by the executive and has been ceded by Congress. This balance of power, this necessary balance of power, this original idea of the balance of power, has been out of balance for 100 years, and perhaps now a realignment begins. 
Mr. Speaker, whether you love President Trump or you loathe him, or whether you are someplace in between with certain apprehensions but hoping that President Trump succeeds, Friday, Inauguration Day, was an extraordinary American day. What we saw was the successful and peaceful transfer of power. Mr. Speaker, with that, I want to thank, again, my good friend, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. SESSIONS ), for yielding to me. Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. FORTEN BERRY ) not only for taking time today to discuss the important things that he has on his mind, but also for sharing with the American people his ideas about where our country is and where we are headed with the new Presidency, a new Senate, and a new House of Representatives. Tonight, Mr. Speaker, I rise to talk about the current state of our Nation’s healthcare system. Mr. Speaker, tonight I am given this time as a result of the majority leader, Mr. MCCARTHY . He has given me time to talk about an important issue that faces not only our country, but also elected Members of the House of Representatives and the United States Senate and the President of the United States, our new President, President Trump. As each of us is aware, the issue of health care is one of the most important issues that has been faced in our Nation for many years. Back in 2009, President Obama began the search that he talked about for what was called an Affordable Care Act. The Affordable Care Act seemed to be a promise to make health care better. It seemed to be a word, in the words of the President, an Affordable Care Act that would help all Americans to receive health care on a fair basis and one that would be sustainable. The President stood before this body several times and talked about his ideas about health care. It took about a year, maybe a little bit more, for the Democratic Congress to work through this issue. On or about March 21 or 22, 2010, a bill popped out of the United States Senate, came to the House of Representatives, and we handled the matter here up in the Rules Committee, brought it to the floor, passed it with debate, no opposition—no opposition, meaning Republicans were not allowed to present an alternative case, a bill. It was a closed rule. And the Democrats passed it and went to the White House the next day, March 23, 2010, and signed the bill. b1930 The American people had grave reservations about that, but what happened is that it took several years in which they were working through this process. We did not know exactly what would happen; but, almost immediately, hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of spending would take place and taxes would take place. What the President did and what the Democrat Party did is they tied health care directly to employers and put mandates on top of employers and mandates on top of individuals with the belief that individuals would be forced into taking what was then ObamaCare—health care—under the Affordable Care Act. What has happened over the years, including as we stand today, is that only some 12 to 20 million people are on ObamaCare at any one time. That is because the system that was devised and run by the Affordable Care Act is a system that does not work well. It is very expensive. It provides limited benefits. And perhaps worst of all, the promise that it would make health care available and better for poorer people never materialized as they sold it. In fact, healthcare providers are reimbursed 50 percent less than from normal insurance; meaning that, while you may have some bit of coverage, the people who would accept that health care are hard to find. It is true that many times you could find someone who is a GP—someone who is a family physician, someone who is an internist who might take what is known as ObamaCare—but if he found something that might be wrong or needed to refer that individual, it was very difficult to do. In my hometown of Dallas, Texas, major hospitals do not take what is known as ObamaCare under the Affordable Care Act, and it is because of this problem that it is a false promise for the people who are on it. Members of Congress are legally required to be on ObamaCare if we accept the health care from our providers, but President Obama did not ask anyone else in government to fall under the same opportunities that we would have as Members of Congress. Over the years, it became a festering point—a sore—among not only those who were paying the costs, but also those who were on it saw it as a concrete life preserver, one that did not live up to its billing. Repeatedly, businesses would come to the House of Representatives— to Members of Congress—and say to us: This law is not only not working, it is causing us to make fulltime employees become parttime employees because we cannot either pay or do not want to or do not have the ability to follow all of the requirements of the law. We here in America saw not only dwindling opportunities for employment, but we also saw the skyrocketing cost—from taxes, from behavior that did not help health care. So Republicans, yes, and the American people began talking about some way that we could isolate health care to where we would have our friends who were Democrats want to accept one of these opportunities to fix this broken system. Over the years, Republicans offered some 60 different alternative votes—piece parts, rifle shots—that said we want to fix ObamaCare, the Affordable Care Act. We picked 60 different things about the bill that were either incomplete, that did not live up to the billing, that caused bad behavior, or that simply were tremendously anticompetitive in their nature. It was a lonely few years. As the chairman of the House Rules Committee, day after day, we would seek opportunities for our colleagues to come join us to present their ideas, and they not only disagreed with us, but they chastised us. We kept going. We kept offering alternatives to a healthcare system that was not working. Mr. Speaker, what happened is the American people soon saw, as we came close to another election, that we were going to have to ask the American people to be a part of the solution. We had tried in Washington, D.C. We had over 60 votes and we had made it a regular part of our discussion. Republicans, each time, had better ideas, better alternatives—ways to take 60 different pieces and trade them out so that we could better this terrible law that was not working. Then came the election. With the election, one of the most key and cleanest issues that was discussed was not only the repeal of ObamaCare, but the promise that Republicans would replace it also. For the past 4 or 5 years, Republicans have had a talking point that we want to repeal and to replace the healthcare system that was known as ObamaCare. Mr. Speaker, that is why I am here tonight—to talk about Republican ideas that we think are better for health care and ideas that we think will work not only in a marketplace, but that will be able to be used by a vast number of people here in America. It will not be something that is use it or lose it, as health care many times is. It will be sustainable. Perhaps, more importantly, there will be the ability for families to get what they want and to not have to pay for what they do not need. It passed on March 21 by a vote of 219–212. No Republican supported the Affordable Care Act, but every Republican understands that health care is important to families. It is important that a family takes the responsibility and tries to cover its family. Tonight, as I speak with you about where we are in health care, I want to include the words that come from Dallas, Texas—my home—of the families whom I have gotten to know and of the families who have communicated with me, because, as their Member of Congress, I am expected not only to listen, but to try and work for their betterment. I am probably no different than hundreds of other Members of Congress who come to Washington every week with a message. This is from Julie Ross of Dallas, Texas, with her two beautiful children. This is a very highlevel conversation in which she says: 
Now that my daughter is at home and thriving—who was in the hospital—we depend upon these protections to provide 
ObamaCare did not meet those needs; but as a Member of Congress, if I am going to talk about repealing, I need to also, forthrightly, talk about replacing what is a bad healthcare law with a better healthcare alternative. Republicans have better ideas to fix health care, and I am going to speak about these. The first thing I would like to speak about is the reality that about 150 million Americans have an opportunity to receive their health care on a pretax basis. That means that our employers and our employees who work for large companies have a chance to get their health care without paying for it on an aftertax basis. I pay about $13,000 myself out of pocket for my health care. My employer pays essentially what is a 70–30 split, but that entire amount is on a pretax basis. The 1943 employer sponsored insurance exemption and the 21st Century Cures, which we just passed this last December, allow businesses an opportunity to provide their employees with pretax health insurance. Pretax health insurance means that they are able to deduct the contributions that they make for their employees, and employees are allowed to receive this as a benefit. However, this, I believe, is part of what we have known for a long time as being an unfair, rigged system. It is a system that says, if you work for one of these larger companies, you will get that tax advantage; but if you do not— if you are selfemployed, if you are an entrepreneur, if you are a 941type employee, meaning perhaps you are a real estate agent who is selfemployed or perhaps you work for a small company—then you are not offered this pretax opportunity. It is probably true that you could deduct that amount next April. As you pay your taxes, you would file if you qualified based upon the amount of money that you spent. Mr. Speaker, this right here is the disadvantage for about 100 million Americans. They do not receive what 150 million other Americans do, and that is to get their health care on a pretax basis. I have worked now for some 2 years with some 500 physicians who are across the country. We have worked on a system that would allow every single American not only to have better health care, but to have an opportunity to participate on a fair basis. The gentleman from Lubbock, Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON ) will participate with me tonight and will speak about how important this is for him. Mr. ARRINGTON. I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. SESSIONS ) for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I want to talk about something that is near and dear to my heart and to the hearts of my constituents. It has been 44 years since Roe v. Wade. Since then, 58 million precious American lives have been aborted. The Supreme Court got it wrong when it violated its authority by creating a constitutional right to abortion. To make matters worse, the Federal Government is now using our taxpayer dollars to subsidize these abortions. Tomorrow we will have the opportunity to put a stop to this. This is an area in which the Constitution, my constituents, and my conviction will not allow me to budge. I believe that all life is ordained by God and begins at conception, as the psalmists so eloquently said: ‘‘for You created my inward parts. You knit me together in my mother’s womb.’’ Our Constitution clearly defines that all Americans—even those who cannot vote, who cannot speak or defend themselves—have the same right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to stand with me in support of H.R. 7; but, most importantly, I plead with them to stand up for generations of Americans yet unborn. I thank the gentleman again. b1945 Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON ), one of our brand new freshman from Lubbock, Texas. JODEY  not only comes from the high plains of Lubbock, a young man who has given great service to the State of Texas, but he also comes as our newest member from the Texas delegation who stands not only with the principles of that district, but with the principle of caring about other people. I thank the gentleman for letting his voice be heard about what will be a bill that will be before the House of Representatives tomorrow. Mr. Speaker, continuing our discussion about health care and Republican ideas. Back in 2013, some 4.7 million Americans that had their own health care were knocked off that health care because it didn’t qualify in the way that President Obama and Democrats wanted to have a comprehensive healthcare plan. So it knocked off 4.7 million Americans, and what it did is it placed America into a circumstance where we began looking for options and alternatives about how we would insure the uninsured. We were told: Just watch and wait. This Affordable Care Act is going to make sure that it takes every single American and gives them an affordable healthcare plan. Here is what happened, Mr. Speaker. We found out that we still have some 30 million people in this country—now in the sixth year of ObamaCare—that do not have coverage. We have learned that about 49 percent of those who are insured work for employers, about 20 percent of the marketplace is Medicaid, about 14 percent is Medicare, but we still have some 9 percent who were uninsured. We then find out that what happened is that the Federal Government decided that insurance was not working, so we had coops that were invented out of the Affordable Care Act. Seventeen out of the 23 coops have now gone into bankruptcy. They could not provide the services that the Affordable Care Act was just so sure, with government run programs, would work; and they wiped out almost unilaterally every single insurance plan where they came in. I don’t know if it was just because they undercut them, but what they did is provided a false indicator for people. Well, the Federal Government is here. Barack Obama and Democrats now have a healthcare plan for every single American. Only a few short years later, they are gone. They are gone from the marketplace after wiping out the insurance that was there. Perhaps worst of all, as they left, there was a requirement by the Obama administration that somebody had to come and renew insurance, even late in the year, or they would receive a $2,000 penalty because they did not have insurance at the end of the year. Mr. Speaker, this is what the insured and the uninsured look like. A gentleman from Dallas, Texas, Kennis Ketchum told us: I am being penalized for being an entrepreneur. I am in here, and I want to be in here. I want to be able to go and to allow myself to be in insurance, but I cannot afford it because I do not have the tax advantage. So Republicans finally have the chance for our ideas that we believe are bigger and better. We have a chance to do, I think, what we have wanted to do for a long time; and that is to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but with the promise that we need to make sure that we replace it with something better. What does this mean? Well, I will tell you what it means, Mr. Speaker. What it means is that Republicans are going to understand that a simple plan that can be paid for literally with the existing dollars that are in health care today and authorized by law—some $1.2 trillion that exists in law and authorized today—can be utilized for a healthcare system to take care of each and every American. I would like to describe that. First of all, it is important for us to understand that of the uninsured in this country, 74 percent work. That means that people that are no different than me and you, Mr. Speaker, get up and go to work to the best of their ability. It might be that they don’t have all the advantages of education that I have. It could be that they have something in their life that might be an impediment. It could be some sort of perhaps what might be a difference or a disability. I understand this. I have a son that has Down syndrome. Alex is not really capable of taking care of himself, so he is not necessarily one of these that would qualify for what we know as the alternative to ObamaCare. There are millions who do need the help, who do want and need insurance and not insurance that is like the Affordable Care Act because we know 
that reimburses at 50 percent less than insurance, some 25 percent less than Medicaid, a plan that limits the number of physicians and healthcare professionals that a person can see. No. The American people need something that they can count on. They need something that is better, that provides better reimbursement to where virtually every hospital would take their plan instead of a few, where four times as many doctors would take their plan, their insurance as opposed to them being on ObamaCare. These people who want and seek health care need a plan that is worthy of the representation that would be given to them, and that is the Republican idea. So Republicans have a chance, an opportunity. Just one of the ideas is to allow the healthcare tax benefits to be consistent with those of every American who works for a large company. You see, there are two ways to look at this. One might be a high standard deduction that an employee or a person would be able to take and buy health insurance and, next April, be able to write that off, so to speak, as a pretax deduction. You know the problem with that and so do I. Seventyfour percent of the people who are uninsured do not have the money to buy health care. Seventyfour percent of the people who are uninsured might not have enough money to be able to go buy insurance and wait all year long to get back their money next April when they file their taxes. So one of the ideas that I have—and I shared this plan with Senator BILL CASSIDY from Louisiana—is that what we would like to do is to provide a $2,500 tax credit for adults and a $1,500 tax credit for dependent children that would be advanceable, assignable, and refundable. What would this mean? This would mean that this year every single American that did not receive the tax advantage—the tax advantage like I receive and some 150 million Americans receive by getting their health care on a pretax basis—would have an opportunity to go online. They would be able to go online and look at the insurance in their area, and they would be able to receive this benefit, this tax advantage. It would not ever come to them. It would go directly to their insurance program. They would be able to take, for a family of four, some $8,000. They would be able to use this first $8,000—the exact same tax advantage that PETE SESSIONS and 150 million other Americans get—January 1st of next year and to assign this $8,000 to their healthcare plan. They could decide they wanted more, and they would be able to do that on a pretax basis also up to $5,000. They could decide that they would like perhaps to get a plan that would be at their local hospital. That is fine. They could decide that they would like to have what is called a health savings account, an HSA, which, more generally, is an opportunity for them to control their costs. This is very attractive for young people and advantageous for young people because they would be able to control their costs and roll these advantages or savings over year after year after year as opposed to losing what they had saved or, at the beginning of the year, starting back over. Republicans have an opportunity to make things fair. I think this is what President Trump talked about when he was candidate Trump. I think he talked about a rigged system. When you have a system where 150 million Americans get a tax advantage and you don’t, you would describe that as a rigged system. So Republicans, at least one of the proposals that is out there—because it is Senator CASSIDY ’s and mine, known as the World’s Greatest Healthcare Plan—employs an opportunity where up front we allow every single American to have health care January 1 that is superior in nature to whatever they had with ObamaCare. It allows the purchase of a nongovernment plan and it allows each individual, if they choose, to go to a health savings account. What is a health savings account? A health savings account is a well known product whereby a family would be able to get what is called major medical coverage. They actually, as part of their plan, would make sure that, if they were in the hospital or a member of their family was in the hospital, they would have to cover the first $5,000, but that the insurance plan then that they could find about affording out of this $8,000 for a family of four would give them a chance then to have either a 90/10, 80/20, or 70/30 contribution. Meaning they could decide what they wanted to afford based upon their age, based upon their risk, based upon their own circumstances. But they, as a consumer, would be able to make sure that they are taken care of if they go in the hospital. Then that contribution, to the level that they would choose—either they would pay 30 percent or 20 percent or 10 percent for expenses past $10,000—gave them the coverage that they need in the marketplace. Maybe it is a baby. Maybe it is major surgery. Maybe it is cancer. But they would receive hospital coverage. Then with the remaining amount of money, they could then put that into a health savings account and use cash for their doctor’s visits. Cash is king. Cash is also the most economical way to get your health care because you go and actually, instead of negotiating with a doctor or looking at what your insurance company negotiated, you negotiate paying that person today instead of the doctor having to file insurance and go through the necessary elements to receive their money back. You go to the doctor you choose. You pay for what you want. You pay for those things that you have made a decision, and you pay out of your cash account. It is the most leading edge, fastest way to get health care in America, and, generally speaking, it is 18 percent cheaper. Mr. Speaker, these are but one of the ideas that Republicans bring to the table. b2000 And it is why I can stand up, as chairman of the Rules Committee, when my colleagues say: oh, you are going to take away something that people had with the Affordable Care Act. And I say: you know, I think we have got a better way to look at it. Instead of only some 27 out of 100 doctors being available to you as a patient, I would like to double or quadruple that. I would like for you to be able to make your own decisions, and, in the long run, you will be better. But there is more to the story. And the more to the story is, what this will do is allow a robust marketplace where, instead of forcing people to go into a system and then penalizing them, we encourage people to go into a system and encourage them to be not only consumers, and not only to take care of themselves, but to help everybody out because it helps the curve. It helps people get in of all ages, of all needs, of all types back into the marketplace automatically January 1st. Didn’t have to guess at how much money they were going to make; didn’t have to worry about whether they got laid off; didn’t have to go check with the IRS; didn’t have to ask Uncle Sam. We are automatically giving the tax advantage by virtue of them being American and us doing the right thing off the existing money that exists in ObamaCare and health care today. Mr. Speaker, that is a better idea. That is a better opportunity for us, as Republicans, to go back home, and, no matter who we want to look at, we can say: we get it. We do get that you want and need health care, that we want and need America to have the greatest healthcare system in the world, but we need to make sure we can pay for it. And it should not restrict business. It should not come and tell a business or a group of people what they will—how they will tie themselves together with their health care and their job that makes absolutely no sense. I know we were told that is the way it would happen, but it did not. It became a concrete life preserver for employees, employers, and for the marketplace. So, Mr. Speaker, this health insurance tax advantage is but one of the ideas that is available to the American people and to the Republican Party as part of the world’s greatest healthcare system. I believe that we need a very disciplined approach. I believe that we need to be thoughtful. I believe that we need every single Member of Congress to understand what kind of healthcare system America deserves, not only for the physicians and the hospitals back 
home but for the real live people who are called constituents. And we as Members of Congress should know, the day we pass a bill, how we intend it to work. My colleagues, the Democrats, for 6 years have bumbled around and, even today, don’t even understand, nor will they admit, what a disaster ObamaCare is. So, the American people did it for them. The American people voted in Donald J. Trump. They voted in Republicans to the House in the majority. They voted in Republicans to the Senate. And now we are in Washington, and we are going to struggle. We are going to struggle mightily. We are going to throw ideas onto the wall. We are going to have committee hearings. We are going to have the best thought process. We are going to be able to go back home and to sell to the American people not only some of the ideas that I have but some of the ideas that my colleagues have. And we are going to come up with a better healthcare system. So what we are about is fix the system before we repeal it. I believe it is wise to say that Republicans owe it to the American people to say: before we go replacing something—before we repeal something, let’s replace it. And more and more and more and more of my colleagues are saying this openly. It only makes sense. We have nothing to fear with a Republican option and an alternative that will be superior for the American people, and every single person will be able to see that. We believe establishing a Republican alternative that can be implemented this year is the best answer. Now, this is my idea. My idea is, let’s go get it on. We know what we are doing. Let’s go hold our hearings. Let’s go to the American people. Let’s sell the ideas that we have got. Let’s go move forward and get this process on. Secondly, we believe that what we have got to do is use reconciliation to repeal the most onerous mandates. What might those be? Well, the individual and the business mandate, the Cadillac tax. We believe that we have got to go and use the processes, the leverage that we have got. And then we have got to count on what I hope will be the gentleman from Georgia, TOMPRICE, who is today the chairman of the Budget Committee, but tomorrow has been nominated to be the Secretary of Health and Human Services. We will count on Dr. TOMPRICE actually sitting in the seat, looking at the exact same law that was overwhelmingly voted by Democrats and no Republicans, and using those levers that he has that were expressly given to the head of HHS to make wise decisions on how to implement the law as we move forward. I will tell you, Chairman PRICE, as a physician with a long history of understanding health care, as a provider of health care for years, as an awesome physician, TOMPRICE knows the problems, and he will use those same opportunities that exist in the law today. Instead of it being something that would be more difficult for a consumer, more difficult for a person on ObamaCare, more difficult for what might be an employer, more difficult and time consuming for a consumer, more costly to the consumers of this country, but, perhaps worst of all, making it harder to provide better health care for a patient, TOMPRICE will have that opportunity. So this is a threetier process for Republicans, for us to also bring the best ideas. The American people should be checking with their Member of Congress who will be able to understand the Republican alternative. This is great for the American people to know. We are going to use the levers of laws to change them, to repeal and take back the most onerous parts of ObamaCare, and we are going to work within the law that Mr. PRICE, as head of HHS, would be able to use exactly the same levers that someone sat there, if they really wanted to fix health care instead of making it harder for someone. We know that Republicans have better ideas, and that what we want to do is to establish a tax benefit system while allowing the employersponsored insurance tax system to remain. That means that every single American will have parity on the opportunity to buy health care on January 1 of every year; that no longer will we find that people lag behind because they can’t afford, or it is a rigged system, or they have a disadvantage. Republicans have an opportunity to level the playing field. This is why Republicans openly in any crowd can say: we have better ideas. We don’t have to force anybody. We will invite them to come be a part of what we do. And I guarantee you, more people will flock to our system than fled and ran from ObamaCare, because it has to work for everybody, not just some of us. The healthcare system that we have today, ObamaCare, literally, young people ran from the system. They could not afford it. But worst of all, they could not pay the high deductible. And if you have such a high deductible, it means, by and large, insurance is useless to you. So, Mr. Speaker, what Republicans are doing is going to allow a tax benefit system. Republicans are going to make HSAs available as an option, an alternative, so that people have a choice and a chance to buy what they need but not pay for what they don’t want. We want an opportunity for them to become consumers. We want them to be a part of a system where it is not use it or lose it, rather, they can only, through their own means and their hard work, roll over perhaps $1,000 a year, $1,000 at 21, $1,000 at 22, $1,000 at 23, and to allow private physicians to make sure they are in the system. Lastly, as my time is moving forward, I want to say something to each and every American because it seemingly has been a part of the lexicon in my Democrat friends’ viewpoint, and it is this: The Republican plan has available to it and, I believe, will accept the rights that were known as under ObamaCare, which were very bipartisan, dependent coverage through age 26—Republican plan, you bet. No lifetime annual limits—Republican plan, absolutely. Modified guarantee availability renewability, just like what was in ObamaCare—you bet we will have that too. Prohibition on preexisting conditions exclusions—literally, just the same. You have to buy in. And if you don’t, then you have a problem. But if you buy in the first time you get a chance, it is an opportunity just like ObamaCare. Prohibition on discrimination based on health status—absolutely. That is a Republican idea, too. It is not owned by just one party. It is a generally accepted idea and would be a part, should be a part, of a Republican plan, and nondiscrimination and healthcare coverage. Mr. Speaker, what I have tried to do in this hour is to give the American people and my colleagues the confidence that what lies ahead will be an awesome debate, but it will be done in public. It will be done above board. It will be done where Members of Congress can go back home and explain to people not only what we want to do but be willing to take their own feedback also. It will be a system that will fix the inequities, the things that were unfair about tax benefits. And it should be, and I hope will be, a system that will be available this next year so that, on January 1 of this next year, as we find the American people wanting eagerly to look at the health care that their families would want and need, that they will find a tax benefit that is consistent with what any other American gets. Now, the last point I would like to say is a thank you. I would like to say a thank you to some 500 physicians of the National Physicians’ Policy Council who have worked through, for 2 years, 9 very large meetings across this country, the last one, the first week of December here in Washington. Dr. John T. Gill, national cochairman, and Dr. Marcy Zwelling—Dr. Gill is from Dallas. Dr. Zwelling is from Los Angeles—and our 16 vice chairmen, who have devoted not only hard work but a belief that a healthcare change should be done with physicians, with the people who care about not only patients but care about the system that they would be engaged in, the system of health care in America, that is the greatest system that we know of. b2015 They have sent me hundreds of ideas and hundreds of things which we have openly discussed where we rubbed elbows trying to decide how do we hone 
this idea. It has come down to every single American should end up with a better healthcare system than one that was designed that they could not explain and still leaves some 30 million people uninsured in America, and that is called ObamaCare. We should not have a system that demands that a person be on that system or have to pay a huge fine. No. We would want a system where people gleefully came to it, liked their healthcare system, became a consumer, were proud of what they got, and perhaps more importantly, could go to the doctor of their choice instead of calling a number and being assigned or take the person that they were given. Mr. Speaker, there are lots of ways to get things done in this country, but Republicans have, for years, had better ideas. The idea on health care is one that Republicans are eager—eager—not only to accept this challenge, but eager to say that we are going to work together. Speaker RYANhas pledged himself to our Conference. We have Members of the United States Senate, MITCH MCCONNELL —the other body— and there are a number of Members, including Dr. BILLCASSIDY and Dr. R AND PAUL who have come out with their own healthcare bills, ways to attract not just other cosponsors, but their colleagues who are Democrats also. So I would say tonight to my colleagues: I would like for you to take just a minute to look at the world’s greatest healthcare plan. I would like for you to be concerned, instead of the some 12 to 20 million people across the country—everybody has their own congressional district, and there might be a large number in some of their districts. But by and large, the vast number would not be on ObamaCare, and each of our Members owe them a better healthcare system also. But if we all get together, every single person can have the opportunity to have a nondiscriminatory system where virtually every hospital would take your coverage instead of only a few. ObamaCare is only a few, only a few doctors. And if we work together and form larger team sizes, we can make health care even better for all Americans. So, Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the opportunity tonight to talk about not only better ideas to fix health care, but it would be done through a deliberate, disciplined approach, one in which every single Member of this body should be able to describe what they want. If they want to be for ObamaCare and say that only 24 percent of physicians and only a few hospitals will take their plan, then let them stand on that. But I want to be for a system where virtually every hospital and virtually every doctor would take the healthcare plan that I would like my family to be on and them, also. That is why I stand up tonight and speak favorably about the Republican advantages of where we will head, specifically about the world’s greatest healthcare plan that Senator BILLCASSIDY and I have cosponsored and, more specifically, that the American people can be sold by every single one of us to make health care work and be better for each and every American. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
A RESPONSE TO PRESIDENT TRUMP’S INAUGURAL ADDRESS AND NEW DEAL FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. KUSTOFF of Tennessee). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Ms. PLASKETT ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. 
Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks on the subject of my Special Order hour. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands? There was no objection. Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the great State of Louisiana (Mr. RICHMOND ), who is the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus. Mr. RICHMOND. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman PLASKETT . Mr. Speaker, the CBC has led the charge in proposing solutions for the underserved and disadvantaged communities throughout this country. In his first remarks as President, Donald Trump claimed to champion this cause in his remarks, which proved to be petty and beneath the Office of President of the United States. On day one, in his first official acts in the office, one of his first official acts was to remove from the whitehouse.gov Web site a page detailing a broad set of civil rights commitments and accomplishments under President Obama. It is fitting that President Trump, as one of his very first actions in office, would take down the public pledge to defend the civil rights of all Americans. This is a continuation of the divisiveness that defined his campaign where he proposed a Muslim ban, mass deportation, and a nationwide stop andfrisk program. This is consistent with a President who would nominate JEFFSESSIONS , a man unanimously opposed by the civil rights community, as Attorney General. President Trump didn’t stop with changing the Web site. It has been reported that the Department of Justice is seeking to delay a hearing meant to focus on the relief required for Texas’ discriminatory voter identification law. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled last year that the law had a discriminatory effect and that provisions must be made to allow those who lack the specific ID that the law requires be able to cast a vote. Every judge who has considered the Texas law found it discriminatory, but it still has been used in elections there. Unfortunately, President Trump has given no indication that he is willing to stand up to protect the voting rights of all Americans. Since being elected, he has ignored proven instances of intentional voter suppression and chosen instead to spread alternative facts about voter fraud. As one of its first substantive acts, the Trump administration suspended a mortgage insurance rate cut put in place by the Obama administration to give relief to homeowners. According to the Federal Housing Administration, the cut would have saved the average homeowner $500 this year. This reversal will make it more difficult for middle class Americans trying to purchase a home and eliminate relief for homeowners struggling to make their mortgage payments. According to the National Association of Realtors, this will prevent 30,000 to 40,000 new home buyers from purchasing homes in 2017. This move will disproportionately affect African American homeowners who are more likely than White homeowners to rely on FHA mortgage insurance. Mr. Speaker, we know exactly who Donald Trump is and have an inkling about what he intends to do, but what we plan on doing is educating the President about the needs of underserved communities. So I will just take a moment to address a few of his points in his new deal for the African American community, which is truly a bad deal in terms of economic equality. It is a raw deal in terms of public education, and it is a hollow deal in terms of voting and civil rights. On behalf of the caucus, the CBC, the Congressional Black Caucus, I would like to inform him that 39 percent of African Americans actually live in suburbs compared to 36 percent who live in inner cities. The remaining 25 percent live in small metropolitan areas or rural communities. For more than 45 years, the Congressional Black Caucus has worked to improve conditions for African Americans from all walks of life. Collectively, our members represent 78 million Americans, 17 million of whom are African American. Our districts are rural as well as urban. Some of our members represent majority minority districts, while others do not. Mr. Speaker, tonight you will hear from several members of the Congressional Black Caucus who will point to specific pieces of legislation that we have championed and that we have authored that would address many of the issues facing innercity communities, facing poor communities, and facing communities all across this country no matter the race or makeup of those communities. What I would like to reiterate and stress is the fact that we don’t just talk about a problem, but we offer solutions. We have sent to you, Mr. 
President, a letter outlining all of the 10 points in your new deal with concrete solutions and legislation that we have authored that we think will go further and is a more comprehensive way of approaching the problems in those communities. We also sent you another document that details more than your 10 issues, but highlights issues that are faced by American families all across this country and our policy proposals that will solve them. We would just encourage you to step out of the White House and to listen to people who have done this for a long time and who live in those communities and who have offered viable solutions. So I would just say that we don’t need more talk or more rhetoric. What we need is action, and we need action from 1600 Pennsylvania. We need action from the White House, and we would urge you to look at the proposals that we have that offer a better solution. Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, my friend and colleague, the Honorable CEDRIC RICHMOND , for his leadership in our caucus as well as his continued fight on the issues impacting Black Americans and other minority communities in underserved American communities in this great Nation. I would also like to thank my colleague, the Honorable MARCVEASEY of Texas, for joining me and sharing this evening’s Special Order hour and my many colleagues of the Congressional Black Caucus who are here to speak on this most important issue. Mr. Speaker, we are here tonight as Representatives of America’s minority communities to respond directly to President Trump’s inaugural address, and specifically to his new deal for African Americans. During President Trump’s campaign, he promised to address issues confronting African Americans, and he gave a 10point plan outlining that. We have studiously reviewed the issues outlined in the plan and have concrete suggestions for him in accomplishing those goals. While I acknowledge President Trump’s willingness to confront these issues, I find the points in his new deal do not go far enough in substance to adequately address the needs of African American communities and rely heavily on assumptions that African American communities are primarily in the inner cities. Just as the chairman spoke of earlier this evening, let’s not continue with this fallacy and stereotyping of the dynamic diversity of African Americans in this country. African Americans live in the Rust Belt. They live in rural areas across this country, in suburbs, and they live in territories. My home district of the U.S. Virgin Islands has a population of 100,000 American citizens and permanent residents. It is a majority minority, and it, too, has experienced the same slow recovery as many of the economically dispossessed communities across America. The issues of African Americans cannot be solved in just 10 bullet points directed to a small portion of the African American community. Mr. Speaker, we are here this evening, in large part, to send a message, suggestions, thoughts, ideas, and support to President Trump that, if he is serious about addressing the issues in disadvantaged communities, it would be wise to tap into the decades of experience held by the members of this caucus. The answers to those 10 points are very nuanced, and we have been working on them for decades, and we are happy to support positive improvements in our underserved communities. For almost a half century, this caucus has advocated to improve the lives of millions of Americans in both rural and urban communities—African Americans and all Americans. The 49 members of this caucus who sit in both Houses of Congress and the members before us tonight have offered policy solutions for decades that would help not only those African American communities, but underserved areas nationwide. b2030 We will continue to lead by offering solutions to improve the lives of all Americans in search of a better opportunity. We are hopeful to give you an idea of some of those this evening. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. VEASEY ), my able colleague, for his remarks on this matter. Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands who is helping to lead tonight’s Special Order hour. I, again, want to highlight how President Trump’s inaugural address served as a preview of what the African American community can expect over the next 4 years. This past Friday, thousands of Americans from all over the country traveled to Washington, D.C., to witness the new President and what type of message he was going to deliver. Unfortunately, instead of starting his Presidency with a bold, new agenda that would benefit all Americans, what we heard was an inaugural address that reminded us that the America he wants to build will leave many of the constituents of those of us who serve as members of the Congressional Black Caucus behind. In his speech, President Trump said that a nation exists to serve its citizens. But for far too many, a different reality exists. He also painted another grim picture of mothers and children trapped in poverty in inner cities and rusted out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our Nation; an education system flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of knowledge; and crimes and gangs and drugs that have stolen the lives of too many and robbed the country of so much of its unrealized potential. Those are problems that need to be addressed. I don’t think that anybody will disagree with that. We need to make sure that our children have access to good public schools and good, quality education. We need to make sure that, as the nature of work changes in this country, people are ready to get those new jobs. We must make sure that we invest in our communities so that they prosper. But yet, very little of what President Trump proposed would actually address the root cause of any of those problems. Not even his new deal for Black Americans provides real solutions for the problems that he outlined in his inaugural address. Instead, we see the same recycled, broken promises. Since the creation of the Congressional Black Caucus, we have been fighting to uplift our communities. We have bold ideas to help transform the lives of those individuals that were mentioned and real ideas that can get going. I thank the gentlewoman as we prepare to have other speakers from the Congressional Black Caucus share their remarks. Ms. PLASKETT. I appreciate the remarks that the gentleman has given, particularly about the grim view that was given of African Americans during the inauguration that didn’t really expound on the great diversity that is here. We have someone from another part of our country who is now going to speak. I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. LEE), one of our senior great leaders of the Congressional Black Caucus, former chairwoman of the Caucus from California, who is going to give us her remarks and her thoughts on this topic this evening. Ms. LEE. Let me first thank Congresswoman PLASKETT for her tireless leadership to protect our progress, but also for her vigilance and hard work on behalf of her district and the territories. I thank her and Congressman MARC VEASEY for cosponsoring our Special Order, making sure that the drum is being beat very loudly throughout the country with regard to what is taking place here in Washington, D.C. For more than 45 years, the Congressional Black Caucus has been the conscience of the Congress. Since its founding, we have fought for robust legislative action to lift our constituents and the African American community, I guess, in a way, to ensure equal justice under the law so that everyone, including African Americans, will be able to live the American Dream. Now, make no mistake about it: we will continue to fight for justice and equality under President Donald Trump. The President’s inaugural address, quite frankly, was appalling. In my nearly 20 years in the House, I cannot recall a darker, more pessimistic view of our Nation from an incoming President. 
The President’s inaugural address distorted the truth about our communities. He used dog whistles to paint a frightening picture of our neighborhoods and stoke fear. Let me be clear: America is not the downtrodden, helpless Nation President Trump described. Yes, we have much more work to do to ensure equal justice under the law and to address the legacy of slavery, Jim Crow, and segregation. But this means public investments in housing, education, jobs, not budget cuts and corporate tax breaks that just do the opposite and also dismantle the safety net. Within hours of taking office, the President already began to unravel the progress of the last 8 years. With the stroke of a pen, the President stuck a dagger in the heart of the Affordable Care Act that will take away health care for millions and pull the rug out from under lowincome families seeking to buy homes. These destructive policies are an attack on the most vulnerable in our society. It is clear that these executive orders will disproportionately harm communities of color, the African American community, and the poor. Repealing the Affordable Care Act is just the tip of the iceberg. We have seen the Trump administration planning a full scale attack on the most marginalized community in our society. Last year, after continually insulting the African American community, Trump’s socalled new deal for Black America really did just add insult to injury. Rather than helping struggling families, this agenda would gut Social Security, repeal the Affordable Care Act, and abolish the safety net. We know that these cuts now will just lead to more poverty. This approach is dead wrong. Instead of stepping on the most vulnerable to benefit special interests, President Trump should follow the CBC’s lead by supporting a national strategy to eliminate poverty and extend economic opportunity to all Americans. He can start by supporting our Half in Ten Act, which would reduce poverty in half over 10 years. And if the Trump administration really wants a new deal to benefit African Americans, they should look to our assistant leader JIMCLYBURN ’s 10–20–30 antipoverty plan, which would direct at least 10 percent of funds in designated accounts to spent in communities experiencing persistent poverty—those with a poverty rate of at least 20 percent over the last 30 years. These are just a few of the proposals that we have to address poverty and lift up our communities. What we won’t do is allow President Trump to roll back progress or push more families over the edge into poverty. We should be identifying the root causes of poverty and developing policies to lift Americans up. Instead, President Trump has shown he would rather line the pockets of billionaires and advance those failed trickledown economics. In President Trump’s new deal for African Americans let me just read you very quickly what he said with regard to illegal immigration. He said: ‘‘We will restore the civil rights of African Americans, HispanicAmericans, and all Americans, by ending illegal immigration.’’ Our response is that the CBC will not buy into the divisive rhetoric that blames immigration for the social and economic problems in African American communities. Our members support comprehensive immigration reform. President Trump will not roll back the clock on our progress or doom another generation to the crippling effects of poverty. Let me be clear: this 10point plan really is a slap in the face to African Americans everywhere. As cochair of the CBC’s Working Group on Poverty and the Economy, along with Congressman CLEAVER and chair of the Democratic Whip Task Force on Poverty, Income Inequality and Opportunity, we will continue to work to make sure that the vital resources for lowincome Americans, African Americans, and those struggling to make ends meet are there. We will make sure that the country understands that the Congressional Black Caucus continues to fight for a real deal for the African American community, for our entire Nation, and that means lifting people out of poverty, creating goodpaying jobs, and moving forward on the progress that has been made. I thank the gentlewoman for her leadership. Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I was really very interested in the discussion the gentlewoman had and about the work that you have done to alleviate poverty both in the Democratic Caucus as well as the Congressional Black Caucus, particularly her words about not allowing immigration to be divisive and used as a means to separate Americans and not being able to realize the American Dream. America is big enough to have immigrants under a comprehensive immigration plan that will allow all of us to be able to lift it up. I want to thank the gentlewoman for her leadership on that and particularly the fight that she has been fighting for so many years when it comes to alleviating poverty in the United States. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. LAWRENCE ), but more specifically from the great city of Detroit, where she has been a strong voice for the people of Detroit, a strong voice for surrounding areas, and her work on Flint, Michigan, and its water crisis, and other areas of people who are in the inner city that need support in so many areas, to speak on the issues that are the topic for today. Mrs. LAWRENCE. I thank the Congresswoman, my colleague, for her leadership. Mr. Speaker, the Congressional Black Caucus, the conscience of the Congress, stands strong to promote unity and fight against divisive rhetoric. Trump’s inaugural speech included a lot of pledges and promises: pledges of ‘‘allegiance to all Americans,’’ promises to the American people, saying, ‘‘I will never let you down.’’ He even quoted the Bible, saying: ‘‘. . . how good and pleasant it is when God’s people live together in unity.’’ But pledges and promises fall flat when tweets, speeches, and now actions are followed by reckless executive orders, thoughtless nominations for our Nation’s leaders, and attacks on the American healthcare system. The American people were let down when President Trump nominated unqualified and outoftouch candidates such as Senator JEFFSESSIONS , Betsy DeVos, and TOMPRICE. How can you pledge allegiance to all Americans while threatening to leave so many without options and access to healthcare coverage? This is not unity. It is hypocrisy. We need to focus on facts and not ‘‘alternative facts.’’ I have a question: Do we have a replacement for the Affordable Care Act? Is it a fact that a repeal without a replacement will leave over 30 million people uninsured? Yes, that is a fact. Is it a fact that Betsy DeVos, if confirmed, will be the first Secretary of Education without any prior experience in public schools, including early childhood education and higher education? Is it a fact that JEFFSESSIONS has been nominated as the Attorney General but was denied Federal judgeship over accusations of racism? I support efforts that will bring more jobs to the American people. I fully support efforts to improve our country’s transportation and infrastructure. But only time will tell if President Trump will follow through with the promises he has made to the American people on inauguration day. Only time will tell if he will continue to act, speak, and tweet in a manner that builds walls and not bridges. Mr. Speaker, the Congressional Black Caucus intends to be a voice to create bridges and work toward real solutions to the real challenges that face African Americans, minorities, and the unheard and disenfranchised. We will be watching, and we will be listening. We will continue to fight for equality, liberty, and justice for all. Ms. PLASKETT. I thank the gentlewoman for those words and thoughts on these issues. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE), who has been a stalwart for social justice, a stalwart on the Judiciary Committee, and is going to speak on the issue that is here before us this evening, the CBC Special Order hour, ‘‘A Response to President Trump’s Inaugural Address and New Deal for African Americans.’’ 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands and the gentleman from Texas for their service to the Nation and for leading the Congressional Black Caucus Special Order. It is always important for the voices of the Congressional Black Caucus and the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, Mr. RICHMOND  of Louisiana, to be heard. Both Ms. PLASKETT and Mr. V EASEY have accepted the challenge and the call. I want to express to them my greatest appreciation for the leadership that they are showing. b2045 I want to start my remarks again by saying that it may be hometown pride, but I like the headline of the Houston Chronicle that says ‘‘Powerful Together.’’ The numbers have not yet been fully calculated, but we know upwards of a million and maybe over a million persons around the Nation, and then they added individuals from foreign countries far and wide. I would take by this title that represents, Mr. Speaker, the peaceful protests—I want to say that again; in fact, I might want to say it two times: peaceful, peaceful protests, nonviolent protests—that occurred on Saturday, expressing the view of what America is really about. I say that to my colleagues, they are about what the Congressional Black Caucus is about, and I believe our chairman made the point that we come from very diverse districts, representing people of many racial backgrounds, religious backgrounds, as well as economic backgrounds, that we are the voice of reason and the conscience of this Congress. We fight against poverty, but we have Ph.D.’s, lawyers, judges, and we have businesspersons. They, by and large, Mr. Speaker, are charitable individuals who believe in social justice. That is why we come with a sense of privilege, if you will, to be able to speak about what America truly is. Yesterday at the Community of Faith, under the leadership of Bishop James Dixon, I gathered for a prayer for the Nation. Mr. Speaker, I did not dissect it. I did not eliminate the White House. I did not point out Members of Congress, call them by name. I said a prayer for the Nation, and that included the White House and individuals in the Congress and the Senate. We had international representation. We had the Consulate General of Pakistan. We had imams. We had individuals who worship on Saturday Sabbath. We had people who spoke Spanish, people who spoke, obviously, English. And we gathered to pray for the nation. That is what I think is represented in the message or the title of the ‘‘New Deal for Black America,’’ it needs prayer because it is not reflective. Although wellintentioned, I am not sure who may have advised the administration, but it does not speak to the wideness of diversity of the African American population, African American communities in this Nation. So I want to speak very briefly on questions of health care and justice. I would like to say that in the safe communities of which the administration or the President has offered his new deal, he says: ‘‘We will make our communities safe again. Every poor AfricanAmerican child must be able to walk down the street in peace. Safety is a civil right. We will invest in training and funding both local and federal law enforcement operations to remove the gang members, drug dealers, and criminal cartels from our neighborhoods. The reduction of crime is not merely a goal—but a necessity.’’ In that there is no mention of ending gun violence or looking at sensible gun safety regulations or laws, of which we have asked. I introduced Gun Violence Reduction Resources Act, which really answered Republicans’ cry for enforcing the law, to add to the ATF, to enforce the penalties against those who use guns wrong. In particular, the perpetrator in Mother Emanuel should not have been able to get the gun, but he was because the gun dealer was so easy and quick to sell it, even though he had not gotten an affirmation by ATF, that is the one. I would argue it was because they did not have enough personnel. He also seems to categorize that every poor child has to walk down the streets. We want every child to walk down—as I said, our community is very diverse. He then says: ‘‘Equal Justice Under the Law. We will apply the law fairly, equally and without prejudice. There will be only one set of rules—not a twotiered system of justice. Equal justice also means the same rules for Wall Street.’’ So I quickly want to offer these points before I yield the floor. Number one, we are not all impoverished, but I join my colleagues in ending poverty. African Americans want the same thing as Barbara Jordan said when asked, ‘‘What do your people want?’’ ‘‘It is the same thing that all America wants.’’ Yes, we do want opportunities, but we do have to be more forceful for issues that are relevant. We have seen nothing in Mr. Trump’s statement of a new deal for Black America to deal with sentencing reduction and ending mandatory minimums. We see nothing about working with police departments that have found themselves falling upon bad times and having a plague of bad actors, even though we respect and honor police. And so the Law Enforcement Trust and Integrity Act that JOHN CONYERS and myself introduced has to do with correcting the issue of training and the improper inaction of police and community. I would offer to say that the nominee for the Attorney General is completely opposed to addressing any questions of bad behavior on behalf of bad actors and bad officers. In fact, he opposed consent decrees like the one in Ferguson and Baltimore that were only positive, welcomed by the police departments to help them do a better job at policing the community. Prison reform to change the matrix of prison, gun violence prevention that I have already mentioned, and healthcare access that are truly crucial to all of us. Let me also indicate a changing of the matrix of juvenile justice. We want to reauthorize the Juvenile Accountability Block Grant Program Reauthorization Act, but, more importantly, we want to change how we are dealing with juveniles. We want to change from the idea of them being, if you will, punished versus incentivized. Finally, let me offer to say that two Senators in the other body have offered a new matrix on health care. I understand there are some proposals here. I would say that we see that we can’t have unity. We don’t have any replacement. What is being offered by the Senators is health savings accounts, which we know are not realistic. So I would offer to the President that there are many ways of looking at serving all of America, including African Americans. It is not listening to your own voice. It is helping us change the matrix for juveniles, changing the matrix for those who are incarcerated, mandatory minimums, the way police and community work, at the same time respecting them, but, more importantly, it is listening and working with Members who have real life experiences in some of the issues that will make this country continue to be the greatest country in the world. I thank the gentlewoman for her courtesies. Ms. PLASKETT. I thank the Congresswoman from Texas. I want to thank her for all the work she has been doing not just in terms of incarceration reform, but pointing out to us that the safety of children also includes gun violence in their communities. That is so very important. And, of course, the real tireless work that she has done in terms of juvenile justice. Mr. Speaker, Congresswoman SHEILA  JACKSON LEEhas been at the forefront of changing the dynamic in how we see juveniles and the things that lead them into incarceration or lead them into problems with the law, and the solutions that are on the table. This is what we are speaking about this evening, giving real solutions and concrete legislation that has already been drafted and worked on by members of the Congressional Black Caucus that President Trump can use in carrying out the 10point plan that he has. I yield to the Congresswoman from Wisconsin (Ms. MOORE ), who also would like to speak on this topic and who has been doing tireless work in her district of Wisconsin and throughout the United States for communities, for children, for working mothers, for women who are attempting to move ahead, to receive a part of the economic justice, who has really been concerned about so many of the things that we are talking about this evening. 
I yield to her to speak to us this evening. Ms. MOORE. I thank the Delegate and the Congresswoman from the Virgin Islands and her counterpart, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. VEASEY ), for really supporting this Congressional Black Caucus hour so that we can discuss the pledges and proposals that President Trump has made as the new deal within the Black community. Mr. Speaker and Madam Chairwoman of this Special Order, I would like to engage in a kind of colloquy with the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. EVANS ), who has been a State appropriator before he joined this body for some 25 years. I hate to date him. He has been a member of the prestigious appropriations committee. So, therefore, he was tasked with taking Federal funds and making those appropriations and those decisions at the State level. I wanted him to help evaluate some of the proposals that now President Trump has made regarding his new deal for Black America. One of the proposals that President Trump has made is to allow the conversion of funds for poverty programs to be converted from those programs into microloans that he would then provide to the poor. I am feeling a little confused and perplexed as to how this would work. I fear that this is part of kind of the double speak or alternative facts about the roots of and the solutions to poverty. As the gentleman now serves on the Committee on Small Business here in the House, and he has been an appropriator, I am wondering, number one, if converting funds from, say, the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families Act, which is comprised of mostly poor women and children or Social Security disability insurance, which is set aside for those folks with significant disabilities, or perhaps SNAP and food stamps, those people who are temporarily out of the workforce waiting to go back, find another job, but need to sort of eat that month—I am wondering how, in his experience, converting programs set aside for poor people would a poor person use a microloan. I have two questions. I want the gentleman to sort of respond to what poor people would do. Presumably they would create their own jobs with these microloans. How big, perhaps, would these microloans have to be in order for them to establish their own businesses so that they would be off welfare? In fact, on any given day, there are 3 million children who live in extreme poverty, off of less than $3 a day. So I guess I would wonder how converting those funds—what those children who are not capable and eligible to work would do with such a proposal. I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania. Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, I think that the points that the gentlewoman is raising are very legitimate in terms of the experience that I have had. And the experience that I have had, always the question is: Is there enough availability of capital in any startup of any particular business? The experience has shown that this idea of microloans hasn’t been sustainable or sufficient in terms of what it would mean. And as a result, Mr. Speaker, I think that this is like kind of a pig in a poke, giving people some sense, but really it doesn’t give them a sustainable sense of whether you have the necessary longterm investment that is necessary. So I think that this is like smoke and mirrors. And the gentlewoman is correct in what she is saying in terms of this is not something that will give them a sustainable effort. Ms. MOORE. I thank the gentleman for that because I thought maybe it was just me who thought that. Here we are, we live in a country with the largest economy, with arguably the strongest, greatest technological economy, and I wonder what these poor women who are on welfare would do? He says he wants to get them off of welfare. Would they sell fruit on the street? How would that work in Detroit or Milwaukee? We are not talking about women who live in countries where microloans may work very well in those limited economies. b2100 I am also wondering how those people who are structurally unemployed would benefit from these microloans. What this does, Madam Chairperson of this initiative, is that what this really is saying is that this is really perpetuating the persistent myth of people who are poor as the shiftless, lazy welfare queens of poverty pimps, and that the solution is to take away the safety net and force them to do some kind of work, whether that work is sustainable enough for them. And so I would say, as a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, that we ought to have welfare reform that really honors our commitment as Americans to make sure that we provide some kind of safety net for the majority of the poor who are, in fact, children. There are, in fact, people who are not capable, or should not be responsible, for providing for themselves through our very sophisticated economy. I would say, Mr. Speaker, that if we really want to help get people off welfare, we should not start the debate by taking away reproductive freedom from women. One of the major reasons that women fall into poverty is the lack of access to birth control, health care, that would enable them to plan their families, plan their pregnancies. And to say that you are going to help people get off welfare and to snatch away funds from Planned Parenthood or their ability to control their reproduction is a nonstarter in truly helping the truly poor. I think that President Trump’s quest to help those who are truly poor will only come if the President and his team will actually listen to the voices of the poor, actually listen to solutions that have been tried and tested, like providing educational opportunity and upward mobility to poor people; by respecting women’s reproductive rights to choose; by really creating a sense of Congress that any goal of welfare reform ought to be to protect children; that any welfare reform ought to make sure that women are free from domestic violence, sex trafficking, and human trafficking, and that they be protected; and that during these periods they not be cut off from public support. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. PLASKETT  for this opportunity to speak to the American people. Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. EVANS ) and ask if he has additional thoughts on this after having that colloquy with Ms. MOORE . Mr. EVANS. Yes. And, Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. PLASKETT for the opportunity to offer some comments. The fact that the Congressional Black Caucus has taken this lead, I applaud our leadership, Chairman RICHMOND . I join with my colleagues this evening to speak to the plan our new President has penned as the ‘‘new deal for African Americans.’’ This plan, unfortunately, does not meet the needs of our communities and focuses on the same assumptions that have not worked for our communities over the years. In his inaugural address, President Trump stated: ‘‘The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country. Their victories have not been your victories; their triumphs have not been your triumphs; and while they celebrated in our Nation’s Capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.’’ That was stated by President Trump. Well, while individuals were celebrating last week, actions were taken for people all over our Nation to lose their healthcare coverage, and the Federal Housing Administration mortgage insurance rate was cut an hour after President Trump took office, which would have reduced insurance premiums for borrowers each year. This does not help the men, women, and children of our great Nation. In the new deal for Black America, President Trump asserts that there will be tax reform to create jobs and lift up people and communities. Just in my community alone, Mr. Speaker, at Temple University Hospital, which has 8,000 jobs, there are jobs that will be lost due to the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, which President Trump signed an executive order to dismantle the day he was sworn in as our President. This is counter to any notion of job creation. As our chairman so eloquently stated in the letter expressing the views of 
the caucus on January 19, the new administration should target investment to those communities that need it the most and support programs that support small and mediumsized businesses and address the access to capital crisis in the African American entrepreneur community. In President Trump’s inaugural address, he stated ‘‘a new national pride will stir our souls, lift our sights, and heal our divisions.’’ I assert that we already have a national pride. It is the pride that those in our communities feel when there is unity when they understand that individuals here in Congress are fighting for them. It is the pride that communities feel when they understand that groups such as the Congressional Black Caucus zealously represented and advocated to improve their lives over the course of the existence of the caucus, those in rural and urban communities. An additional point in the new deal for Black America asserts financial reform to expand credit to support new job creation and specifically calls out the DoddFrank reforms set forth and protected through the leadership of Ranking Member WATERS . These financial reforms and protections are absolutely essential to protect our communities. With the racial wealth gap reaching an unfortunate and historical level, with White households maintaining 13 times the wealth of African American households, we must work to ensure the protections of DoddFrank remain in place. Additionally, as Representative RICHMOND shared, programs such as the Small Business Administration’s Microloan Program, which provides capital and assistance to minority owned business, must be bolstered. I have spoken directly with my constituents about the need for access to capital; thus, my statement is not hypocritical or speculative in nature. There is an actual need in our communities so that our small businesses can grow and flourish. Our new President asserts: 
We are transferring power from Washington, D.C., and giving it back to you, the American people. 
I assert that the American people have always had the power. I see this power as I walk through my district as through my community, as I walk through Ogontz Avenue in West Oak Lane, part of my district, down Girard Avenue in North Philadelphia, Lancaster Avenue on the Main Line, and Baltimore Avenue in West Philadelphia. The faces in my community let me know that the power has always belonged to the people. It is now up to all of us to do what is in the best interest of our communities, to work collectively and address the issues that plague our communities. Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania, DWIGHT EVANS . I know that he is new to this Congress, but he has worked for so many years on the issues that we are talking about today. I look forward to our continued collaboration in supporting so many communities throughout our country. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. BEATTY ), who has been a stalwart voice on so many of the issues that the Congressional Black Caucus has brought here this evening and is here, Mr. Speaker, to share some of her thoughts on the things that have been spoken about earlier today. Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Congresswoman STACY  PLASKETT , for leading tonight’s Special Order hour, joined by her cochair, Congressman MARC VEASEY , and also my classmate. Let me say to our chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Congressman CEDRIC RICHMOND for bringing this Special Order hour here tonight. So much has been said already. But let me say how honored I am to join my colleagues as we address and talk about ‘‘A Response to President Trump’s Inaugural Address and New Deal for African Americans.’’ Like so many of my colleagues tonight, Mr. Speaker, and the countless Americans who are watching at home, I remain deeply concerned and troubled about several of the statements that Mr. Trump made and also about the stances of Mr. Trump’s Cabinet members, comments about minorities and women and immigrants, and, of course, comments about our own colleague Congressman JOHNLEWIS. Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, in Trump’s inaugural address, he did nothing to ease those concerns or to unite us. On the contrary, all I heard on Friday was another campaign speech of more of the same divisive rhetoric and recycled ideas from his campaign trail, ideas like the new deal for Black America that he mentioned on the campaign trail, a proposal that you have heard a lot about tonight that embraces the same trickledown economic assumptions that didn’t work for African Americans in the past and certainly won’t work today. Mr. Speaker, during his campaign speech, Trump talked about gangs roaming the streets and how African American communities are being decimated by crime. He went so far as to say, overwhelmingly, the majority of Black people living in inner cities in the United States are ‘‘living in hell.’’ Well, Mr. Speaker, I want President Trump to know that I am Black. I grew up in the United States inner city, but I didn’t live in hell. And here I stand now, educated in the public schools, attended a historically Black university and college, and I am a Member of the United States Congress. Mr. Trump said: ‘‘We are one Nation—and their pain is our pain. Their dreams are our dreams, and their success will be our success.’’ He was referencing mothers and children strapped in poverty in our inner cities. He was referencing rusted out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our Nation, and an education system flush with cash but leaving our young students deprived of knowledge. Well, Mr. Speaker, I want to see his plans for public education. I want to see his plans for innercity students. I want to see his plans flush with all that cash that he talked about going into our public schools. I want us to unite to help eradicate the cycle of poverty and eliminate the toooften traveled pipeline from underperforming schools to overcrowded prisons. I want to see Mr. Trump’s plan on criminal justice reform. I want a fair Attorney General vetted and confirmed because they will stand up every single day for equal rights of all Americans, for freedom of speech, for freedom to vote, and much more—not an Attorney General who lacks the ability to represent disenfranchised groups, not someone who fails to champion the least of us. b2115 I have not seen those things in nominee SESSIONS . Lastly, I want Cabinet members who will be champions for our seniors—people like my 92yearold mother. I want Cabinet members who will stand up for minorities and minority businesses. See, we need greater assistance in minority businesses and funds for minority business. I want Cabinet members who will build on and strengthen our healthcare system—yes, to make it greater, not to take away health care from 30 million people. Let me just say that I want to plan for workforce development programs and reentry training programs for those laidoff factory workers. I want to see plans for mothers and families because we certainly know, when women succeed, America succeeds. Yes, Mr. Speaker. I dare ask that women get equal pay for equal work. I don’t want recycled, failed policies that will do nothing to heal our communities. I am proud to be a member of the Congressional Black Caucus. We are the conscience of the Congress. Let me end by saying that there are so many programs. We have a task force on poverty, led by Congresswoman BARBARA LEE. I won’t repeat the program that Assistant Democratic Leader CLYBURN has already introduced—the 10–20–30 plan. Let me again thank my colleagues for bringing their powerful voices to this floor. Mr. Speaker, it is incumbent upon all of us to join the members of the Congressional Black Caucus, the entire House Democratic Caucus, and all Americans of every color—in standing up to President Trump and continuing to let him know, as our preamble of the Constitution says—to form a more perfect Union for all Americans. Ms. PLASKETT. I thank the gentlewoman. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank the gentlewoman. Mr. Speaker, I was struck by some information that I just received. This is a summary of the new deal for Black America. Nowhere in the new deal for Black America is a commitment to protecting voting rights. One of the Achilles heels of the nominee for the Attorney General is he does not have a history of protecting voting rights. Particularly, I want to acknowledge President George W. Bush because the Congress—both the House and the Senate—worked extensively with him in the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, including section 5, which is preclearance. Lo and behold, the Shelby case imploded section 5. We no longer have it in a potpourri—a flourishing, a garden of weeds—of voter ID laws, one by which my colleague Mr. VEASEY , who was a plaintiff, was promoted. The last point that I want to make is, in addition to not having anything on voting rights, we just had breaking news that the White House has indicated that the President would have had the popular vote if he had not had happen to him 3 to 5 million illegal votes cast. This is being reported. Likewise, what is being reported is there is absolutely no evidence that there were 3 to 5 million illegal votes cast in the 2016 election. I think we need to have focus on voting rights and on the protection of those who vote. Ms. PLASKETT. I thank the gentlewoman. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. VEASEY ). Mr. VEASEY. I thank the gentlewoman. Mr. Speaker, I thank all of the Members who have participated tonight. We are about to run short on our time here, but there are just so many other areas that need to be addressed, and the Congressional Black Caucus is going to continue to address those when we talk about safe communities; when we start talking about great education and some of the issues that we see with the nominee for the Secretary of Education that threaten to really cripple and hurt our public schools; when we talk about equal justice for all. How are we going to work with the Justice Department to try to foster some of the good initiatives that President Obama put forward in dealing with community policing? It is all of those things, Mr. Speaker. Ms. PLASKETT. And education and workforce development. Mr. VEASEY. Absolutely. Education and workforce development with our changing workforce—STEAM jobs and STEM jobs. Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, within hours of taking the oath as President of the United States, Donald Trump signaled that his much touted ‘‘New Deal for Black America’’ is just the same ‘‘old deal’’ of discrimination, voter suppression and establishment entitlement. In politics, as in life, actions always speak louder than words. And the speed of his repudiation of the inclusive agenda of the Obama administration shouts his intention to turn back the clock on civil rights for a broad swath of our nation. Since the Supreme Court suspended the application of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act in the Shelby County Case, African American communities around the nation have fought the passage of discriminatory voter identification laws as part of a scheme to suppress the vote. The states of Texas and North Carolina have been particular battlegrounds, where important victories were achieved in the federal courts. The work of civil rights advocacy groups received important support from the Voting Section of the DOJ Civil Rights Division in reversing some of the most aggressive statepassed voter suppression plans. As many have feared, the election of Trump threatens to produce a radical change in support for voting rights from the White House. Unlike even President George W. Bush, who signed the reauthorization of Section 5 of the VRA, Trump has exhibited an hostility to voting rights not seen since the Civil Rights era. By Friday afternoon, lawyers for the Department asked for a delay in the hearing scheduled for tomorrow on the Texas voter ID case, citing the change in presidential administrations. The motion noted that ‘‘Because of the change in administration, the Department of Justice also experienced a transition in leadership, . . . and requires additional time to brief the new leadership of the Department on this case and the issues to be addressed at the hearing before making any representations to the Court.’’ It is generally expected that DOJ will reverse course in the case. This case is a bellwether of what can be expected from a Trump DOJ on civil rights. Given the size of Texas and the precedential impact of the case, the stakes in this litigation could not be higher for the minority community. The voting law at issue in the case, known as SB 14, set strict requirements for permissible ID to vote. While it included such identification as a driver’s license, passport and a concealed handgun license, it excluded identification like federal government or student IDs. In July, the Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit in New Orleans ruled that the law violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act because it disproportionately affected minorities. The Department of Justice had previously argued that the law violated the Voting Rights Act and was intended to directly impact the abilities of minorities to vote, as more than 600,000 minorities lacked the ID necessary under state law to vote. The belief that the Civil Rights Division will change position and will be under attack is well founded. Last Thursday, it was reported that the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, Violence Against Women Grants and the Legal Services Corporation would be target for elimination and the Civil Rights Division would have its funding cut as part of Trump plan for reducing the size of the federal government. Most troubling, it was also reported that John M. Gore, an attorney who led the legal teams on several key cases attacking civil rights, would be the head of DOJ’ s Civil Rights Division as the Deputy Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. Gore was one of the defense attorneys who argued in court on behalf of North Carolina’s legally dubious and discriminatory anti transgender bill HB2. The bill blocks transgender people from using public bathrooms that align with their gender identity. The bottom line here is that Gore was on the side of discrimination in the country’s most high profile LGBTQ rights case of the past year. (Many will recall that this legislation generated a huge economic backlash against the state, including the relocation of major sporting events). His record of being a legal champion for discriminatory causes appears to be a highlight of Gore’s legal career. One of his main areas of expertise appears to be defending redistricting plans against claims of civil rights violations, with his online bio boasting of a number of successful such defenses. One of the most highprofile civil rights cases Gore has litigated in recent years is the Florida Purge case. This case brought many of us to the floor to denounce yet another attempt at voter suppression that was designed to alter the balance of state politics. The state of Florida was found to have violated the National Voter Registration Act with a systemic purge of voters it suspected of being noncitizens. As the New York Times wrote of Florida’s voter restriction attempt: The program to identify and remove noncitizens from the rolls prompted a national outcry and several lawsuits in 2012 because it was riddled with mistakes and was being pushed through months before the election. A number of people on the lists, which were sent by the state to county election supervisors, were, in fact, citizens (including the two lead plaintiffs in the lawsuit). 
Just as we opposed the nomination of Sen. JEFFSESSIONS to serve as Attorney General, we must similarly build a record against John Gore to head the Civil Rights Division. We simply cannot entrust our legacy civil rights statutes to any person who has shown a lack of sensitivity and balance in protecting the interests of justice in our society. Though Trump’s inaugural speech invoked an image of my home City of Detroit, I fear what his vision will mean for my community and vow to continue the struggle for jobs, justice and peace. He stated that ‘‘the time for empty talk is over. Now arrives the hour of action.’’ I take him at his word and his actions send an unmistakable message: His action is to appoint a defender of discrimination to head the Civil Rights Division. His action is to retreat from an agenda on Community Oriented Policing. His action is to undermine affordable healthcare. His action is to appoint cabinet officials who fail to represent the mosaic that is America. The Congressional Black Caucus took to this floor tonight to outline our response to the President’s Inaugural Address & New Deal for AfricanAmericans. While our views may not find much in common, I believe we can agree on this: the time for talk is indeed over and the hour for action has arrived. This caucus will not stand idly by while an administration attempts to turn back the clock. The greatness of America is found in its diversity, inclusiveness and empathy. That is why we are the beacon on the hill. Whether we fly, walk or crawl, we are committed to moving this nation forward and will not turn back. 
Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, on Friday, President Donald Trump addressed the nation during his inaugural address by laying out his priorities for the new administration and his future vision for our country. Among his priorities is to incentivize private investments in infrastructure through tax incentives and publicprivate partnerships. Tax incentives and publicprivate partnerships are simply two elements that I believe should be part of a larger, more comprehensive infrastructure plan. A truly comprehensive plan will include direct spending and invests real dollars in both rural and urban communities So far, the only portions of President Trump’s infrastructure plan that have been made public include $100 billion in tax breaks to private investors. I believe that President Trump is deeply misguided in relying solely on tax breaks to miraculously spur investments in our decaying transportation network. We need to include a healthy mix of direct spending, tax incentives, publicprivate partnerships, and sensible public policies if we are to sufficiently address the infrastructure needs across the country. Our highways, railways, and airways serve as the arteries that drive the U.S. economy. As our nation’s population continues to grow and become more diverse, the growth of our transportation infrastructure needs to keep pace. Texas is projected to account for nearly fifteen percent of all the national population growth through 2030. Yet, it has become increasingly difficult to make the investments that we need to properly maintain and build up the state’s infrastructure due to dwindling federal funding for transportation projects. President Trump’s plan in its current form falls drastically short of the necessary steps that we must take in order to modernize our crumbling infrastructure. Mr. Speaker, it has been and continues to be my intention to give President Trump a fair chance at proving to the American people that he is serious about bringing real solutions to our nation’s problems to the table. I strongly encourage this administration to present a wellrounded infrastructure plan that goes beyond merely handouts to corporations, and also includes the direct spending that is so desperately needed.
