Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, perhaps the most powerful moment on Inauguration Day when the President gave his speech was when he reminded his supporters and the people who were assembled there that there were too many in America who were forgotten by the Federal Government; and that it was his promise that he would, in fact, remember them in terms of how he developed policies and programs during his time as President. It is a message which obviously he used quite effectively on the campaign trail. I think personally it is what propelled him into the White House. Fast forward to where we are today, Mr. Speaker. It is hard to really square that rhetoric with the budget, which was submitted a couple of weeks ago by the Trump administration. The one agency which probably has the closest connection to rural America, that part of the country which he was addressing in his comments on Inauguration Day, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, was cut by 20 percent in terms of what came over from the White House. Again, that was the third largest hit of any Federal agency of the entire Federal Government, the U.S. Department of Agriculture. It does so much in terms of helping farmers, small town America, and rural America in terms of dealing with the challenges which, again, I think, were just a huge, powerful undercurrent in last November’s election. In particular, the budget proposes eliminating completely the USDA Rural Development for drinking water and wastewater programs, which, again, for so many communities, is desperately needed. Again, the property tax base of small town and rural towns across the country really cannot, by themselves, pay for sewer plants, pay for drinking water upgrades. I know because I come from one of those districts. Even in Connecticut, the eastern half of the State, the Second Congressional District is small town, rural America for which the USDA Rural Development programs have been the lifeblood of making sure that community facilities and, again, a decent quality of life are possible. So, for example, in towns like Vernon, Connecticut, where I am from, the Bolton Lake sewer plant was just finished a couple of years ago through USDA Rural Development. In the town of Putnam, $28 million over just the last couple of years, they just built a new fire station, the north Putnam fire station, with USDA Rural Development. Stafford, Connecticut, there was a sewer plant upgrade. Windham, Connecticut, there was a new community health facility, which was a community facilities program, through USDA Rural Development. There were projects in Thompson, Connecticut, $2.4 million for water and sewer; Brooklyn, Connecticut, $1.3; Killingly, and the list goes on and on. This budget, let’s be clear, doesn’t just give this program a little haircut or tailor it back. It eliminates it. It eviscerates this type of help which, again, rural communities, with their own resources, are incapable of accomplishing on their own. Mr. Speaker, a budget is more than just a collection of numbers. It is a statement of your priorities. It is about what is important to you as an executive or as a legislator, and this budget fails that test for rural America, for the forgotten Americans which the President addressed on Inauguration Day. I am confident that, in this Chamber, there is potential for a bipartisan group of Members to push back on this type of really just backwards budgeting and backwards priority. Again, in terms of what my father told me a long time ago: Talk is cheap. Put your money where your mouth is. Put your budget where your rhetoric is. On that score, this administration has failed that test. It has also failed it with the Sea Grant program for fishermen in America. Again, 90 percent of seafood that is consumed in this country is from overseas. Even though we are a great maritime country, the Sea Grant program helps 
fishermen deal with all the complexity of the maritime domain in terms of regulations. I have seen it in Connecticut. Again, my district borders on Long Island Sound. We have seen shellfish growers coming back to life because of the Sea Grant program administered through the University of Connecticut Avery Point Campus that has given these really hardworking, inspiring entrepreneurs the tools that they need to again give America a domestic seafood industry. It is just ridiculous when you look at the disproportion of imported seafood that is consumed on the tables of Americans all across the country. Later today, 100 House Members, on a bipartisan basis, will be releasing a letter of support for the Sea Grant program. Congressman ZELDIN , Republican from Long Island, and myself led that letter. Again, this is where our focus ought to be in terms of this country. If you really care about making America great again, it is about giving people out there in the great heartland and in the coastal sections of this country the tools that they need to grow, thrive, innovate, and succeed. This budget fails that test.

PRAYER Reverend Dr. Dan C. Cummins, Skyline Wesleyan Church, San Diego, California, offered the following prayer: Almighty God and Father, how good and pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity. It is like sweet perfume upon our heads. Let us walk together in the vocation wherewith we are called, with all lowliness and meekness, forbearing one another in love, keeping the unity of the spirit in the bonds of kindness, till we all come into the harmony of faith and the knowledge of God’s Son unto a more perfect union, till we are no longer children tossed and carried about by every wind of opposition. Let us speak the truth in love that we may grow up into You in all things. Sanctify us, Lord, through the truth. Thy Word is truth. And the glory You have given us; for what purpose, O God? That we may be one? Yes, that we all may be one. I pray this in Jesus’ name. Amen. THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER pro tempore.

CONGRATULATING GAMECOCKS, NATIONAL CHAMPIONS (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, last night, the Gamecocks women’s basketball team made history, winning the NCAA National Championship for the first time in school history. Defeating Mississippi State 67–55, the Gamecocks dominated the allSEC game, leading the Bulldogs in scoring and in rebounds. Early in the season, the Gamecocks set their sights on the championship, themeing the season as 100, with the ‘‘1’’ reflecting their commitment to one goal, one team, one dream, one family, and one focus. They never gave up their goals, and their dedication clearly paid off. I join all of Gamecock Nation in celebrating this remarkable victory. We are also grateful for the Gamecock men, who, in the Final Four, were ahead of number one Gonzaga in the last 3 minutes until the disturbing Zags pulled ahead. Special congratulations to superstar A’ja Wilson of Heathwood Hall and Hopkins, South Carolina, who had a great game, scoring a team high 22 points, and who was also named most outstanding player in the Final Four. Congratulations as well to Head Coach Dawn Staley, President Harris Pastides, and USC First Lady Patricia Pastides. The Gamecocks women’s basketball team joins Clemson’s football team and Coastal Carolina’s baseball team as the third college national championship from South Carolina in just 1 year. Go Gamecocks. In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. Welcome, Timmerman School of Forest Acres, South Carolina, to the Capitol. REMEMBERING LOUISVILLE METRO POLICE OFFICER NICK RODMAN (Mr. YARMUTH asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow the city of Louisville will lay to rest Officer Nick Rodman, a loving husband, father, son, and friend, who died in the line of duty last week. The special commitment that the men and women of law enforcement make to protect and serve their fellow citizens is one that the Rodman family holds dear, and Nick felt that call to service deeply, growing up as the son and brother of fellow officers. He is survived by the loves of his life: his wife, Ashley; his young son, Mason; and his newborn daughter, Ellie Jean. I ask my colleagues and our Nation to join me, the Louisville Metro Police Department, and our entire city in honoring this public servant as he is laid to rest. To Nick’s wife, Ashley: I hope the memories you have with your husband will be a source of comfort as you face this heartbreaking tragedy. The city of Louisville joins you in grief, and we will ensure that Nick will always be remembered. 
CONFIRM JUDGE GORSUCH (Mr. BABIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to strongly urge my colleagues in the United States Senate to confirm Judge Neil Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court. Since being nominated by President Trump, Judge Gorsuch has provided unprecedented transparency and access. He has completed three rounds of intense questioning by the Senate Judiciary Committee, which totaled nearly 20 hours and covered nearly 1,200 questions. This was the longest hearing of any nominee in the 21st century. During this time, Judge Gorsuch showed himself to be uniquely qualified and experienced to serve on our Nation’s highest court. In fact, he showed the exact same qualification that previously earned him unanimous approval by the U.S. Senate in 2006 to serve on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. ThenSenators Obama, Biden, Clinton, and SCHUMER were all serving in the Senate at that time and raised no objections whatsoever to Judge Gorsuch’s nomination. Mr. Speaker, it is time for the Senate to put politics aside and confirm Judge Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
COMMUNICATION FROM THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following communication from the Clerk of the House of Representatives: 
b1704 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky) at 5 o’clock and 4 minutes p.m. 
MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT A message in writing from the President of the United States was communicated to the House by Ms. Mariel Ridgway, one of his secretaries. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 92. I am the chief Democratic cosponsor and the gentleman from South Carolina is the sponsor of this resolution condemning North Korea’s development of multiple intercontinental ballistic missiles, and for other purposes. It should be noted that this resolution now has 120 bipartisan cosponsors, including the ranking member and chairman of the committee, the chairman of the Asia and the Pacific Subcommittee, and myself as ranking member of the Asia and the Pacific Subcommittee. This resolution is necessary at a time when the regime of Kim Jongun is as belligerent as ever. His intentions are clear. He is conducting intermediate and intercontinental ballistic missile tests and nuclear tests for the purpose of being in a position to intimidate the United States and the rest of the world. Just this month the regime in Pyongyang released a fake propaganda video showing the imagined destruction of a U.S. aircraft carrier by its forces. In addition to the five nuclear weapons North Korea has already tested, Kim Jongun continues to test ballistic missiles, including submarinelaunched ballistic missiles, and is moving toward intercontinental ballistic missiles. These missiles have as one of their chief purposes to be able to reach the continental United States and particularly the Pacific Coast of the United States. We used to have the luxury of saying that North Korea just wants attention; they just want this or that concession. But now their goal is clear. It is to threaten hundreds of millions of Americans. It is clear that North Korea is testing missiles and bombs for the purpose of developing warheads that can do just that. The resolution we are considering today, H. Res. 92, condemns North Korea’s intercontinental ballistic missile tests, calls for the United States to apply economic sanctions on North Korea, and calls on China to pressure North Korean leaders to cease their provocative behavior, abandon and dismantle their nuclear missile program, and it calls upon China to curtail, or at least threaten to curtail, their economic support of Pyongyang. President Xi is coming to the United States. He will meet with our President in Florida. And I hope that the recent comments that we are going to handle this issue on our own are not what comes out of Florida, because, instead, we must demand that China pressure North Korea. 
According to the U.S.China Economic and Security Review Commission, China accounts for over 90 percent of North Korea’s foreign trade and approximately 95 percent of its foreign direct investment. Beijing needs to know that there are serious challenges to its relationship with the United States if it does not assist us in this effort. Officials in Beijing cannot assume that their companies will always have access to the United States market. There are those who say it is unthinkable to link our trading relationship with China to its position on North Korea. I believe it is unthinkable for us not to use all the tools at our disposal to try to prevent the least predictable leader in the world—and perhaps the least stable—from having the capacity to hit the United States mainland with intercontinental nuclear tipped ballistic missiles. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. WILSON ), who is a senior member of both the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Armed Services Committee and the author of this resolution. Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I was grateful to visit North Korea on a congressional delegation in 2003 with House Foreign Affairs Ranking Member ELIOT ENGEL on a delegation led by Congressman Curt Weldon of Pennsylvania. While there, we witnessed a regime obsessed with a Potemkinlike appearance and preservation to the detriment of its own citizens who have been reduced to destitution and starvation. b1715 After seeing the devastation of the people at the hands of the totalitarian regime, I have been even more invested in the need to hold the regime in Pyongyang accountable for threatening neighbors. In early February, I introduced this bipartisan resolution in response to North Korea’s threat to test an intercontinental ballistic. Their threat is concerning because an ICBM has the capability of reaching the West Coast of the United States. The rapid pace of North Korea’s growing offensive nuclear weapons development is alarming to the United States and our allies. In just a few short months, North Korea has appeared to successfully test an ICBM; launched a satellite; tested four simultaneous ballistic missiles, three of which landed in Japanese territorial waters; had a failed missile launch; and tested a ballistic missile engine. The regime also claims to be planning another nuclear test for later this month. Sadly revealing, the regime in North Korea recently released a propaganda video depicting a missile striking a U.S. aircraft carrier and calling for the destruction of the American people. North Korea is rapidly advancing their capabilities, working to miniaturize nuclear technology to deliver a nuclear weapon anywhere in the world. Sadly, 8 years of strategic patience only enabled the dictatorship. We cannot afford to stand by as this regime grows in power and influence, threatening the United States and our allies. I am grateful that President Donald Trump is taking the regime and its threats seriously. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson recently visited our allies in South Korea and Japan; and the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, has led the efforts for strengthening international sanctions against North Korea. The administration has also demonstrated peace through strength by backing up their commitments to our allies with action. We have begun deploying the THAAD missile defense system, recently resumed the annual military training exercises with South Korea, and deployed attack drones to support our servicemembers stationed in the region. This defends the extraordinary people of South Korea, who have developed one of the most prosperous nations on Earth. As we work to check the growing influence and missile capability of North Korea, Congress, too, has a vital role, starting with passage of H. Res. 92 to forcefully condemn North Korea for these actions and call for the consideration of all available sanctions on the regime and the individuals or businesses who sustain it. We are clear: the United States must stand strong against North Korea for American families and our South Korean allies. I appreciate the consideration of H. Res. 92, with 120 bipartisan cosponsors. I know that America is fortunate to have the leadership of House Foreign Affairs Chairman EDROYCE , serving in a bipartisan manner with Ranking Member ELIOT ENGEL . I urge my colleagues to vote in support of the resolution. Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN ), the chairman emeritus of the committee who chairs the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa and has authored previous legislation to address the North Korean threat. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I commend the commitment that Chairman ROYCE and Ranking Member ENGEL have shown in holding North Korea accountable for its illicit activity, and it is a long list. Mr. Speaker, I want to also commend my good friend and colleague, Congressman JOEWILSON , for authoring this important measure, H. Res. 92, condemning North Korea’s development of multiple intercontinental ballistic missiles, or ICBMs. Recently, North Korea has made the calculation that it either needs to flex its muscles through the test of ballistic missiles or, at the very least, provoke an international response so that the regime can use it as propaganda against the West. We have seen dozens of missile tests over the past year, and, just as troubling, at least two nuclear tests. I know that this is resolution condemning North Korea’s provocative action, but I do think this is an opportunity to call attention to the Iranian nuclear and ballistic missile program. What I and some of my colleagues have been saying for years now is that Iran has been following the North Korea playbook. We signed a weak and dangerous nuclear deal with North Korea, and what was the result? A nucleararmed Pyongyang that is testing and upgrading its ballistic and nuclear program unchecked and possibly even proliferating these materials, or at least the knowhow, to Iran. We concluded a weak and dangerous nuclear deal with Iran, and you can be sure, if we don’t do more to press Iran, we will be welcoming another dangerous regime to the nuclear weapons club. While we rightfully condemn North Korea for its provocations, we must be mindful that, if we follow the same path and make the same mistakes, it will be Iran in a few years that will have a nuclear weapon and ballistic missile program that can threaten global security, and that is in none of our interests. I urge my colleagues to fully support Mr. WILSON ’s measure, Mr. Speaker, but I also urge them to realize the failures of past policies and what got us here to this point with North Korea and not to allow the same mistakes to happen with respect to Iran. Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT ), a senior member of the Foreign Affairs Committee. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 92, condemning North Korea’s development of multiple intercontinental ballistic missiles. Without question, North Korea’s relentless effort to develop ballistic missiles poses a serious threat to the security of the United States, especially to our allies in the region, and possibly all across the globe. For the past several years, Kim Jong un has made significant strides in their nuclear missile program. It seems like every few weeks we hear new reports concerning the growing North Korea nuclear threat. North Korea has conducted multiple nuclear tests and demonstrated that it is bound and determined to develop a ballistic missile capable of delivering a nuclear warhead to the continental United States. It has also become abundantly clear that the Kim regime will continue to 
work toward a nuclear warhead, no matter the cost. Just today, a senior North Korean defector stated that the young, irresponsible dictator will do anything to remain in power and that Kim believes nuclear weapons will help guarantee his rule. We must condemn these actions and begin taking concrete steps to mitigate the growing North Korean threat. I also believe we must work closer than ever with our South Korean partners and increase our already strong security alliance by assisting with technological developments, carrying out more joint exercises, and quickly making the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense systems, or THAAD, in South Korea operational. I commend my friend, Mr. WILSON of South California, for his leadership in championing H. Res. 92. I also want to thank Chairman ROYCE and the ranking member, Mr. ELIOT ENGEL , for, again, using the format of the Foreign Affairs Committee in a bipartisan manner. This is one committee in the House— and there are a few others—that works very much in a bipartisan manner. This is one we do need to be united on. The threat from Kim Jongun is serious. It is dangerous. It is a threat to world peace. We need to take it seriously. H. Res. 92 goes in the right direction. I, again, want to thank Mr. WILSON for proposing it. Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I will add a comment to the upcoming visit of President Xi to Florida and President Trump’s statement in advance of that: Well, we don’t need China to get tough on North Korea. The fact is, President Trump has not given us a plan that would put effective pressure on Pyongyang that does not involve China. There is no magic road to dealing with the North Korean threat that does not go through Beijing. My fear is that, in the guise of being the tough guy who doesn’t need China’s help, in fact, President Trump is preparing to fail to get China’s help in controlling North Korea, is preparing to be weak in dealing with China and to weakly accept their unwillingness to act, and then disguising it all in some machismo statement of strength: Oh, we don’t need China. We do need China. There is no plan to control North Korea that doesn’t involve China. Macho statements are not an excuse for real strength in dealing with President Xi. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California). Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 92, condemning North Korea’s development of multiple intercontinental ballistic missiles. The world has watched in fear as this brutal dictatorship has labored to miniaturize a nuclear warhead capable of being delivered by an ICBM. Across the 45th District, Californians are anxious about the growing threat from North Korea and its efforts to develop the capability to strike the West Coast. Orange County is home to a large KoreanAmerican population who have spoken out forcefully against this rogue regime, fearing for the life of their Korean kin and the safety of the entire world. As I tell all concerned constituents when I am back home in California, and I will repeat here today: I share your concern and will do all I can to ensure we eliminate this threat. Mr. Speaker, just today, an interview with the most highprofile North Korean defector in two decades was released. The man’s warning was dire: Kim Jongun will use nuclear weapons at the slightest sign of an imminent threat to his rule. The time for the old strategy of strategic patience has passed. We must take serious actions now to prevent a nuclear weapon from ever threatening the United States or one of our allies. I urge the President to address this grave threat with the Chinese President at their upcoming summit. I thank my friend, the gentleman from South Carolina, for undertaking this effort, and I am proud to join him in this fight. Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I would simply say that I commend the gentleman from South Carolina, Mr. WILSON , for authoring this resolution, which has secured the support of 120 bipartisan cosponsors, including the chair and ranking member of the full committee and the chair and, in my case, ranking member of the relevant subcommittee. I, again, call on my colleagues to join me in supporting H. Res. 92, condemning North Korea’s development of multiple intercontinental ballistic missiles, and for other purposes. We need an official congressional condemnation of North Korea’s continued ballistic missile testing and its related nuclear program. We need to ramp up sanctions on North Korea, while applying pressure to China, hopefully later this week, for being North Korea’s economic lifeline. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, North Korea, as we all know, poses an urgent threat to the United States and to our allies. Experts say that, in less than 4 years, Kim Jungun will likely have the ability to make a reliable intercontinental ballistic missile topped by a nuclear warhead capable of targeting the continental United States. They also expect that, by then, North Korea may have accumulated enough nuclear material to build up to 100 warheads for those ICBMs they have been making. In an interview, the President says he is going to discuss this growing threat and Kim Jungun’s behavior with Chinese President Xi this week. As he says, China has great influence over North Korea, and China will either decide to help us with North Korea or they won’t, but, if they do, that will be very good for China. It will be good for China because we have made it very clear that this is a key interest of the United States. We do not want to see North Korea able to proliferate this kind of weaponry. They have already tested this off of a submarine. It would be irresponsible for us, China, and every member of the international community not to take steps now to cut off all hard currency into North Korea that allows that regime to continue down this path. b1730 This threat is real, and that demands real response. I appreciate JOEWILSON  bringing this resolution because, as he notes, one other point that I think we have to make, the deployment of THAAD needs to be completed as quickly as possible. The President must also utilize the economic tools that Congress has given him with the act authored by myself and Mr. ENGEL to cut off funding for the regime of Kim Jongun. I would also encourage the administration to pursue all opportunities to strengthen our economic and security relationships with our partners throughout the Asia Pacific right now because, as we know, our allies there are equally concerned about this development. I thank the author of this resolution, Mr. JOEWILSON , and, of course, my committee’s ranking member, Mr. ENGEL . I want to thank Mr. S HERMAN  as well for working on this resolution. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I stand in strong support of H. Res. 92, Condemning North Korea’s development of multiple intercontinental ballistic missiles. The security of our nation and allies rests on a global community of nations acting in a responsible manner. For too long the AsiaPacific region has been rocked with instability because of North Korea’s irresponsible behavior. Last year, the North Korean regime conducted two nuclear tests and twenty missile tests, including successfully testing a submarine launched ballistic missile. This is a marked increase from two nuclear tests and 42 missile tests over the previous seven years. In February 2017, North Korea fired a ballistic missile that landed in the sea between the Korean Peninsula and Japan, sending shockwaves among our two closest allies in the AsiaPacific. Passing this resolution will reaffirm our commitment to trilateral missile defense cooperation with South Korea and Japan and to an interoperable, multitier missile defense system that will protect Americans and our allies on the Korean Peninsula. At a time of increasing belligerence by North Korea, our allies need such security assurances. This bill will also urge the President to promptly deploy the 
Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system in South Korea, apply all available economic sanctions on North Korea, and consider additional measures to strengthen bilateral security cooperation with South Korea, including increases in foreign military sales and joint exercises. Like many of my colleagues, the constituents whom I represent want assurance that the United States is secure from all external threats, including the potential threat of weaponized intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). ICBMs are designed to travel between 5,500 km and 10,000 km. California is about 9,000 km from North Korea. Given that the North Korean regime has made steady advances in its nuclear weapons program over the past few years, it is not surprising that my California colleagues are increasingly alarmed by Pyongyang’s actions. The level of bipartisan support for H. Res. 92 reflects the importance of the threat North Korea poses to global stability. Our security and the security of our allies is an issue that crosses party lines. It is imperative to our national security interests that North Korea does not develop a weaponized ICBM capable of reaching any part of our country. This resolution provides more assurance to our allies in the AsiaPacific and sends a message to the North Korean regime that all Americans are united in our determination to safeguard our country against foreign threats. I strongly urge my colleagues to vote yes on the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, H. Res. 92, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
REAFFIRMING THE UNITED STATESARGENTINA PARTNERSHIP AND RECOGNIZING ARGENTINA’S ECONOMIC REFORMS Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 54) reaffirming the United StatesArgentina partnership and recognizing Argentina’s economic reforms, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the resolution. The text of the resolution is as follows: 
Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to put any extraneous material in the RECORD . The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Let me just start by thanking Mr. SIRES, the author of this measure, and I rise in support of it. It reaffirms the United StatesArgentina partnership. After over a decade of economic mismanagement and corruption and alliances with the likes of Iran—well, we should say the Ayatollah in Iran—and alliances with the regime in Venezuela, the people of Argentina used their vote to usher in a new era of what I would call economic common sense and a new era of regional leadership. Since assuming the Presidency in December 2015, President Macri has undertaken difficult economic reforms to undo the damage caused by his predecessor’s policy and taken reforms to return to the global markets. He tore up the laughable agreement that President Cristina Kirchner signed with Iran to investigate the 1994 Hezbollah bombing of the Jewish community center, which killed 85 and injured hundreds of other people in the Jewish community in Argentina. He has shown regional leadership in condemning Venezuela’s human and democratic rights violations. As the new Argentinian Government undertakes difficult reforms, it needs the moral support of its allies in the region, including the support of this body. This measure seeks to reaffirm the partnership, the friendship that we share with Argentina. It commends the government’s hard work in bringing Argentina back from economic ruin. This measure also encourages the Government of Argentina to make good on its promise to finally bring the perpetrators of the 1994 bombing there 
of the Jewish community center to justice, while thoroughly investigating the January 2015 death of special prosecutor Alberto Nisman. As my colleagues know, immediately before his mysterious death, Nisman was set to issue a thorough report on his findings that the government of Cristina Kirchner had colluded with Iran to conceal Iran’s role in orchestrating that 1994 terrorist attack at the hands of the Iranian proxy in this case, Hezbollah. Mr. Speaker, let me just mention another subject here. In South America, we are watching Venezuela lose any semblance of democracy or human rights. Last week, Venezuela’s democratically elected National Assembly was dissolved. The Venezuelan people are greatly suffering. As Argentina has dropped its support of these authoritarians and stands with the rest of the region in strong condemnation of authoritarianism in Venezuela, the Venezuelan Government is now more isolated than ever. Back to H. Res. 54. This reflects this body’s support of and friendship with Argentina, and it reflects our gratitude for Argentine leadership in support of economic and democratic reform. Again, I thank Mr. SIRES for this resolution. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution. I would like to start by thanking Chairman ROYCE , Ranking Member ENGEL , and their staffs for working with me to bring H. Res. 54 to the floor. I would like to thank my friend from South Carolina, Chairman JEFF DUNCAN, who is in charge of the Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere and led a delegation to Argentina last March to help restart relations with the Macri administration. H. Res. 54 reaffirms the strong U.S. partnership with Argentina and acknowledges their President Mauricio Macri for his efforts to make the necessary changes and bring Argentina back into the international community. President Macri worked hard to stimulate growth and bring Argentina back as a powerful player in the region after years of isolationist views from the Kirchners. I was pleased to visit Argentina last year and see, firsthand, the changes the new government was making, and it was refreshing to see the progress already being made. Most importantly, we received assurances from the Macri administration that they will restart the investigation into the horrific 1994 bombing of the AMIA Jewish center in Buenos Aires, which left 85 dead and hundreds more injured, and the untimely and suspicious death of prosecutor Alberto Nisman, who was found dead on the eve of delivering his explosive report which outlined the connections between the bombing, Iran, and former Argentina President Cristina Kirchner’s efforts to cover up these links. Unfortunately, the victims of these attacks and their families still lack answers to what really occurred, and the troubling reports of Iran’s role in the bombing deserves thorough investigation that finally brings the perpetrators to justice. Argentina is a great partner and a friend, and I believe we must continue to support our friends and continue to grow this critical relationship. Once again, I thank my colleagues for their support of this resolution and urge Members of the House to support H. Res. 54 to further strengthen the great ties our country has with Argentina. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. DUNCAN ), who chairs the Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. He is the primary cosponsor of this measure. Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I briefly want to mention the country of Colombia. Tremendous flooding and mudslides there have taken more than 200 lives. Colombia is in my prayers, the prayers of the Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, and the prayers of all of America. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 54, which reaffirms America’s partnership with Argentina, and applaud the economic reforms undertaken in recent years. I applaud Ranking Member SIRES for his leadership on this issue. Last year, he and I led a congressional delegation to Argentina to see the differences in the country under the new leadership of President Macri and to reextend a hand of friendship of the United States. Though the previous government followed the path of ruinous economic and foreign policies, I saw new optimism that the new Macri administration would right these wrongs. For example, at the Organization of American States, Argentina has been supportive of the actions of OAS Secretary General Almagro, urging the Venezuelan Government to respect democracy, human rights, and the rule of law. In addition, President Macri is working to find justice for the 1994 AMIA bombing terrorist attack—the largest loss of life from an act of terror in this hemisphere prior to 9/11—and the murder of the AMIA special prosecutor, Alberto Nisman. It is my sincerest hope that he will find the perpetrators and hold them accountable for these heinous acts of terror. In conclusion, the United States should be very clear that we are thankful for President Macri’s courage and willingness to take unpopular but principled positions. I urge the new Trump administration to do all in its power to take the steps outlined in this legislation and advance a deeper bilateral relationship. Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. SHERMAN ). Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 54 and commend its authors and cosponsors. With the new administration of President Macri, I think that there will be a deepening relationship between the United States and Argentina, and this resolution recognizes that. It also encourages the Argentine Government to continue to investigate and prosecute those responsible for the 1994 bombing of the ArgentineIsraeli Mutual Association, located then in the center of Buenos Aires, and the death of Argentine special prosecutor Alberto Nisman, who died mysteriously 1 day before he was going to submit a report to the Argentine Congress regarding that 1994 bombing. I think it is apparent that that 1994 bombing was conducted by Iran in cooperation with Hezbollah, and we all want to encourage the Argentine Government to find out whether there was foul play in the death of Alberto Nisman and, if so, who was behind what has all the hallmarks of an assassination designed to prevent that report from being submitted to the Argentine people and Congress. I commend the authors of this legislation. I urge its adoption. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. ROS LEHTINEN ), chairman emeritus of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and a cosponsor of this measure. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman ROYCE for the time. Mr. Speaker, I am so proud to be standing here in strong support of the measure of my very good friend from New Jersey, Mr. ALBIO SIRES. H. Res. 54 is so important. It reaffirms the U.S. Argentina partnership and recognizes Argentina’s economic reforms. As Mr. ROYCE said, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of Mr. SIRES’ important resolution. Up until the recent election of President Macri, Argentina was going in the wrong direction. Since Macri came to office, he has made some tough but muchneeded economic reforms. He has shown that Argentina is willing to be engaged in areas of mutual interest to our two countries and expand our bilateral relations. President Macri’s commitment to these reforms should be commended. But he hasn’t just shown strong leadership on economic reforms. President Macri has shown strong character and leadership to the rule of law and pursuit of justice. He has done so by announcing his intention to continue to investigate and prosecute those responsible for the 1994 bombing of the ArgentineIsraeli Mutual Association, AMIA, in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Last month, we marked the 25th anniversary of the terrorist attack on the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires, which was followed by the 1994 AMIA attack. 
It is no secret that the Iranianbacked terrorist group Hezbollah was responsible for these attacks; yet, to this day, Mr. Speaker, Iran and Hezbollah have evaded justice. b1745 The United States should support President Macri as he continues his investigation and seeks to hold those responsible accountable to make sure that he can bring them to justice for their deadly terror attacks. We should also applaud and support his decision to investigate the suspicious circumstances involving the death of the special prosecutor of these cases, Alberto Nisman. Alberto had uncovered links between Hezbollah and these terror attacks, and I would speak with Alberto frequently about these troublesome ties. Nisman was a good man and a strong supporter of human rights. We must help President Macri and the people of Argentina continue Nisman’s work and legacy by bringing those responsible for his death and for those dastardly terrorist attacks to justice. We can start by signaling to the people of Argentina that we support their government and that we value our bilateral relationship. Passing Mr. SIRES’ resolution will do just that. We will send that message. I urge my colleagues to support Mr. SIRES’ measure. Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume for the purpose of closing. In conclusion, let me say that the U.S.Argentina relationship is critical, and I stand in strong support of H. Res. 54. Argentina’s new President, Mauricio Macri, has done a tremendous job reforming their outdated and isolationist economic policies. Most importantly, the Macri administration has renewed its efforts to find the long sought after justice for the bombing of the AMIA Jewish Cultural Center, whose perpetrators are still evading justice. His efforts have improved the lives of countless Argentines, and I look forward to working with his government to continue building on the progress we have already made. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution and thank them all for their support. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues; I want to thank Mr. SIRES, ranking member of the Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere; and I thank the chairman of that committee, Mr. DUNCAN , for their leadership in bringing this measure to the floor. This important resolution reaffirms our relationship with the people and the government of Argentina. It calls on the State Department to develop an interagency strategy to maximize our cooperation with Argentina as our countries work together to promote democracy, to promote human rights, and to promote economic freedom across the Americas. Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this measure, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, H. Res. 54, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the resolution, as amended, was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
NORTH KOREA STATE SPONSOR OF TERRORISM DESIGNATION ACT OF 2017 Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 479) to require a report on the designation of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 479 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘North Korea State Sponsor of Terrorism Designation Act of 2017’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) and the gentleman from California (Mr. SHERMAN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ). 
Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material in the RECORD . The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, last month, I was pleased to hear Secretary of State Rex Tillerson say that the State Department is considering a range of measures to respond to Kim Jongun’s dangerous provocations in Northeast Asia. One immediate step should be listing North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism, a status it should have never lost. In 2008, North Korea’s designation as a state sponsor of terror was rescinded following the regime’s promise to dismantle its nuclear weapons program. Well, North Korea got its delisting, but it kept its nuclear program, as proven by its fourth test and as proven by its fifth test last year. Since 2008, not only has North Korea’s nuclear weapons program advanced, so too has its support for terrorism. Let me explain that. The Kim regime has continued to supply surfacetoair missiles and explosives to terrorist groups like Hezbollah. In addition to that, the actions taken by North Korea include the firing of repeated rounds on South Korean civilians on the island of Yeonpyeong and carrying out targeted assassinations of North Korean defectors, including the recent assassination of Kim Jongun’s half brother, who had been living in exile. Recall that this murder, which took place in broad daylight at Kuala Lumpur International Airport, involved the use of VX nerve agent, which is a chemical weapon banned under international law. Now, a liter of this substance contains enough lethal doses to kill 1 million people. It has no other purpose than being an instrument of death. This they used to assassinate the President’s own half brother. Mr. Speaker, the Foreign Affairs Committee has focused extensively on the urgent threat by North Korea to the U.S. and our allies in Asia. It is critical that we use every tool at our disposal to ramp up the pressure on the Kim regime. I know just how aggressive North Korea can be. I saw a ship of the South Korean Navy that had been lifted from the bottom of the sea. It had been split in two by a torpedo fired by a North Korean submarine. Over 40 South Korean sailors were killed in that attack. This is the kind of behavior we have seen from Kim Jongun. This is why I rise in support of Judge TEDPOE’s bill, H.R. 479, which pushes the State Department to relist North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism. The state sponsor of terrorism label is a very powerful one. In addition to imposing sanctions and other restrictions, the designation itself earns a state pariah status internationally. And that is deserved. After all, these are countries whose governments backed the killings of innocent people, innocent civilians, as a matter of policy. Frankly, the Department should never have removed North Korea’s designation in the first place. I am glad that this legislation demands a reevaluation. I think I know what that result will be. I thank the bill’s author, Judge TED POE, who has a deep sense, as a former judge, of justice and has pursued this issue for a long time. I also thank the ranking member for working with our offices on this important and timely measure. The flawed delisting of North Korea has also been a particular focus to the chairman emeritus of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Ms. ROS LEHTINEN , and so I want to recognize her contributions as well. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS , Washington, DC, April 3, 2017. Hon. EDWARD R. R OYCE , Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs, Washington, DC. DEARCHAIRMAN ROYCE : I am writing with respect to H.R. 479, the ‘‘North Korea State Sponsor of Terrorism Designation Act of 2017.’’ As a result of your having consulted with us on provisions on which the Committee on Ways and Means has a jurisdictional interest, I will not request a sequential referral on this measure. The Committee on Ways and Means takes this action with the mutual understanding that we do not waive any jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this or similar legislation, and the Committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as the bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues that fall within our jurisdiction.

Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter confirming this understanding, and would ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the Congressional Record during floor consideration of H.R. 479. Sincerely, KEVIN BRADY , Chairman. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS , Washington, DC, April 3, 2017. Hon. KEVIN BRADY , Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, Washington, DC. DEARCHAIRMAN BRADY : Thank you for consulting with the Foreign Affairs Committee on H.R. 479, the North Korea State Sponsor of Terrorism Designation Act of 2017, and for agreeing to forgo a sequential referral request so that the bill may proceed expeditiously to the House floor. I agree that your declining to pursue a sequential referral in this case does not diminish or alter the jurisdiction of the Committee on Ways and Means, or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives on this bill or similar legislation in the future. I would support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate number of conferees from your committee to any HouseSenate conference on this legislation. I will seek to place our letters on this bill into the Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill. I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward to continuing to work with the Committee on Ways and Means as this measure moves through the legislative process. Sincerely, EDWARD R. R OYCE , Chairman. 
Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H.R. 479, the North Korea State Sponsor of Terrorism Designation Act of 2017. I want to associate myself with the chairman’s remarks. He summarizes well the need to adopt this legislation. I want to commend Judge POEfor introducing this legislation. I was very pleased to introduce it alongside him. We earlier considered H. Res. 92. In that debate, we discussed the nuclear and missile program of North Korea. Now it is time to focus for the next few minutes on their use of terrorism. We need to consider North Korea’s obvious state support of terrorism around the world. North Korea has engaged in kidnappings, targeted assassination, cyber attacks, and support to terrorist organizations in various regions. North Korea was designated as a state sponsor of terrorism in 1988, but it was taken off that list in 2008, following commitments by Pyongyang to dismantle its nuclear weapons program. We dismantled their status as a state sponsor of terrorism. North Korea certainly has not dismantled its nuclear program. Kim Jongun has only increased the pace of his nuclear ballistic missile testing and is nowhere near dismantling that program. So now it is time to focus again on North Korea’s terrorist actions around the world. We can go back several decades when the North Korean Government kidnapped Japanese civilians—some because of their talents in making movies; most in order to force them to 
teach Japanese etiquette to North Korean spies. Now, you may say: Well, that was decades ago. Why are we designating them as a state sponsor of terrorism now? Well, those people still have not been released to this day. And, if they have passed on, their bodies have not been returned to their families. We are all aware of how North Korea engaged in cyberterrorism against Sony Pictures because Sony Pictures made a movie they didn’t like. We know that, just a month or so ago, a North Korean agent killed Kim Jongnam, the half brother of North Korean leader Kim Jongun. This act of terrorism took place at the airport in Malaysia and was summarized by the chairman. In the case of Chaim Kaplan v. Hezbollah, a United States District Court found that, in 2014, North Korea materially supported terrorist attacks by Hezbollah, a designated foreign terrorist organization. And finally—and this list is incomplete but last on my list—is North Korea’s assistance in helping Assad try to develop nuclear weapons of his own. We are aware that Assad’s nuclear facility, built almost entirely based on North Korean technology and using North Korean equipment, was destroyed in 2007. Assad has murdered hundreds of thousands, it looks like the figure is now half a million, of his own citizens. Imagine the destruction Assad would have engaged in had he been able to develop nuclear weapons with the support and technology of North Korea. H.R. 479, the North Korea State Sponsor of Terrorism Designation Act, expresses the sense of Congress that North Korea likely meets the criteria to be designated as a state sponsor of terrorism and requires a determination by the Secretary of State within 90 days as to whether or not North Korea meets that standard. This bill is an important step in confronting North Korea’s support for terrorism around the world and for the danger that it poses to the civilized world. Mr. Speaker, I call upon my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. b1800 Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I would also like to recognize the contribution here of Mr. SHERMAN , who is the ranking member on the committee, and to acknowledge also the force of his argument. Kim Jongun is an individual who not only kidnaps his neighbors, but also, in the past, this rogue regime has become expert at transferring the methods to kill civilians to other rogue regimes around the world. And based upon his past behavior, it is only too plausible that if they get this weapon, they will do it again. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. POE), the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade, and the dogged author of this bill who has pushed this issue for a long time. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and the ranking member, Mr. SHERMAN , for his cosponsorship of this legislation. Mr. Speaker, North Korea was on the State Sponsors of Terrorism list for 20 years. It was taken off in 2008 for purely diplomatic reasons. North Korea agreed to freeze and disable its nuclear program as the result of international efforts known as the SixParty Talks. In exchange, the United States decided to remove North Korea from the State Sponsors of Terrorism list. Fast forward 9 years later, North Korea remains off the list while it races toward the capability to send a nuclear warhead to American shores. There has been no secret about this. Little Kim has said he wants to send intercontinental ballistic missiles to the United States. North Korea has conducted four nuclear tests since 2008. Recent satellite images suggest that it is preparing for yet another nuclear test. North Korea is also doing all the things that got it placed on the State Sponsors of Terrorism list in the first place. North Korea harbored Japanese Red Army terrorists who participated in the hijacking of a jet in 1970. These terrorists are still living happily in North Korea today. Press reports suggests that little Kim is even arming and training Hamas and Hezbollah terrorists. A U.S. district court actually found in 2014 that North Korea materially supported terrorist attacks by Hezbollah against Israel. North Korea has also moved toward a new form of terrorism: cyber warfare. We all remember the 2014 North Korea cyber attack against Sony Pictures that included direct threats against its employees and a warning to ‘‘Remember the 11th of September 2001.’’ In March of 2015, North Korea launched a cyber attack against nuclear power plants in South Korea. North Korea is not just active over cyber. It has a long history of actually killing folks, dissidents in particular, all over the world. In February, North Korean agents killed little Kim’s half brother in Malaysia using a chemical VX nerve agent. North Korea has helped Assad develop chemical weapons. Thankfully, Israel took out those chemical weapons some time ago. Mr. Speaker, North Korea’s actions have not gotten any better. They have only become more dangerous and more treacherous. In addition, North Korea is working with Iran, the world’s number one state sponsor of terror, on developing nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles. It is clear that North Korea is a state sponsor of terrorism. At the very least, the State Department should go back to the drawing board and assess whether or not North Korea meets the criteria for designation as a state sponsor of terrorism. And that is what this bill does, H.R. 479, the North Korea State Sponsor of Terrorism Designation Act. It is high time we call out little Kim, the loose cannon of East Asia, for what he is: a terrorist in a terrorist state. And that is just the way it is. Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I would note that this bill passed our committee without any opposition. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. ROS LEHTINEN ), and I thank the gentlewoman from Florida again for her contribution on this legislation. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I stand in full support of Judge POE’s bill, H.R. 479, the North Korea State Sponsor of Terrorism Designation Act of 2017. Over the years, as the chairman has said, I have repeatedly and explicitly called for Pyongyang to be redesignated as a state sponsor of terrorism, SST, country. I stood in ardent opposition to the Bush administration’s decision to remove North Korea from the SST list, and in the years past, I introduced similar legislation to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. POE), which would see Pyongyang back on the list where it belongs. The removal from the list was a failure of the nuclear negotiations with North Korea, a concession given for nothing but empty promises in return. In much the same way that the Obama administration removed Cuba from the SST list 2 years ago, the Bush administration got empty promises in return for these terrible concessions, while the Obama administration couldn’t even get empty promises. These designations are much more important than just tools for negotiation, Mr. Speaker. They are there because these countries actively support terror or they support or facilitate countries that do support terror. They pose a very serious risk to U.S. national security and global stability. This is not something to take lightly, and removing North Korea from the SST list was a very serious error in judgment. It is far past time, Mr. Speaker, to correct this mistake, and it has to start by having an honest and transparent determination made on Pyongyang, its support for terror, and its ties to other state sponsor of terrorism states like Iran. I support Judge POE’s bill, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. In closing, this bill is an important step in confronting North Korea’s support for terrorism around the world. We should not stand idle while North 
Korea engages in terrorism, including kidnappings, target assassinations, cyber attacks, support for other terrorist organizations, and nuclear proliferation. I again call upon my colleagues to join me in passing this bill, H.R. 479, the North Korea State Sponsor of Terrorism Designation Act of 2017. I note that this bill passed our full committee without a single opponent. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I again want to thank Judge POEfor his determination to have North Korea labeled as a terrorist state. As Judge POEnotes, that is just the way it is. With the passage of this bill today, we are going to take another step, I think, toward pushing back on that regime’s destructive ambitions. I think also it is worth noting that we have a recently published U.N. panel of experts on North Korea. They put out this report that says that North Korea continues to illicitly ship dualuse items to both Syria and Iran. Now, those are two terrorist regimes. So I hope that the new administration will move quickly to relist North Korea and continue to seek ways to increase pressure on the regime through the sanctions bill that we passed out of here today and other measures. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important measure, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 479, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed.

RECOGNIZING WORLD AUTISM AWARENESS DAY (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the world celebrated Autism Awareness Day. Each year, Autism Speaks asks people across the Nation and around the globe to ‘‘Light It Up Blue’’ in an effort to increase understanding and acceptance. Last night, right here in our Nation’s Capital, the White House joined hundreds of iconic landmarks as it illuminated the exterior blue. Individuals wore blue clothing or turned their online profile photos blue. Autism spectrum disorders affect an estimated 1 out of every 68 children in the United States. These families face enormous challenges in assisting their loved ones over the course of their lifetimes. Each year, an estimated 50,000 youth will turn 18 in the United States, and many face a services cliff when schoolbased programs end. Men and women living on the autism spectrum have made incredible contributions to our society. We must continue to research the causes of autism and work to strengthen opportunities for individuals with autism to live full lives. Together, we can increase understanding and acceptance as we celebrate and support so many Americans who live with autism. f 
GORSUCH NOMINATION (Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, Judge Neil Gorsuch’s lifelong appointment to the Supreme Court would have serious consequences for all Americans, but especially the health and wellbeing of AfricanAmerican women. In 2013, by ruling that corporations have the right to deny access to contraceptives on employersponsored health insurance plans, Judge Gorsuch proved that he believes the reproductive decisions of women nationwide can and should impact their livelihood. This is problematic and troubling. For Black women and so many women across the world, birth control is a matter of health and life. We rely on contraception to treat endometriosis, manage uterine fibroids, unplanned pregnancies, and quell PMS symptoms. In 2013, Judge Neil Gorsuch made the decision that his overarching commitment to religious freedom as a constitutional and statutory right is more important than lifesaving reproductive care. In 2013, he proved he should not be confirmed to the United States Supreme Court. For this reason and a host of others, I implore my colleagues in the Senate to take all available steps to oppose Judge Gorsuch’s nomination. 
RECOGNIZING THE CITY OF WEST MIAMI ON ITS 70TH ANNIVERSARY (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to pay tribute to the city of West Miami in recognition of its 70th anniversary. What began as a small town of 700 residents has flourished into a haven for nearly 7,000 south Floridians, including my constituents, Senator MARCO RUBIO and MiamiDade County commissioners and former West Miami Mayor Rebeca Sosa, who are proud to call West Miami home. While the city itself is less than 1 square mile, the tremendous growth that has graced West Miami in the past 70 years has led to the creation of some of the finest public parks and summer camps in our State. To celebrate its founding, local officials, businesses, residents, and their families will gather together on Saturday, April 8, at Cooper Park, in celebration of this incredible milestone. I am honored to represent the city of West Miami, and I thank all who have dedicated countless hours to making this corner of south Florida special for all of us to enjoy. f 
HONORING EQUAL PAY DAY (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in honor of Equal Pay Day, which is tomorrow. Women in our country earn, on average, 78 cents for every dollar that a man makes. For women of color, that gap is larger. Even in my own district, the Eighth Congressional District of Illinois, where the overall disparity is smaller, women still only earn 83 cents on the dollar. The pay gap is not simply a women’s issue, but a challenge for all Americans. Gender wage disparities are a fundamental obstacle to millions of families trying to make ends meet. At a time when nearly twothirds of mothers are primary, sole, or cobreadwinners for their families, the pay gap makes it that much harder to pay for groceries, housing, child care, and all the other necessities of daily life. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the Paycheck Fairness Act and hope all my colleagues will join me in supporting this bill to address pay discrimination. 
PROTESTING THE ARREST OF REVEREND CAO SAN QIANG (Mr. CONAWAY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to shed light on the religious persecution of Christians by the Chinese Government. On March 5 of this year, Reverend Cao San Qiang, also known as ‘‘Pastor John,’’ was arrested and is still behind bars in the Yunnan province of southwest China. I believe that his arrest and detention was for inflated charges leveled against him simply because he is a Christian. Pastor John has been a permanent resident of the United States since 1990, where he attended seminary and became a pastor in Greensboro, North Carolina. He is married, with two children, and is kind and humble. Even though he was living a comfortable life in the United States, he kept his Chinese citizenship so he could continue to 
travel there and spread the good word of Jesus Christ. He has been ministering to the impoverished people of Myanmar and the Yunnan province of China for over a decade. In these last 3 years, he helped build and staff 16 schools in northern Myanmar. For years, Pastor John regularly crossed the border on his small motorcycle loaded with food and medicine, without incident. For some reason, this time, he was arrested and charged as a smuggler. Since his arrest, Chinese officials have raided and threatened a number of Christian churches in several provinces. I urge the State Department to seek Pastor John’s immediate release from Chinese custody and to stop further raids before other innocent individuals become casualties of aggressive religious persecution. 
CONGRATULATING FAIRMONT HEIGHTS HORNETS (Mr. BROWN of Maryland asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the Fairmont Heights Hornets for winning their first State basketball championship in 36 years. After trailing by as much as 9 points, the Hornets, under the leadership of Coach Chuck Henry, won the 1A boys State title by a score of 65–52. The team of young scholars was resilient, played hard, and never panicked. Credit is due to Coach Henry, who has taken his team to the State championship after only 2 years on the job. He is a role model, had high expectations for his students, and constantly pushed them to play better on the court and achieve more in the classroom. Throughout the season, Coach Henry never lost faith in his young team. Mr. Speaker, the students on the winning Fairmont Heights team may not go on to play in the NCAA or the NBA, but the memories of this moment, the bonds they have built, and the lessons they have developed will stay with them for a lifetime. Fairmont Heights High School has a proud legacy. When it opened its doors in 1950, it was only one of two high schools in the State of Maryland for African Americans. Now, nearly 70 years later, the school has made history again. This team has made Prince George’s County and the entire Fourth Congressional District very proud. Go, Hornets. 
PROTECTING OUR BORDER (Mr. ROTHFUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, the past several days, I had my firstever tour of our southwest border. During my visit, I met with Border Patrol agents in New Mexico and Texas, as well as ranchers and business leaders on the border. Border security was a significant issue in the last election, as Americans are concerned about the flow of illegal narcotics and aliens across the border. Although gaps in security remain, I saw an impressive array of assets, including drones and manned aircraft, walls, cameras, and other materiel. More impressive, however, are the men and women who work for Customs and Border Protection, who, at no small risk to themselves, work to keep America secure. They are very encouraged lately as they see policy changes coming that will allow them to enforce our laws. Mr. Speaker, these individuals are literally on the front line defending our Nation and communities, and I thank them for their service. I understand that there are job opportunities with Border Patrol. For those seeking a public service career doing something bigger than themselves, that is something to consider. f 
EQUAL PAY DAY (Mrs. BEATTY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, over 50 years ago, President John F. Kennedy signed into law the Equal Pay Act, landmark legislation which requires that men and women in the same workplace be given equal pay for equal work. Unfortunately, equal pay for equal work has not become a reality. In fact, women are paid between 79 and 80 cents for every dollar that men are paid for doing the exact same job. In fact, it takes women until tomorrow, April 4, to earn what men were paid in the previous year. For women of color, the gap is even wider. In 2015, AfricanAmerican women made 65 cents for every dollar earned by their White male counterparts. For Hispanic women, it is even worse. They earn 58 cents for every dollar earned by their White male counterparts. Women pay a huge price because of the wage gap. Today, families rely increasingly on women’s wages to make ends meet; and with less takehome pay, women have less money to cover the everyday needs of their family. Mr. Speaker, it is time for Congress to right the wrong. Let’s pass the Paycheck Fairness Act and send it to the President’s desk for signature. 
b1930 END COMMERCIAL WHALING (Mr. GAETZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. GAETZ. Mr. Speaker, our great ally Australia has long been the leading voice in the world to end commercial whaling. I rise to let them know that they are not alone and to announce the filing of bipartisan legislation to support an end to commercial whaling. Another of our valued allies, Japan, unfortunately continues this depraved practice. In fact, the Japanese whaling fleet has just returned home, having killed 333 Antarctic minke whales. Despite the global ban on commercial whaling, Japan continues the slaughter on the seas under a thinly veiled claim of research. Research into whales is important, but all available science shows that this research can be conducted with nonlethal testing and biopsies. The Japan whale hunt isn’t about research. It is about whale meat. In 2012, a Japanese minister even commented that the minke whale offers great flavor and aroma as sashimi. I think that is disgusting. The Japanese whalers shoot the world’s majestic mammals with exploding harpoons and electric lances. Death can often take hours. Commercial and fake research hunting of whales must end. I thank Australia for its leadership. I ask Japan to be honest with the world and end this barbaric practice. f 
JOBS SHOULD BE JOB ONE (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, the consensus for this Friday’s Bureau of Labor Statistics jobs report is that it will show the economy added about 178,000 new private sector jobs in March. That is a good number, though not as good as the March numbers in recent years. As The New York Times put it: ‘‘Growth in the first 3 months of the Trump administration is looking much the way it did’’ in the growth under President Obama. But because of the current administration’s inaction on vital economic issues, like infrastructure spending, right now about one in three market experts now think that a nearterm stock market correction may be in the cards. Instead of doing the things we need to do to rev up the economy, this body has been spending time trying to make it harder for women to access contraceptives, gutting our right to privacy on the internet, and trying to take health care away from millions of Americans. That is no way, Mr. Speaker, to create jobs. How about we do what the President said he wanted to do? Let’s make the investments that we need now that will stimulate the creation of good jobs— goodpaying jobs for Americans. That should be job number one for this Congress. 
HAPPY 108TH BIRTHDAY TO MARY COFFEY (Mr. OLSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, 100 years is a century. It is a really long time. 108 years of life is a blessing. A young lady I work for in the Texas 22nd Congressional District, who lives in my hometown of Sugar Land, is such a blessing. Her name is Mary Coffey, and she celebrated her 108th birthday on March 20. In a recent article in the Fort Bend Star, Mary described her keys to being blessed: Number one, trust Jesus and lead several Bible studies with your friends; number two, get plenty of exercise; number three, eat healthy; and number four is about personal hygiene, have jar after jar after jar of Pond’s cold cream available when you need it most. For 108 years, Mary has inspired all of us. Happy 108th birthday, Mary. Let’s go out; maybe go out dancing if you promise not to wear me out. 
INVESTIGATION INTO RUSSIAN CONNECTIONS IS LONG OVERDUE (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, today The Washington Post reported that the United Arab Emirates arranged a secret meeting in January between Blackwater founder and major Trump contributor Erik Prince and a Russian close to President Vladimir Putin. The meeting was an apparent effort to establish a backchannel line of communication between Moscow and Presidentelect Donald Trump, according to U.S., European, and Arab officials. Erik Prince, by the way, is the brother to Betsy DeVos, the Secretary of Education. The UAE’s incentive to broker this meeting comes from the deteriorating relationship between them and Iran. They wanted to drive a wedge between Russia, Iran, and Syria. Agreement on that deal would need a handsome reward, like the easing of U.S. sanctions on the Russian Federation for its invasion of Ukraine. Blackwater is the private security firm that became infamous for U.S. abuses in Iraq after a series of incidents, including one in 2007 in which the company’s guards were charged and criminally convicted of killing civilians. ‘‘Officials said Zayed and his brother, the UAE’s national security adviser, coordinated the Seychelles meeting with Russian Government officials with the goal of establishing an unofficial back channel between Trump and Putin.’’ The UAE at one point paid Erik Prince’s firm a reported half a billion dollars to consult on defensive security. An independent bipartisan commission to investigate Trump officials and Russian connections is long overdue. [From the Washington Post, Apr. 3, 2017] BLACKWATER FOUNDER HELD SECRET  SEYCHELLES MEETING TO ESTABLISH TRUMP  PUTIN BACKCHANNEL  (By Adam Entous, Greg Miller, Kevin Sieff and Karen DeYoung) The United Arab Emirates arranged a secret meeting in January between Blackwater founder Erik Prince and a Russian close to President Vladimir Putin as part of an apparent effort to establish a backchannel line of communication between Moscow and Presidentelect Donald Trump, according to U.S., European and Arab officials. The meeting took place around Jan. 11— nine days before Trump’s inauguration—in the Seychelles islands in the Indian Ocean, officials said. Though the full agenda remains unclear, the UAE agreed to broker the meeting in part to explore whether Russia could be persuaded to curtail its relationship with Iran, including in Syria, a Trump administration objective that would likely require major concessions to Moscow on U.S. sanctions. Though Prince had no formal role with the Trump campaign or transition team, he presented himself as an unofficial envoy for Trump to highranking Emiratis involved in setting up his meeting with the Putin confidant, according to the officials, who did not identify the Russian. Prince was an avid supporter of Trump who gave $250,000 last year to support the GOP nominee’s campaign, records show. He has ties to people in Trump’s circle, including Stephen K. Bannon, now serving as the president’s chief strategist and senior counselor. Prince’s sister Betsy DeVos serves as education secretary in the Trump administration. And Prince was seen in the Trump transition offices in New York in December. U.S. officials said the FBI has been scrutinizing the Seychelles meeting as part of a broader probe of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election and alleged contacts between associates of Putin and Trump. The FBI declined to comment. The Seychelles encounter, which one official said spanned two days, adds to an expanding web of connections between Russia and Americans with ties to Trump—contacts that the White House has been reluctant to acknowledge or explain until they have been exposed by news organizations. ‘‘We are not aware of any meetings and Erik Prince had no role in the transition,’’ said Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary. ‘‘Erik had no role on the transition team. This is a complete fabrication,’’ said a spokesman for Prince in a statement. ‘‘The meeting had nothing to do with President Trump. Why is the socalled underresourced intelligence community messing around with surveillance of American citizens when they should be hunting terrorists?’’ Prince is best known as the founder of Blackwater, a security firm that became a symbol of U.S. abuses in Iraq after a series of incidents including one in 2007 in which the company’s guards were accused—and later criminally convicted—of killing civilians in a crowded Iraqi square. Prince sold the firm, which was subsequently rebranded, but has continued building a private paramilitary empire with contracts across the Middle East and Asia. Prince would probably have been seen as too controversial to serve in any official capacity in the Trump transition or administration. But his ties to Trump advisers, experience with clandestine work and relationship with the royal leaders of the Emirates— where he moved in 2010 amid mounting legal problems for his American business—would have positioned him as an ideal gobetween. The Seychelles meeting came after private discussions in New York involving high ranking representatives of Trump, Moscow and the Emirates. The White House has acknowledged that Michael T. Flynn, Trump’s original national security adviser, and Trump adviser and son inlaw Jared Kushner met with the Russian ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak, in late November or early December in New York. Flynn and Kushner were joined by Bannon for a separate meeting with the crown prince of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed al Nahyan, who made an undisclosed visit to New York later in December, according to the U.S., European and Arab officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. In an unusual breach of protocol, the UAE did not notify the Obama administration in advance of the visit, though officials found out because Zayed’s name appeared on a flight manifest. Officials said Zayed and his brother, the UAE’s national security adviser, coordinated the Seychelles meeting with Russian government officials with the goal of establishing an unofficial back channel between Trump and Putin. Officials said Zayed wanted to be helpful to both leaders who had talked about working more closely together, a policy objective long advocated by the crown prince. The UAE, which sees Iran as one of its main enemies, also shared the Trump team’s interest in finding ways to drive a wedge between Moscow and Tehran. Zayed met twice with Putin in 2016, according to Western officials, and urged the Russian leader to work more closely with the Emirates and Saudi Arabia—an effort to isolate Iran. At the time of the Seychelles meeting and for weeks afterward, the UAE believed that Prince had the blessing of the new administration to act as its unofficial representative. The Russian participant was a person whom Zayed knew was close to Putin from his interactions with both men, the officials said. When the Seychelles meeting took place, official contacts between members of the incoming Trump administration and the Russian government were under intense scrutiny, both from federal investigators and the press. Less than a week before the Seychelles meeting, U.S. intelligence agencies released a report accusing Russia of intervening clandestinely during the 2016 election to help Trump win the White House. The FBI was already investigating communications between Flynn and Kislyak. The Washington Post’s David Ignatius first disclosed those communications on Jan. 12, around the time of the Seychelles meeting. Flynn was subsequently fired by Trump for misleading Vice President Pence and others about his discussions with Kislyak. Yousef Al Otaiba, the UAE’s ambassador in Washington, declined to comment. Government officials in the Seychelles said they were not aware of any meetings between Trump and Putin associates in the country around Jan. 11. But they said luxury resorts on the island are ideal for clandestine gatherings like the one described by the U.S., European and Arab officials. ‘‘I wouldn’t be surprised at all,’’ said Barry Faure, the Seychelles secretary of state for foreign affairs. ‘‘The Seychelles is the kind of place where you can have a good time away from the eyes of the media. That’s even 
printed in our tourism marketing. But I guess this time you smelled something.’’ Trump has dismissed the investigations of Russia’s role in the election as ‘‘fake news’’ and a ‘‘witch hunt.’’ The level of discretion surrounding the Seychelles meeting seems extraordinary given the frequency with which senior Trump advisers, including Flynn and Kushner, had interacted with Russian officials in the United States, including at the highprofile Trump Tower in New York. Steven Simon, a National Security Council senior director for the Middle East and North Africa in the Obama White House, said: ‘‘The idea of using business cutouts, or individuals perceived to be close political leaders, as a tool of diplomacy is as old as the hills. These unofficial channels are desirable precisely because they are deniable; ideas can be tested without the risk of failure.’’ Current and former U.S. officials said that while Prince refrained from playing a direct role in the Trump transition, his name surfaced so frequently in internal discussions that he seemed to function as an outside adviser whose opinoins were valued on a range of issues, including plans for overhauling the U.S. intelligence community. He appears to have particularly close ties to Bannon, appearing multiple times as a guest on Bannon’s satellite radio program over the past year as well as in articles on the Breitbart Web site that Bannon ran before joining the Trump campaign. In a July interview with Bannon, Prince said those seeking forceful U.S. leadership should ‘‘wait till January and hope Mr. Trump is elected.’’ And he lashed out at President Barack Obama, saying that because of his policies ‘‘the terrorists, the fascists, are winning.’’ Days before the November election, Prince appeared on Bannon’s program again, saying that he had ‘‘wellplaced sources’’ in the New York City Police Department telling him they were preparing to make arrests in the investigation of former congressman Anthony Weiner (D–N.Y.) over allegations he exchanged sexually explicit texts with a minor. Flynn tweeted a link to the Breitbart report on the claim. No arrests occurred. Prince went on to make a series of unfounded assertions that damaging material recovered from Weiner’s computers would implicate Hillary Clinton and her close adviser, Huma Abedin, who was married to Weiner. He also called Abedin an ‘‘agent of influence very sympathetic to the Muslim Brotherhood.’’ Prince and his family were major GOP donors in 2016. After the Republican convention, he contributed $250,000 to Trump’s campaign, the national party and a proTrump super PAC led by GOP megadonor Rebekah Mercer. The Center for Responsive Politics reported that the family gave more than $2.7 million to GOP candidates and super PACs, including about $2.7 million from his sister, DeVos, and her husband. Prince’s father, Edgar Prince, built his fortune through an autoparts company. Betsy married Richard DeVos Jr., heir to the Amway fortune. Erik Prince has had lucrative contracts with the UAE government, which at one point paid his firm a reported $529 million to help bring in foreign fighters to help assemble an internal paramilitary force capable of carrying out secret operations and protecting Emirati installations from terrorist attacks. The Trump administration and the UAE appear to share a similar preoccupation with Iran. Current and former officials said that Trump advisers were focused throughout the transition period on exploring ways to get Moscow to break ranks with Tehran. ‘‘Separating Russia from Iran was a common theme,’’ said a former intelligence official in the Obama administration who met with Trump transition officials. ‘‘It didn’t seem very well thought out. It seemed a little premature. They clearly had a very specific policy position, which I found odd given that they hadn’t even taken the reins and explored with experts in the U.S. government the pros and cons of that approach.’’ Michael McFaul, former U.S. ambassador to Russia, said he also had discussions with people close to the Trump administration about the prospects of drawing Russia away from Iran. ‘‘When I would hear this, I would think, ‘Yeah that’s great for you guys, but why would Putin ever do that?’’’ McFaul said. ‘‘There is no interest in Russia ever doing that. They have a long relationship with Iran. They’re allied with Iran in fighting in Syria. They sell weapons to Iran. Iran is an important strategic partner for Russia in the Middle East.’’ Following the New York meeting between the Emiratis and Trump aides, Zayed was approached by Prince, who said he was authorized to act as an unofficial surrogate for the presidentelect, according to the officials. He wanted Zayed to set up a meeting with a Putin associate. Zayed agreed and proposed the Seychelles as the meeting place because of the privacy it would afford both sides. ‘‘He wanted to be helpful,’’ one official said of Zayed. Wealthy Russians and Emirati royalty have a particularly large footprint on the islands. Signs advertising deepsea fishing trips are posted in Cyrillic. Russian billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov owns North Island, where Prince William and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, went on their honeymoon in 2011. Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed alNahyan, president of the UAE, built a hilltop palace for himself with views across the chain of islands. The Emiratis have given hundreds of millions of dollars to the Seychelles in recent years for causes including public health and affordable housing. But when the Emirati royal family visits, they are rarely seen. ‘‘The jeep comes to their private jet on the tarmac and they disappear,’’ said one Seychellois official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he did not want to be seen as criticizing the Emiratis. Zayed, the crown prince, owns a share of the Seychelles Four Seasons, a collection of private villas scattered on a lush hillside on the main island’s southern shore, overlooking the Indian Ocean, according to officials in the Seychelles. The hotel is tucked away on a private beach, far from the nearest public road. Current and former U.S. officials who have worked closely with Zayed, who is often referred to as MBZ, say it would be out of character for him to arrange the Jan. 11 meeting without getting a green light in advance from top aides to Trump and Putin, if not the leaders themselves. ‘‘MBZ is very cautious,’’ said an American businessman who knows Zayed. ‘‘There had to be a nod.’’ The Seychelles meeting was deemed productive by the UAE and Russia but the idea of arranging additional meetings between Prince and Putin’s associates was dropped, officials said. Even unofficial contacts between Trump and Putin associates had become too politically risky, officials said. Sieff reported from the Seychelles. Julie Tate, Devlin Barrett, Matea Gold, Tom Hamburger and Rosalind S. Helderman contributed to this report. HONORING CHIEF CLINT GREENWOOD (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, early this morning, Precinct 3 Assistant Chief Clint Greenwood put on his uniform, secured his badge over his heart, and he headed off to work. As he arrived at the courthouse at 7 a.m., shots suddenly rang out. After the smoke cleared, Chief Greenwood was shot in the neck. His fellow officers rushed to his aid, and he was airlifted to a nearby Houston hospital, but it was too late. Texas lost another one of its finest men in blue. The suspect is still at large, but not for long. As the investigation develops, it is still unclear if Deputy Chief Greenwood was specifically targeted or if he was ambushed because he wore the uniform. Law enforcement will do everything in their power to find and apprehend the murderous outlaw. Chief Greenwood dedicated 30 years of his life to the law. I knew Clint when I worked as a judge in Houston, Texas. He was a prosecutor. He was a defense lawyer. He worked for the sheriff’s department, and now more recently as a member of the constable’s office. He was of strong character and a proud Texas lawman. Texas prays for Chief Greenwood’s family and the Harris County, Texas, constable’s office. Our men and women who wear the badge are the best we have. They protect and serve our communities. Chief Greenwood’s life may be gone, but his memory serves as a reminder of all those who give their lives for the thin blue line. Back the blue, Mr. Speaker. Back the blue. And that is just the way it is. 
ELECTRIC UTILITY TRANSMISSION LINES IN NATIONAL FORESTS (Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, tonight I am pleased to announce the Electric Reliability and Forest Protection Act of 2017, cosponsored by my colleague Representative SCHRADER of Washington. Thousands of miles of electric utility transmission lines run through our national forests, key infrastructure that literally keeps the lights on across the West. Unfortunately, existing Forest Service rules hinder effective removal of hazardous trees and safe management of transmission rightsofway. In too many cases, the inability to address hazards in a timely fashion results in blackouts, damaged infrastructure, and even forest fires, something we have too much of in the West, as you know. This all could be prevented if electric utilities were allowed to remove the dangers in a timely fashion. This bill will reform that broken system by streamlining the process for 
utilities to receive Forest Service approval for longterm transmission maintenance plans, allowing them to take immediate action to remove hazardous trees as soon as they are identified, before they cause a fire. This is a widely supported rule by rural communities, rural electric cooperatives, and many others. It is a good bipartisan effort. Let’s get it done. 
THE SMITH FAMILY ACHIEVED THE AMERICAN DREAM THROUGH HARD WORK The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. BERGMAN ). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, last month I had the privilege of meeting Lisa and Chad Smith and their charming son Jamil during a visit to Newland, North Carolina, in the Fifth District. The Smiths are the proprietors of Forage Soaps, which began in 2014 with a $50 purchase of supplies and a trip to the Avery County Farmers Market to sell their first batch of wildcrafted soaps made in their kitchen. Wild crafted refers to plants collected from their natural or indigenous habitat. The Smiths handpicked these botanicals fresh from the trail with minimal environmental impact to ensure longterm sustainability. Well, that first batch turned into a second batch and a third batch, and so on. As they continued to make soap, they bought better equipment and invested in larger orders of supplies. Word spread about their soap, and before they knew it, the Smiths were receiving invitations to attend craft and artisan shows. They were invited to put their soap in several local galleries, and it wasn’t long before they were filling their first wholesale order. Today their business includes a retail location that also functions as their studio as well as several small satellite locations and an online store. Chad works for Mountain Electric Cooperative full time, and Lisa has a master’s degree in organic chemistry and biology. She has been making soap for more than 20 years. The Smiths adopted Jamil when he was 18 months old. They were told he would never be able to speak and may never be able to walk. Today he does both and is attending school and thriving with their loving care. He even helps out with the business, where he loves to mix oils and wildcraft herbs. Their older children help with deliveries and during special events, while their grandchildren like to come on weekends to help stock shelves and run the cash register. It is truly a family affair. Lisa likes to say she and Chad built their business one bar of soap at a time. They didn’t take out business loans or expect to be an overnight success. Instead, they started small and grew a little bit at a time, working long, hard hours, and eventually reinvesting in their business. The Smiths are living proof that one can achieve the American Dream through hard work. It is an honor to represent them in Congress. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. GAETZ ). 
Mr. GAETZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I rise to speak on an issue important to so many Floridians, and that is the Florida Everglades. The Everglades are Florida. They are as iconic as the Blue Angels, the space shuttle, and even the orange. No one in Florida is unaffected by the fate of the Everglades. This is why I join my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in encouraging President Trump to remain focused on Everglades restoration. Congress has invested in these projects before, and the Everglades ecosystem is improving as a result. But there is debate about how to proceed. In short, the question is: Should the government buy more Everglades land? I say no. Fortytwo percent of the land in south Florida is already owned by the government. We should get the government out of the real estate business, not deeper into it. Instead of a land buy, we must finish the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. Since 2000, this plan has enjoyed bipartisan support. Taxpayer dollars go toward important environmental work. The plan respects private property rights, doesn’t harm agricultural communities who play a critical role in Florida’s economies, and advances the cause of restoration. Florida’s Everglades are a national treasure. We can’t afford to lose them. Finishing the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan will ensure that our river of grass will be around for generations to come. Mr. Speaker, I take particular pride in thanking both Congressmen ROONEYs from my State for their outstanding leadership. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
b1945 CONFIRMATION OF NEIL GORSUCH TO THE SUPREME COURT The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to come to the floor this evening to coanchor the Congressional Black Caucus hour about the present nominee to the Supreme Court, Neil Gorsuch. I am very pleased that my good friend from Texas, Representative SHEILA JACKSON LEE, a distinguished member of the Judiciary Committee, has agreed to coanchor this hour with me. Mr. Speaker, I am chair of the working group for the Congressional Black Caucus that looks at nominees for Federal courts. So, I have buried myself in the record of Neil Gorsuch and wrote the testimony that we submitted to the Senate. What I will do is speak for a few minutes generally about the nominee, and then I will go to my good friend from Texas. I am very pleased that another good friend, Mr. DONPAYNE , Jr., is here from the State of New Jersey, and we will hear from him as well. Now, just as the Congress has been polarized so has the court been polarized, if you look at the liberal and conservative blocks in that way. But, of course, since the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, there has been a 4–4 split. Justice Anthony Kennedy, who is still a Member of the Court is not always a predictable conservative, though he tends to vote with the conservatives. What has happened in the Senate is entirely predictable, at least today. In an unprecedented move, the Senate refused to hear from or even meet the nominee of President Obama. There was almost a full year, yet the Senate refused to take up that nominee. What happened today was not payback. If you listened to the testimony, you would see that there are good reasons why the Senate Democrats today decided to filibuster Judge Gorsuch. I want to begin because I am speaking for the Congressional Black Caucus with his views as they affect African Americans and, by definition, others who depend upon the antidiscrimination laws and the Constitution of the United States. There is more than enough in the record on race related matters from Judge Gorsuch’s 10th Circuit service to oppose his nomination. But let me focus for a moment on his precourt service, which seems to have predicted what he would do in the court of appeals. He was a principal deputy to the principal who had jurisdiction over the Civil Rights Division. We have to pay attention to the fact that the inspector general, during Judge Gorsuch’s time in the Justice Department, found that the Civil Rights Division, where he had some oversight, had been politicized in order to stifle civil rights enforcement. As you might imagine, the Congressional Black Caucus had to pay attention to that finding by a neutral investigator. We also are very concerned about how Gorsuch is a Justice Department Official treated a Georgia election law. As we know, election laws from the South—of course, there has been a historic decision that has made the Voting Rights Act far less effective than it was—but certainly during most of the time of the Act, Southern states had to go through the Justice Department to 
see if the laws in southern States, that had kept AfricanAmericans from voting for reasons of race, to see if newly enacted laws affecting voting rights, in fact, discriminated against African Americans and others or not. A Georgia election law was found by the Civil Rights Division to be discriminatory. Judge Gorsuch was part of the team that overturned the Civil Rights Division. That was, of course, challenged in the courts. And the ruling of the Justice Department that pre cleared the law—that said it was all right to go ahead with this law that the Civil Rights Division had found discriminated against Blacks—the court overturned that finding of the Justice Department. It used quite pregnant language. The District Court said that the Georgia election law was reminiscent of Jim Crow laws. Those words have special meaning in our history—and I speak not here about AfricanAmericans alone. But if you have found yourself in the minority on any issue—it could be a First Amendment issue, it could be a criminal justice issue—you want a court that will protect your rights, not only the rights of the majority. But this nominee has shown a hostility to litigation in the courts that have been the primary ways we have vindicated constitutional rights and the rights of minorities of every kind. In a telling oped, this nominee, Mr. Gorsuch, said: ‘‘American liberals have become addicted to the courtroom, relying on judges and lawyers rather than elected leaders and the ballot box, as the primary means of effecting their social agenda.’’ What? What else was there? The majority had enforced laws against the minority—in this case, AfricanAmericans. He conceded that Brown v. Board of Education the school desegregation decision. But he went on to say that liberals should ‘‘kick their addiction’’ to constitutional litigation. This is a man who wants to get on the Court whose most important mission is constitutional litigation. I submit to you that even the Justice who epitomized conservatism, Justice Scalia, never showed hostility coming to Court to vindicate the rights of people who felt themselves to be offended. So in that respect, I think it is clear that—and this is a very important respect—Judge Gorsuch is more conservative than Justice Scalia was on the Court. Nothing could be more concerning than a Justice who says: Look, the preferred way to vindicate your rights is the political process. Who would disagree with that? It is the failure of the political process that sends people to the court. It shows, it seems to me, little appreciation for the Bill of Rights itself. The entire Bill of Rights is about the rights of the minority. And again, the word ‘‘minority’’ means any of us could be in that minority at any given point. You could be in that minority when it comes to religious rights. You could be in that minority because of a search and seizure case. You could be in that minority because of a free speech case. And, yes, you could be in that minority because you are part of a classic minority group. That is why the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments were added to the Bill of Rights. The Framers, of course, shared Gorsuch’s preference for the political process. A Constitution is a, small D, democratic document. But they created a separation of powers government knowing full well that majoritarian democracy sometimes treads on the rights of minorities. That is why we have the Supreme Court of the United States which Mr. Gorsuch seeks a seat. Mr. Speaker, before I go on to discuss some cases, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey, (Mr. PAYNE ), my good friend from New Jersey’s 10th Congressional District. Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia’s leadership throughout the years on many of these issues. Mr. Speaker, confirmation of Judge Gorsuch to the Supreme Court would be detrimental to the interests of working Americans, particularly AfricanAmericans and other vulnerable communities. Just as President Trump’s agenda prioritizes special interests, Judge Gorsuch’s record shows that he favors powerful interests and businesses over regular people. His hostility to class action lawsuits would threaten protections for workers, especially African Americans and other minorities. What is particularly of concern to me is Gorsuch’s opinion in what is known as the ‘‘frozen trucker’’ case. Gorsuch ruled against an AfricanAmerican truck driver who, after breaking down in freezing weather, ignored his supervisor by unhitching the broken trailer from his truck and driving away in search of assistance. In freezing cold weather, the truck driver is nearly freezing to death. He has a truck that won’t work with frozen brakes. They are telling him to move—to use the truck and drive away. If he takes his truck with frozen brakes, the harm potentially to other citizens is great. An 18wheeler truck with no brakes, that doesn’t seem logical. Gorsuch believed that the employee should have followed the orders, even though the driver’s life was at risk. Gorsuch was the sole vote against the driver, who was put in the position of having to choose between freezing to death, driving an unsafe vehicle and endangering the lives of others, or unhitching his trailer and seeking help. b2000 Judge Gorsuch’s record is also troubling when it comes to issues around police accountability. Gorsuch believes in granting police qualified immunity, which protects law enforcement from being held liable for any excessive use of force. Now, this is deeply concerning given the widespread use of excessive force against African Americans by police and the increasing number of police shooting deaths of unarmed African Americans. This is particularly concerning to me. I come from Newark, New Jersey, and the police department is being overseen by a Federal monitor following a 2014 review that determined officers repeatedly violated citizens’ civil rights. Additionally, Gorsuch’s record on civil rights is deeply troubling. The National Bar Association, our Nation’s oldest and largest national association of predominantly AfricanAmerican lawyers and judges, notes that Gorsuch has shown a strong tendency to be biased in favor of powerful corporate interests and unapologetically biased against workers and victims of civil and human rights violations. The confirmation of Gorsuch would threaten the protections and the rights of African Americans. Gorsuch is in lockstep with the President, favoring the wealthy over ordinary Americans. This is why I oppose his confirmation. Even those who disagree that Gorsuch would bring a biased view to the Court should see the necessity in delaying consideration of Gorsuch, given the ongoing controversy over the TrumpRussia connection. It is inappropriate to rush forward with a lifetime appointment made by a President who is under investigation by the FBI and trapped in scandal. The Senate should delay consideration of Gorsuch until an independent commission investigates Russia’s election interference and any ties between Trump and Russia. Let me just say that Judge Gorsuch has put on a very good show in front of the Senate, seeming to be very confident and thoughtful, but never really answering a lot of the questions that were asked of him. We feel that this jurist should not sit on the highest court in the land because of the bias that he has shown against working people and regular citizens in this country. Justice is supposed to be blind, but it seems that this jurist has a bias against the American working class person, the normal Joe, the minority looking for an equal break, and to have him sit on the highest court in the land would be a grave, grave mistake. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PAYNE ) for those cogent remarks. I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PAYNE ) for his very careful scrutiny of Judge Gorsuch and for participating with us tonight. It gives me great privilege to join with the distinguished Congresswoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON ) to be able to really articulate 
what is at stake with the potential for Gorsuch to be the ninth member of the United States Supreme Court. As I do that, allow me to offer a personal note of sympathy to my hometown, to the Constable’s Office, in the shooting and death of Chief Clinton Greenwood, to his family for his tragic death, and to acknowledge the service that he has given in many, many ways as a law enforcement officer and attorney committed to the implementation of the law. My sympathy goes to his family and to his colleagues. I also want to acknowledge the tragedy in Russia and the loss of life, which indicates how close all of us are around the world and that we should be committed to the fight against terrorism, wherever it may be. If I might, I applaud the Democratic Senators, in this instance, in the other body to express my appreciation for taking a fight that many would be critical of. Now, that fight I don’t put in the context of politics or partisanship. I have not heard one Senator who is opposing Judge Gorsuch and is not supporting or participating in the filibuster mention one word about the political elections or the process that occurred in 2016. I have heard truly deliberative analysis that I think is important to recount, Congresswoman NORTON . I am delighted with the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia and the distinguished leadership that the gentlewoman gives us as the chair of the Judicial Nominating Committee for the Congressional Black Caucus, a position that the gentlewoman has served ably for years and has resulted in some outstanding jurists because of her leadership that the Congressional Black Caucus has been able to advocate for. During the tenure of President Barack Obama, as the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia worked very closely on his nominees, distinguished jurists have been placed on the Federal bench and in the Supreme Court to no one’s complaint. In addition, President Obama followed protocol and consulted with Members of the other party in the United States Senate. Unfortunately, we are now ending this process with the nomination of Judge Gorsuch by the President of the United States, this President who announced it as a campaign trick by issuing a list of individuals that he had not vetted but had been given by those who were bartering: This is a list, and you will have our support in the election. My fear is that that is not the context in which distinguished jurists should be appointed to the Supreme Court. There is no doubt that this was bait for voters to be able to fall in the column of this particular individual who now holds the office. So no criticism should go to my colleagues in the other body who realize that this is about lifeordeath matters. This is about the millions of Americans who will suffer at the hands of Judge Gorsuch on the United States Supreme Court. I am more convinced now. I am grateful for their debate because, as they have debated in a very detailed, passionate manner, I hope that they have been able to provide light and education to Americans who may be watching and trying to understand the ‘‘no’’ vote and the ‘‘yes’’ vote, the filibuster, that it is not in any way anyone’s political desire to not have the Supreme Court working on behalf of the American people, adhering to the high calling and ultimate judgment of the Supreme Court, which is to recognize settled law and to be able to respect the rights of all Americans and not skew this Court to the point that some Americans will be left out in the hall of justice. Why should my friends in the other body who have taken this courageous stand yield to false criticism and pontificating and grandstanding about they have never seen this before, the other persons who have voted ‘‘yes’’ have never seen this before, this is outrageous, a qualified individual. I have no angst against the person. He has ascended to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. He has colleagues who respect him. He showed himself respectful before the Senate Judiciary Committee; in fact, some called him charming and engaging. Again, I make mention of the fact that this is about life and death. So let me put in the context a very important statement made by Amanda Bronstad in the National Law Journal article, February 28, 2017: ‘‘Neil Gorsuch ‘Piercingly Textual’ and Often ProDefense on Class Actions and Arbitration.’’ ‘‘According to a careful review of Gorsuch’s decisions, his textualist approach, more than ideology, is the common theme of his opinions on class actions, arbitration, and mass torts. And yet, though some of his decisions have favored plaintiffs, Gorsuch’s careful judicial reasoning and parsing of statutory language has more often led him to side with the defense,’’ leaving most others out in the cold. In addition, Judge Gorsuch has a disdain for those who seek to redress their civil rights and other remedies of law. In a 2015 article published in the conservative National Review, these are his words: ‘‘American liberals have been addicted to the courtroom, relying on judges and lawyers rather than elected leaders and the ballot box, as the primary means of effecting their social agenda on everything from gay marriage to assisted suicide to the use of vouchers for private school education. ‘‘This overweening addiction to the courtroom as the place to debate social policy is bad for the country and bad for the judiciary.’’ Well, Judge Gorsuch, let me tell you a thing or two. I grew up in a segregated America. At my birth, African Americans were treated unequally in terms of education as well as accommodations, as well as the right to vote. We couldn’t even march in some places in the Deep South without being shot at, losing our lives, being hosed at, and dogs making sure that our young kids were intimidated and even bitten. Maybe he fails to remember the four little girls in the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, called the bombing in Birmingham, in 1963. Maybe he fails to remember the tragedy of the Edmond Pettus Bridge or Jimmie Lee Jackson shot dead in the streets of Selma. Or maybe he doesn’t understand Brown v. Board of Education, Roe v. Wade, Miranda v. Arizona, Gideon v. Wainwright, New York Times v. Sullivan, Obergefell v. Hodges, and Shelby County v. Holder. These cases are dealing with issues such as the right to vote, the right to an equal education, the Fourth Amendment interpretation of the right to be protected from unreasonable search and seizure, and the First Amendment right to freedom of the press. b2015 Maybe he doesn’t understand that these cases have brought to America the image and the recognition of justice. It doesn’t seem that he has that interpretation. So I just want to read another interpretation of his record by the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. ‘‘Judge Gorsuch’s decadelong record on the Federal bench, as well as his writings, speeches, and activities throughout his career, demonstrate he is a judge with an agenda.’’ What a frightening proposition, that he goes to the Supreme Court, having given the impression that he is just an open book, genuinely concerned. ‘‘His frequent dissents and concurrences show he is out of the main stream of legal thought and unwilling to accept the constructs of binding precedent and stare decisis when they dictate results he disfavors.’’ Stare decisis is something that we learned in law school, but that is a very appropriate and important basis of decisions. ‘‘If confirmed to the Supreme Court, which is closely divided on many critical issues, Judge Gorsuch would tip the balance in a direction that would undermine many of our core rights and legal protections. He lacks the impartiality and independence the American people expect and deserve from the Federal bench.’’ Let me make one or two other points that I think are so very important. I hope to put my entire statement into the RECORD , and we will be engaging, and I know that my colleague will have further comments, but I want to make sure that we point back to those who are criticizing a very courageous stance because they are taking the stance, my friends in the other body, in the backdrop of all these accolades and 
how genuine and charming he is. I have said that before. But he is going against the backdrop of protocol—no engagement with the Democratic Senators, no adherence to the President, when he was President elect, who pledged to the Nation that he would be the President of all Americans—because it rings hollow to tens of millions of Americans. My colleague from New Jersey mentioned the truck driver story. It was a 2–1 decision. He was dissenting. No person with common sense and knowledge of the law would reject the understanding that this individual acted not against the instructions of his employer in leaving a truck that—by the way, the cargo area of the truck—nothing was violated, no product was taken, with bad brakes, and in jeopardy of his life, if he had left the cargo portion of the truck and tried to drive away on this frozen night, after waiting 3 hours in a cabin where he was freezing to death, he would have died. Yet Judge Gorsuch did not think that was important enough to rule in favor of this AfricanAmerican who had a 2– 1 decision. He thought that the employer could fire him; and there was no factual basis for that, that he did something when it was a balmy day, and he just went off recklessly because he didn’t want to be bothered or he was tired or he was hungry. That was not the case. That is cruel, Judge Gorsuch. Your conservative ideology and professed judicial philosophy of original intent has harmed many. He is not an unbiased judge. At best, he is a younger, more charming version of Judge Robert Bork, who was rejected 58–42 by the Senate in 1987. So he has a history of ruling against people who have used the legal system to hold government officials accountable. The gentleman who was fired was fired, I think, 7 years ago, and has not been able to find a job yet. By the way, the truck’s heater didn’t work. His words were—Judge Gorsuch dissented and said the employee should have followed orders, even at the risk of serious injury. In NLRB v. Community Health Services, Judge Gorsuch again dissented from a majority opinion that found in favor of employees, where a hospital was required to award back pay to 13 employees whose hours had been reduced, in violation of the National Labor Relations Act. As the ranking member on the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security and Investigations, we are trying to find the right kind of balance between police and community. But Judge Gorsuch has ruled that there is no reason to give police any punishment, such as the case when an individual used a stun gun and the victim died. Judge Gorsuch’s judicial record on police accountability minimized the Fourth Amendment protections against warrantless search and seizure. I will continue my discussions of Judge Gorsuch. I will come back again and finish my comments on issues dealing with, again, civil rights and the rights of women. I am delighted to cohost and comanage this hour dealing with the nomination of Judge Gorsuch. Ms. NORTON. I thank my friend for her comments. Mr. Speaker, I was the chair, before I came to Congress, in another life, of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, dealing with job discrimination in our country. I was interested, in my own research on Judge Gorsuch to find that he has written more opinions in discrimination cases than other cases. Now, the Rocky Mountain States of the Tenth Circuit do not have large numbers of African Americans, but the way in which the Supreme Court has interpreted antidiscrimination laws doesn’t, in fact, basically differ from one group. The EEOC also has jurisdiction over disability discrimination. For example, the Court has always indicated that antidiscrimination laws should be read broadly in order to capture discrimination. Whether we are talking about the antidiscrimination laws as they affect women or racial or ethnic minorities or religious minorities, the Supreme Court simply will not read these laws narrowly. But that is not how Judge Gorsuch has operated on the Tenth Circuit. He has given a cramped interpretation of the antidiscrimination laws, and yet it is interesting to note that, when there is a claim of discrimination based on religion, he gives a very broad interpretation. He is perhaps best known for his opinion in the socalled Hobby Lobby case. This is the case in which he found that a closely held corporation was within its rights when it refused to adopt the Affordable Health Care Act’s mandate that women and men be granted contraceptive protection as a part of health insurance. Judge Gorsuch found that this was a violation of the rights of the closely held corporation, the first time there has been such a holding. It is very interesting also to note that right after that, there was a case called Little Sisters of the Poor. Now, the Little Sisters of the Poor, unlike the closely held corporation, is, in fact, a religious organization, and they too said they do not wish to have contraception be a part of any of the institutions that they govern. Remember, we had a religious organization there, not a closely held corporation. The Court found that, to accommodate both women and the religious scruples of the Little Sisters, the Little Sisters had only to acknowledge that they did not desire to enforce the contraceptive mandate, and then it would be taken away from them and would be done by a third party, by the government. That was allowed as a way to accommodate the Little Sisters. Judge Gorsuch opposed that and wrote an opposing opinion. So to see this difference in the way he treats discrimination, reading antidiscrimination statutes affecting minorities of every kind in a narrow fashion; when he finds religious discrimination by statute, he reads those statutes very broadly. His technical rulings are of statutes that the Supreme Court has broadly interpreted, would have made these statutes worthless. You simply cannot enforce antidiscrimination statutes by treating them as though they were technical statutes that, for example, govern financial dealings. And yet this nominee has brought that kind of interpretation of antidiscrimination statutes. I was shocked at his holding in Hwang v. Kansas State University, which illustrates what I am saying. There, a professor brought a case because her university had refused to follow the guidance of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. She was entitled to a 6month leave to accommodate her condition. This is a statute involving disability rights. She took that 6month leave and asked to have it extended until a day certain, not indefinitely, to recover further from cancer and a bone marrow transplant. Now, the EEOC guidance said that an additional leave beyond 6 months was possible as an accommodation to an employee unless there was an undue hardship. There was no undue hardship. But this nominee, Judge Gorsuch, found that the ‘‘6 months was more than enough to comply with the law in nearly every case’’—yes, in nearly every case—but the EEOC guidance said that there obviously could be extensions. I can think of no case that would call for more of an extension than a professor who said: I will come back on a date certain, but I have a cancer diagnosis, and I have had a bone marrow transplant. I hope that that case would give some pause to anyone who hears about it. The nominee has been quite consistent in how he has ruled in the Tenth Circuit, which gives every reason to believe that he is going to carry that consistency to the Supreme Court. I was very interested to see how he ruled on a Planned Parenthood case where the Governor of Utah had seen these notorious false videos that purported to show the sale of fetal tissue. b2030 Now, those videos—every court that has considered those videos have found that they had nothing to do with Planned Parenthood and what it actually did. So this matter has been litigated in a number of circuits. It was litigated in the 10th Circuit in a case called Planned Parenthood Association of Utah v. Herbert; and the 10th Circuit found, as the other circuits have, that these videos were not, in fact, associated with Planned Parenthood—the false videos that surfaced. 
Interestingly, the court, on rehearing, which Judge Gorsuch had sought, characterized his dissenting opinion as ‘‘mischaracterization of this litigation and the panel opinion at several turns.’’ Here again, we see Judge Gorsuch going out of his way to rule in a fashion that he sees as necessary to sustain his broad views of religious claims. I am trying to give you an overview of Judge Gorsuch’s opinions in a number of different areas, and I am mystified by how he would reach the conclusions he has reached in discrimination cases. Here is one that is very revealing: A.F. ex rel Christine B. v. Espanola Public Schools, where a student was found by Judge Gorsuch not to be able to sue for violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act because she had earlier settled a suit for violations of another act, the socalled IDEA Act. Well, she has a right under both laws. She would have obviously raised perhaps different claims, but his view was that she should not be in court. This closing of the courts must be taken seriously in evaluating Judge Gorsuch. Because if you can’t get into court in the first place, particularly if you are a member of a minority group, or for the moment find yourself in the minority on a particular issue, then you are out of court before you are in court. You have lost before you cross the threshold. I can’t imagine why Judge Gorsuch didn’t allow a student to continue when she had, in frustration, left her school because of violations of her disability rights. That frustration, as far as he was concerned, closed the courthouse door to her. Why would we want to interpret discrimination laws in a fashion that you can’t get into court to make your case? A particularly cruel case, Compass Environmental v. OSHRC, a case where Gorsuch wrote the dissent, involved a worker who was electrocuted and died as a result. The corporation had trained its workers. This worker happened to be hired after the training had taken place; therefore, was not aware of all of the safeguards. The Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission found that the electrocution of the worker could have been avoided if the corporation, Compass Environmental, had provided the necessary training. So it cited Compass and it fined Compass. Gorsuch dissented. He found that the company had not violated the law. The company hadn’t provided the requisite training. The man was electrocuted, and it is very instructive what Judge Gorsuch said: 
‘‘Administrative agencies enjoy remarkable powers in our legal order. Their interpretations of ambiguous statutes control even when everyone thinks Congress really meant something else.’’ 
He didn’t like the administrative ruling, so he dissented and would have ruled against the family of a man who was electrocuted. That is not a man I want on the Supreme Court. This is not a man who knows how to interpret the discrimination statutes which have always been interpreted broadly by the Federal courts. This is not a man who should sit on the Supreme Court of the United States. Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON  LEE), my good friend who is coanchoring this hour with me, who would like to say a few words. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for again articulating the really egregious opinions, judicial approach, and temperament of Judge Gorsuch. I will conclude my remarks with a focus on the issues of women’s rights as well as some cases dealing with immigration. Immigration, Mr. Speaker, is a crucial issue that we are addressing now. In fact, I will cite an incident that happened in our district—or in my district or in my community just a few days ago, which means, as we proceed, there may be a number of cases coming to the Federal courts and the district court because I think, as my colleague has indicated—both of us have indicated—that the courts are for petitioning. That is what the courts are for. It seems that Judge Gorsuch wants to slam the door. And this is a—how should I say it—a metaphor. It is not a precise comment by the judge, but annoyed that people have to come and use the courts. As he has indicated, minorities and women and others want to use the court for their social agenda. And for fear of being redundant, I feel moved—my passion is so strong because, Judge Gorsuch: Have you walked at any moment in your life in my shoes as a woman and as a minority? Have you walked in the shoes of the little children who made the plaintiffs of Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka? Were you in any way discriminated against with respect to education? Have you ever been a victim of stop and frisk? Have you ever been incarcerated for something you did not do? Have you ever been a woman who had been subjected to sexual harassment or discrimination? Do you understand the purpose of title VII? Do you understand the value of affirmative action both in policy and in law? Just a few weeks ago we got an effective and important decision on affirmative action out of this Supreme Court, in a court that is 4–4. I don’t think that is the case. And I just, again, want to take this as I cite these cases. I just want to, again, cite Amanda Bronstad, that some of his decisions may have favored one or two plaintiffs. I am not going to deny that. But Gorsuch’s careful judicial reasoning and parsing of statutory language has more than often led him to side with the defense. That is not the role of a Supreme Court Justice. It is not to side with anyone. It is to have the view on the basis of the appeal within the context of precedence and others how a decision should be rendered. So these are Judge Gorsuch’s decisions: In Strickland v. UPS, Gorsuch dissented from a ruling giving a female UPS driver a chance to prove sex discrimination, arguing that the plaintiff had not provided evidence that she was treated less favorably than her male colleagues, even though in the documents submitted in the lower court, her coworkers testified and gave written testimony detailing the level of mistreatment they witnessed her receiving while employed by UPS. In Hwang v. Kansas State University involved a professor employed by Kansas State University who was diagnosed with cancer, and after treatments, requested an extension of her disability—another woman—due to a flu outbreak on campus which could potentially compromise her health. And Judge Gorsuch talked about ‘‘showing up’’ as an essential job function, and that the Rehabilitation Act should not be used as a safety net for employees who cannot work. I think her request was an extension, not a forever. Two women, among others, that he found no reason to be supportive of. He could not find no legal precedent, nothing that would give him the ability to make a decision that was within the law and humane, even though he was in the dissent. And then in Planned Parenthood Association of Utah v. Herbert, the Governor of that State, again, he dissented against the court’s majority, impacting women’s health, to decline a full court review of the case—the court’s majority decision to decline a full court review of the case, in which Governor Herbert of Utah stripped Federal funding away from Planned Parenthood. Neither party requested a full court review; however, Judge Gorsuch decided to deviate from court practices and norms to signal his favor of Governor Herbert’s decision. Other women—he continues to show hostility toward women’s rights and his willingness to overlook institutions that discriminate against women. His record indicates that. Let me finish with this comment on immigration—and if I might, Mr. Speaker, how much time is remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. DUNN). The gentlewoman has 2 minutes remaining. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me finish quickly and let my colleague from the District of Columbia close. Let me indicate an immigration case, and he voted to affirm the district’s court granting of summary judgment which blocked a title VII national origin discrimination case from going to 
trial, despite evidence of animus, unlawful reverification and document abuse by the employer. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the House Committee on the Judiciary, Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations, and member of the Congressional Voting Rights Caucus, I rise today to express my views regarding the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to be Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court is the highest court in the land and the final arbiter of our Constitution and laws, and its rulings can impact the lives and rights of all Americans as shown in the cases of Brown v. Board of Education, Roe v. Wade; Miranda v. Arizona; Gideon v. Wainwright; New York Times v. Sullivan; Obergefell v. Hodges; and Shelby County v. Holder, to name but a few. Judge Gorsuch is a judge with an agenda, as demonstrated by his record on the federal bench, as well as his writings, speeches, and activities throughout his career. Judge Gorsuch’s frequent dissents and concurrences show he is out of the mainstream of legal thought and unwilling to accept the constructs of binding precedent and stare decisis when they dictate results he disfavors. Judge Gorsuch’s appointment to the Court would tip the balance in a direction that would undermine many of the core rights and legal protections Americans cherish. For the reasons I will discuss in detail, the Senate should reject his nomination and not consent to his confirmation as the next Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. On Election Night the PresidentElect pledged to the nation that he would be a president to all Americans. That pledge will ring hollow to tens of millions of Americans in light of his nomination of Judge Neil M. Gorsuch to be an Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. Perhaps nothing would do more to reassure the American people that the President is committed to unifying the nation than the nomination and appointment of a person to be Associate Justice who has a record of championing and protecting, rather than opposing and undermining, the precious right to vote; the constitutionally guaranteed right of privacy, criminal justice reform, and support for reform of the nation’s immigration system so that it is fair and humane. That is not to be found in the record or character of Judge Gorsuch. It should not be forgotten that the vacancy at issue was created in February 2016 by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia and should have been filled by the confirmation of the eminently qualified Judge Merrick Garland, Chief Judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. In fact, the only reason Judge Garland is not now on the Court is because Republican Senators disregarded a century of precedent and their constitutional oaths and refused to consider the nomination because it was made by President Obama. Judge Gorsuch’s conservative ideology and professed judicial philosophy of ‘‘original intent,’’ which more accurately should be called the doctrine of predetermined result, has been at the core of his prior legal decisions. He is not an unbiased judge; at best, he is a younger, more charming version of Judge Robert Bork, who was rejected 58–42 by the Senate in 1987. Unlike his predecessors, Presidents Obama, Clinton, Reagan, Eisenhower among them, the current President did not consult in advance with the bipartisan leadership of the Senate and its Judiciary Committee. Instead, the President selected Judge Gorsuch from the list of names provided him by the rightwing legal group, the Federalists Society. Judge Gorsuch’s adherence to originalism is alarming and should raise concerns for all Americans because on a narrowly divided Court, his could be the deciding vote to dismantle many of the constitutional safeguards and protections upheld by the Court that have moved the country forward and made it better. Judge Gorsuch has a history of ruling against people who have used the legal system to hold government officials accountable. He has also used the bench to rule in favor of large corporations routinely and against the rights of workers. He has been lenient on those that have used excessive force and police brutality. His record demonstrates hostility towards equal opportunity, worker’s rights, women’s access to reproductive healthcare services, and protections for persons with disabilities. For example, in TransAm Trucking, Inc. v. Administrative Review Board, the majority held that a trucking company unlawfully fired an employee in violation of federal whistleblower protections. The employee, Alphonse Maddin, was a truck driver whose brakes broke down in the middle of a freezing January night in Illinois. The truck heater didn’t work either, and he got so cold that he couldn’t feel his feet or torso, and he had trouble breathing. Nonetheless, his boss ordered him to wait in the truck until a repairperson arrived. After waiting for three hours, Mr. Maddin finally drove off in the truck and left the trailer behind, in search of assistance. His employer fired him a week later for violating company policy by abandoning his load while under dispatch. The panel majority said the firing was unlawful, but Judge Gorsuch dissented and said the employee should have followed orders even at the risk of serious injury. In NLRB v. Community Health Services, Inc., Judge Gorsuch again dissented from a majority opinion that found in favor of employees, where a hospital was required to award back pay to 13 employees whose hours had been reduced in violation of the National Labor Relations Act. Judge Gorsuch’s frequent and recurring dissents in workers’ rights cases suggest a refusal to follow binding case law when it leads to results that favor workers rather than businesses and employers. In Strickland v. UPS, Gorsuch dissented from a ruling giving a female UPS driver a chance to prove sex discrimination, arguing that the plaintiff had not provided evidence that she was treated less favorably than her male colleagues even though her coworkers testified and gave written testimony detailing the level of mistreatment they witnessed her receiving while employed by UPS. Hwang v. Kansas State University involved a professor employed by Kansas State University who was diagnosed with cancer, and after treatments requested an extension for her disability due to a flu outbreak on the campus, which could potentially compromise her health. Judge Gorsuch ruled that ‘‘showing up’’ for work is an essential job function and that the Rehabilitation Act should not be used as a safety net for employees who cannot work. In Planned Parenthood Association of Utah v. Herbert, Judge Gorsuch dissented against the court’s majority decision to decline a full court review of the case, in which, Governor Herbert of Utah stripped federal funding away from Planned Parenthood. Neither party requested a full court review, however, Judge Gorsuch desired to deviate from court practices and norms to signal his favor for Governor Herbert’s decision. This particular case amplifies Judge Gorsuch’s inability to remain impartial when deciding cases that may conflict with his personal beliefs. Throughout his tenure as a Judge, Gorsuch’s record indicates his hostility toward women’s rights and his willingness to overlook institutions that discriminate against women. Women will likely be disproportionately impacted by Judge Gorsuch’s appointment to the United States Supreme Court and any decisions related to health, labor, and reproductive justice. Judge Gorsuch’s record shows that he believes police officers always should be granted qualified immunity, allowing police officers and other government officials to avoid being held accountable for the excessive use of force. His record on police immunity aligns with President Trump’s belief in police impunity. In cases where victims of excessive force did not pose an imminent threat to police safety, Judge Gorsuch has a tendency to side with police. Judge Gorsuch’s judicial record on police accountability minimizes the Fourth Amendment protections against warrantless search and seizure. In three separate cases, Gorsuch ruled in favor of police searches of vehicles without a warrant. As an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, Judge Gorsuch would be one of the nine individuals tasked with one of the most critical systems of American democracy. Because of the decisions rendered by the Supreme Court of the United States, women have been granted reproductive rights, de jure segregation and discrimination against African Americans has been abolished and their right to vote protected, workers have been granted security from exploitative labor practices; and marriage equality is the law of the land. If confirmed to a evenly divided United States Supreme Court, it is unlikely that Judge Gorsuch would have a balanced, unbiased view of important issues. Judge Gorsuch’s extreme judicial philosophy of original intent would likely lead him to cast decisive, outofthe mainstream votes that reverse significant gains in the areas of police accountability, civil rights and liberties, women’s reproductive rights, and workers’ rights. Judge Gorsuch’s record in each of these 
areas should raise concerns for all Americans. Opposing Judge Gorsuch is not a difficult decision; for members of the communities represented by CBC members, it is a matter of survival, of life and death. An Associate Justice would be expected to be an independent jurist capable of rendering 
judicial decisions that prevent executive overreach. No senator should vote to confirm the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch as Associate Justice if he or she has the slightest doubt that he possesses the character, qualities, integrity, and commitment to justice and equality needed for this position. There is so much to say about Judge Gorsuch, so much to say about the stance that is being taken by colleagues who are not being political, who are not talking about the 2016 election, who are simply talking about the courthouse door being slammed in the face of the most vulnerable. I believe that this judge should not ascend to the United States Supreme Court. Ms. NORTON. I thank my good friend for helping us document why we believe this is not the time for this Justice to be on the Supreme Court. We recognize that it is not the House of Representatives that decides this matter, but the Congressional Black Caucus represents 17 million Americans who will be deeply affected by who sits on this Court. I appreciate that we have had this full hour to express our views. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
LEAVE OF ABSENCE By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to: Mr. BISHOP of Georgia (at the request of Ms. PELOSI ) for today on account of delayed by weather.
